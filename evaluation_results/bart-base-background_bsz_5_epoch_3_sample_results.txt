Background: Vanderbilt   71 Kentucky   64 CLAUDE FELTON:   We're joined by Vanderbilt head coach Kevin Stallings and studentathletes Jeffery Taylor and John Jenkins. We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for the studentathletes. COACH STALLINGS:   I say this a lot, or not a lot, but when I think it's appropriate, but if you didn't care who won, that was a great college basketball game. Kentucky, they set the bar. They set the bar nationally this year. They set the bar in our league almost every year. They certainly did this year. They have got a great team. So we're proud to have beaten them. Proud to have won a SEC championship. I couldn't be happier for my players because this season has had its ups and its downs and we have been the target of much criticism, and to my players' credit, they never let that get to them, they never let it create a seam in our squad or let it create any division in anything that we did. They stayed with us as coaches, they stayed with each other as teammates. This is the result of that sticking together. As far as the game today, we battled, they battled. We had a little bit of a better plan, we felt like, going in this time. The stat sheet at halftime, I don't, I haven't really seen the stat sheet since the game's been over, but they had taken 16 threes at half and that was what we wanted. We wanted them to beat us from outside. Then they made their runs, and we had responses and we made a run, and they had a response. And it kind of went back and forth a little bit. And then at the end, we have talked for a long time about wanting those last three or four minutes again because we got it to that point in the first two games and they outplayed us at the end of both games to win the game. We wanted one more shot to see if we could do it. And today we played better than them in the last few minutes. I couldn't be prouder of these guys. It's to their credit. They deserve all the credit. I'm most happy for them and for our fans that have waited a long time to see us win a SEC tournament championship. CLAUDE FELTON:   All right. We'll take your questions for the studentathletes. 
Question: Yesterday Billy Donovan was talking about how one of the more remarkable things he found about Anthony Davis was that he can block all those shots and he has such body control that he stays out of foul trouble despite that. The fact that you got him into some early foul trouble, he admitted that this isn't something he's used to dealing with. How much do you think that might have changed the game?

Gold: Well, it didn't seem like he was out for very long, so he played 34 minutes. So it's not like  I don't know if it affected his play. I mean it certainly didn't affect the amount of time that he played.

Question: You've been in this tournament before. What is the pressure like when you actually have to tee it up and you're a Canadian in this tournament? Is it different from other venues?
Model prediction: You've been in this tournament before. What is the pressure like when you actually have to tee it up and you're a Canadian in this golf tournament? Is it different from other venues?
Gold: A little bit. I think we pressure ourselves. We just really want to play well just for this tournament for the fans, being the one tournament a year in Canada. But it's nothing but support that all the fans have given us. It's more ourselves. We just want to play well for the event. But if you go to any other event, it's really the same.

Background: 
Question: Would you agree with that?
Model prediction: Would you agree with that?
Gold: Yeah, he's exactly right. I think coming to Orlando from Seattle, they didn't know what type of player they was getting, and I think I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform at my best, and it was only preseason. I wanted to play hard and show the city what type of player they was getting. The very first game I went out there and twisted my ankle and got injured. I think I was putting too much pressure on myself, and my mom told me just relax, do what you've been doing since you was in Seattle. Just play your game. You wouldn't be in this position today if you didn't do well in Seattle, so just go out there and play your game. I think I just kind of relaxed, focused a bit more and let the game come to me instead of trying to force it.

Background: 
Question: After yesterday, did you have any idea what to expect on the greens today or was it a matter of you had to get a couple holes under your belt to really know what you were dealing with?

Gold: Not really, I didn't think they would be too much different. I knew they were still going to be fast, but I honestly didn't think they were that firm yesterday they were very crusty, but it was, they still have a soft base and you can feel it when you fix a ball mark, it's just, I mean I'm sure they just, conditions of the green, I don't know if it's weather or what it is, but it's not how, I'm sure it's not how they would like it, but the greens are rolling great, but they just don't have that kind of that firmness underneath them. But it was just, I wasn't sure, you never really know at the start of the day how firm they're going to be, but you kind of get a rhythm and get a feel for it watching yourself and your playing partners, but, yeah, you just trying to get a feel for it I guess to start the day.

Background: 
Question: Let's go to 17 first. We got these in here. On this tee shot, mentally from yourself, thinking you got to step up, there's pressure from that leaderboard as well right now.

Gold: For sure. Yeah, I didn't really pay any attention to the leaderboard until, honestly, hole 18. I looked a little bit -- I actually looked up one time on 15 and then Scottie made that eagle there on 16, and I just said, hey, look, we need to make a birdie coming in.

Question: What do you consider him right now as, receiver or quarterback?
Model prediction: What do you consider him right now as, receiver or quarterback?
Gold: I consider him as both.
