Run scrapper.py to download data from web again. No need to run if you want get football player interviews since those have already been downloaded.

If you want to download interviews for players of other type of sports, change the highlighted area in scrapper.py by modifying the **folder path** and **url**. To find urls for other type of sports, go to http://www.asapsports.com/showcat.php?id=1&event=yes (the specific url for football) and select one sport category on the left.
