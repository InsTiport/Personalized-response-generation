## Web scraping

Run `scraper.py` to download data from web. No need to run if you want get football/basketball player interviews since those have already been downloaded.

If you want to download interviews for players of other type of sports, change the highlighted area in `scraper.py` by modifying `sport_type` to one of the possible sport categories.
