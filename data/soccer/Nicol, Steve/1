 Q.  Is each trip to the finals its very own story, or is there something similar about the four times you've been here and come away empty? 
 STEVE NICOL:  No, not at all.  Everyone's completely unassured.  If we were told before the game the chances we'd make in the game, I'd have been happy. 
 It's real simple for me.  You don't take your chances.  You leave your team hanging around, then it comes back and bites you, and that's exactly what happened today. 

 Q.  Steve Ralston was fairly effective for 60 minutes today, then I noticed he came off.  What happened with Steve? 
 STEVE NICOL:  He cramped up. 

 Q.  Jay, is this one particularly hard to take because it seems so well set up for you?  Everyone was healthy, the team well rested, not a long travel trip, big day to play? 
 JAY HEAPS:  Yeah, they've all been tough.  But I think this is tough just because, you know, it was an opportunity again, and we look forward to getting back here.  And I wish I could put into words how tough the game is.  We fought hard.  And the problem was we just, you know -- we didn't take our chances. 
 But at the same time, we've been a great defensive team this playoff, and we're a little disappointed that we let even a scrappy goal.  A great goal you got let in, try to figure it out.  But the scrappy goal, we felt like we defended scrappy goals all year.  Until that one went in, it was a little disheartening.
