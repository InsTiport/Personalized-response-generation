NY Red Bulls - 1, Montreal Impact - 0
Q. Coach, frustration level right now, one win in your last matches?
MAURO BIELLO: Yeah, obviously, we're frustrated.  I think it's not the difficult performances on the road.  I think on the road we've done fairly well.  I think we were in this game all the way to the end and it was exactly what we expected.  Ignacio scores that goal at the beginning of the game, it's a different game.
It's at home where we've got to step it up and where we've been having difficulties.  Now we have a quick turnaround with San Jose coming in, and it's an important game for us.
Q. Coach, what makes Red Bull Arena such a difficult place for Montreal Impact?  The only time you've ever taken a point was in the CopyCat Championship group stage match two years ago.
MAURO BIELLO: Yeah, they're a good team.  They're one of the top teams in the league.  It's a difficult place to play.  I think you got to score goals here and you've got to score goals in this league.  It's the only way.
When they were having difficulties at the beginning, they were having trouble scoring.  So this is what it is in this league.  You've got to be able to score goals and sustain, especially on the road.
Q. (No microphone)?
MAURO BIELLO: Yeah, I think, you know, Didier didn't have preseason, and coming in, the ups and downs of the season are sometimes difficult.  The second year, it's always more difficult when opposing defenders are getting ready to face him.  In the end, he's been getting chances.  He had chances at home to score goals, and it's about finding that balance.  Hopefully, it will turn for him.
