 Q.  I thought Kyle Fisher was a particular bright spot for you tonight.  Can you talk about his performance, maybe give an update on him coming out.  
MAURO BIELLO: I think Kyle has been solid.  He's a guy that keeps working game in and game out, every day in training.  I think for him this is all an experience.  You see this year how well he's done in terms of his play.  He's only growing.   
 Q.  Going through the protocol, any symptoms that you were worried about or all just standard?  
MAURO BIELLO: They went through the protocol, see how he is now.  They let him back in, so the doctors took a look at him.   
 Q.  Comments on the game in general.  
MAURO BIELLO: Yeah, I think it's a disappointing game.  We didn't play well.  We didn't play well in the back or the front.  In the first half we gave up a PK goal.  Lack of concentration, get behind.  Get up for another set piece goal, three guys are jumping for the ball, the ball is knocked down.   
You have to take your chances on the road.  You're not going to get many chances.  We weren't able to capitalize on our chances in the first half.  They're a good team, they're on a high, and they were able to hurt us.
