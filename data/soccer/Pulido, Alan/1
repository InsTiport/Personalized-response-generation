Q. You are close to starting your first round of games in Orlando. How good does it feel to get back into training with your full team? 
ALAN PULIDO: Yes, we are happy to be here, obviously adapting to a new experience and a new tournament. We obviously all have the responsibility that is required in taking care, and also following all precautions. And of course, we come to compete and to win.

Q. Do you feel that you are ready to compete? Do you feel that after the team has been out for so many months, that you and your teammates are ready to take on this challenge? 
ALAN PULIDO: Yes, we are ready. That's why we are here. We will be doing our best to win, and it's all about the mentality and being focused on that.

Q. From an emotional and psychological perspective, how strange is all of this for you, the setting and the bubble? Do you talk about your fellow Mexican players in the league about what it's like for them? 
ALAN PULIDO: Yeah, it's complicated in terms of what's being experienced around the world, and yes, there is some fear, fear not to get sick. But we are here with another idea. We are here. We are following the protocol and focused on why we're here.

In terms of the other question about contact with colleagues, Mexican colleagues, I've had a little contact, mostly via social media, given social distancing since we are following all precautions.
