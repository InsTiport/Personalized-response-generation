Minnesota United 2, Chicago Fire 2
Q. Why does this keep happening with this group where you guys get leads and chances to finish games, but it doesn't happen?  What is this team lacking and why can't this team consistently finish games when they have a chance for the lead, tide for a win?
FRANCISCO CALVO:   It hurts, first of all, it hurts, because we feel this is like a loss, even though we are gaining a point on the road.  We were controlling the game.  We were managing the game.  I think the stops for Minnesota changed the game.  That's my personal opinion.  They get into the game with good rhythm, good intensity and changed, got a little bit tired in the end I think, and then we concede the two goals, and it happened.
I know that things can happen but we need to fix this right away.  We have another fight on Sunday and we're just looking for that now.
Q. No wins on the road for you guys this season.  Obviously every game is different, but what went wrong for you guys away from home all season?
FRANCISCO CALVO:   I mean, to be honest, if I take the game in Columbus where we lost 3-0, I think we controlled the majority of the games.  Yeah, we didn't get the results.  We got some ties, but I don't have an answer for that.  I think that the things need to be more together.  It needs to be more grow as a team, grow as a group.  That's all I can say about that.
Q. Did this game tonight have any added meaning for you considering that Minnesota was the team that traded you away last year?
FRANCISCO CALVO:   No, no.  I just said thank you to them because they bring me to MLS, but I represent Chicago with every honor and I'm proud with this team, and also they take me when they make the trade.  It's just a normal game for me.
