 Q. Can you walk us through the goals?
 DANNY MUSOVSKI:   The first one, Edward just played in a good ball.  I think I did a good job of withholding my run a bit to stay on side and tried to place that one in the corner.
 Then the second one, Latif did a good job fighting for the ball and luckily I was there for the rebound, and I just wanted to redirect it.
 Q. What are you guys thinking when first you see Mark-Anthony Kaye go down, and minutes later you see Andy go down, as well.  What goes through your mind and how do you overcome that?
 DANNY MUSOVSKI:   You never want to see anyone go down like that.  I think that speaks to our team character to just see that and then fight through it.  Now we have guys out with international break and that hurts even more to see people going down in the game.  We just try to fight through it and I think everyone who came in after that did a good job of stepping up.
 Q. What was the message at halftime?  You got it under control against a really tough opponent.
 DANNY MUSOVSKI:   Yeah, Bob just told us to keep the intensity and keep doing what we were doing.  He was happy with what we were doing the first half intensity wise and just said keep going, because the game is not over.  There's still 45 minutes to play, so he just said keep going with it.
 Q. Is this you laying down the marker you want to be the starter moving forward?
 DANNY MUSOVSKI:   It's not really my job.  My job is just to play.  So it's up to the coaches to decide.  I just try to do well when I get on the pitch, and yeah, I'm happy to get the praise and I'm happy for the team to win, and that's where my focus is at.
