 BRIAN CHING: -- I think it's finding its right footing, the new MLS franchises. 

 Q. Bruce, Man United came in here after the loss to Kansas City. When you saw that game, did you have a sense they were going to come in with more purpose? 
 COACH BRUCE ARENA: I sensed that. Obviously the conditions were a little bit more favorable for them tonight with a dome and air-conditioning as opposed to the heat and humidity in Kansas City. 
 You know, obviously Manchester United had a little bit more focus in this game I think than they did in the previous ones. 
 I think again, and I think Sir Alex will tell you the same thing, there's some clear growth in our league, although tonight is a disappointing loss. I think a number of our players showed well. I'm really optimistic for the future of this league. 

 Q. Coach, was there a particular game plan you had or you just wanted to go out... 
 COACH BRUCE ARENA: Obviously we wanted to go out and get off to a good start. Obviously that didn't happen. You know, you don't need to be a genius to figure that out. 
 I think the result tonight, part of the story is we really spotted Manchester United a goal going into the game. That made it difficult. You have to remember a team I think is going to have an advantage over a collection of players that you throw together on an evening. 
 I think a team of the quality of Manchester United are clearly going to have some advantages against an All-Star team as opposed to another team in MLS because we're not necessarily playing players in the right spots, we aren't able to complement each other in this kind of format. 
 I think going into the game, there certainly were a number of advantages that Manchester United had. They showed that. They're a quality team, experienced team. I still marvel at players at the quality of Giggs and Brown and Welbeck. They have a number of great players. 
 I think in particular for our young players, again I mentioned Kevin Olson earlier, but for the L.A. Galaxy, Omar Gonzalez, it's a great experience for him. The first time they've been in these kind of environments. It's only going to be a plus for them as they move forward professionally.

 Q. How surprised were you to see Javier Hernandez make the move and how much damage do you think he can do over in Europe? 
 COACH BRUCE ARENA: Manchester United has a global scouting system. They know where all the great players in the world are. Obviously, they're well aware of this young prospect in Mexico. They did a fabulous job to be able to secure him at the time they did. 
 He's going to have a learning curve in the EPL and becoming a professional in the environment at Manchester United. He's not going to step on the field and I don't believe accumulate a whole lot of playing time in the early going. 
 One would have to believe that he's going to turn out to be an outstanding player. You can't have a better club in the world to be developed in. I think he has certainly a bright future. 

 Q. Bruce, David Beckham, is he close to returning to training, doing better than expected? 
 COACH BRUCE ARENA: David will be back in Los Angeles next week. He's on schedule in terms of his timetable for the rehabilitation. I believe there's a chance he can begin training by the end of August. 
 At this point in time there's no way to predict whether he'll be able to play this year or not. If you ask David, I think David would say yes. But certainly we need to be real smart about moving this player forward. We want to go in the right progressions and make sure that he has the correct fitness as we move him forward into the month of September. 
 There's a possibility he could play towards the end of the MLS regular season. But at this point in time, it would be difficult to say yes or no. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.
