 Q. As a goalkeeper, how much confidence does it give you to you make a save early on?
 BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   Yeah I think we switched off a bit and in the first couple minutes that's not something that can happen and obviously we'll have to go over that and make sure it's corrected for the next game.  In terms of confidence, it's nice always to get an early touch and make a big save when you need to, but that's why I'm there.  I'm there to try and make saves.
 Q. Other than that big save right off the bat, how would you rate the defenses performance.  I know you've been saying the team needs to improve, stop with the soft goals, but how do you think the team did defensively tonight?
 BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   Yeah, I think we did pretty well.  You know, any time you're on the road in this league, it's going to be difficult.  They made things tough for us at times and moved the ball well.  I think we got into blocks and defend asked dug in when we needed to.
 But obviously there's things that we need to improve on, and you know, we need to go over this video and we need to try to keep improving on those things hopefully for Sunday.
 Q. I wanted to ask you if you see a difference between the first half and the second half in the team?
 BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   I mean, I think at times, there were times when we built up well in both halves.  There were times when we needed to dig in defensively on both halves.  I think we created a little bit more probably in the first half but I think there were chances on both sides.
