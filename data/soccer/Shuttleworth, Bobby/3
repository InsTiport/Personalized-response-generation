Columbus 3, Chicago 0
Q. Bobby, just wondering, what's it like playing a Major League Soccer game and traveling on the same day?  I know you guys were on a charter, but describe what that experience is like to do that?
BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   Yeah, I mean obviously it's new, new for us, and every team is going to have to do IT.  To be honest with you, it pretty easy hop on a charter, had a-minute flight and we got to rest in the hotel, so the travel wasn't bad at all.
Q. Being your first match with the Fire, what was it like to have to come in with your new teammates and communicate and organize the back line against one of best teams in the Eastern Conference, if not MLS?
BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   I think, you know, I've been here for a while now and we've had a long time together, three different preseasons, so I feel comfortable.
You know, I feel comfortable playing with everyone along the back line, and Columbus is a good team, but that being said, I think there was long stretches tonight where we had the better of the play.  I think we just, you know, turned off at inopportune moments and they took advantage of that.
Q. Some of the mistakes, it's easy to pick on but what did you like from the team today?  What went well and what can you build on going forward?
BOBBY SHUTTLEWORTH:   Yeah, I think Raphael said it.  After the first 15 minutes when we settled in, there was long stretches where we were creating a lot of good half-chances and moving the ball well from side to side and really pressuring them well when they were trying to build out.
Of course those are things we can build on, but that being said, we need to be better in these key moments when we give away, really, really soft goals.  That's something that, you know, obviously we're going to work on in training and try to hammer out and get it right for Tuesday.
