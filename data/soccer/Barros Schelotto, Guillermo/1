Red Bulls - 3, LA Galaxy - 2
Q. Thoughts on the game?
GUILLERMO BARROS SCHELOTTO: Well, thoughts on the game.  I think New York no play better than us.  I think we had to get something, even I think even the third goal was a very irregular situation because it's very clear New York player is on off-side, but there's a -- sometimes it's like that.  Sometime you win, you can tie, you can lose, but I think we lost and we need to recover the three point and the next win even higher.
Q. Can you talk about the pressure the Red Bulls were bringing to the Galaxy?
GUILLERMO BARROS SCHELOTTO: They pressure but they never tried to play -- when they get the ball, just they play long ball and they get -- felt that way in the third half.  In the last minute in the first half, we could figure it out, trying to play, and get back the ball, the line back for New York, and we could score.  We start to winning the game, but in second half, they press, but not much, not play much better than us.  They found the goals.
Q. What do you say about Santos's performance today?
GUILLERMO BARROS SCHELOTTO: I think he scored.  He get the pass, he assist in the first goal.  You know, when he has the ball, he's really good.  He make a lot of difference, and we could (indiscernible) about -- his level today.
