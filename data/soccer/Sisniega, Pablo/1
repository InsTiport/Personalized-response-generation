 Q. Can you give us your thoughts on the game?  You looked like you had a tough collision with Eddie.  How are you feeling?
 PABLO SISNIEGA:   Obviously Seattle is a great team, and I'm just very happy that we were able to pull through and that we were able to suffer as a team in the moments where we had to suffer, and then we were able to get the three points.  We started off great, and it was a good first half, and then in the second half in the moments where we had to suffer, we knew how to kind of contain that and suffer as a team and I think that's something that is important to develop in our game and something that's going to carry on throughout the season.  I'm very happy with the win and it's a great team win.
