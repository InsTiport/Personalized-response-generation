Los Angeles Football Club 6, Vancouver 0
Q. Obviously this is the first shutout for the team since March 1, opening night.  How does it feel for you after the big win?
PABLO SISNIEGA:   Obviously very happy, very happy with how we started the game.  I thought kind of those first 10, 15 minutes, we really set a high standard and after that it was important to keep our concentration and to not give up, not give up a goal.  That was kind of the goal at the beginning of the game, and I'm happy we finally got a shutout after such a long time.
