 Q. I can you speak obviously Diego Rossi and his performance, and also when did you find out you were going to be the starting goalkeeper for tonight's game?
 PABLO SISNIEGA:   Obviously Diego had an amazing performance.  To score four goals is something that's at the reach of very few players and obviously he's a special kind of player, and he's stepping up right now.  So obviously it was a great, great night for him.
 And I found out yesterday and I just tried to get ready and do it -- like do everything to the best of my abilities.
