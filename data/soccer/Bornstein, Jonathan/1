Minnesota United 2, Chicago Fire 2
Q. Why does this keep happening to you guys? Why do you keep building leads but not be able to finish the game off? What's lacking in this group that allows this to keep happening?
JONATHAN BORNSTEIN:   I mean, that's a difficult question. Obviously if we knew the answer, we would try and fix it as quickly as we could. You know, just got to be a little bit more mature as a group, and know how to manage the game a little bit better. I think we're growing as a team. We have made leaps and bounds in terms of building the group and being able to create results at the beginning, but lately we haven't been able to finish out games. So it's definitely something we've got to work on and hopefully next game we can definitely figure out how to get that win and close out the game.
Q. You guys went the entire season without winning a game on the road this year. So what went wrong for you guys away from Soldier Field all season?
JONATHAN BORNSTEIN:   I mean, you know, I think with Chicago in general, been struggling on the road since I got here even last season. Before that Houston game last year, we were not finding results on the road. I think it's carried over and something we need to focus a lot more on is when we go on the road, especially if we get up, figuring a way to finish out games and get points.
You know, winning on the road is so important in this league because you steal points, and obviously with a few road wins, we find ourselves easily in the table for playoffs.
I don't have a true answer as to why we can't win on the road, but we're definitely trying to figure it out and get that aspect a little bit better going forward.
Q. I know the group probably can't pleased right now, but how do you feel going into Sunday's game? At least on the bright side, you know what you need to do: Three points and you're in.
JONATHAN BORNSTEIN:   Yeah, that's it. We're conscious of that. We know, you know, at home we've actually been a lot better in terms of getting results and getting wins. New York is not an easy opponent, but that's the mentality we're going with is three points, it's in our hands. Put a good game together and then get those three points and qualify for playoffs, and then, you know, once you're in, you're in. You can get a good run of games going and you find yourselves champions. That's our plan, get three points on Sunday and never look back.
