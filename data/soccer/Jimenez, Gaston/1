Philadelphia Union 2, Chicago Fire 1
Q. How much did the game change after the red card, and what did you think of the team's reaction to playing with ten men?
GASTON JIMENEZ:   I think we had a great reaction.  We fought hard and it was very difficult when you're playing with one man down, especially from so early on almost the whole game, and especially against a great team, but we were in there fighting, battling hard, and it's difficult when things -- when they make things a little bit one-sided and it seems that the fouls are going mostly one-way.
Q. With the ^ playoff race getting right and tighter, how much pressure is there on you guys to start getting results on the road?
GASTON JIMENEZ:   We still have three games left and we need to get nine points from those three games or the maximum amount of points possible.  We are still in control of our fate and we are going to keep fighting and keep going with everything that we have because that's what we want.
Q. After a defeat like that where the team played well and a lot of people would say deserved to win and didn't today, does it have a negative impact on the team's feeling?  Do you feel down now or does it motivate you going forward?  What's the impact on the team after something like that?
GASTON JIMENEZ:   We can't have a negative reaction within the team.  Everything is positive with us.  We are doing well.  We are going through a good moment.  We are playing well, and we know that everything still depends on us.  We still depend on ourselves and that's the best motivation that you can have.
So while the math is still working out and we are still in the playoff race, we are going to keep working hard to obtain our objective, which has been to get into the playoffs, and we are still depending on ourselves and we are still in a fight for it.
