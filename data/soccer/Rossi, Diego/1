 Q. Talk about the Golden Boot win, and going into the playoffs, what you need to do.
 DIEGO ROSSI:   Thank you about that.  I think that we have to continue working hard and I know this one was not a result that we want.  But we have to learn about this and we have to continue.  This is part of football, and now we have to learn for the playoffs, that is more important at least from there.
 Q. Congratulations on the Golden Boot.  I wanted to ask you about the accomplishment.  What does it mean to win it, and was this something that you were working towards all season being the top scorer in MLS?
 DIEGO ROSSI:   Thank you.  As a forward, you always want to score and you always want to help the team in that way, and yes, you have to work hard for that, improve yourself, and be ready when you have a chance to put it in.
 Yeah, this is a trophy also for the team, because without my teammates, this is impossible to make.
