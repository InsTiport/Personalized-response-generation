 Q. Could you speak about the feeling of beating your rivals by such a wide margin, and also the work that you're doing, do you feel that you're stepping up in the absence of Carlos Vela?
 DIEGO ROSSI:   Well, the feelings are really good.  Obviously I'm happy with my goals but I am more happy about the result, the attitude of the team.  We always want to play with heart, and that attitude is what we are happy about.
 So I'm really happy about the whole situation, and we have to continue like this.
 Q. How different was this edition of the rivalry, just being in Orlando and without fans there?  It almost seemed with the number of yellow cards and stuff, it was as chippy as usual.
 DIEGO ROSSI:   Yeah, I mean, it's different to play any game without fans, but also, it's really different to play a derby without fans.  The derby that we had before, it was a really good atmosphere with the fans, and when we play in our stadium every game, it's full.  Every game the fans are with us.  That is something that's really important for us because they push us in a good way.
 Obviously it's different, but you have to be smart.  The group have to be really focused on what is going on, and yeah, it's different.  But it's the new life that we have and we have to be ready for this.  FastScripts by ASAP Sports ...
