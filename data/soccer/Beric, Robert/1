Q. Just looking ahead a little bit, actually, you guys have eight games this month, if I'm not mistaken.  How do you deal with that both physically and mentally knowing that this is going to be a pretty challenging grind of a month for you as a player?
ROBERT BERIC:   I mean, like you said, it's going to be challenging.  We have to be professionals.  We have to be able to take care of our bodies.  We have to make a good re-generation after every game.  Yeah, have a good sleep, rest at home, and going from the game to the game to try to be in the best shape.
Q. Five straight games with a goal for you.  How did you keep your confidence when the goals had dried up for you a bit?
ROBERT BERIC:   I mean, it's always nice to score a goal, but I always say, it's even nicer to win, you know?  So I mean, winning a scoring goal is the work of the whole team, so I'm thankful for that, that the team is helping me, that I'm helping the team.  So we just have to try to keep winning and being good, having a good energy for every next game that's coming.
Q. How have you turned it around from a long goal-less streak to now having goals in five straight games?  Have you done anything different or is it just a matter of believing in yourself and staying the course?
ROBERT BERIC:   As I say, I think, well, we as a team, we progress.  We feel each other much more, much more on the pitch.  I think we get to know, get to slowly know each other more.  And then I also know what to expect in the moments on the pitch, what kind of ball, where to move.  So I think it's the progress of the whole team and as you can see also how we play, I think we are making progress from the game to the game and I think this is the main reason.
