 Q.  What happened in the second half?  
MATÃAS ALMEYDA: That's two, we had pretty much two games in one.  The first half it was a great game.  The second half, it was pretty bad.  It was against a team, they have been working together for five years now, and they already have their system installed.  We're still searching for a bunch of new things, a new mentality and new style of play and it's going to take time.   
 Q.  Is his situation more a product of the team's results?  
MATÃAS ALMEYDA: I think he did a good first half.  In the second half, like the whole team, he wasn't at a great level.  When I tried to do an offensive sub -- (inaudible).   
 Q.  How frustrating was it -- or is it part of the growing pains of learning the position?  
MATÃAS ALMEYDA: Work, mentality, concentration, the nine goals that we conceded is, I don't think of one where it's the strength of our rival.  It's more our mistake.  That shows that that we have to keep working to get what we're looking for.   
 Q.  It sounds like you believe this roster can still win games.  
MATÃAS ALMEYDA: We're going to try to give our current players we have confidence.  It's never easy to change a system, it's a whole different system and as time goes, we're going to get out of this one we're in.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
MATÃAS ALMEYDA: He hasn't done very many chances.  He's still working with the club, with his teammates, with us.  He's a goal scorer and sometimes goal scorers goal-scoring phases and sometimes they have droughts, for him and as well as for the rest of the team, we should still keep improving.
