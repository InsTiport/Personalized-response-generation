Minnesota United 2, Chicago Fire 2.
Q. Why does this keep happening to you guys, having a lead and then not being able to finish games? Why does this keep happening, and what are you guys lacking and what's stopping you guys from being able to pick up three points in games that you have had leads?
RAPHAEL WICKY:   I look at the end of the day, it's a lot of the same mistakes throughout the whole season. First we create a lot of chances; we miss those big chances. Missing a big chance alone in front of a goalie is like making a big mistake as a defender, as a goalkeeper. So we do mistakes on both ends of the game, and that goes throughout the whole year.
And then on the other side, we give up often similar goals. We give up often set piece goals. We had a 2-0 lead and I know they have some big guys, but again, we gave a set piece goal away again in Nashville, so it's a lot of similarities almost in every game.
Yeah, what is it? Is it focus? Concentration? Is it bad luck? Is it quality? I cannot tell you. I can't give you the answer. I'm obviously happy that we create so much. That is obviously a positive, but I'm obviously not happy that we don't score these goals.
Q. Playoffs are still within reach for you guys and you know exactly what you need to do to qualify for them but how much does a result like this hurt, especially when you're up 2-0?
RAPHAEL WICKY:   Yeah, we know it's all in our hands. We still know that. It's just right now directly after the game. We're very disappointed. We came here, we had the game in our hands. I think honestly we should have been 3-1 up at halftime and we should have, after 2-0, we should have killed that game. It was all there. And again we don't do it, so that's why it really hurts. The result hurts. We still take a point.
We know scenarios for Sunday, but right now after the game, this one hurts, and it's a game we shouldn't have drawn. We should have won this game, period.
Q. Obviously this one hurts as you just said, but how are you feeling going into Sunday? Are you still confident the guys can get three points on Sunday, and then you don't have to worry about what everyone else does?
RAPHAEL WICKY:   Oh, of course. Of course I'm confident. We have shown throughout the whole season that we can compete with every team; that we can beat teams. So I'm confident. Right now, I'm disappointed right now. But of course I'm confident to go into the game against New York City at home that we can that, of course.
