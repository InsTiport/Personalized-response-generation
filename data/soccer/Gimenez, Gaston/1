Q. Now that you've had a number of games with the team, what's your comfort level like and how is your understanding with your new teammates?
GASTÓN GIMÉNEZ:   Yeah, we have played several games together and we are feeling more comfortable together.  We are starting to understand each other better.  We are finding ways to play together more cohesively.  We are starting to understand better what the coach is asking of us.
Yeah, there are things -- each time we're playing a little bit better, but there are things that we can adjust, that we can correct.  Little by little, we're going to get there.  Defensively, we're starting to understand each other better.
Today thankfully it was 0-0.  It was a very important point for us, and so now we just have to keep adjusting, keep working together and start getting points.
Q. Is this a game where you felt like a road point was a very good result, or did you feel like during the course of the game, you guys should have ended up winning this?
GASTÓN GIMÉNEZ:   We always are looking to get the three points.  We're always trying to win.  Of course we knew that coming into this game, we had -- we were coming off the loss.  So it was important to come in and try to get the three points, but even so, we need to earn points and getting the point here was important.
So getting the points and earning points is what we're trying to do, and that's what is important for us.
Q. Did you feel in the second half there was a little bit of an injection in energy with the three substitutes and that Chicago had more attacking chances?
GASTÓN GIMÉNEZ:   Yes, the subs came in really strong.  We needed that freshness.  We needed them to come in and each one of them, you know, came in -- especially with so many games back-to-back every three days, it's important that our subs come in and bring in that freshness and that they come in ready to play, and today they certainly showed that they are ready to play and that's what we need, everyone, you know, coming in and demonstrating that they are ready, we are all ready, we are all competitive, and coming in and bringing in that energy.
