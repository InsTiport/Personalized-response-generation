NY Red Bulls - 3, Montreal Impact - 1   
 Q.  Just want to give a couple thoughts about the match?  Obviously tough result?  
RÃMI GARDE: Yeah, I mean, we had a good first half, but then we didn't create any chances in second half and it was difficult to compete against a good team.  They have a good team, many players that can come in and strengthen the team in the second half.  That's what they have done.   
On all sides I think we played well for the 45 minutes.  Second half, we didn't hold the ball enough collectively, and then they gave us a problem.   
 Q.  Piatti back from injury, what do you think of his shift out there?  
RÃMI GARDE: It's always a boost for the team when you can play with Nacho, but we cannot rely on Louis and Camacho individual stuff to win games.  Then we need to improve as a team, but as I said, we both played quite late in the season.  It was the first game for Camacho and it was only the second one for Silva, and it was the third one for Fanni.   
You know, we have a young team in term of how many games did we play all together; then we need to improve in that part of the game, and go through and work some training sessions.
