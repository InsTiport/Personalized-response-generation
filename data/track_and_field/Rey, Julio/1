JULIO REY:  I got tangled with another runner and when I felt, like, twisting my ankle and I feel it's a little serious because the pain is strong. 
 
Q.   We saw on the tape, did your ankle hit the leg of the table?
 
JULIO REY:  I don't remember exactly but I think it was with another runner's leg.  
 
Q.   Did you step on another runner's heel in front of you?
 
JULIO REY:  I think what happened is that they crushed leg against leg and that's how I got tangled.  My legs. 
 
Q.   When did the tangle occur?  What point was it was it?  4 miles as we think or you know better obviously you were there.
 
JULIO REY:  Exactly on the fourth mile. 
 
Q.   Pretty sure it's just a bad twist, it's not like broken or anything?
 
JULIO REY:  I am not really sure.  I just arrived.  It hasn't been seen by a doctor yet, but I am really hoping that it's just a twisted ankle and nothing serious. 
 
Q.   When you started you said you were very obsessed about running in the New York City Marathon.  How do you feel now?
 
JULIO REY:  I feel very sad and because I really was sure that I was in pretty good form; that I was going to win the marathon and I am so sad that this happened to me because I was in pretty good form.
