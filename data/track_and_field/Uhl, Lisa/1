  Q. So it's been pretty much off since June?   
 LISA UHL: Well, yeah, since end of July, it's been pretty interrupted.  
  
  Q. So you might be one of these people, every once in a while we have these races for somebody who hasn't been able to race in a while. They're the ones that go in and steals it.   
 LISA UHL: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that that's going to happen or not. I feel like I'm very fit, I'm very strong right now, but I'm not very fast. I've been doing lots of marathon training. I've been training with Sean and Cara. So I'm doing marathon training at this point of the year. I don't know. I'm not going to feel fast. But I don't think anybody's going to feel very fast. Lots of these girls have been just coming off a long track season or going into a marathon.  
  
  Q. I know you have a fast enough 10K, but you're not going to do a marathon?   
 LISA UHL: No, I'm not planning on running the marathon. Not for next couple years.  
  
  Q. So your next plans after this would be indoor stuff in January?   
 LISA UHL: Yeah, probably do some indoor stuff in January. I have to get the qualifier in, so I'll probably get that out of the way early at Stanford or some meet like that where I can hopefully run under 31:25 to get the qualifier in for the trials.
