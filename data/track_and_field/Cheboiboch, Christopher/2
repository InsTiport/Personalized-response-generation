Q.  How much did this race remind you of Boston?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: Well, that was -- the course in Boston is the hardest course I have I ever run.  
 
Q.  At about one hour and 59 minutes, did you notice when Rodgers Rop grabbed his side, did you think he was in trouble?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: No, I never noticed he had trouble . 
 
Q.  It seemed like he was struggling to hold onto that lead.  Was it hard for you to hold the pace up there?  Was that reality or just TV?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: Yes, it was reality, but we knew at 20 miles I was the in this race.  I never wanted to go in front because I knew I could have a lot of troubles in my 20. 
 
Q.  Was there ever a time in the last two miles where you thought you might catch Rodgers?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: Yeah, I thought could I catch him but he was, like, 150 meters ahead of me.  But I really struggled, but it paid off.  I had never had any quit in him. 
 
Q.  What do you think of the race that Rodgers ran?  Was it a smart race?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: Rodgers had a great race because all the time he was in front.  He had a wonderful race. 
 Ã   
 
Q.  Rodgers has only run these three marathons and he wins two.  What do you think of that?  What do you have to do to beat him?
 
CHRISTOPHER CHEBOIBOCH: Always, you know when you are preparing for a big marathon like this one it's not easy.  And don't forget that maybe if it is your day, it is your day, maybe.  Maybe it was Rodgers's day today.
