   MARIO LOPEZ: I ran, hit the play list, bam! Once the old school Doobie Brothers kicked in, that was it. I'm a little lightheaded.   
 But, no, I feel great. I'm very excited. Gorgeous day. New Yorkers couldn't be cooler or more supportive. I stopped, took a couple pictures. Signed a couple autographs.   
 Did a little salsa in the Bronx. Talked to Extra around mile 22.
