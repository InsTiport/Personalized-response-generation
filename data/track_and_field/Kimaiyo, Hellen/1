HELLEN KIMAIYO:   Yeah, I enjoyed myself down here.  The run was very good.  I enjoyed running.  It was very nice.  I didn't make it to the best time that I wanted, but it was okay.  Next time I can do better than I did today.


Q.  2:32 and 11th place is amazing.  Why do you think it was so fast? 

HELLEN KIMAIYO:   To me, it is not great, because I wanted to improve, because  -- I wanted to at least do better than my best time, but I am happy about it because I did it to the finish line. 


Q.  Why do you think the race itself was so fast, all of the women in front of you? 

HELLEN KIMAIYO:   Yeah, it was fast, so I try to stay with them, but it was too fast for me.  I just decided to just come and use my own pace, because it may be that I not have to push.  So, I just decided to just use my own pace to the finish line.

HELLEN KIMAIYO:   Thank you very much.
