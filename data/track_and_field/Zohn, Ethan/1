 Q. Ethan Zohn and Aaron, you guys ran great together. You helped him. You were busting your butt to keep up with this guy. Tell us about that?
 ETHAN ZOHN: It worked out pretty well at first. I was doing a good job. When I was tired he dragged me, when I was tired he dragged me. So it was a good partnership. I just feel incredible having run 26.2 miles. I said it before, but I stepped on every single cancer cell out there, and I punched out every little bit of age that you can possibly punch out.

 Q. Ethan, you are that survivor. You've done it, you're going to come back to run for cancer again, aren't you?
 ETHAN ZOHN: I am. I'm going to beat it, and hopefully I'll be here next year.
