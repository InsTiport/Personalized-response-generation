Q.  How did your race go today?
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  It was hard towards the end for me.  My best time in Dallas was 3:48, got cramps at the end, and the same thing happened to me today.  I need a solution for that, but it was a great, beautiful incredible experience.  The crowds and the people and all of it, it was just awesome. 
 

Q.  Where did you start to have problems in the race or cramps?
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  Just before mile 20, I think. 
 

Q.  How did you feel the temperature was?  We heard some people saying that it was a little bit warm today, but I would imagine from Austin, did you find it was okay?
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  In Austin it's been very warm all the way up till a week ago.  So I've been training in really hot, humid weather.  So to me, it was incredibly beautiful.  It was beautiful, perfect. 
 

Q.  Are you planning on doing another marathon?
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  Last time after I finished, I said I would never do another one; so here I am. So I think I'll just say nothing.  I think it's like childbirth, you sort of forget, and then you think, okay, I'll have another one. 
 

Q.  What do you think about when you're running?  What keeps you going, what gets you to the finish?
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  Today I was thinking about -- both my friends and I were running for an organization called Fertile Hope; I was thinking about that.  I was thinking about my children.  When it hurts really bad, I pray. And I'm just real grateful to my two friends I ran with today.  That really helped me.  They are sitting in the back right now stuffing their faces.  (Laughing.) 
 
KRISTIN ARMSTRONG:  You just never know.
