JAPHET KOSGEI:   Yeah, I thought doing that because in the first half, I tried to apply the techniques that I had for a fast time.  So I tried to relax, at least up to  -- I wanted to relax, try to relax up to more than half, let's say up to 30 kilometers, 25, but after that, I struggled from 27 kilometers all the way up to the finish.  And reaching about 35  -- 38 kilometers, that is when my leg was very stiff so I just tried to finish. 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   Yes, this is the first marathon that I have not won, and I am hungry because I finished second.  I struggled, used all my strength.  I have never struggled in a race.

JAPHET KOSGEI:   Never. 


Q.  Were you surprised when Abdelkhader El Mouaziz, went out so early, so far, were you surprised? 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   No.  I was not surprised at all. 


Q.  Why not? 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   Because I knew that even when it was time for me to go, I would have to run after him, but after the half, he was ahead and I had to step up my own pace to finish. 


Q.  Did you know there was somebody ahead of you at the end of the race? 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   Yes, I knew very well, because there were two people at first and then I run past one and I could see them. 


Q.  Did you see him at all in the last half of the race? 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   I couldn't see him, but I knew that he had not dropped, and because I was stiff, I couldn't apply, but I just continued to try for second place or fourth place, go to the finish. 


Q.  (Inaudible)?

JAPHET KOSGEI:   My problem earlier was to  -- my aim now was to take my body to the finish line, to struggle and finish the race. 

JAPHET KOSGEI:   No, I don't train with him.

JAPHET KOSGEI:   No, I didn't know that Shem was coming.
