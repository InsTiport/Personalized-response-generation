   STEPHEN MUZHINGI: I know the courses are very tough. And here now these flat courses, they run 2:15, 2:16. I'm not expecting to run 2:16. I must go run a better time, 2:13. That is what I'm trying to do: 
 I can't run 2:15. 2:15 is a later time. I must run 2:10, 2:11, 2:12 because I can qualify for Olympics.

 Q. That is the target? 
 STEPHEN MUZHINGI: Yes. To select me to go to the Olympics next year. So if I run like 2:12, I'll be in the lineup for the Olympics. That is why I want to better my time. To do a personal best. 
 2:20 is my personal best.
