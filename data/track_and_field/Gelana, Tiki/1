Q.   Were you surprised to win the gold medal? 
    TIKI GELANA:   Yes, very much. 

Q.   When you crossed that finish line, what was the first thing in your mind?   What did you think? 
    TIKI GELANA:   I was thinking, have I really won. 

Q.   You come from a country with a great tradition of women runners, some of the best the world has ever seen.   How does it feel now to be among them? 
    TIKI GELANA:   I feel great joy. 

Q.   Have you ever been to New York before, to the city? 
    TIKI GELANA:   No, I haven't.   This is my first time. 

Q.   When did you arrive? 
    TIKI GELANA:   On Wednesday. 

Q.   Have you had the chance to see anything here at all yet in the city? 
    TIKI GELANA:   No, I haven't seen anything. 

Q.   Will you see the course before the race?   Will you take a tour? 
    TIKI GELANA:   No. 

Q.   Do you usually like to see a course before a race? 
    TIKI GELANA:   No, I don't. 

Q.   Why not? 
    TIKI GELANA:   I just want to relax, rest.

Q.   You took one full year off of running before you started at Amsterdam Marathon in 2011.   Was it difficult to get back into training and get back to racing? 
    TIKI GELANA:   No, that's not correct. 

Q.   Before you came here, perhaps last year or before you came this year, have you ever watched this race on television or video?   Will it be a complete surprise to you? 
    TIKI GELANA:   I watched when they were running here last year.

Q.   On television? 
    TIKI GELANA:   Yes.

Q.   From Addis?
    TIKI GELANA:   Yes.

Q.   Then you saw Mary Keitany go out very fast, very early.   What did you think of that? 
    TIKI GELANA:   I just figured she must be very well prepared and she must be expecting to win, so actually I was rather surprised when she fell back.
