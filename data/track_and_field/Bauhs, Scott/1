Q.   How are preparations for the race?   Are you good?
SCOTT BAUHS:   Yeah, I hope so, yeah. 

Q.   What are you looking to accomplish out there?
SCOTT BAUHS:   I'd like to PR.   I'm pretty loose, like if I could PR or if I can beat some good runners, that's really all I need to take away from this race.   I'd also like to get out there and see what it's like.   I did do the Dash to the Finish last year, but I think this will be a better sample of what it might be like to run the actual marathon.   At some point in the future I imagine I'll do that.   Just a way to break up training.   I've been training pretty hard, and it's nice to get a race in there. 

Q.   A PR would be a good accomplishment.   Your PR is solid. 
SCOTT BAUHS:   Yeah, but it was only a few months ago, so I hope I've sort of progressed from there.   But yeah, I definitely set goals kind of high for myself.   I don't think it's an impossible barrier or anything, though. 

Q.   So you're coming here basically to build off a good performance in Houston, then where do you go from here?
SCOTT BAUHS:   Well, then I go to the track.   With the Olympic Trials coming up and the Olympics, coming up, that's the goal, make the Olympic team on the track.   That's where I go from here.   I'll open up my track season in just a couple weeks. 

Q.   Where do you think you'll open it up?
SCOTT BAUHS:   The Stanford Invitational on April 6th, I think. 

Q.   Are you doing the 10?
SCOTT BAUHS:   I'll do the 5K there.   And then there's the other invitational at Stanford, the Cardinal Invitational in late April.   I'll do the 10K there. 

Q.   Are you going after the standards?
SCOTT BAUHS:   No, I have to get the A standard in both.   I don't have the A standard.   B standard doesn't do me a whole lot of good being American.   It's good for the sport, but yeah, so I need to get the A standard.
