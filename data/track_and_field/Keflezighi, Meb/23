   SHALANE FLANAGAN: Oh, my goodness. I credit my team. I was so prepared. I'm so grateful and I was so nervous. And Jerry Schumacher was so confident of what I could do.   
 I'm just so thankful right now.  
  
 EDNA KIPLAGAT: I'm happy because the field was so strong, and I managed to pull away from them.   
  
 MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I felt pretty good overall. They just made a move on First Avenue and kept it going. That's the marathon for you.  
  
 GEBRE GEBREMARIAM: I can't believe it. I am so happy. It's my first marathon, and I wasn't sure I could win but now I'm sure.
