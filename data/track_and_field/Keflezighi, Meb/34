Q.  What did you learn about the marathon today?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I guess I felt very comfortable getting there.  I struggled the last 10k.  Felt very comfortable.  I was very cold but I learned from it.  It was rough.  Just I went for it.  Live and learn. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I do not regret.  I say live and learn. 

Q.  Talk about the race that Rop ran; he ran a very intelligent race or --

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: First time I raced against him.  He was looking around a lot.  He was looking at me and I was looking back.  But he was kind of checking it out who was behind, but I don't know what his final time was, but he probably was consistent.  Personally I didn't have it the last 10k, just went slower and slower. 

Q.  Was it windy out there?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: It was very windy.

Q.  Head wind or  ---

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Head wind, definitely.  My hands were cold.  Especially after I finished, very cold.

Q.  Could you tell us where you fell off with the leaders?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Last bridge, I guess they made a surge and kind of had -- they had a gap.  Then I got up to them a little bit; then when I got there, they surged it again. 

Q.  After they started to get away from you, what happened for your race after that?  What happened to your splits and people coming by you, things like that, how did that feel?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Basically pace was obviously too slow.  I was watching my split, but it was very slow.  I don't know, I think I was 103 something, felt great for -- I just wasn't there.

Q.  Were you working with Gert Thys? Were you guys sort of working together?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Work with who.

Q.  Thys, he was in blue.

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Not that I know of, no.  Marco went by.  When he went by he said let's go Meb.  I wasn't able to keep up the pace with him.  Marco and I talked a little bit tried to help each other out.

Q.  If you think about the preparation, you had the training for this race, do you think that was sufficient or do you think it was just the bold tactic that (inaudible) --?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I was comfortable where I was, more free instead of staying in the back and preparation, I had done a lot of runs and longer than 26 miles, so I had a stitch that last 6 mile so it was kind of rough. 

Q.  More the conditions than your preparation?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah, conditions.  I have been in the mountains and temperature was fine but if it was really cold I would wear sweats.  Today was tank top and shorts.

Q.  Anxious to do another one?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I am in no rush.  Obviously my first 10k didn't go well either.  I think I ran 30:55.  So kind of similar experience.

Q.  Sort of having that bad last 10k, is that motivation to try and come back, run a complete marathon again, do it right all the way?

MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I give a lot of respect for people who run marathons.  I give a lot of respect to them no matter what time they do.  Today I didn't get the time that I'd like but I finished the marathon.  I felt like dropping out but I didn't do it.  It is a very tough event.  Jifar won it last year; look what happened this year.  It is difficult.  You never know what to expect. Everything has to be perfect.
