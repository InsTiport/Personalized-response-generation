Q.  Could you tell us what it was like running just with women, whether that was a little bit different in this case, whether it was more enjoyable or less so, whether it mattered?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  I think it made it -- a lot of the girls were watching each other a lot.  That's why the pace was not so fast because I think people were -- didn't want to run away and be out there on their own. 

Q.  Did you like it?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  I don't know.  I think the first half was great, the crowds were fantastic, and I think the second half I struggled a lot and I just was trying to get  -- I just wanted it to end really, and just get to the finish line.  I think my legs were really just, got really tight and I couldn't run properly so it was something that I wasn't used to feeling and didn't enjoy. 

Q.  Why were your legs tight?  Was it a matter of hide duration?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  I don't know exactly right now.  Only one thing, I suppose I had enough time in those last 10 miles when I was trying to run fast but not managing to think about why can't I keep going and what was the problem.  The best thing I could come up with was, I think in some ways maybe the pace was too slow and I should have went faster earlier on.  I think I am not really used to the slow rhythm of running and even in training, I tend to run a bit quicker.  I think maybe my legs just tightened up because I was trying to hold back because I had taken advice from so many people "No matter how good you feel, try to relax and don't go fast the first half." I don't know, looking back, if I would start over again, I think I would go faster in the first half even if I was in the same position the second half then.  At least I would know that I tried my best at the first half. 

Q.  What do you think of the marathon?  Are you going to run more?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  At this stage, I don't know.  At this stage, you'd like to say no and be like get at that and say never again.

Q.  On the bridge, were you pretty much running solo the last ten miles.

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  Definitely, yeah. 

Q.  Anybody to run with?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  No.  The gap opened up really quickly on the bridge.  I don't know if it was before that or after that that my legs just tightened up and I couldn't feel myself run properly.  Margaret went past me.  I tried to go with her.  I know she'd probably catch up with me, if I go with her, I'd catch up too.  But I went for a little while but just keep going.  

Q.  Do you think there is any possibility that you might have raced too often?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  Definitely not, no.  If anything, I think it was enough races to prepare me for this race.  No, I don't think so. 

Q.  When you were near the front, did you feel that the pacesetter should have gone faster?  She was running 2:28 for the first half of the race?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  I think she didn't want  -- I think she kept looking behind and there was nobody willing to go with her.  I think she just didn't want to be running out there by herself and just stop.  I think it was one of those things, it was a lot of good really good runners in the race and when that happens, people tend to watch each other and nobody is willing to go out there and run fast unless they decide they are going to do that beforehand.

Q.  We were told that  -- Lornah Kiplagat suggested that she would want the faster pace.  Considering that, were you surprised that Lornah didn't try and push it?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN: A bit, yeah.  I spoke to her afterwards and she also said that she probably would have preferred to have run faster from the start and maybe it is a mistake that both of us made that you'd be a bit cautious and you still feel the same way the last bit.

Q.  Was there anything that went through your head that thought maybe this was a better opportunity for you when Okayo was having trouble?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN: No, I didn't notice that she had any trouble.

Q.  You say you feel like never again, but an athlete of your pedigree  -- talk about whether or not you think you would come back?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN: I don't know.  It's hard to say right now.  Right now, I don't know, I just want to have a break and I suppose start all over again pick a few more things to look forward to things to train for.  I don't know right now the marathon is not the next race I want to run. 

Q.  Talk about Marla Runyan's performance today, her debut, any comments on that?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN: The only thing I noticed during the race I think Marla ran really well and I just felt that she was running strongly throughout the race.  The race was perfect for her, it was a pace that she wanted to run. 

Q.  If you couldn't see the way that she can't see, how much of an effect does that have, do you think, as far as running?

SONIA O'SULLIVAN:  I don't know.  It's hard to imagine, I mean, it's hard to close your eyes and go for one lap at a track, so it's hard to put yourself in that position. But I know that she's been in the Olympics and she's run shorter road distances.  She obviously knows what she is doing.  She's well prepared and trained.
