ALLAN STEINFELD:  What a spectacular start to the ING sponsorship.  We had a record over 35,000 starters and tomorrow we will have a full report because our elite athletes and our wheelchair athletes, don't go over the mats, so it will probably be upwards of 35,200. 

We had 3 course records in the men's and women's wheelchair, certainly in the women's event, 3 women under our old course record.  Margaret Okayo certainly has cemented her reputation as one of the dominant women marathoners in the world.  Look at the field that she beat.  Something that's new this year, besides our title sponsorship and the concerns.  Mayor Bloomberg just received a call that he will present the keys to the city to the winners of our race, the male and female and the two wheelchair winners, and a crystal apple from Tiffany, which represents New York City to the two local winners.
