 Q.   Because it's difficult, a lot of corners and a lot of hills.   So good tactics.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Are you happy about the wind?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   No.   About the wind, I'm not happy, but if the wind is there, there's nothing you can do.  
   
 Q.   Exactly.   It's the race.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes, what I want is to run a good pace.  
   
 Q.   So do you like a hard race with tough competition?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   It's not a competition if it's easy.   Competitions are always hard.   What you need to do is to try your best.  
   
 Q.   Well, just think, in London you timed it so beautifully when Wilson went away, and then you came through later.   You let him make the mistake.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   You see, mistakes are common.  
   
 Q.   Yes.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   So for him, I think I learned from his mistake.  
   
 Q.   So you waited back and you came through.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   You mean in the Olympics?  
   
 Q.   Yes, I meant the Olympics.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   He was strong in the race, but he went out there too fast.  
   
 Q.   You won gold medals in the Olympics.  
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   In the Olympics, everybody in the race was strong.   But maybe because he went out there first.  
   
 Q.   You've done well in championship races and gold medals and World Championships in the Olympics.   But that hasn't translated as well to these World Marathon Majors.   What do you think will be different this time?   What do you hope happens on Sunday?   Do you think there's a reason you've struggled more in the marathon majors than you have in the championships?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   I see the good competition in the world majors.   Like the last two, I win a marathon in the International Championship and also in the Olympics.   So this time I hope that I win.   I didn't do anything in the championship race differently.   This time I hope that I improve.   
   
 Q.   You did quite well in hot competitions, in London and others that are hot.   It's not going to be very hot on Sunday.   Do you think your body will adjust well to a very cold temperature and wind?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Like in any competition, the way you work out, maybe the conditions.   
I was saying like maybe the previous years I would not have done good in the world majors because of some reasons.   One reason is maybe it was a bad day for me.   Maybe I didn't prepare well.   So the competitions are different now.  
   
 Q.   You don't think it's anything about you particularly that would prevent you from finishing on the podium on Sunday?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   In the competition like this one, everything is pressure.   My hope is to finish at the top.  
   
 Q.   You normally run two marathons a year, not three.   But you came to New York last year because it was a possibility of the World Marathon Majors.   How do you come into New York this year?   What's the difference between your preparation this year and last year?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   After last year, I didn't perform well as I expected.   So last year I think I didn't do some things.   So that's why I came back.  
   
 Q.   You've been at the camp training with Emanuel Mutai, Eliud Kipchoge.   Now they've just had 2:03:13, first place Berlin, 2:04:11, second place Chicago.   What do their performances tell you about your condition?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Their performance, as my training mates, it helps.  
   
 Q.   That gives you confidence?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yeah, confidence.  
   
 Q.   Were you able to stay with them during the workouts that you logged in?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes, most all the workouts.  
   
 Q.   Most all the workouts, you were right with them?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Who prepares the workouts?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   We have two coaches.   One coach is Patrick Sang.  
   
 Q.   And who's the other one?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Richard Metu.  
   
 Q.   But Patrick is the main coach?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How tall are you?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   My height is the same as before.   My weight has reduced a little bit.  
   
 Q.   It's a little less?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   So how many kilos?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   52, 53.  
   
 Q.   How was it before?   You said reduced from what?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   56.  
   
 Q.   Was this when you won the Olympics?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   When I won the Olympics was 54.   I've been 54 for three years, but then I was 56.  
   
 Q.   When you won the World Championships, what were you?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   I was 54.  
   
 Q.   And you're a little lighter now?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How tall are you?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   5'7".  
   
 Q.   The conditions will be similar to last year, maybe a little bit colder and a headwind.   This is not a 2:03 course, not 2:03 conditions, not 2:04 conditions, but the Olympics and World Championships, don't watch, just race.   Do you prefer races that are no pace?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yeah, yeah, I prefer it with no pacers.   For me, I like races without pace makers.  
   
 Q.   You run very well without pace makers.   The Olympics, the World Championships, you've done well without it.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What is your motivation this year?   What is really in your heart?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   My aim is to at least break my fastest pace.  
   
 Q.   2:07?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yeah, 2:07.   But the conditions are unfavorable.   I hope for better conditions.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel better rested than last year because you didn't run the World Championships before hand?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   I feel more comfortable than last year.  
   
 Q.   Are you married?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Children?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.   Three kids.  
   
 Q.   How old?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   6, 3, and 1 1/2.  
   
 Q.   Boy, girl, how?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Two girls, one boy.   Girl, boy, girl.  
   
 Q.   What did you learn from your race last year in New York?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   I learned so many things.   First I learned the weather.   Also, it's up and downhill.   I'm aware about the course.  
   
 Q.   Difficult course or good course or both?   It could be a good course for some people, right?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   It's a different course for every person.   It may be a good course for some people.   May be difficult for others.   I call it a medium course, up and down.  
   
 Q.   But you train up and down, obviously.   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Which camp?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   I train from Eldoret.  
   
 Q.   And how often do you go home to Uganda?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Sometimes on the weekends.  
   
 Q.   How far is home from Eldoret?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   It's about a fiveâ€‘hour drive.  
   
 Q.   And you're very close to the Ugandan border?   
STEPHEN KIPROTICH:   Yes.
