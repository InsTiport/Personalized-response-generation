   JESSICA AUGUSTO: The Kenyan took off very early, so I was behind her for five or six minutes trying to catch up, but I couldn't.  
  
  Q. Do modern Portuguese runners still admire Carlos Lopez and Rosa Mota? Are they still there and are they figures?   
 JESSICA AUGUSTO: Yes, Rosa Mota and Carlos Lopez are eternally there. They go to all the races. They are quite present.  
  
  Q. Do they ever give advice?   
 JESSICA AUGUSTO: No, sometimes we meet at races, but, no.  
  
  Q. How do they train together? Do they work together every day?   
 JESSICA AUGUSTO: She used to live in my city, but now she moved and we don't practice as much together as we used to. Only whenever we can. Whenever we have a chance.  
  
  Q. Do you expect to run together in the beginning as long as possible?  
 ANA DULCE FELIX: I'm going to do my own running, she's going to do hers. Maybe we'll be able to stick together. But that will depend on the races.  
  
  Q. So kind of a silly question, but Jessica's boyfriend was an international goalkeeper for Portugal. Is she trying to talk him into running a marathon?   
 JESSICA AUGUSTO: No. No, he's too big and happy, and he doesn't like running sometimes on vacation, but he can only do it for 15, 20 minutes. He's probably almost 5'11", like 1.84 meters. He's tall.   
  
  Q. What have you done to prepare to finish this race?  
 ANA DULCE FELIX: This year it was just a bad day. And I didn't want to think that's going to happen again. I came to do my best, and everything's going as well as possible.  
  
  Q. The great Manuela Machado has run very well here in New York. Do you know her? Have you ever talked to her about this course?   
 ANA DULCE FELIX: Yes, I've been with her. I've talked to her about this race, and she told me it's a very tough competition, but she told me to be confident and not to be afraid. My coach is the same as Manuela Machado.
