 Q.   Have you done New York before?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   When I was racing, it was a different vision of New York.   It's nice that it's been here for some time, and it's a good quality.   It's kind of nice to be here.  
   
 Q.   What's your racing history?   Have you‑‑  
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   I raced a lot from the early '90s, I suppose.   I finished competitive racing in 2004, after the Athens pair Olympics, and I've been coaching ever since.   So I just wanted to come back and do New York because it's New York and experience it.   And a lot of athletes that I coach compete here.   So it's good for me to experience it and also make me a better coach as well.   
So I'm really happy to be here.  
   
 Q.   How many athletes do you have here?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   I have Madison De Rozario in the women's division.   She's the only one I'm coaching in the race here.   So, yeah, she's definitely going to be up there with the women.   I guarantee she'll win it one day.  
   
 Q.   Nice.   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   That's interesting.   So when did they add the chairs?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   I'd have to ask actually what year.   The last marathon I did was 2001, and that was Boston.   So it was definitely after that that they had New York.   So, yeah, there was never a wheelchair division.  
   
 Q.   Isn't it when you think back?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   Yeah, it was not that long ago.  
   
 Q.   That's the interesting thing.   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   It's kind of cool.  
   
 Q.   So where will you be‑‑ never mind.   You'll be out there.   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   I'll be out there somewhere.   Hopefully, I'll be racing with someone.   That's my goal to try to stay with some of the girls.   We'll see how we go.   I'm not training as much as I used to.   The reasons why I retired, the injuries and things like that.  
   
 Q.   What's your biggest race?   Do you have one?   Your biggest win?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   On the road, probably Boston.   I won the Boston Marathon four times.   I did it nine years in a row.  
   
 Q.   Nine in a row?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   I did nine and won four, not four in a row.   That was probably my biggest road race that I've won, like marathon.   Probably my whole career would be Sydney 2000, the Olympics and pair Olympics, obviously, being my home country and winning there.   So, yeah, winning gold.  
   
 Q.   Nice.   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   Definitely.  
   
 Q.   Where do you keep your medals?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   My Sydney medals, I have them in Sydney.  
   
 Q.   You don't have them displayed?   
LOUISE SAUVAGE:   In a box somewhere.   Too many people have them stolen now.   It's really sad.   I have them hidden away, unfortunately.   My mom has my medals from '92 and '96 Paralympics, and I have my ones from Sydney in 2004.
