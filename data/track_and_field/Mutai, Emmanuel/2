 Q. Have you changed anything in your preparation or changed anything in your approach to this race at all? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, for me, I don't change anything. The training I was doing was the same. 
 But I was training for New York and the competition. But the training for me was okay.

 Q. Is there any more pressure to run a fast time here than maybe there was, you know, two months ago? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, for me I don't have a time, just run my own best.

 Q. What would make a perfect race for you on Sunday besides a victory? How would you like tone vision it? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: On Sunday, I would like to run with the best. So for me, maybe I will just stay with the group.

 Q. Are you thinking that to make the Olympic trio that you'll have to not only win here but also run fast to win for that reason; do you think you can run fast in addition to win? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, I think in addition for the selecting thing will not determine how fast you run. So for me, I would like to compete for my goal in the marathon. So I will be driven for my run.

 Q. You don't have other plans? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No.

 Q. Emanuel, do you expect somebody to take the pace out hard and try to make it a fast race? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: Well, no, I don't know. I don't know what you think about on Sunday, but for me I don't know.

 Q. Will you take the pace out hard and try to make it a fast race? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No.

 Q. Are you going to use the same tactic you used in London making a break? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, New York is different from London. London is best time, but here --

 Q. You have to think differently? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: Because it's like a world championship.

 Q. Is there anything you remember from last year in your race against Gebre Gebremariam, where you think "I have to do that differently," and maybe you have to do something differently to a specific point on the course? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, not for now I don't. Last year I was looking for Haile, but this year, I don't know who. Maybe Gebre.

 Q. Who were they looking for last year? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: For Haile. But this time I don't know.

 Q. So you think people actually waited. They figured if Haile does it, we'll do it? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: Yeah, I don't know. Because you know, I don't know (Inaudible).

 Q. What do you consider the most important part of the New York City course for you? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: For me, the most important for me is after 25K. After that, in the race, 23 there are a lot of spectators, so that part of the race has many people.

 Q. How do you find the hills; are they a problem? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: Yeah, there are more tough. I went running and I don't have a problem with them.

 Q. They're not like the hills in Kenya? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No.

 Q. Do you think the American, Meb, has a chance to win? Do you know him? Have you raced against him? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: We raced I think last year. But I don't know. Last year was different, so I don't know how he's going to run. I cannot say anything about him.

 Q. So do you really pay that much attention to who else is in the race and how good you think they are? A lot of us would think that maybe the race is between you and Geoffrey and Gebremariam. Do you think about stuff like that or no? Like who the other contenders are? 
 EMMANUEL MUTAI: No, for me, I know everybody is thinking about that. But for me here, everybody's trying to do his own best. That's what I can say.
