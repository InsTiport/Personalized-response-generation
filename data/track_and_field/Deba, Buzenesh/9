 Q. After that article, people started to recognize you running through the park, running after the race. Just wondering if after the New York Times article if people had been able to recognize you? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Yeah, a lot of people. A lot of people cheering and calling my name.

 Q. Where exactly do you live in New York? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Bronx.

 Q. What street? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Kingsbridge.

 Q. Near the Kingsbridge Armory? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Yes.

 Q. Will you become an American citizen? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Maybe soon.

 Q. When might that be? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: If I get the chance, I'd like to. I'm not sure when.

 Q. Do you have a chance of making the Ethiopian Olympic team? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: If I run good.

 Q. Will you have to go back to the trials race? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: If I run a good time here, I can be selected from here. It's based primarily on time.

 Q. You've run a couple marathons this year, and quite a few last year. How are you feeling coming into Sunday? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: In the past I've run a lot of marathons in one year, and I've really run too much. 
 But this time I've limited it. So far I've only run two marathons, and this will be my third. So I'm very well prepared and I feel confident.

 Q. How special would it be for you to win in New York City where you live? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: It would feel extremely special. A lot of people believe that you really need to train at altitude. They think it would be very tough to live in New York and prepare in New York and compete here. So if I were to win, I'd be able to prove that it is possible to do that. To live here and train here and win.

 Q. Have you been training a lot? Where are you training in New York? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: In the Bronx, in Van Cortlandt Park, Rockville Park, Tarrytown, and Central Park. These are the places I train most of the time, especially in the Bronx.

 Q. You've run the New York the last two years. What have you learned about the course on Sunday? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Most years I didn't find the course difficult. Towards the end there is a little bit of a hill. But this time because I'm well prepared. 
 I don't think I'll find it too difficult. Those years I had run a lot of races beforehand.

 Q. So you'd say that being rested up will be the key difference for you this year? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Yes, but also in addition, the training I've done for New York, I've trained for longer, and I've done a little harder training.

 Q. If everything's perfect on Sunday, what kind of time are you looking for? I know it's hard. Just give us your best thought. 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: It's hard to say because there are a lot of athletes here who are very tough runners. But if it's a good competitive race, I think we'll all run a good time, not just myself, but all of us.

 Q. A personal best? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: Yes.

 Q. When was the last time you competed in a race? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: June 17 or 18th. The last marathon I ran was in San Diego in June. But the last race was a half marathon on September 18 in Philadelphia.

 Q. What was your time in Philadelphia? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: 1:09:55.

 Q. What brought you to the United States initially? Why did you want to live here? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: I like America, and I came here to run a race. But in addition I also had an injury that I needed to get treated.

 Q. What year was that? 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: August 2005.

 Q. Where was the race? 
 BUZENESH DEBA: Nashville.

 Q. So you liked it so much that you decide d to stay? 
 BUZENESH DEBA: Yes.

 Q. Nashville is a little different than New York. What brought you from Nashville to New York? 
 BUZENESH DEBA: Because of the injury, I didn't even run that race, I just went right straight into treatment.

 Q. Have you run for Ethiopia in a major national championship? 
 BUZENESH DEBA: Yes, in the World Cross Country Championships in 2004, I ran representing Ethiopia.

 Q. What sort of things would go into making the decision, if you have a decision to make on who you represent? What sort of factors would you consider? 
 BUZENESH DEBA: I'm not really sure. I can run for Ethiopia as it is right now. But at the same time, I run here, I train here. So if I get the chance to represent the United States, I would appreciate that too.

 Q. So you'd have to wait to become a citizen, then at that point you could make your mind up. 
 BUZUNESH DEBA: I have begun the process, but nothing has happened yet.
