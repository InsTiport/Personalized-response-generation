  Q. How do you feel now?   
 KIM SMITH: I feel okay, just tired.  
  
  Q. What is the best part of the race?   
 KIM SMITH: Probably through the park there are a lot of people cheering, so it's pretty cool, yeah.  
  
  Q. What were your thoughts when Mary took off there towards the beginning?   
 KIM SMITH: Yeah, it was a bit shocking to run that fast. I think I was the second mile I ran five minutes, so I don't know what they must have run.   
 I was just like, all right, they're coming down a little too fast for me, and they were 50 meters ahead at that point.  
  
  Q. So any surprises that she faded the way she did there?   
 KIM SMITH: I didn't know she faded.  
  
  Q. She faded about a mile, mile and a half to go?  
 KIM SMITH: What did she end up with?   
  
  Q. She ended up third. Firehiwot Dado won, and Deba got second.
