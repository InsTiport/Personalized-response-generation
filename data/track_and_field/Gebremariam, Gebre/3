Q.   Can you talk a little bit about some of your tactics in the 10,000 because in London you went to the lead, right, but you tried to slow things down.   Did you think that would be‑‑ obviously you thought that would be the best way to beat Mo?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   I was having a problem in my hip at the Olympics, and I got an injection.   That's why I can't go just freely.   I got with problems, so I talked to my brother, I talked to them already having a problem, but you have to beat them.   You have to go from this‑‑ we do the tactic different. 

Q.   Mo was real active with about 200 to go.   Where were you at that point? 
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Not only trying, but when we are in 23 laps and 24 laps, Mo, he's better than any other athletes there, so that's why we changed the tactics, too.   Because if we beat him in 20 laps, we can (Inaudible).   But if we had three laps, he can beat us because 51, 52 laps‑‑

Q.   So you wanted to separate from him?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah.   Yeah. 

Q.   You slowed down the pace at the Olympics, were you doing that for your own benefit, or was it a team tactic?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   No, just I'm telling them already, I can't push with them.

Q.   You mean you can't sprint the last lap?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Exactly.   I'm going to for the team.   We all won.

Q.   Did you slow down the pace for them or for yourself?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   No, it's not for myself.   I want to push for them, but I can't.   With my problem in the hip‑‑

Q.   You told them your hip was bothering you?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah, and I told them, and he has to push, and after 20 laps‑‑ after 18 laps he has to push and separate the group.

Q.   And you told him that before the race?   So in other words, you weren't trying to slow the pace up, you were just trying to tell them to take over?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Exactly, that they can push. 

Q.   Your fitness now as you are here, compare it with the year you won. 
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   I'm okay.   I'm training very well.

Q.   Listen, I have to ask you, what does okay mean?   I can't let you off the hook as we say in America. 
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah, I have the same way to express just like the last two years.   I have good speed‑‑

Q.   Your hard tempo runs are just as good?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah.

Q.   So you think you're in as good a shape?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   I hope so.

Q.   Well, do you think you are? 
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah, I think so. 

Q.   How much did the injury in London set you back for training for New York? 
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Well, I‑‑ when I finished the 10K in Boston‑‑ I mean, in London, I stopped two weeks from training, and I got healthy and I started my training for two months and two weeks ago, I start my training.

Q.   Were you able to do as much building up to this marathon as you have in the past?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Yeah, yeah.

Q.   So you had 10 weeks of good training?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   10 weeks.

Q.   And your hip was not bothering you?
    GEBRE GEBREMARIAM:   Not bothering me.
