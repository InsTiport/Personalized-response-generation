 Q. So what has your training been like in the past year since your win here? 
 DERARTU TULU: It's been good after I won here. In between I had a little bit of an interruption. After I ran here, I was second in Nagoya, and after that I ran a 10K in Manchester, and I found it a little too fast, so after that I interrupted training a little bit. But other than that, it's been good.

 Q. Were you surprised to win here last year in New York? 
 DERARTU TULU: Yes, very much, because I really didn't expect to win.

 Q. Especially before that, I remember it was the Philly Half Marathon last year that kind of inspired you even coming here. Before that race in Philly, did you really think you could really ever get back to that level? 
 DERARTU TULU: I did think that I could get back to that level of running, but I thought it would take much longer. But when I ran Philadelphia it gave me a glimpse of what could happen. But even without that I had planned to run here, but I did not expect to win.

 Q. Just take us through the timeline of when she had the children before, and then the other children. And how that really affected the training over those years? 
 DERARTU TULU: My kids ages are 4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16. And except for one of them who came to me at six years old, all of the others I started raising from infancy. But I don't raise them alone. My sister helps me, my mother helps me. We raise them as a family, even if I am the legal guardian. They all help me. 
 So things like cooking for them, taking care of their clothes, I don't have to be there all the time to do those things because they help me. So it hasn't really affected my training that much.

 Q. That was four who came at six years old? 
 DERARTU TULU: One came at six years old. The 14-year-old came to me at six. But all of the others I gave birth to or had since infancy.
