   BRANDI CHASTAIN: I think the example that I made today, I took 45,000 steps to finish, and I can show that to the young girls that are in my nonprofit back home and say, that seems almost insurmountable, but you can do it, so it's a good example for them. 

 Q. I missed the beginning. 
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Oh, this is the chance of a lifetime.

 Q. Did you think you were going to win?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: No, I knew I wasn't going to win, so I could throw that right out the window.

 Q. This is your first marathon?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Yes, sir.

 Q. How was it?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: It was more intense and more visceral and more exciting and overwhelming than I ever anticipated, and that is the crowd, that is the course, that is just -- even just getting to the race in the morning, you know, doing the media and going through that whole process, I mean, it is -- it's a long day. You have to really be prepared to take it on. 
 At one point on that mile 16 when you're on that -- I think it's mile 16 -- I've lost my ability to think clearly -- but when you're going up that bridge, it seems like forever, and it almost brought me to my knees, really. I've never had that feeling before. But I won; I finished. 

 Q. Were a lot of people recognizing you along the route, chanting or --
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Absolutely, and they did for everybody who had their name across their chest or on their shirt.

 Q. Did that give you a lift?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Yeah, but the tough thing about that is it's like a false sense of security, temporarily. Because it makes you feel so good that then you go on to the next where there's not that cheering, and all of a sudden you're like, okay, I'm back to where I was and what I'm feeling. It's an amazing race. I am astounded how the elite runners take this course on and run so quickly.

 Q. They don't play soccer. 
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: They don't, but still, it's quite impressive. I think now I have definitely a higher regard and respect for how they do it. 

 Q. I think Lance Armstrong did two. Do you want to do two? He trained more the second time, he said. 
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: You know, he's an endurance athlete.

 Q. How much training did you do?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Not enough probably. You know, you live and you learn. It's one of those great experiences.

 Q. Were you running with friends?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: I did. I ran with a sister of a friend of mine who I played college soccer with, and finally I told her, just go, do your thing, don't wait on me. 

 Q. What was her name?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Her name is Ann Cernicek. Married name, I have no idea.

 Q. How do you spell her name?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Cernicek.

 Q. How did Kerri do?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Kerri went just under four hours, awesome. She beat her goal, so I'm proud of her.

 Q. What was her goal?
 BRANDI CHASTAIN: Finish. I mean, I've never done this before. I had no idea what the hell was going to happen to me.
