 Q. What is the volume that you've been training? 
 MARA YAMAUCHI: I've been doing some 100 miles a week. In an ideal world I'd like to be doing 120 a week. I haven't increased.

 Q. You said your workouts have been going well, your specific workouts? 
 MARA YAMAUCHI: Yeah, yeah, I've been doing some really good specific sessions over total volume.

 Q. I was going to ask about London, because you did run 2:26; 2:26 here, that puts you in pretty good shape?
 MARA YAMAUCHI: Yeah, everyone was so disappointed. But I was not that disappointed. I mean coming 10th does sound quite bad, and I had come second in 2009, so everyone was like, oh, you're going to win because you came in second last year. 
 But after the travel we had and the injury, I was quite happy with 2:26.
