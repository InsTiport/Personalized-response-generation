Q.  When you got the stitch, how bad did that hold you back for a while, and were you worried you might be out of the race?

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  It's serious pain, but it's not to stop me a lot. 

Q.  Where was the pain?

Q.  Have you run marathons as large as this before?  Were you comfortable running in that large of a group?

Q.  Did the heat bother you at all?  Was it too hot?

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  The weather was good.  But it could be a little bit colder because I like colder weather.  But today wasn't shiny; it's very good for running. 

Q.  This is the first major marathon that you have won in terms of the top five, do you think this will put you on the map in the world?

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  Yes, New York is very important, very huge marathon and maybe I want to win Chicago and Boston and London.  (Laughing).

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  But a very fast race, if I want to set my personal best, maybe I will run Berlin. 

Q.  I think earlier in the week, talking about the prize money, you were mentioning you might be wanting to build a new house; is that right?  Will this go toward that?

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  Yes, that's true. 

Q.  You said after you won in Osaka that your goal was to win this marathon.  Why was this one in your mind?  Why did you set out to win here?

Q.  Did you see the New York City marathon growing up or anything?  You said it was your dream.  When did you first really know about it or how old were you when that dream started?

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  I ran the New York City marathon last year.  I was fifth, and I know New York City is a very tough course.  I like New York.  I was in New York three times.  It was my dream.  I decided, I don't know, I feel it, that I can do it.

JELENA PROKOPCUKA:  Yes.
