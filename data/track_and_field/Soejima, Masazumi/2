  Q. This is a big win for you in New York. Tell me about how you feel right now.   
 MASAZUMI SOEJIMA: I just wanted to win so bad this year. I promised to just go and go and go from the beginning.   
 Before I came here, I just promised the people in northern Japan that I was going to win, and I kept that promise.
