 Q.   Winning the New York Marathon, what would that mean to you again, winning the race?   
EDNA KIPLAGAT:   It would be important to me to show that I can run.   
This is going to be my fourth year running here.   So it would be perfect time for me to win.  
   
 Q.   Have you won New York before?   
EDNA KIPLAGAT:   Yes, I won it.  
   
 Q.   Of course.   Of course there will be wind on Sunday, but New York's about winning over the pace.   Hope all goes well.   
EDNA KIPLAGAT:   Thank you.
