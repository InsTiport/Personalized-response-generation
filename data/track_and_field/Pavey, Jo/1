  Q. Can you talk about your race a bit?   
 JO PAVEY: Yeah, yeah, I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was amazing. I found it tough but so pleased to be close to my PB because it's maybe a tougher course.   
 But the atmosphere was such a race. I loved it. It really kept me going.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised about any part of the race?   
 JO PAVEY: It was hilly, and I did feel the hills were tough. But it's so majorly exciting to go over the bridges. I loved it. It was a really exciting course.
