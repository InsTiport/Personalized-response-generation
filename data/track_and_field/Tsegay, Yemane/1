  YEMANE TSEGAY: 40 days before the race, I come to here. I have speed work training for the race because this race is hard up and down, not like a flat course. It's a hard and tough course. So I prepared like to get most important training for this race.  
   
 Q. Did you know before Beijing that you would also run New York City?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. Was it New York was‑‑ you knew that you would have both races?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. So you were running in World Championships knowing I still will run New York City later?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. So that mentality and your preparation was ready for two races, not one race? So you prepared for Beijing, World Championships. Normally, after Boston, how much rest?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Only World Championships.  
   
 Q. No, how much recovery?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: One month.  
   
 Q. So after World Championships, just two weeks?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, two weeks.  
   
 Q. So a little change?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, a little change.   
   
 Q. What is your hope here? Are you in full preparation? Your confidence is very good?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes, my confidence is very good.  
   
 Q. Do you think you can win?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, this race is very tough. Also, the other guys are very strong. They are on target for a win. Who wins? We don't know. We'll see who wins Sunday.  
   
 Q. So you're going to compete against Wilson. Is that something that you think about?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. Compete against Wilson Kipsang, is that something that keeps your mind busy?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, even Kipsang is strong. Also, the other people are also very strong. Stanley Biwott and Lelisa, World Champion in the 10K, also Jeffrey Kamworor. So not easy, very strong guy.  
   
 Q. Who do you train with at home?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Training partners with Lelisa Desisa. Also many strong people, we're doing training together.  
   
 Q. In Addis Ababa?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. Yemane, how often do you get on the track each week? Once or twice? To do speed work on the track.   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Per week, one time.  
   
 Q. National stadium?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: In the national stadium.  
   
 Q. Your workouts, when you're recording them, compared to what you did in Boston this year, are they faster, or are they slower?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Almost the same, but I think this time is a little bit fast.  
   
 Q. Faster now than you were in Boston?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. But you have never run New York City before? First time New York?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes, the first time.  
   
 Q. Have you talked to people about New York? Have you asked other athletes about New York? What do you know about the course?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, I know the course. I watch on TV every year. On the competition day. So I look at the race up and down, also very sometimes windy, sometimes cold. But I think this year will be nice. So I will try.  
   
 Q. Do you like to lead? Do you like to follow?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: For me, no problem. Together I do.  
   
 Q. However you feel?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I feel good.  
   
 Q. But some people like to be in first, be the leader of the race. Other people like to just wait and follow.   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yeah, I think I have my system, but the system I look at the condition type because sometimes it changes.  
   
 Q. Right, you never know.   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes. But I must do after maybe sometimes it's windy, full wind, not important in front. Because in the World Championships in Beijing, I was in front with the other people, but the guy come from behind and gets the win. So I get an important thing from the World Championships. I will look at that on Sunday.  
   
 Q. You learned a lesson?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. Is it important to you‑‑ No.2 in Boston, big race. No.2 in World Championships, big race. Is it important to be the winner?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I hope the history changes for Sunday maybe.  
   
 Q. Yemane, this is your first time in New York. Why did you decide to compete this year, or why did you not compete the previous years? Why New York this time?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I don't know. If it's me only, I just do training. But my agent or my manager decide which race is important or is good. I listen to my manager. So this year he says this race is very important. Also, I like the New York City Marathon or Boston or even Chicago. I like the big races in the world, like even including London.   
   
 Q. So how does it feel to be here? What is your impression of New York? Now that you're here, how do you like it here?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I like it very much.  
   
 Q. So who do you run for? Do you run for yourself, or is it for a different cause as a runner?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.  
   
 Q. Who do you run for? Is it for yourself, or is it for your family? Is it for your country? When you run, is there anything that keeps your mind busy?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: My mind is always with my friends.   
   
 Q. You ran the World Championships just ten weeks ago. That's not a very long recovery. How have you recovered since then?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: It's already good. No problem for me because even last year I was running, double marathon. After not even two months, I ran a good time in the wind. In Boston and New York also, I have got more for these races, almost two months, ten weeks.   
   
 Q. We noticed you ran a 2:06 and another 2:06. That was last year, right?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: 2014.  
   
 Q. Yeah, you ran Daegu and then Ottawa, both of them 2:06. And then Honolulu and then Boston. But do you feel like you're in better shape now? Of the three races‑‑ Boston, World Championship, New York‑‑ which is your best fitness and which is your worst fitness? Or is it similar?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Almost similar. Even better, a little bit. I was doing training and speed work, more sprints for this race. For New York, it's better for speed work.   
   
 Q. Do you like races with no rabbits? Do you like it when there's no pacemaker?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: No pacemaker for me, no problem.  
   
 Q. Which do you prefer, though? Do you prefer to have pacemaker? Or do you prefer‑‑ which is your favorite?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Without pacemaker is good. Because sometimes pacemakers, gives people a chance without pushing themselves. So without pacemaker is better.  
   
 Q. Meb says he's run 100,000 miles. How many have you run?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I think more than 19 marathons.  
   
 Q. Do you count how many miles you run?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Oh, more miles. Even only for New York Marathon, I think 1,100 miles after World Championships in training.  
   
 Q. Do you celebrate when you hit a milestone, like 10,000 or 20,000?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: I don't know.   
   
 Q. You've done 1,100 miles since worlds? Like 110 a week?   
    YEMANE TSEGAY: Yes.
