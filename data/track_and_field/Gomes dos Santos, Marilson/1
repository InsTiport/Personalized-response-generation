  MARILSON GOMES DOS SANTOS:   I want to have a good time here, inside for one of the first positions.   I feel better than last year.   My expectations are high because I want to improve my time, and consequently improve my final position. 

Q.   So there are not very many people who have run faster than one hour in a half marathon, and of course you are one of those people.   So when you look at the rest of the field knowing that you are as good or better than some of these others, does that give you extra confidence? 
MARILSON GOMES DOS SANTOS:   I think the highest confidence, what gives me the most confidence is having one the half marathon in less than one hour.   This boosted up my expectations and my will to improve my results when I run.   It makes me feel confident in doing 1:00 on this course that's not very easy at its first part. 

Q.   The New York City Marathon seems to be a good marathon course for you, but this half marathon is‑‑ you haven't done as well.   Is there a reason? 
MARILSON GOMES DOS SANTOS:   I think it's more in terms of time for training.   At times like this in other years I was more focused on running the real marathon, and I used the half marathon as part of my training and also a way of having an assessment. 

Q.   So how does that affect the way you decide‑‑ will you choose to run with the fastest group, or do you have a specific assessment time goal? 
MARILSON GOMES DOS SANTOS:   I'm going to try to run with the fastest group as much as I can.
