   ARATA FUJIWARA: The New York City Marathon was so famous and I have known since I was in junior high school. Of course the Olympics is such a huge place to try but for me, New York City Marathon is such a cool place to try. It's so international.   
 I already run this cool New York City Marathon. Also, it really heats up the fever of the Olympics. Compared to the Olympics it's such a fever, such a heat and dynamic, but New York City Marathon is such a cool, very stylish in a way. That's why I wanted to try.   
 In Japan, the Olympics, it's almost like a crazy fever, obsession. But in the New York City Marathon, it's more I choose to run. As a runner, as a person, I really look forward to doing it.
