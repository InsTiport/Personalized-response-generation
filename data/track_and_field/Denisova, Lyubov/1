Q.  You seemed to run behind the lead run.  At first it was very close all the way.  Was that a tactic?  It looked very smart, because you weren't running with any air resistance.

LYUBOV DENISOVA: Yes, that was the tactic.

Q.  Are you surprised you finished so well?

LYUBOV DENISOVA: I am not surprised really.  I trained well and I wanted to be among one of the first third, and I got it.  I don't think  -- I didn't think I could win, but I was pretty sure that I will be second or third.  I think I will have a possibility to win. 

Q.  Can you compare today's performance with your L.A.  victory?

LYUBOV DENISOVA: The field was much deeper here and actually I am more satisfied with my performance here today than with my victory in L.A.  There wasn't really much of a field in L.A..

Q.  When it was down to you and Joyce, at what point did you think that it was really getting away from you and what did you see happen that made you think it was going to be Joyce's race?

LYUBOV DENISOVA: Essentially, it happened during the last three miles.  I knew that she is stronger, she is much stronger than me.  Also I had some problems with my liver, otherwise I probably would have fought more.

Q.  Her what?

LYUBOV DENISOVA:  Liver.  It might be somehow related to the diet I have.

Q.  Is that like a stitch; a pain in the side?

LYUBOV DENISOVA: It was somewhat painful. 

Q.  Have you experienced this problem before?

LYUBOV DENISOVA:  In terms of diet, it's three-day protein diet and then beginning from Thursday, it's mostly carbohydrates, which made me somewhat load for the liver.  Also possible, that at the yesterday pasta party, I had too much pasta.
