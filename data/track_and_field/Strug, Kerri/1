 Q. How fast did you run?
 KERRI STRUG: I think I was a couple minutes under four hours, and that was my goal. I lost my cousin at mile 14 with a hamstring, my second cousin, who was supposed to pace me for the race. So I ran by myself again.

 Q. Male or female?
 KERRI STRUG: Male. His name is Mark Strug.

 Q. His hamstring went out?
 KERRI STRUG: Yeah, so he said, go ahead, do your own thing. 

 Q. How did it go for you overall?
 KERRI STRUG: Great. I was hoping to come around four hours, and that's exactly what I did, a couple minutes under. We started later than 11:00 o'clock, and I finished like 3:59 or something, but then take away five minutes.

 Q. Do you feel good after a marathon? Was this your fifth?
 KERRI STRUG: Yeah, this was my fifth. I don't feel fabulous, but I'm not the type that's going to completely like kill myself so I can't do anything for a week. I've got to go to work tomorrow. I'm on a train this evening, and I'll be back in the gym like two days from now, like the elliptical thing. I don't think I'm going to be running long distances for a couple weeks. 
 I always do well until about 17, 18, and then I get tired. 

 Q. Where do you work?
 KERRI STRUG: I work at the Department of Justice in the Office of Juvenile Justice.

 Q. In Washington?
 KERRI STRUG: Yes, D.C., and I audit programs that receive funding.
