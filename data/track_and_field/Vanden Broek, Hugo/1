  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the problems with the planes.   
    HILDA KIBET :   There was this problem with the planes.   We don't know what to do.   The flight was canceled.   
   
 Q.   From where?   
    HILDA KIBET :   Amsterdam to Newark.   Hugo had to call our agent.   What you call it, like travel agent?   
   
 Q.   They fixed everything?   
    HILDA KIBET :   No (laughter).   They couldn't.   
    They told us to wait and wait.   Finally we went to the airport.   They got us on a direct flight yesterday.   
    HUGO vanden BROEK:   I called KLM, but they got us on another flight, very expensive business class seats.   I was ready to play because we wanted to come.   It was better to pay a few thousand dollars.   
    But we were lucky.   I explained a few things.   This is one of the top athletes.   KLM, Dutch company, of course they would like the best Dutch runner to be there and comfortable.   
    They did their best and got us on the flight.   
   
 Q.   To Newark or JFK?   
    HUGO vanden BROEK:   JFK.   
   
 Q.   What is your relationship?   Coach, married?   
    HUGO vanden BROEK:   Married.   I'm an athlete myself.   We met each other 12 years ago in Kenya.   At that time I was a runner and she was not.   She was just trying to get a scholarship for an American university.   I'm sorry, I'm taking over.   
   
 Q.   It's part of the story.   
    HUGO vanden BROEK:   Then she got a scholarship actually.   But I was working a partâ€‘time job and running marathons.   She came, studied physiotherapy, got her degree.   
   
 Q.   What school?   
    HILDA KIBET :   It's in Amsterdam.   
    HUGO vanden BROEK:   Has a different name in The Netherlands.   In America you have university, you can go for bachelor and masters.   In Netherlands you go for Masters, then you go for something after afterwards.   There's no literal translation.   Amsterdam University is something else.   In America you would call this the University of Amsterdam.   
   
 Q.   When did you graduate?   
    HILDA KIBET :   2004, July.   That's when I found out that I can run.   
   
 Q.   How did you find out?   What was the test or how did you know?   
    HILDA KIBET :   You know, when I finished school in Kenya, I started running.
