 Q.   Are you ready for a good race on Sunday?   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   And you know this race course, you know New York.   The weather will affect you, I think.   It's going to be pretty cold tomorrow.   Does that bother you, the cold weather?   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Well, that's God's will.   There's nothing we can do about that.  
   
 Q.   It's cold for everybody.   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Yes, it is for everybody.  
   
 Q.   If things go well, do you have a time that you are shooting for, a time that you are trying to do on Sunday.   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   It's going to be a tough race, and they'll have some very tough athletes.   How I'm going to do is really hard to predict.  
   
 Q.   You have Mary and Edna and Buzunesh, your friend.   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Hi, I apologize if you've been asked about this 50 times:   How did you hear about the news with Rita Jeptoo and any comment you have on that or antiâ€‘doping.   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Sorry, I just heard the news.   I am not sure about what happened.   I have no comment.  
   
 Q.   In general, do you feel like that athletes in your sport are clean, or is it a problem?   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   It's very hard to say.   She's a very tough athlete.   She's good at what she does.   Maybe it's not even true.  
   
 Q.   What are your personal goals for this marathon?   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   As for me, by the grace of God, I would like to be an excellent athlete.   That's my goal.   
   
 Q.   You've known Buzunesh for a long time.   She moved to New York at a very young age.   A very big change for her.   How does that describe her as a person that she was able to make a change like that and be so successful making a big change like that at a young age.   
FIREHIWOT DADO:   Even when we were in Ethiopia before, she was a very good athlete.   Even when we lived in that area, she was a strong person.   
I'm happy every time I see her.   She was a very good athlete back home.   And after she lived here, after a little break, she continued to do very well, and I'm happy for her.
