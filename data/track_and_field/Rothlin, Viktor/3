  Q. When you're running the race, do you like to stay in the front of the pack, what is your strategy?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: I don't have a typical strategy. You have to feel or you have to see in the race what will be the perfect way to run to be successful. So I'm not a front-runner or a pack-runner. I decide in the moment when I see the race.   
 For example, when Haile will break the course record, I will not try to follow him. It's too fast for me, so I will stay behind. But if nobody does something for the race, maybe I'm still in front, so we will see.   
 There is not only one way for me, there are different ways, and I hope I choose to the right one in the race.   
  
  Q. What did you do in high school, secondary school? How fast were you? 5K, 10K or something?  
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: I'm not very good in this times in my memory.   
  
  Q. At 17, 18?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: At 18, 19, let's say 19, I ran the 10K under 30 minutes.   
  
  Q. 10K under 30?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: Yeah, 29:49 was my speed. And 5K in 14:33  
  
  Q. Was that at altitude or where was that?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: No.   
  
  Q. Do you like to come from behind and run at even pace?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: It depends. In Osaka, for example, the World Championships where I won the bronze medal, I was 40 kilometers position six, and I went to the finish line position three, but I came from behind.   
 In Barcelona, I was leading after 28K until the finish line. So it depends how the race will be and I don't have one way to go. I have different ways to go, and I try to choose the right one.   
  
  Q. European Championships you came from behind?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: No. I was leading.   
  
  Q. You were out in the lead from where?   
 VIKTOR ROTHLIN: I was in the leading pack the whole ways, but I ran away close before 28K mark.
