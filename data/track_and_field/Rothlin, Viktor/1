  Q. You spoke earlier in the week about hanging behind the leaders and trying to pick some people off later; how did that work out for you late today?   
 VIKTOR RÃTHLIN: It was really tough. Started off not that fast, and I started to gamble. I had really to decide to do my own race. On the last part of the race, I fell, but those guys are unbelievable. I got even beat by the U.S. runner. He did a great job. I tried to follow him, but it seems to be that I'm getting older.   
 Anyway, I'm not in Top 10, but 11, and so I'm happy on the finish line.  
  
  Q. Have you ever seen a race start so slowly and get so fast towards the end there?   
 VIKTOR RÃTHLIN: I told them it will be the fastest ever New York City Marathon, because this new generation is really crazy. It's hard for runners like me, 37 years old, to see that you have to compete against 20, 21-year-old guys. Yeah, that's a new generation. For us, it's hard to win something, but at least I'm still there, and I'm happy and glad to come through Central Park.
