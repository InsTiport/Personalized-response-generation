Q.  You were with the leaders for much of the race, then you went and fell back.  What happened?

LUDMILA PETROVA: I had cramps in my legs.

Q.  Did they go away when you came back?

LUDMILA PETROVA: No, I pretty much had them for the rest of the race, so I couldn't go any faster.  As soon as I tried to increase my pace, they came back.

Q.  Leg cramps.  Do you think the cold weather had anything to do with that?  How were the conditions for you?

LUDMILA PETROVA: I don't think it's related to the cold weather.  Actually I more often get it during the hot weather, but probably it has something to do with my body, something must have been missing.  Maybe calcium. 

Q.  Did you like the women's only race?

LUDMILA PETROVA: Yes, I liked it. 

Q.  Why?

LUDMILA PETROVA: Nobody is in the way, all the freedom.

Q.  How did the tactics change because it was a pack of women only?

LUDMILA PETROVA: In fact not much change in tactics because of the pacemaker, pacesetter.

Q.  Talk a little bit about the Kenyan dominance of the sport?  It seems to still to be continuing?

LUDMILA PETROVA: There is not much to comment on.  They are strong.  But they can be beat and it is was proven in London.

Q.  How much does Ludmila know about Denisova?

LUDMILA PETROVA: She's my friend.  She's my close friend.  She is a very good person.  We don't train together.  When I come to Moscow -- she is from Moscow, when I come to Moscow, I often stay at her place and from time to time we just jog together, run together.  We don't train together.

Q.  Are you surprised she ran so well?

LUDMILA PETROVA: I am not surprised at all.  She is good.  Even in their first marathon, a person can show very good time.

Q.  Was that her first marathon?

LUDMILA PETROVA: It was her first.

Q.  Between London and here, Ludmila went to do altitude training for the first time.  How did that affect her?

LUDMILA PETROVA: It was an experiment for me.  This was the first time I did altitude training, and from the first impression it didn't work out well.  I probably won't do it again.  (Laughter).
