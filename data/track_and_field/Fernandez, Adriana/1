ADRIANA FERNANDEZ:   The second part of the race I started feeling a little poorly, and obviously, I couldn't keep up.

ADRIANA FERNANDEZ:   I don't like to quit, so I'd rather finish the race rather than quit. 


Q.  How were you feeling poorly?  Were you feeling sick, injured, tired? 

ADRIANA FERNANDEZ:   I felt a little tired towards the second part of the race.

ADRIANA FERNANDEZ:   I'm quite used to running in a lot of wind. 


Q.  How much did running in Sydney six weeks ago, did you still feel the fatigue from that race at the Olympics? 

ADRIANA FERNANDEZ:   Honestly, I have never run a marathon so quickly after another one, and yes, I think it affected me and I felt a little tired towards the second part of the race.
