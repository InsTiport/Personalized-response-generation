Q. Just clarify that part, do you have dual citizenship now?

GILLIAN HOROVITZ: I am English but I live here.

Q. Are you British through and through or are you American through and through?

GILLIAN HOROVITZ: I am the U.S.A. T. F. Masters Champion because they recognize green
card holders as being allowed to hold a U.S.A.T.F. Championship. But if I am running
internationally I run England. I have applied naturalization but it is going to take a
while.

Q. Can we ask the same question of Arsenio, you are Mexican born; are you a U.S.
citizen?

ARSENIO ORTIZ: I am not a citizen of America.

Q. How long have you been living in Astoria or Ozone Park Manhattan?

ARSENIO ORTIZ: 1994.

Q. Were you pleased with your race? Are you as happy as John Kagwe was a moment ago?

ARSENIO ORTIZ: Yes, I am very happy today.

Q. In England do you have a trial system for the Olympic marathon?

GILLIAN HOROVITZ: Say it bit different. I think they use really the London Marathon
generally and then they have it is not as clear-cut as over here. You have to get the
qualifying time.

Q. Might you qualify for the U.K. teams?

GILLIAN HOROVITZ: My best is only 2:36 and I think you have to do 2:33 to qualify for
the Olympics so it means I have to improve my best by almost 4 minutes. So --

Q. How many New York City Marathons have you run, Arsenio?

ARSENIO ORTIZ: Today is five.

Q. This is your highest finish in a New York City Marathon?

ARSENIO ORTIZ: Yes, this is my best time today.

Q. Gillian, you ran a marathon a month ago. You are not tired?

GILLIAN HOROVITZ: No.

Q. There is a little bit of a buzz back here. He was supposed to have been the first
U.S. finisher and there is some question now if he is not American then that makes him not
the first U.S. finisher; isn't that not correct? He is not an American national; isn't
that correct?

MODERATOR: Who, Arsenio, he is not an American national but I am not you know, that is
a very confusing issue, isn't it? Is it confusing for you? 

Q. I am not confused. I am just assuming that he was brought up because he was the
first U.S. finisher or because he is the first local?

MODERATOR: First U.S. finisher as we were told.

Q. It now seems maybe that is not the case; correct?

MODERATOR: He is the same as Gillian; he was a green card. Thank you.
