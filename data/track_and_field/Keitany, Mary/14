   GABRIEL TORRES: Yes, we have a group of ladies, but we use four men because, as you know very well, the level of Mary Keitany and the cardio's different. So train together 90% the same program. 
 We have a group that creates motivation. Everything is specific for her, because running is an individual sport. When you speak about the group it doesn't make sense. But it's good for internal motivation because they're both challenging each other, sharing the experience. Especially people like Selena. 

 Q. It's very rare at your level to do something new and to go the distance. I'm curious what distance, what is the farthest you've run continuously before? 
 MARY KEITANY: In competition? 

 Q. No, just at all?
 MARY KEITANY: 20 kilometers.

 Q. So you will be going into a little bit new territory to go to 42. So are you excited or anxious? 
 MARY KEITANY: I'm excited.

 Q. How many days have you been down from altitude now? 
 MARY KEITANY: Twelve. For a Kenyan born in Kenya, altitude is a factor. Can you see a European or American going to run. So for them it is more important for the jet lag. Altitude is not a problem when you're from Kenya.
