FRANCA FIACCONI:   She paced herself today because the other girls didn't pace.  At the second half, I had some problems due to my personal female problems, having my period, in the end, I felt a little bit better, but I couldn't see Ludmila, so I wasn't able to see if I could catch her.  In the last two miles, I was able to gain on her about 20 seconds, but I wasn't able to catch her. 
 

Q.  I was wondering if you thought it helped to have someone pacing and if you thought it gave any extra advantage to Petrova because he was Russian? 
 
FRANCA FIACCONI:   The first eight miles, she pulled -- in the race, and then the pace maker came so she thinks that  -- from eight miles until, I think 18 miles, the pace maker did a very good job.  
 

Q.  Do you think that it gave any extra advantage to Petrova because he was Russian, or do you think it was fair to everybody? 
 
FRANCA FIACCONI:   This is very difficult to say, but it is like the race went, so it is difficult to say if it was an extra advantage for her.  
 

Q.  What are some of the other races that you are going to have? 
 
FRANCA FIACCONI:   For this year, I already had four marathons, so for this year I am very happy.  I feel that this race is very good, but if I feel fine, fine, but if I have any other races to do, okay.  In one month, if I feel like running one more, we can see.
