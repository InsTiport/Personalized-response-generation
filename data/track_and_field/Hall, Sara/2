Q.   How's it going? 
SARA HALL:   Good.   Just getting in shape, both of us, I think.   Just starting out.

Q.   How is your body feeling now? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Much better.   Much better, yes.

Q.   Ready to go? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Yes.

Q.   Already gearing towards 2014? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Yes.   It's the first race of the season, so I just want to get a mark and see where I am.

Q.   Well, you're well rested.   Are you fit? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Yes.

Q.   What are you both predicting for your performances? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Just a competitive performance. 
SARA HALL:   I think it's too early to know.   I don't think any of us have done 5K workouts yet.   We look to our trainer to dictate that.

Q.   Have you run through Central Park? 
SARA HALL:   We both ran the race two years ago.

Q.   What were your impressions? 
SARA HALL:   It was uphill a lot of it.   This last part is obviously challenging, but I thought it was fun. 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Yes.

Q.   Do people tend to go off a little bit too quick? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   No, I don't think it was too quick. 
SARA HALL:   No.   I think no one's in shape enough really to run crazy. 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   It's not London.

Q.   Is it because it's not back into the track season or anything like that?   You both had a break? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Well, I didn't have a season.   So I'm going to start. 
SARA HALL:   I think this is most people's first race.

Q.   Who would you pick if it wasn't yourselves? 
SARA HALL:   What do you mean?   For the win?

Q.   Who else? 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   They put together a lot of competitors. 
SARA HALL:   We have really good girls.   We have the American record holder here.

Q.   Can it go sub15 here? 
SARA HALL:   I don't think.

Q.   So like a 15:10, 15:20, something like that? 
SARA HALL:   That would be pretty fast for this course.

Q.   Do you have races planned for next year, Steeples? 
SARA HALL:   I want to do indoor, but I'm looking to do my first competitive half marathon in December, so I'm looking at that.   I might do like a fall marathon depending on how the half goes.   So we'll see.   I know it's an off year from track.   So it could be a good time to train for a marathon.

Q.   You ran some great mile races in New York.   Those were some classic races. 
SARA HALL:   I miss the Garden.

Q.   We all do. 
SARA HALL:   Is the U.S. Open there again?

Q.   That was a oneâ€‘time shot.   That was two years ago.   So there's nothing in the Garden anymore. 
SARA HALL:   I love that place.   The Armory is great, but it's different.

Q.   I bet you're glad to be coming back and racing again. 
SALLY KIPYEGO:   Yes.   It's very exciting to be back.
