  SARA HALL:   I'm someone I don't like to just sit in front of the TV like in between runs.   It's good.   I don't have much time for it, but one day.

Q.   When you retire, whenever that will be. 
SARA HALL:   Right now I will volunteer run, but we could take on a staff person or something.   So that would help.

Q.   Anything coming up with the foundation here in New York?   Any big events? 
SARA HALL:   Nothing planned.   Just we have some runners running the marathon for our fundâ€‘raising event.   Really we're just kind of grass roots right now, engaging people that are excited about making a difference with us.

Q.   It takes time, but you'll get to a point, and all of a sudden it's accelerating. 
SARA HALL:   Yeah, you look at Livestrong, and he had the perfect storm of the tours and Nike behind him and all of that.   Who knows what could happen with this?   We have the infrastructure where it could take off.   You never know.

Q.   You know you guys are doing great stuff.   Perhaps your sponsors, like Nike backed Livestrong, Lance was a client of Nike's.   I think you're with Asics? 
SARA HALL:   Yes.

Q.   And Ryan is with? 
SARA HALL:   Asics.

Q.   So perhaps you'll want to continue with Asics, once you stop competing, they can get behind the foundation? 
SARA HALL:   They've been supportive before.   We're hoping to do more with them in the future.

Q.   That would keep you attached to Asics and keep Asics attached to you and Ryan? 
SARA HALL:   I hope so.

Q.   You guys are all over the country and all over the media. 
SARA HALL:   It's been a fun ride.
