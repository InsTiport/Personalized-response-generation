Q.  Can you tell us why you had to drop out of Chicago and when you decided to run New York instead? 

MARGARET OKAYO:   After Chicago I was sick on Saturday night.  So I decided to run this one because I was sick.  I wanted to try another one but they told me that if I recover you can go to New York.  So I stayed for five days and then I wanted to try to do New York.


Q.  How far did you run in Chicago before you had to drop out?

THE MODERATOR: It was ten miles. 


Q.  And they took you to the hospital after Chicago? 

MARGARET OKAYO:   Yeah.  I sleep there one night. 


Q.  Dehydration from being sick? 

MARGARET OKAYO:   Yeah. 


Q.  You seemed to focus early in the race on Tegla, staying with her.  Was that part of your plan, to stay with her and in hindsight do you feel that was a mistake?

MARGARET OKAYO:   No, it was just trying to stay with my pace.  I was not trying to go with Tegla. 


Q.  This was a very fast race today, the top five women were all very fast.  What do you think caused that?  Was it very competitive at the end, a lot of people coming up from behind?  You came up from behind and passed a few people.

MARGARET OKAYO:   Yeah. 


Q.  Because you were all running so close together, did it make it all that much more competitive at the end? 

MARGARET OKAYO:   Yes, but the problem was a lot of wind. 


Q.  Do you think if you would have gone faster earlier you would have  -- the result would have been different or was this the best that you could do today?

MARGARET OKAYO:   For me this is my best today.
