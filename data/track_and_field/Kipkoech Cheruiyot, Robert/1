   THE MODERATOR: Our second place finisher Robert Cheruiyot. Robert, just a couple of thoughts about your race and maybe even a comment about Meb's victory today and what that might do for the sport of marathoning with an American winner at a major marathon again?   
 ROBERT KIPKOECH CHERUIYOT: Meb is a strong guy. He knows -- he's a very strong guy, and you know, as I told you before that the Americans are like everybody. It's not like before. They are now very strong. So I knew that Meb and all the Americans out there, they are strong.   
 THE MODERATOR: Meb made a move at about 24 miles. Can you talk about the move? You tried to follow it. Was he just too strong at that point? Were you a little hurting at that point?   
 ROBERT KIPKOECH CHERUIYOT: No, luckily everybody. Whenever somebody wants to decide we have to move, luckily I'm not (inaudible) on that.  
  
  Q. After Boston where you had some problems with your stomach. You got them sorted out. As a Kenyan you had to give up tea, but you were able to race strong at the World Championships just a few months ago to get number 5, and to come back here and run strong again, can you tell us how you've regained your strength?   
 ROBERT KIPKOECH CHERUIYOT: Since last year, you know, I had a very strong injury, and that is why also -- that's why also, you know, when I was starting training for Boston, it was difficult because I trained very -- few months, so I had the stomach, there was a big problem. And, you know one thing about New York is different. But I like today what I did. I'm very happy about it.   
 THE MODERATOR: We thank Robert for his first time and his performance today. Thank you, Robert.
