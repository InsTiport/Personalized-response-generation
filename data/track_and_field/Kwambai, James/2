 Q. Because you run so fast, does that give you confidence here in New York even though it's a hilly course? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: I have a lot of confidence from my run in Berlin. So I want to be the same as what I did.

 Q. Can you be the same five weeks later? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: We will see.

 Q. You mentioned you want to push early in the race, you don't want to be at the end. Is there any part of the race course that you would push if it's still a big group? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: It all depends on how the pace is.

 Q. You don't want it to go too slow, right? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: No, I don't want it to be very, very slow.

 Q. Is there a place in this course where if there are still people together at 20 miles, will you push? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: Maybe at 20 miles.

 Q. Last year you came here as a favorite to win. This year, do you think you are a favorite to win? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: I think of course (smiling). I hope that it happens this week.

 Q. You have run so fast and you have run so well, but you have not yet won a major marathon. Do you get tired of people calling you the fastest loser? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: I will not be tired, because I still want to win a major marathon. I will not be tired, I want to fight.

 Q. Is it that important to you to win that major marathon? 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: It's very important, very important.

 Q. Being fast is important, but winning is important. 
 JAMES KWAMBAI: Let's just say it's very important to win.
