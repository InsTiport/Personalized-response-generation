 WERKNESH KIDANE: I consulted with my manager, and we consulted with each other, and we decided for me to run in New York.

 Q. Why did you make the decision so late? What were you waiting to know? 
 WERKNESH KIDANE: We are looking at other options, and finally we decided at the last moment to come to New York.

 Q. Where were you last year when Gebre won New York? Where were you and what was your reaction when you found out he won? 
 WERKNESH KIDANE: I was in Ethiopia in Addis Ababa watching the race. When he won it was unbelievable. 
 We were just so happy and just words cannot say how I felt.

 Q. Was it on television live? 
 WERKNESH KIDANE: Yes, we were watching live.

 Q. Did that inspire you to start thinking about you running here? 
 WERKNESH KIDANE: Last year I was preparing to run here in New York, so I always had the intention to run New York.

 Q. You ran a very good race in Boston this spring. What did you learn from that race that might help you here, things that you didn't know before about the marathon distance?
