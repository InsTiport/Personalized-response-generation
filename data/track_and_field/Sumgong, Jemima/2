Q.   Just initial thoughts being in New York this fall, running in this marathon. 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   It's my first time to be here.

Q.   When did you get here? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   I came here on Wednesday.

Q.   Had you been to New York before? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   No, it's my first time.   So beautiful.   I like.

Q.   What are your impressions of the New York Marathon?   What do you know of it?   You obviously know it but‑‑
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   In marathon, for sure I know it's a big marathon.   That's what I know.   It's the biggest and the largest marathon in the world.   About the marathon, I don't know, but I know it's the largest.

Q.   The course specifically, do you have anything? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   The course, for sure I don't know about the course.

Q.   Do you have a strategy of sorts? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   About Sunday's race?

Q.   Yeah, like in terms of your splits.   Do you have a time in mind? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   I can't predict about the time for marathon Sunday because New York, I heard it's 2:22 for a course record.   So it's unpredictable.   We can't predict about the time.

Q.   What are your expectations? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   My expectations is high.   I'm trying to run so that I can be in top three.

Q.   You're hoping for a podium finish? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   Yeah, I hope so.

Q.   Would anything less than that be a disappointment, having never run here before? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   No.

Q.   Those are high expectations? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   It's high expectations to run on Sunday, sure.

Q.   Can you talk a little bit about sort of what your strategy is as far as are you going to kind of go out at your own pace, or are you going to see what others are doing?   Kind of like are you going to be more tactical? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   On Sunday?

Q.   Did you hear the news about Rita Jeptoo this morning?   Is?
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   No, I don't know.

Q.   You hadn't heard, or you just don't want to talk about it? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   Pardon?

Q.   Rita Jeptoo, did you hear the news this morning? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   No.

Q.   So you haven't heard anything about her positive test? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   No.

Q.   You just don't want to talk about it? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   Sorry.

Q.   Just getting back to Sunday, can you talk a little bit about how your training has gone and how you feel about heading up to Sunday. 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   About my training, it was okay.   I was going to go to Chicago, but after some time I felt my muscle, I had a problem in my muscle, and I talk to my manager to maybe to look for other race. 
I told him to ask for New York Marathon.   It's a pleasure to come here.   The thing which forced me to come here was a muscle, which my training was stopped.   But after some time, I picked up.

Q.   So you're feeling healthy now? 
JEMIMA SUMGONG:   Yeah, I'm healthy now.
