 Limestone   9
      Le Moyne - 6 
  
    THE MODERATOR:   We're joined by Le Moyne coach Dan Sheehan and student‑athletes Kevin Kelly, Alex O'Brien and Matt Taylor.   Coach, an opening statement.  
    COACH SHEEHAN:   I guess first congrats to Limestone.   One heck of a team.   Both ends of the field.   Second, it's an honor and a privilege to have the opportunity to be here today.   To sit at the front of the bus with these guys ‑‑ and anything in life that's worth a damn, it's not supposed to be‑‑ and we've got a locker room full of guys that put their heart and soul into every single day.   
    So probably just, not to compare other teams, but this is up there, if not the highest, it's the best locker room that I've had in 18 years.   Example, goalie controversy, three guys battling it out, and it's funny because they're probably three best friends; it's a different example of a locker room, so...   
   
 Q.   Could you address the number of face‑offs they won.   
    UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   No, I don't think so.   I think it just came down to we didn't make a play, get the ball back to offense.   (Indiscernible).  
   
 Q.   Alex, on the shot selection, in the center of the field?  
    ALEX KRAWEC:   Obviously I don't think we wanted them to contain the field as much as they did.   We wanted to keep (indiscernible).   They did a good job getting into the middle of the field, getting open shots.   
   
 Q.   Matt and Kevin, dealing with limited possessions and trying to maximize the opportunities?  
    MATT TAYLOR:   They did a good job on face‑offs, can't take anything away from them there.   I just think that there were some possessions that I know personally I wish (indiscernible).  
    KEVIN KELLY:   We played well offensively for the most part.   We just didn't get as many chances with the face‑offs, so hats off to them.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach.  
   
 Q.   On holding them to nine goals.   
    COACH SHEEHAN:   We actually probably one of our higher priorities was we just wanted to go 40percent at the X.   We were there up until probably the last ten minutes.   We really wanted to limit easy goals.   And I think we did that.   You guys already mentioned their ability to get to the middle of the field.  
    We've got a couple of kids that didn't have an opportunity to cross the white line today.   Alex Zytko and Ryan Suddaby, those guys gave us an absolutely fantastic look this week when it came to scout team.   But we don't have a single guy on our roster from north of the border.   The game is played a little bit different.   
    And when you‑‑ we had great hand recognition, but when you're that big and strong and have the ability to hold onto the ball and jump between double teams and switches, no doubt about it they're a handful to cover.  
   
 Q.   (Question off mic).  
    COACH SHEEHAN:   That little run was a hell of a pass off with Messenger streaking down the side.   That was a hell of a play.   As pretty as any play that happened yesterday, I'll tell you that.   
    And it's a game of runs and we made one.   Made it maybe a little too soon.   And I don't think the heat or conditioning or anything, no more than the other sideline.   They're a hell of a team.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the legacy and how good the locker room was this year.   
    COACH SHEEHAN:   It's great when you get a guy like Matty Taylor that spends time at Cornell, goes out into the real world, and to have an opportunity to watch a 24‑year‑old turn the switch back to 18, you know, it's stuff like that puts a smile on my face.   
    Yeah, it's a really good group.   I thought with the talent that we had, I thought this group achieved quite a bit.   And then obviously once you get here, one team is going to be doing that, the other's not.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
