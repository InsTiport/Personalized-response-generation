THE MODERATOR:   To my right we have Coach Danowski, and Justin Turri, and CJ Costabile.   We'll lead off with an opening statement from head coach and then we'll take questions from the student‑athletes.   
COACH DANOWSKI:   We'd like to congratulate the University of Maryland, Coach Tillman, Coach Warne, Coach Phipps, Coach Moran, their players and their staff on a terrific performance.   They were certainly up to the task today, and I thought they were terrific in many phases of the game.   
I think we were disappointed.   If I have time to look back, I'm just so emotional and so close to the game, I don't know if we played as well as we think we're capable, but that may have been due to the University of Maryland and how well they played.   We know that by maybe looking at the film.   
I'm very proud of my guys.   Very proud of the way they fought, you know, tried to give it a run.   
We said during the timeout, we may give up 20 goals there in the fourth quarter, but we're going to play there to win in the end.   But congratulations to Maryland.  
   
 Q.   Coach, nice run that you put together at the end of the third quarter, and Rob got one early in the fourth, then it just seemed to get away from you guys at that point.   Can you explain what happened in the fourth quarter?   
COACH DANOWSKI:   I really can't explain it.   I was there too, and they made plays.   The Maryland kids were sharp.   They shot very well, and put the ball on each other's sticks.   I thought they were much more confident than we were.   I thought it was very different, and we know that.   The Maryland kids come in and they're tough and rugged young men and very confident.   I thought our guys backed down at times and were not as confident as they've been.   But, again, perhaps it was due to how well Maryland was playing.  
   
 Q.   Can you give an assessment to what you think happened out there today?  
CJ COSTABILE:   They were better than us today.   They played all parts of the game offensively.   Defensively we couldn't stop them.   We had two guys sliding into the ball and they were picking up parts in the middle.   There was no backside help.   Face‑off wise, he did a great job.   He swings.   Gave me a lot of whistles.   You know, it's not a good recipe to win a ballgame.  
   
 Q.   Justin, talk about what their defense did against you?   Their defense has been pretty hot the last three or four games.   What were you seeing out there?   
JUSTIN TURRI:   It was pretty much what we expected.   They were sliding really early, especially when we were diving behind the cage.   We were trying to prepare for that.   When we were patient, we had good looks.   Didn't hit the shots we usually hit.   At times we didn't play patient, we tried to do everything one‑on‑one.   
You could see it looked bad, but we didn't play up to the level we've been these past couple weeks, which makes it kind of disappointing.   Especially when some of the stuff we got was really simple stuff and really easy.   We just didn't do a good job of being patient enough.   Really looking for the best look on offense.  
   
 Q.   John, you've got a final now with one team that wasn't ranked in the preseason and another team that's not seeded in this tournament.   Is that any kind of statement or should anything be drawn from that?   
COACH DANOWSKI:   I'm not on the committee, so I don't do the seedings or anything.   To be honest, we don't pay a lot of attention to any of that.   We don't pay attention to polls, so I wouldn't know anything about that.  
   
 Q.   (No Microphone)?  
COACH DANOWSKI:   We played Loyola, they were great.   We played Maryland during the year, and they were great.   I don't know why they wouldn't be ranked or be seeded.   I don't know.   We thought they were great, and we played them both.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Christian Walsh's goal to begin the fourth quarter and it was waved off?   How much did that affect momentum or morale?   
COACH DANOWSKI:   None.   They had a goal that was disallowed as well.   That happens over the course of a game.   One play is not going to turn the tide in a game.   Even though it would have been great at that point, they had one also that was in a similar situation when the attack was too close to the crease.   So it evened out.  
   
 Q.   Coach and CJ, how will you remember CJ in his career here?   And CJ, what are your thoughts that you're taking away immediately?   
CJ COSTABILE:   Currently, right now, it's over.   You dedicate four years of your life to something, and it just ends.   What I'll miss most are the guys and everything we've done.  
COACH DANOWSKI:   CJ has been an impact the first day he walked on to campus and his first game.   He scored three goals in the ACC Championship as a freshman.   Scored the Christian Laettner goal as a sophomore.   Played through injuries, didn't face off against Syracuse because he had a broken finger, which we kept secret from everyone.   Missed him last year when we played Maryland at this time because he had a broken bone in his hand.   
Warrior, sometimes, is an overused cliche, but certainly that would come to mind that he's been a warrior for us.   What he does is very difficult getting up‑and‑down the field.   Takes a lot of hits and just keeps coming back.   We're going to miss him tremendously as will all the seniors.   But we'll miss him.
