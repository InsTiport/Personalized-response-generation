Limestone   12
  LIU Post   6

JOHN JEZ:   I thought it was a very good game.   Limestone came out fired up and ready to play.   It was a great game.   I think we fell flat in a couple spots on offense and defense and I thought we tried to rush too many things.   Very proud of our team for playing so well, and Limestone is a great team and deserving of this title. 

Q.   It seemed like the second quarter got away from you.   They got seven goals and then you were in catch‑up mode the rest of the game.   What do you think happened in there that you couldn't handle? 
JOHN JEZ:   We're a relatively young team and new guys stick together and maybe the excitement of the game and adversity in parts of that game, we tried to force things, we tried to force things a little bit, tried to get the points right away instead of playing our game and be a little composed.   We did have two penalties in that situation that were detrimental to us.   They're a very good team on man‑up and once we had to fight back from that deficit in the second quarter, it was tough to overcome. 
T.J. DiCARLO:   I think that says it all. 
MATTY BECCARIS:   That's everything right there in a nutshell.   We've just going to‑‑ they've got a lot of young guys, and it's going to be a great team throughout time. 

Q.   Coach, the path to get here, beating some really great teams in the north, just kind of the arc of your season having kind of a lull in the middle there and then coming back strong at the end, that's got to feel good.   What are your thoughts on the season overall? 
JOHN JEZ:   You know, I thought we didn't play our best lacrosse early on, and the team came together, and we did things to overcome things and get us into the national playoffs.   We worked our way through the playoffs, beating two very good teams in the north, and we came down here, and it's relatively new for our guys.   There's no one on our roster that's played in a playoff, a National Championship before, and I'm not sure, I think it was my fault for not preparing them well enough.   I'll take the blame for that, and we'll work on that in the future.   But it was good.   It was good, and there's a lot of growth in this team.   We lose some key players in T.J. and some D‑midfielders and stuff, but we have a great nucleus to build on the future and this is definitely a foundation, and hopefully we'll be back here next year speaking to you guys again. 

Q.   Matty and T.J., a couple minutes after the game I know it's still a little raw, but do you think now or maybe down the road you take some satisfaction going from that team and winning all these games, getting to a National Championship game when it looked like things were pretty much over at the beginning? 
T.J. DiCARLO:   The guys on this team have a tremendous amount of effort, and from every guy on this team is willing to always push themselves to get better.   Because of that attitude and mindset, this team is going to be a very successful team in the future.   Everything that they do, I mean, just comes down to effort, and these guys got it.   They've got a lot of it. 
MATTY BECCARIS:   I think a good team really shows their potential when you hit a rough patch and you have to deal with adversity like when we were 6‑5.   If you're a good team you can take that negative energy and make it positive and bounce back and really come together as a team.   That's what we did early in the season‑‑ I mean, later in the season.   That's what we did throughout the playoffs, and unfortunately things didn't fall the way that we wished they did.   I just wish we played a little better, and we came out on top, but unfortunately that didn't happen.   I think we're a very good team, and I think taking this loss, it really depends on how we bounce back for next season.   I think we could take this in a positive direction instead of beating ourselves up.
