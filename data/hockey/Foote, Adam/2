Q.  How tough is this one?
 
ADAM FOOTE: Well, it's tough, I mean, no excuses, we got to get another one there, and, you know they pressed a lot.  I felt like they played with more urgency and they were desperate, and, you know, it seemed like they were stepping up the lines.  We got to get it deep and better.  I would say after we scored the first, they were more desperate to win. 
 
Q.  I don't know if you can speak for the guys up front, but did you guys go into kind of a shell when you had the goal?
 
ADAM FOOTE: Maybe a little bit too much.  But I think more than anything, we felt good early, we had a really strong first.  I don't know if we lost some legs.  I know there is no excuses at this time of the year.  I don't know if they caught up with us, but we weren't doing the things that gave us success in the first period, and we got away from our game plan.  And, you know, they were pressing and pinching, and instead of getting deep and getting behind them and making them go back, it seemed like we were trying to, you know, do something, and they were picking off passes and, you know, they were desperate, and we've got to get that second goal.
