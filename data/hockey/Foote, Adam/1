Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
ADAM FOOTE: I don't know.  I mean, we could end on this.  We've won a few.  I really believe the playoffs, every year's a new year and every series is a new series.  I don't think for us, even though  -- we want to make sure.  We don't want to just assume.  I think Game 6, we weren't ready for the whole 60 minutes. 
 
Q.  How much of a factor will the coaches be in this game?
 
ADAM FOOTE: I don't know.  I don't look at it that way at all.  I always go back to us.  We have to make sure we play detailed hockey.  I don't look at the coaches.  I make sure I'm doing what I have to do in being successful out there and trying to help my team, and that's how I approach it. 
 
Q.  Can you ever remember having so many injuries at one time in the playoffs?
 
ADAM FOOTE: No.  But that's part of a playoff run.  It's grueling.  It's demanding.  You know, there are bumps and bruises and another guy comes in and fills in and that's the way she goes. 
 
Q.  What changes for you tomorrow, Adam?  You'll be pulling even more time than you have been doing and do 40 minutes in a game like this?
 
ADAM FOOTE: I don't know.  Whatever is thrown at me or at our team, we have to do whatever it takes to get a win in Game 7.  We're not going to approach it like anything else.  It's an elimination for both sides.  Whatever it takes, you know, stay very focused and we have been focussing this series.  We have had a better outcome and we're a harder team to play against when we're a focused hockey club.
