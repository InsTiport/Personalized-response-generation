 Q.  Just tell us, were you surprised to go as high as No. 2? 
 BOBBY RYAN:  I think like the interview before, we kind of knew there was a group of us that were interchangeable, all could have jumped into that spot. 
 Had great meetings with Anaheim.  We had some good talks.  To be honest, I wasn't exactly surprised.  I'm just glad I went to an organization that wanted me. 
 Q.  Can you just talk about not having the pressure that Sidney had all year long.  Do you feel that was an advantage in the long run to maybe let you be yourself, play your own game through the year? 
 BOBBY RYAN:  Yeah, I think so.  You know, Sidney has always got cameras and people that want to talk to him all the time.  I didn't ever have that.  I think maybe it eased my mind a bit, but at the same time you have to look at the way he handled things, and he handled things great. 
 You just got to be proud and you got to wish success for a kid like that.  I can't say, it didn't make it easier for me. 
 Q.  You played your minor hockey in the Los Angeles area.  You're going back to an area you're familiar with.  Do you feel like it's a comfort zone?  Does that make it a little bit better? 
 BOBBY RYAN:  I think so.  I think knowing people in the area, kind of knowing the lifestyle, so to speak, it's a little different from most of the other places that the league has. 
 You know, I fell in love with California when I was out there.  I'm looking forward to going back.
