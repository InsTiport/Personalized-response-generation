Q. Mark Crawford is the new head coach of the Vancouver Canucks and Mike is gone.  Your reaction to that.

MARKUS NASLUND:  I feel for Mike. Any time someone gets fired it's tough. I think he's done a good job for us, and now we got a new coach and now we can see what Mark is like.
 

Q. You look forward to working with Mark?

MARKUS NASLUND:   Oh, yeah, of course. I've heard a lot of good things about him, so it will be interesting.
 

Q. Good luck to you, Marcus.

MARKUS NASLUND:   Thank you.
