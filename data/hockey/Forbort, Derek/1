 Q. Congratulations. Surprised? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah. Simply a good fit.

 Q. You're committed to college, correct? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, North Dakota.

 Q. Did they say wait to see how it works out, or what did they say? 
 DEREK FORBORT: To be honest with you, I haven't gotten into that much conversation about it. Maybe in the weeks to come we'll see what happens.

 Q. Any talk at the combine? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I had like a two-minute interview with them, so this is kind of unexpected.

 Q. Is there anybody in the NHL that you would compare yourself to that we can say didn't see you play, but he plays like? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I don't know, someone I try to model my game after is Chris Pronger. Good puck man, defenseman. Just an all around defenseman. 

 Q. Did you like the fact that the team traded up to get you? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, it's definitely a good feeling. I didn't really know. It was a great feeling.

 Q. How do you think that two-minute interview went? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, it went well. It was just a quick interview.

 Q. What do you know about them? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I know they've got two really good defensemen down in Johnson. Good young "D", so I hope to be part of that one day.

 Q. What was the expectation coming in today? Did you have a feeling? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I heard anywhere in the teens. I didn't know. I just wanted to get drafted in the first round. I'm not a picky guy, so.

 Q. (No microphone).
 DEREK FORBORT: I think I'll be playing with North Dakota.

 Q. What do you take from your experience? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I don't know. In the program they just teach you how to be a pro off the ice and on the ice. It's really to prepare you for the next level. 

 Q. (No microphone).
 DEREK FORBORT: It went well. Sounds like a great group of fans. I know there is a lot of excitement in L.A. and on the team, and a lot of young players. So I'm excited.

 Q. Do you have thoughts being a table setter, and home of the Kings, it's not like you have to fly out to go see them or anything like that?
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, yeah. It's pretty cool. Hopefully I'll get to see the facilities and see what everything's like. 

 Q. Were you aware of the organization's playoff rounds up until this year? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, like I said, a bunch of great young players that are changing things around. So I'm excited. 

 Q. Tell me what you felt when you first heard the name, obviously you were hoping?
 DEREK FORBORT: First, it was like, oh, God, I hope I don't fall. The next one when I came to terms with it, it was like, wow, this is pretty cool.

 Q. Do you have brothers? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, two young brothers, Nick and Jack.

 Q. Who was most excited? 
 DEREK FORBORT: My grandma seemed pretty pumped.

 Q. How much did you sleep last night? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Not a lot.

 Q. Because you were in L.A. or the draft or both? 
 DEREK FORBORT: A little of both. 

 Q. Seemed like everybody wanted a big forward. Is that the way it went? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, you never know how it's going to turn out. That's just how it went. 

 Q. (No microphone).
 DEREK FORBORT: I heard a lot of North Star stories. Kind of followed the Stars a little bit, but definitely for the Kings now.

 Q. Can you talk about your decision to play? 
 DEREK FORBORT: I don't know. They put a lot of guys in the NHL, the coaching staff there is great, bunch of straightforward guys and a really good program.

 Q. I'm sure you're probably going to get a call from one of those guys? Matt Green is going to be your teammate?
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, hopefully. I've got a long ways to go, so... 

 Q. Is this your first time in Southern California? 
 DEREK FORBORT: This is my first time in L.A.. I was in the Irvine, California, visiting my uncle a couple years ago, but that's about it. 

 Q. Now, Los Angeles, being selected here in L.A. in front of all these fans, going crazy. You got the biggest round of applause of any pick so far. How was that? 
 DEREK FORBORT: It was amazing. A little nerve-racking at the same time, but it was a great feeling inside. 

 Q. Could you imagine what that feeling would be like when you went up on stage? 
 DEREK FORBORT: It was a lot better feeling to be honest. When I saw them move up, I got a little anxious in the seat.
 When I heard my name called, it was just, wow. I just hugged my dad. I didn't know what to do.

 Q. What did your dad tell you?
 DEREK FORBORT: I don't even think he said anything.

 Q. Emotional? In shock? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah. It was just an overwhelming feeling of enjoyment. 

 Q. Who else did you bring here? 
 DEREK FORBORT: My brothers, my grandparents, my aunt, my bantam coach who is a pretty big part of my development as a hockey player.

 Q. You're going to go play in North Dakota. You're committed to North Dakota. What is it going to take to get up here with the Los Angeles Kings? 
 DEREK FORBORT: A lot of hard work and commitment. I want to play in the NHL. That's my dream. Just getting drafted by the Kings, it's a great organization. I'm excited to get after it and come and play here.

 Q. Are you looking forward to going from Minnesota, the cold winters to the nice summers here in L.A.? 
 DEREK FORBORT: Yeah, I just bought a winter jacket.
