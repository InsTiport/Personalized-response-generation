RICHARD MATVICHUK: We all know special teams is going to win it and we can't take down
penalties and the powerplay got a quick one for us. They got one too. We are going in the
second period tied up to one and, you know it is a low scoring battle and we will see what
happens.

Q. Are you concerned a little bit that you had the two-man advantage; you couldn't
create a little more offense?

RICHARD MATVICHUK: It is always nice when you can score off a two-man advantage. But
unfortunately we didn't, but we can't look back on that. We have to regroup here after one
and go back for two.
