 Q. First of all, tell us about the first period?
 
 RICHARD MATVICHUK: When you get to this point of the year, you got to give it all you
got. We are playing with desperation now. We lose, we go home. That is -- we have got too
much experience in the dressing room. We are going to keep fighting. 
 
Q. Darryl Sydor got the leg injury. Does that mean more time for everybody back there
going with five deep?
 
 RICHARD MATVICHUK: Yeah, I think everyone has to step up a little bit, keep it simple.
Do everything we have to. We will go from there. It hurts when you lose a key player like
that, but we have to regroup. 
 DERIAN HATCHER: It is just -- just coming down across the blue line with his head down,
just stepped into him. I am not sure what happened, but they said he is moving and
talking, everything is okay. That is the important thing.
