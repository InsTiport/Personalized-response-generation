JONATHAN MARCHESSAULT: Every game is must-win, but I think the situation of going back home down 2-0, that's not something we wanted to be in.  We wanted to show the hockey world we earned the right to be here, we can play with I think the best team remaining.
Q. What is the difference when you feel like it's a must-win game?  What are you doing differently that you're not doing in the games that aren't necessarily must-win?
JONATHAN MARCHESSAULT: I don't know.  I mean, obviously every night we're trying to win every game.  But, I mean, that first game, it was really important for us, obviously.  They came out hard.  They played just the day before.  I think it showed.
Q. What did you learn about how you're going to have to play to win in this series last night?
JONATHAN MARCHESSAULT: It's going to take 20 men.  It's going to take 20 men, it's going to take a full effort of 60 minutes.  That's what we did yesterday.  That's why we won.
Q. What about more technically in terms of gap, skating?
JONATHAN MARCHESSAULT: First of all, we played good D.  I think we eliminated their options quick.  We didn't spend a lot of time in our D zone.  Second of all, I think our forecheck  was great.  We put pressure on the D, got some turnovers, were able to create some chances.  I think that's the biggest change we did Game 1 to 2.
