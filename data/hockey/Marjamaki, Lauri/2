 Q. Coach, you were obviously disappointed with your effort against North America. How did you think your team responded today against Sweden?   
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course we have to respect the result. We played such a great game, started off well, created so many good scoring chances, but we didn't score.   
Of course the goalie Lundqvist was impressive.   
But so proud of my players and our team effort. It was great today. But it is not enough.   
   
 Q. Do you think Sweden was the better team today, or was it really just a matter of hitting a hot goalie in Lundqvist?   
LAURI MARJAMAKI: What I said, that we have to respect the result. Doesn't matter who was better. But we knew before the game that we were facing a tough team today. I think we did it, but we didn't score. And our scoring average was bad, and that's it.  
   
 Q. When you look at the results, obviously you're disappointed, but you had eight guys on this team that were 24 and under, and you've got some good talent coming up. Do you look at that and sort of temper your disappointment with the fact that maybe there are better days coming for the Finnish men's program?   
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course. Our young players bring so much positive energy to the team and whole Finland ice hockey, and we have a good future forward. But everybody understands that I am now so disappointed that I don't want to say anything.   
   
 Q. Coach, last big tournament you played very well against Russia. You beat them in Sochi, in Torino and the last world championship. How do you see the next game, and will the result of this game and of this tournament overall influence the performance of your team?   
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course. We have to first handle this game with the players, and then we start to prepare on Thursday.   
Of course tomorrow game Sweden against the young stars is important for us, but of course I have good confidence. We know that we are facing a good team, but we have a good chance to win.
