 Q. Shady outing for Pekka Rinne today. Are you contemplating any kind of goalie change going forward?  
LAURI MARJAMAKI: I don't know. I think that Pekka was our best player today, and I have to think about it, what we do on Tuesday.   
   
 Q. Talk a little bit about‑‑ everyone has been talking about North America, no one knows how they're going to play, how they're going to be as a team. Did that make it difficult as a coach to prepare, how you had no idea how they would play from an opponent standpoint?  
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course we know how they played, and we started off well. We had a couple or two power plays, but we didn't score on the first power play, but second period was so‑called shower for us. They won every battle. They skate hard. They're so impressive. All the credit's to them. They're such a great team, and that's it.   
   
 Q. Talk about regrouping; how difficult is it going to be as a team to come back mentally with the pressure on you guys now?   
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course we have to live in the moment, and we have to prepare on Tuesday. Everybody understands that every game is so important, and many one‑goal game coming, and I think that two games that we have left, it will be tight, and we have to prepare on Tuesday and all the focus on that game.
