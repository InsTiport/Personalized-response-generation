Q. Coach, I know it's one of those things that for the players it's tough to think about during the tournament, but with so much youth on this team, do you think this tournament could have served as kind of the starting‑off point for maybe a new generation of Finnish hockey, and do you think it could have been a good learning experience for a lot of those young players? 
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Yes, it was difficult situation before the game, how we prepared this game, because we lost that game on Tuesday, and what happened yesterday, Sweden against young stars. 
We started off well and played pretty good first period. We created so many good scoring chances, but we didn't score. After penalty killing second period, we have a good scoring chance, for example, Granlund, but he only post, and then goal against. 
And everybody understand that if you score, you get so much energy and positive thinking in your team. But now we didn't score. Like same way on Tuesday. 
But I am proud of my team, but it is not so easy to come to this game and play like that and dedication to our style of play was great. But if you didn't score, you can't win. That's the way. And of course it would be interesting to see the exact same team, for example, in the Olympics in 2018. The future seems bright, nevertheless, for Team Finland. 

Q. You mentioned the future; you have a lot of young guys on this team. Finland has done really well in these best‑on‑best tournaments. Some teams can just reload like Team Canada has. Are you guys kind of in this transition period now where you know you have these good young players coming up but maybe they just weren't ready for this tournament?
LAURI MARJAMAKI: You are right. I think that this tournament is coming too fast for us, and what I said before is that, for example, next Olympics maybe it's better timing for our team. 
But, of course, we had a good chance to succeed here, but you didn't score, you can't win. We have so much good scoring chances in both games, but of course that first game against young stars, they were so much better that I don't know even with a top performance from us, I don't know is it enough. 
We have to keep going and maybe analyze a little bit later, and just now a little bit disappointing.

Q. Koivu, how is he feeling after the blocked shot? And he is one of the older guys; if this is one of his last tournaments for Team Finland, what has he meant for the program?
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Of course he's a great captain. He leads by example, and so good character. I think he's okay. 

Q. What is your forecast for semifinals, Russia and Canada? 
LAURI MARJAMAKI: Sorry, I don't know. I don't want to say anything about it.
