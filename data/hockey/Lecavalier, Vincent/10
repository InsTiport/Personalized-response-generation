  VINCENT LECAVALIER:  It's a great honor and it's been a good year and so I'm happy to be here and experience it again. 

 Q.  How do you like Dallas so far? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I love Dallas.  Great city.  It's a lot of fun.  You get to see all the guys, and it's just a great experience to be here and be around everybody.  So it's only my second time.  So I'm definitely going to enjoy it. 

 Q.  A lot of first-time guys here, is that the direction the league is headed? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I don't know.  See a lot of new faces, Sidney Crosby and Ovechkin obviously, and there's a lot of new guys.  It's fun.  It's a fast league.  It's a fun league.  And we're definitely -- with the new rules, with everything, it's been great the last two years for sure. 

 Q.  The change more to -- 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I think the rule changes I think have helped a lot of guys.  I mean, like I said, I mean it's definitely a faster league.  And guys that are fast and that can be a little bit smaller, but you know they've got great finesse, and they can make it. 
 Maybe ten years ago it wasn't the same case.  But now it's a lot of skill.  There's a lot of defensemen.  They're smaller but they're quicker.  So it's kind of different hockey.  But I think it's a lot more interesting and a lot more fun to watch. 


 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  Well, we're going to work hard.  I mean, it's definitely for fun.  I mean, we're here to -- there's always some nice plays in the games.  But nobody is going to hit each other out there and nobody is going to try to hurt somebody else. 

 Q.  Jeremy Roenick did a couple years ago.  He was running around pretty good? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  Yeah, he was.  That was in Miami when I was there.  And, well, I don't know.  I think we'll take it easy.  We're not going to hurt each other. 

 Q.  You're going to keep an eye on him if he was on that other team? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I did check their lineup.  I was a little scared of that.  But I'm sure he'll keep that for when we play each other in March. 
 But I think everybody is excited to be here.  We're definitely going to try to put on a show and play well. 

 Q.  Is there more prestige for winning the hardest shot or the fastest skater, who is the biggest dog, which event? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I don't know.  I think the hardest shot, I mean, I don't know.  Chara -- there's a lot of good guys out there. 

 Q.  (Inaudible?) 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  104, 105. 

 Q.  That was before the sticks, too? 
 VINCENT LECAVALIER:  I don't know.  I hope somebody beats it.  It's going to be interesting.
