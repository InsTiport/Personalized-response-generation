  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Willie Mitchell.

Q.   (No microphone.) 
WILLIE MITCHELL:   It's difficult.   There can only be so many bosses in the room, right (smiling)?   Sometimes when you're hearing it from every which direction, it's tough to absorb.   Sometimes as a teammate and peer, doesn't matter whether you're 35 or 22, it's good to be a good teammate, vent, let him work through that with the coaching staff. 
Like I said, it's a fine line because you don't want to take away who he is.   Like I said, who he is is a guy who loves the game, has fun being at the rink, wants to make a difference, wants the puck on his stick in that defining moment.   That enthusiasm and love for the game is what makes him a special player. 
You don't want to make him so by the book, this is how you got to be, that it takes all his creativity away as a player.   I think he's doing a good job, starting to find that balance of being prepared as a player, but also not taking away from what makes him a special player.
