Q.   Is there anything from 2010 that you guys can draw on coming back in the series? 
BRIAN GIONTA:   Well, the guys that were here, you know, you remember the situation and you remember the feelings that you had.   At no point in that series did we feel we were out of it, and the same holds true now.   We believe in the team that's in here, and we believe we can win this series.

Q.   When you have a goalie (No Audio)is there any way to lift him up anymore? 
BRIAN GIONTA:   No, no, no matter who it is.   A key loss like that, you're going to try to support him, whether it's Carey or it's Dustin.   He's played extremely well for us.   He gave us a chance to win last night, and some of the big saves he made were the reason why we were in that game still.

Q.   (No Audio).   Is there any tendency, anything at all that he shows (No Audio) that he didn't exploit yesterday? 
BRIAN GIONTA:   No, he's like any goalie.   He's great at making the first save, and you've got to get screens and tips and rebounds on him and make sure you get second and third opportunities.   That is how it is across the board with all the goalies nowadays.   It's tough to beat them on that first shot.
