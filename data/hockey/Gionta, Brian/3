 Q.   What are   your thoughts?     Did you think that something needed to be tweaked a little bit in your game?  
BRIAN GIONTA:   No, I thought, obviously, we lost the first two games.   We've got to do something different.   But at the same time, we had a pretty good game in Game 2.   We've just got to find ways to get more goals and get to them a little more offensively.  
   
 Q.   You've seen a lot of Lundqvist from your days in New Jersey, what is the key to beating him, or is there a key to beating him?  
BRIAN GIONTA:   It's no different than any other goalie in this league.   You have to get traffic, and you've got to get second and third opportunities.     Most goalies in this League are going to stop the first shot.     So it's part of penetrating their "D" and making sure you get quality chances, but you're also there for the rebound.  
   
 Q.   When you're a captain, and a veteran guy like Vanek is struggling, do you need to go talk to the veteran guys like that as much as young guys? How do you see that?  
BRIAN GIONTA:   It's part of everybody. The thing with this room is everybody cares, so he wants to be a big part of this team, and he is a big part of this team.   So, obviously, the first two games when you lose, things are more amplified than when you are winning.       So we have confidence in everybody in this room and the way guys will respond.  
   
 Q.   No excuses, is that the word for the team?  
BRIAN   GIONTA:Yeah,   for   sure.  
We thought we played a pretty good game in Game 2, but at this time of the year, you need to get wins, so regardless of how it went, we've got to find a way to come out with a win in Game 3 and set ourselves up for a match-up in Game 4.
