I am actually friends with Wayne, Herbert Carnegie's grandfather, he did not have an opportunity to play in the NHL because of his color.  But I just look up to people like LARAY being the first black hockey player and Carnegie too so I am just trying to carry the torch. 
   
 
I have a brother and five sisters. 
   
 
That was one of my best interviews.  I was really optimistic (inaudible) hopefully them trading up was out of the question.  
   
 
I had to make do with what I had.  Some trying times.  We had to hop on the bus 4:30 in the morning to travel by bus sometimes walking, but that is  part of why I am where I am today.  I am not embarrassed about it.  I am willing to talk about it.  I am more appreciative.  I am  fortunate enough, my family helping me out, plus the community and people -- not really having to pay registration fees. (Inaudible). 
   
 
He wasn't able to make it because he was bedridden.  It is unfortunate that he passed away, but we were trying to sort of get that tournament for him but it is unfortunate that we lost, but pretty sure he's proud of me now. 
   
 
He was pretty old back in the day when I was 9 or 10 and he said he's going to retire as soon as I get drafted in the NHL.  It's unfortunate that he didn't make it here, but just trying to dedicate this to him and all of the people that helped me out along the way.
