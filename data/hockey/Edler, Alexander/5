  Q.  Brian was just talking about your shootout success.  And for a young guy you surprised a lot of people around the league by coming up and playing so well early.  Just talk a little about the shootout, your success early on with all those injuries on defense for van cure?   
 ALEXANDER EDLER:  Well, the shootout, I don't know.  I got the chance we played the Islanders.  I don't know, I guess it was a little bit of luck.  I scored and I got a chance again, and I scored again.   
 I don't know.  It's fun to be in the shootout, of course.   
  
  Q.  Not nervous at all?   
 ALEXANDER EDLER:  No, not really.  No, if you miss, you miss.  If you score, you score.  I don't know, the first time there were a lot of other guys that missed before me.  I don't know, maybe that helped.   
  
  Q.  Who was your idol growing up?   
 ALEXANDER EDLER:  Well, when I was a little kid I really liked Forsberg.  But then when I decided to be a Demon I think like Lidstrom and Olen were my biggest idols.   
  
  Q.  And Mathias, your teammate has helped you along in the early part of your career?   
 ALEXANDER EDLER:  Yeah, he's a great guy.  Really good player.  I like the style he's playing.  He's been really helpful.   
  
  Q.  Good luck the rest of the way.
