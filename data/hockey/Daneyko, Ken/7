 Q. This has a look of a classic.
 
 KEN DANEYKO: It's been a real goaltending duel. Both teams have had some opportunities.
Both goalies have shut the doors. It is only fitting for us - this is our first overtime
game in the Playoffs; it would be a nice way to win it. 
 
Q. Confidence now in overtime, do you kind of like to get the jump early?
 
 KEN DANEYKO: We just have to keep doing more of the same - stay patient; take a few
more chances. It is a must-win for them; plus hope we get our scoring chances that way
staying patient.
