 KEN DANEYKO: We are very confident on the road. We didn't expect this thing to be easy.
If we were told before the Stanley Cup Finals that we would be up 3-2 I would have ran
with it. We feel good coming in here. 
 
Q. They shortened their bench a lot more than you guys in the last game. Do you think
that 48 hours later it is going to have any impact?
 
 KEN DANEYKO: Well, I hope so. We have relied on our depth throughout the Playoffs.
(inaudible) let's hope tonight it plays into our advantage. We feel good coming in here.
Obviously we have a competent team playing on the road. Hopefully that will -- extra legs
and things like that can help us out. 
 
Q. Feel less fatigued?
 
 KEN DANEYKO: Feel fine. I don't think we have a chance to feel that way right now; too
much at stake. I just feel good. We got good rest last night, the night before in Jersey,
so guys are ready to go. 
 
Q. What was the attitude coming back, flight down last night, practice today?
 
 KEN DANEYKO: Everybody feels good. Obviously it was a great hockey game, classic game,
spectacular goaltending on both ends. Obviously games like that are -- any time you go six
periods, you get a little -- I mean, six-period game, anybody can win it. That is the way
it happens, so it is over and done with. That is the playoffs, but like I said earlier, we
are very confident coming into this building. We seem to play very well on the road, play
a little bit simple; do little things better, hopefully that will happen again tonight.
