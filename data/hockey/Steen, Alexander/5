Q.  Talk about the meaning of being drafted by this particular team in the National Hockey League, given its drafting of Swedish elite league players in recent history. 

ALEXANDER STEEN:   I was really looking forward to this draft.  To be drafted by Toronto in Toronto is really huge for me.  I've always admired Canadian teams.  Toronto has always been one of my favorite teams, so this has been a real big experience for me.

Q.  Could you tell us how it feels coming to a team where the captain is a Swede, and needless to say, probably a popular player back home?

ALEXANDER STEEN:   Yeah, he's huge back home.  I actually know him pretty well.  My father played hockey; so he has connections that way.  So I know Mats pretty well.  He's a great player.  I'm really looking forward to this.

Q.  What kind of time line are we looking at for you?  When can Toronto fans expect to see you in the lineup? 

ALEXANDER STEEN:   I'm not quite sure yet.  I took a big step in my career this season back home in Goteborg, but I'll be returning back to Goteborg and playing in a couple more seasons with my team back home.  If I keep developing, maybe a couple of years, three years.
