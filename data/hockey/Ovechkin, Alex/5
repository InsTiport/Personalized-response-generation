 Q.   Troy, have you got to see your father yet, and how was that moment for you?   And I guess if not, what's going through your mind as the winning goal scorer?   
TROY BROUWER:   No, I haven't yet.   He texted me, but that's it.   I haven't responded to him.   I figured I would wait until I got home to kind of share it with him.   But knowing how my dad is right now he's probably got a couple tears.  
   
 Q.   What were you seeing when Alex's stick sitting right there, you had guys left and right, it looked like a clear view, but what did you see?   
TROY BROUWER:   I was trying to go to the net because I knew he was shooting and we were running out of time.   And when I saw the puck laying at his feet when he broke his stick, somebody had to try to keep alive.   So I turned around, threw it to the net.   I'm not sure where it even went in, but I heard the noise of the crowd, heard the noise of the guys on the ice, and it was one of those where you know the time, you know the score, and you're just trying to get a puck on net, and thankfully it went in.  
   
 Q.   Alex, you were talking about being in Washington and how much it meant to the team here.   Other than winning, what was your favorite part of the day and did it go the way you expected?   
ALEX OVECHKIN:   The whole day was unbelievable.   It has been outstanding.   The atmosphere on the ice, like, since first second was like unreal.   
It's a good one before all our lives, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to watch this hockey game, like, and we'll enjoy it, so.   It is what it is.  
   
 Q.   Alex, not just on, not just on your goal you scored, but also every other goal that was scored, you ‑‑ just your enthusiasm is really bubbling over obviously for this game, but really all year.   Are you having as much or more fun than you've had really any year with this team.   
ALEX OVECHKIN:   No, I always have fun.   But this is probably like one of the special days.   And as soon as you see a puck go in, it's a great feeling, because you want to get success and you want to win.   
   
 Q.   Braden, we talked about this game for the last several months and now it's over.   There's a game on Sunday against Florida.   Will it be easy for you and your teammates to flip the script and realize that, yes, this is a culmination of sorts, three months into the season, but you do have to get back to work and still have 40 regular season games to go.   
BRADEN HOLTBY:   Yeah, the emphasis we put on this game is the two points in our locker room.   It means a lot more to us as professionals, as the Capitals, than anything else.   So, realistically, the next game we play, it's the same mindset, that that's the main goal and obviously different circumstances create different problems, but in the end the two points count the same.  
   
 Q.   Braden, it hardly seems fair to try to stop a shot that starts in sunshine and ends in shadow.   Did you even see that puck and how much did that play a part?   
BRADEN HOLTBY:   I didn't see it, it was a screen, I didn't really see the release of it, but, yeah, it was, the first period was definitely a challenge.   It was tough to pick up pucks.   
But it's equal for both goalies, so I think we, the people involved with putting it on did their absolute best at making sure it was comfortable for us as players and the product on the ice was really good.   
   
 Q.   Alex, you met with Toews real quick to say, let's play on time, like why were you guys comfortable playing like that?   What was that like?   And then for all three of you, just what will you remember the most in five, 10 years about this day?   
ALEX OVECHKIN:   Well, I'm pretty sure him and I, because captains and goalies make the decision, especially the goalies, and they just said, yeah, we're ready to go and we're just going to play 10 minutes and then switch the sides.   
So, but I'm pretty sure that everybody is going to remember this moment for a long time and as I said, it's a great feeling.   And it's going to be in our memories.   
   
 Q.   Braden, where does this rank in your hockey career, late game winner, Winter Classic, where does that rank?  
TROY BROUWER:   It's pretty special, for sure.   I've had some good moments in my hockey career, but this one, with all the intangibles, that played a part in it.   My parents being able to come into town, playing against my former team, this being the first goal that I scored against my former team and the dramatic fashion at the end of the game of how everything played out is definitely going to, you know, it's going to be a memorable day, a memorable event.   
The entire lead up to this has been a lot of fun and the finish couldn't have worked out any better for us as a team and me personally.   
   
 Q.   Braden, take us through the five on three kill through your eyes.   Because it appeared they got back in the game, huge chance for them, and it seemed to turn back after that.   
BRADEN HOLTBY:   Yeah, it's, obviously, the five on three all year has been phenomenal for us.   I think when you see a moment like that, a five on three at that time of the game, the guys that do kill in those situations really take a huge pride in knowing that that can turn a game and a month around.   
I think I only stopped one or two shots in that and that shows how committed we were to playing with the commitment we needed, in order to kill that off and get some huge blocks and huge clears and that's like scoring a goal for us right there.   
   
 Q.   Alex, what is it about these big stages that you think brings out the best in your game?   A lot of your teammates were saying that you had a smile on your face from the moment you arrived in the Nationals Park and that gave them a lot of confidence.   
ALEX OVECHKIN:   I just feel like when I play against great teams and especially if it's a great atmosphere.   
We started talking about the Winter Classic since we started the season and this is it.   I remember Brouwer said, it's a good time to show up and make a show.   And he did, so.
