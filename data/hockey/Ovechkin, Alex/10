 Q. Alex, where did you get the idea to do the hat and the glasses? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: Well, it was last night. I talked actually with Nate about it, and I said it's going to be fun, and you have to try it. 

 Q. Can you just comment on, it seems like you really enjoy the spotlight and playing up to the crowd. Do you think hockey needs a little bit more of that? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: Well, I think, you know, fans have to see how we are, who we are, you know. They see our skills and, you know, I think the last trick like was just for fun, you know. 
 I think fans love it. 

 Q. I've seen you try that shot, the Phoenix goal from the back a few times in practice as well, and you've never been able to do it. Are you just going to quit? Was that just a one-time thing? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: It's one time, and it's, you know, it goes in, and right now I feel like no more time (laughing). No more try. 

 Q. On that shot when you used the two sticks, did you think about all of it, including using the two sticks or did you just think about the hat? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: Yeah, I think the hat was just one piece of my trick. But I think, you know, it's same skill. You know, I try to use different stick, and then I try to use it left shot, but, you know, it was in, so I was pretty happy. 

 Q. How did you go about getting Evgeni's help for the little skit? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: Nothing. It's during the bench. Coach helped me. So coach said like, okay, let's do -- Malkin give me water, put hat, like clean my sunglasses, and give me some water, and give me his stick. So I think it's -- it was pretty fun. 

 Q. Where'd you get that hat? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: In the store. Selinevich buy me, like my guy. 

 Q. And the glasses and everything? He bought everything for you here? 
 ALEX OVECHKIN: Yeah.
