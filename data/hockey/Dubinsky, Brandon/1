  Q.  Brandon, you were just telling me how good it felt to end the segment of the National Hockey League schedule with a win last night going into break, because you felt better and you knew that your general manager and coaches felt better?   
 BRANDON DUBINSKY:  Yeah, definitely.  We were having a little bit of struggles there.   
 To end with a couple wins going to the break, I think it lets the guys relax a little bit better and enjoy themselves a little bit better over the break.  They feel good about themselves and reenergize to get ready for the final push in the season.   
  
  Q.  Now, think back and tell me when you found out you were coming to the All-Star Game, and secondly, who told you and what was the first thing that you did after learning about it?   
 BRANDON DUBINSKY:  I'm not sure the day that I found out, but our public relations guy told me.  And I was obviously really excited about it.   
 After I left practice, I phoned my father and told them that I was going to be in the game and he was real excited as I was as well.  So it was great.   
  
  Q.  Well, congratulations on your selection, first of all, being here.  I'm sure as I can tell by the smile on your face you are very much looking forward to the remaining few days?   
 BRANDON DUBINSKY:  I am.  I've been a big hockey fan myself growing up and watched the All-Star Game.  And to be here and get a chance to take part in it and all the different festivities and things like that, it's going to be really exciting.  I'm looking forward to it.   
  
  Q.  Brandon, thanks very much.  Have fun this weekend.
