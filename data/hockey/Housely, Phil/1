Q.  Do you feel vindicated at all, on a personal level --

PHIL HOUSELY:  I feel I know it takes a team to get there.  It is not any one individual.  Everybody has their part on a team to get to this point.  Doesn't matter what your role is.  Everybody has got to play well and do well in their role during the Playoffs to be successful.

PHIL HOUSELY:  (On Dale Hunter) I say he is almost like our John Elway on our team.  He has been playing such a long time.  Just the type of player he is and type of human being he is, he cares a lot for the game.  Like myself, I think I wouldn't have anything without playing hockey, but we would sure would like to see him hoisting the Cup.  It would be a great end to his career for all the years that he has played.
