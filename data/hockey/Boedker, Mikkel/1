THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Keith Yandle. 

Q.   Your reaction to this game? 
KEITH YANDLE:   Yeah, I mean, I think we played hard.   Obviously we're not happy because we didn't get the win.   This time of year you have to play every shift.   I think they found a way to get one more than us. 
We just got to focus on the next game, trying to make something happen here. 

Q.   (Question regarding penalties in the third.) 
KEITH YANDLE:   Obviously that hurts any team when you're getting calls like that, momentum taken out of the game.   We were doing a good job of rolling four lines.   On those penalties, you got to run only four guys.   That's something that took us out of the game a little bit. 
But you can't blame it on that. 

Q.   You guys were getting some shots on goal in the first period. 
KEITH YANDLE:   That was our goal coming in, to get shots.   He's a good goalie.   To beat him, you have to get as many shots at net as possible, kind of get him out of his comfort zone a little bit.   We were only able to get one by him. 
For next game, we have to try even better. 

Q.   How tough is it when you score the first goal then two minutes later you're tied?
KEITH YANDLE:   It's tough.   You have to be mentally strong, battle through that, realize we had to go out there and get the next one.   Unfortunately we weren't able to. 
To win games, you got to be mentally strong and be able to battle through that, to be able to get another goal. 

Q.   It's 3‑0.   There's two days until the next game.   Talk about what you have to do to regroup. 
KEITH YANDLE:   Yeah, I mean, it's a good two days' rest.   We'll be able to get focused, have a good day of practice, whatever goes on, and just focus on Sunday. 
It's something that we have nothing to lose.   We got to come out and play.   It's not like it's never been done.   We know in this group, we're a resilient group, we can battle back and play hard. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Mikkel Boedker. 

Q.   Talk about the mindset of the team tonight. 
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   It's tough.   I mean, obviously it could have went both ways.   I thought we played a lot better as the game went on.   We came out strong in the first. 
Yeah, I mean, it could have went both ways, but they got the upper hand. 

Q.   11 pucks on net in the first period. 
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   Yeah, obviously they tightened down the defense a little bit.   Got some more shots off there.   They had a few more power plays than we did.   That's obviously why they had more shots.

Q.   Still not generating enough second chances, though?
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   Yeah, obviously the puck might be laying there, but they clear it pretty good.   We got to get a little more aggressive and keep our heads up and win Game4. 

Q.   Is part of the problem the Kings are playing really well, maybe better than they ever have?
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   I mean, obviously they're a good team.   But obviously a lot of people are doubting us.   We're used to that.   I mean, obviously they think the Kings are going to the finals already.   But the series isn't over.   We still plan to win it.   We're not done yet. 

Q.   Can you talk about how you were able to get the lead, but they were able to come right back.   Was that deflating in any way?
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   Obviously we want to play with the lead.   But we didn't have a chance to play with the lead that long.   They came right back.   They got a breakaway.   Obviously, if you ask Smitty, he probably wants that one back. 
It is what it is.   Obviously we wanted to win this game badly, and they came out on top.   But that's why we play seven, right?   I mean, the odds aren't in our favor, but we can still win Game4 and keep coming at 'em. 

Q.   Looked like you played the best hockey of the series in the first period. 
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   We came out strong.   We were focused at getting after them.   I thought we had a real good first period.   Obviously we generated some more chances, and that's what we got to do in the full 60. 

Q.   You talk about the series isn't over yet.   Odds are against you. 
MIKKEL BOEDKER:   They are.   But they've been against us the whole year.   Obviously everybody is counting us out.   They've been doing that the whole year. 
We bend, but we don't break.   That's what we have to do.
