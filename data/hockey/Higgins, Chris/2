   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chris Higgins. 

 Q. (No microphone.) 
 CHRIS HIGGINS: That's a big advantage of this team, is the amount of depth it has. Hopefully we can continue to get that going forward. 

 Q. Just the confidence right now with the way this team has battled throughout the whole playoffs, finding a way. 
 CHRIS HIGGINS: Yeah, it has been a battling series. I think it's unique, every series. 
 But I don't think any game has come easy for us. I think we've had to really earn every win we've gotten. 

 Q. Any personal moments in these playoffs that have stuck out for you?
 CHRIS HIGGINS: No, not really. Nothing personal. No, I think just taking it all in and enjoying the ride, playing with a great team. I don't think anything would stand out in my mind, just one play, game, anything like that. 
 I think the overall experience has been something that I've always wanted.
