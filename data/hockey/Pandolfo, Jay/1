Q.  What was your thinking when they were debating the goal?

JAY PANDOLFO: I was pretty sure they weren't going to take one away.  I knew I didn't kick it.  I stopped and it went off the skate and it went in.  I knew they weren't going to take that one away.  Maybe it was justice for the last one that didn't count.  It was nice to get that.

Q.  You'll take a win in a big game like this in the Stanley Cup Finals any way you can get it.  But is it fair to say that this is not how the Devils expected to win a game in the post-season?

JAY PANDOLFO: Yeah, I don't think either of the teams typically plays like this, and each team didn't give up more than one or two goals in the other games.  It's a funny game tonight.  We've got to be ready to come out in the third period and play well.

Q.  Looked like a better last two minutes for the Ducks in that period.

ROB NIEDERMAYER: Yeah, I think we played a little more desperate.  That's the way we've got to play.  I think they were out battling us for a little while in the 2nd period.  We just got to get back to the simple things again.

Q.  I know your team was not at all pleased with the effort in the first two games.  What's been the difference tonight that's allowed you to produce three goals?

ROB NIEDERMAYER: We're pressuring their D a lot more.  In the first two games, we gave them all the time in the world.  They've got some good players in there, and they'll just pick you apart.  We're getting in a lot better and forechecking, and I think that's causing a lot more turnovers.
