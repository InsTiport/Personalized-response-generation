ED BELFOUR:  I think for fans it was an overall better game, better exhibition.  I think they got a good show.


Q.  (Inaudible)

ED BELFOUR:  Well, yeah.  The normal All-Star Game is definitely tough.  It's all wide open, no defense.  But today, you know, we played better defensively. Still some good opportunities, goalies made some good saves, made some nice goals.  I think overall, it was a tighter checking game. It made for a better game.


Q.  As a goalie, MVP is a long shot, so you have to shoot for the team award?

ED BELFOUR:  Yeah.  In the other All-Star Game, the way it was, you get sometimes 20, 25 shots in a period.  If you were on your game, you could be MVP of the game.  But the way this is, it makes for a better game. You still have to make some big saves.
