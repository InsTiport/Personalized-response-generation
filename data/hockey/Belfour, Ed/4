Q.  What was the biggest highlight for you this weekend? 

ED BELFOUR:  I think just, you know, being amongst the guys, watching hockey heroes. It was definitely a big event, a lot of people are here. It's definitely a great honor, just being recognized as one of these real good players, one of the best players in the world.


Q.  Are you surprised they put on the trap at the end?

ED BELFOUR:  I don't know about that. I think in the All-Star Game there's probably not too much defense, but I think overall it was a real competitive game tonight and everyone worked hard and played hard and I think the scoring was -- it was fair. You know, goalies didn't get blown away, so that was good.
