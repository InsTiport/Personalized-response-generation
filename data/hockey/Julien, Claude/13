THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   The special teams seemed to be a big game changer, they have been all series.   Could you talk about how important they've been.   
COACH JULIEN:   Well, they are.   We know they've got some great players on that other team.   Our penalty kill has to be at its best.   
It really got better as the playoffs went on.   But we really picked it up against Pittsburgh for the same reasons, same kind of a dangerous power play.   Again, it just continues to give us some help in these games.   
Obviously we don't want that to be a momentum changer against us.   I think killing those has really given our bench a boost.   
Power play, we had some chances.   We scored that one goal, which obviously with a huge one.   
We just keep plugging away with those special teams, but at the same time, I'm not going to change my attitude as far as saying that five‑on‑five right now is just as important.   So we got to continue to play well five‑on‑five.   
   
 Q.   The piggyback on the power play goal by Bergeron, there was once a time you couldn't score in the power play, just that brand of hockey, is that the way you envision the game being played?  
COACH JULIEN:   We're in the playoffs here.   As I said, a little while back, we're playing the best hockey of the season right now.   That's what you've got to do to give yourself a chance to win a Stanley Cup.   
We've got to continue playing our best hockey and at the same time we've got to continue to try to fix the little things that we feel can be better in our game.   
We're not a satisfied group.   Whether it's through wins or through games, we try and I guess better ourselves in certain areas.   That's what we got to continue to do.   
Again, I can't say enough about that team we're playing.   They've got great speed, great skill.   Our goaltender continues to be good for us.   Our guys continue to do a good job back‑checking and we're finding ways to score goals.   
   
 Q.   With the star power that they have in their top six, did you envision this being a series in which the bottom six battle would be as important as it's been?  
COACH JULIEN:   When you look at I guess the matchups, it just kind of seems to even itself out.   Their top lines, our top lines.   Our top lines haven't scored that much five‑on‑five either.   It's the Kelly line that gives us that goal five‑on‑five.   Right now it just seems that both teams are very aware of the other team's top players.   Playing a chess match right now.   
   
 Q.   You said this is the best the team is playing right now.   Can you go over the three elements that really stick out for you as the coach?  
COACH JULIEN:   I think it's the energy in the game, the effort.   You see our guys, like I said, they're back‑checking, having layers, so when somebody makes a mistake, you have somebody covering up.   We're blocking a lot of shots.   The commitment is totally there.   
Throughout a whole season, it's not easy to have that full commitment.   But I think when you get to this stage, players start feeling it.   They go above and beyond.   That's what you're seeing from our team right now.   
   
 Q.   When did you find out that Hossa wasn't going to play?   How did that change your game plan at all?  
COACH JULIEN:   Just found out when I received the game sheet.   I was surprised as anybody else.   But to be honest with you, there wasn't any changes in our game.   As I mentioned the other day when I was asked about another player, we don't make our game plan based on an individual.   
I can definitely tell you they lost a pretty important player on their roster, but that doesn't mean we change our game.   I think it's important we stick with what we believe in.   
   
 Q.   The penalty kill has had amazing success.   Even strength, you seem to have the penalty kill mentality out there, if you know what I mean.   
COACH JULIEN:   Yeah.   I was just saying, it's our back check.   Our guys are understanding one thing:   this is a team, when it attacks, it attacks with four, never three.   They've got such great skaters back there on the fence that if we don't do what we're doing right now, we don't stand a chance.   
Our guys, like I've said, they've committed to that.   They realize how important it is to come back.   We're trying to support each other that way and trying to keep it as tight as possible.   
   
 Q.   If you went through the four series, Toronto, the Rangers, Pittsburgh, here, would you say the game planning has been essentially the same?   
COACH JULIEN:   Well, you know, I think these last two teams ‑ Chicago and Pittsburgh ‑ are very alike as far as respecting the offense.   They've got a lot of depth.   They've got a lot of guys that can score from the first line to the fourth line.   
I thought we had that same approach against Pittsburgh.   So the only thing was, we didn't know them as well 'cause we hadn't played them.   But, you know, I don't think there's a big, big change in our game plan except, like I said, they've got a lot of Ds on the back end that carry the puck and make it a four‑man attack all the time.   
   
 Q.   Talk about Tuukka's ability to maintain his strength, focus, even when he's not getting the action?  
COACH JULIEN:   He's been focused since day one of the playoffs.   You watch him on off days, you watch him, he's quiet, focused, calm.   Right now all his energy is put towards his game, how he needs to get his rest, relax.   When the game starts, he's a focused individual.   
Like I said, I've never seen a guy so calm, obviously confident with the way he's played.   Probably quietest I've seen him so far, but in a good way.   
   
 Q.   After Game1, Joel said in Chicago how important momentum was, particularly in the Stanley Cup Finals.   Obviously you took it away in Game2.   Do you feel you have momentum on your side at this stage?   
COACH JULIEN:   The biggest thing is every coach thinks differently.   I'm not one to say momentum.   This game is over.   I think next game is just as important.   We have to go into the next game the same way we did tonight.   If you don't win that game, does that mean the momentum goes the other way?   
I know it gives them home‑ice advantage again.   
I think it's more about refocusing on the next one, knowing that the team you played against is going to be looking at what they can do better.   They're going to make adjustments.   We have to do the same from our end.   
   
 Q.   There was a report that your captain was hurt during the warmup.   Was that true?  
COACH JULIEN:   I found out just before.   All he did is he slipped, had a little gash over his eye.   I haven't even seen it.   Just by slipping, he got hit just above the eye.   Nothing serious.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
