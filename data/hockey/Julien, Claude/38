 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Julien. 

 Q. Claude, how do you get it going on the road offensively? Is there anything you can say to this team to try and turn things around on the road? 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I think we are very well aware of how we've played on the road the last three games in Vancouver. It hasn't been good enough and our plan is certainly to change that for Game 7. We've created ourselves another opportunity and it's up to us to take advantage of it.
 But we've got to be hungrier than we have been the last three times in Vancouver and want to put some pucks at the net and get yourself hungry around that net area. 

 Q. Coach, wonder if you could talk about Brad Marchand, a not so big guy who seems to have a big impact?
 COACH JULIEN: Yeah, he's been a great player for us all year. He's a good energy player. Certainly that goal that he scored tonight was certainly a highlight reel goal. The shot that he took was an extremely accurate and hard shot from an off wing and that's the caliber of a Brad Marchand shot. Hopefully with more confidence you're going to see him use that even more. 
 He's been a great, great player for us. For a first-year player, he's been great. When you look at how he's handling himself in the Stanley Cup finals, you certainly can't complain as a coach. 

 Q. Claude, these three games in Boston have caught people by surprise how they have been one-sided games. Have they caught you by surprise tonight, four goals so early so quickly like that? 
 COACH JULIEN: I don't know. We needed to come out hard tonight and I thought our guys responded. We needed to come out hard the last two games before that because we were trailing 2-0 in the series. So our guys have responded well and now we have to make sure we don't get comfortable with our game. We're willing to bring it to Vancouver with us, because that's what it's going to take to win.

 Q. Coach, the Canucks took a few verbal shots after Game 5. You guys responded with shots on goal. What does that say about your club? 
 COACH JULIEN: We're just focused on doing our job here. 
 At one point this series is getting near the end and the most important thing right now is not what's being said but what's being done. That's what our focus has been about right now. We're going to continue to do that. 

 Q. Coach, what is it like to have a goaltender like Tim Thomas who can stay so focused and not get into the verbal battles back and forth with the opposing team? 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I think, you know, he's been in the zone for the whole playoffs and you can barely count on one hand how many bad goals he's given up in this whole playoffs. That speaks volumes for him. He's come in and decided just to focus on his play and nothing else. He's been outstanding for us and we all know the teams that normally win the Stanley Cup usually have unbelievable goaltending. We feel like we've got that.
