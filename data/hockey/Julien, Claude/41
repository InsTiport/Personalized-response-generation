 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Julien.   
  
  Q. Tough generating offense obviously tonight. Luongo played well, but did you feel like you didn't test him as much as you needed?   
 COACH JULIEN: We didn't. I think a lot of the things that you saw tonight are a lot of the things that you saw in the first two games. Good effort, not good enough. Times where we should have gotten the puck in deep and established our forecheck, wasn't obvious. We turned some pucks over.   
 Give credit to the goaltender. He played well tonight, but we certainly didn't make it as hard on him as we did in the last two games at home. Those are things that I remember the most from this game that certainly we could have done better.   
  
  Q. Coach, why do you think the team hasn't been able to win, either team hasn't been able to win on the road in this series?   
 COACH JULIEN: It is what it is. The two teams that are here are good teams and they don't give home ice advantage away that easily. So they've been good in their own building.   
 I think we've been a decent road team for most of the season, and right now, what we have to do is go back home and create a Game 7 so we get another shot at 'em here.   
  
  Q. Claude, talk about the three power plays you had in the first period and what you thought of them and the decision to use Steven Kampfer more tonight than we've seen in the past on the power play there?  
 COACH JULIEN: He's done a pretty good job in front of the net and he certainly is good at tipping and, obviously, screening. But, you know, I don't think we're capable of doing much with him in front because we weren't getting the set that we wanted to get in the offensive zone. Certainly didn't play in our favor.   
 Had we managed to get control of the puck and move it around and create some shots, he would have been a valuable player up front there where he normally does a good job.   
  
  Q. The thoughts of going home, regrouping, you've done it there before. Is it any different now when you're facing elimination?   
 COACH JULIEN: Not at all. We've been through this, I don't know how many times, so it's not something that's new to us. We've had to regroup all year. I don't think we're a team that's done anything the easy way, so in certain ways, it's not a surprising that we're here in this situation where we got to bring our team back home and create a Game 7.   
 Two of the last three rounds we have been through seven-game series, so our goal right now is to create another one.   
  
  Q. Claude, does it feel like the power play took a couple of steps forward at home and now it took steps back? Is it a recurring theme as far as the playoffs and the season even?   
 COACH JULIEN: The other night, although we didn't score, we had much better chances than we did tonight. Tonight was certainly not a good night for a power play. It wasn't a good night for our whole team, as far as creating good, quality scoring chances. We had some, but the thing, again, that we need to do a lot better is get to that front of the net.   
 We had guys, again, there, but on the side. We need to be a little more aggressive in that area than we were tonight. That's so huge for a hockey club and we need that.   
  
  Q. Claude, your view of the goal there, do you see that as a fortunate bounce off the back with the guys left unprotected or do you think that that's the play they're going for, get the ricochet?   
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I don't think that was necessarily a play they were going for from where the guy shot it to where it came out. He was pretty wide. Normally those pucks from where he shot it don't normally come out there. But nonetheless, you make your own breaks.   
 I think tonight as a whole, they were the better team. We have to, again, acknowledge that, because if we don't, we're not going to be a better team next game.   
  
  Q. Could you comment on how you saw the physical play and some of the "nastiness," for lack of a better word, compared to what happened in the last two games at Boston?   
 COACH JULIEN: I don't think it's anything different. It's a series that has a lot of body checks. I know they dominated and, for the first period at least, I know it was about 21 to 13 or something like that.   
 But with the power plays we had and the way we started off the game, the team that's chasing the team that has the puck the most is going to end up with the most body checks. So you got to be careful how you look at those things.   
 They had an edge tonight. They were in front of their home fans and they seemed to thrive on that. They came out hard and were a committed group.   
  
  Q. Coach, you did a good job of shutting the Sedins down, the big line, but normally you wouldn't think you would get beat by Maxim Lapierre, a six-goal scorer. Is that the strength of that team, they're third line comes up big and ends up winning the game for them?   
 COACH JULIEN: Well, you know, I guess if you want to look at tonight, you look at it that way. Our third line has Michael Ryder and Tyler Seguin who scored a lot, Daniel Paille scored a big goal for us short-handed in Boston. So I don't think their depth is any better than ours. I don't believe that anyway.   
 So it's just one of those nights where one goal was scored and it happened to be from their third line, but it doesn't mean that their third line dominated our bottom two lines. He just happened to be at the right place at the right time.
