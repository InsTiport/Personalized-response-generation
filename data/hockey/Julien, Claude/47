   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Julien. 

 Q. It seemed after the first period Horton takes the big hit, five-minute advantage, you don't score. Did you say anything between periods to totally take control of this game?
 COACH JULIEN: Nothing out of the ordinary. I think, you know, you always make mention about the guy that's gone to the hospital. That I'm sure being there, he'd like to see this team win this hockey game. It's always something to motivate yourself with. 
 But, you know, even that five-minute power-play, again, we talk about the results, and we didn't get the results. But the one thing you can't do is take away our momentum, and it didn't do that. So we're still in decent shape. I don't think we're discouraged more than we realized we had to stay with it. The power-play at least gave us some momentum and didn't take it away. 

 Q. Before the series you heard a lot about how good the Canucks were. You go to Vancouver and lose two games after playing relatively strong. How nice is it to beat this team the way you did?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, what I can say to you in the playoffs, we've mentioned that throughout the whole playoffs since day one, whether you lose a game in overtime or you lose a game 10-0, it's only a loss, in the loss column. So we won by a big score tonight, but it's only a win, and we're still down 2-1. That's the way I've approached it. That's the way I've seen it. 
 What's maybe encouraging is we had our issues on scoring on Luongo. And tonight we managed to find a way to score a lot of goals on him. Certainly good confidence-wise, but I don't think it's any reason for us to think that all of a sudden things have turned around. 
 We expect a tough game next game. I'm sure they're going to want to rebound back the way we did from those two tough losses. 

 Q. How do you feel about Milan Lucic's actions with Alex Burrows? 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I'll tell you what. I said this morning that I wouldn't accept it on our team. It happened a couple of times tonight. They've been told that I don't want any of that stuff. 
 You know, like I said, you got to live by your words. It was disappointing for me to see that happen after what I said this morning. But part of it is my fault for not bringing it up to the guys. They did it. Emotions got the better of them. I'm going to stand here and say I'm not accepting it. The guys have been told. 
 I don't want that stuff in our game. I think we got to be better than that. Emotions are running high. It was a very physical game. There was a lot of stuff going on. You can live with that kind of stuff. But the other stuff, as you mentioned, I don't want to see. 

 Q. Was it your sense that the Rome hit on Horton was a dirty hit in any way? Between the first and second period, was there any sense in the room of rallying or winning this one for Horton?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, there always is when a guy goes down the way he did. I'm sure the guys were in there. I know we talked about it, the fact that Horty is at the hospital right now probably obviously hoping that we win the game. But more than anything else, we were concerned about his welfare. Hopefully it's not too bad. 
 I know I've got the same things that you guys got, that he was obviously moving around. That's all that I've been told. I don't have any more to share with you guys. 
 Looking back at the hit, you say was it a dirty hit. I think what I would call it is it was a blindside hit that we've talked about taking out of the game. He made the pass. It was late. He came from the blindside. Whether it's through the motion of the hit, it appeared he left his feet a little bit. 
 You know, again, that's my view on it. I'm not going to comment more than that. Say what I always say: let the league take care of it. We're trying to clean that out. Let's see where they go with that. 

 Q. If Horty has to miss a game or two, what do you think you would be able to do on that line? 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I mean, we lost a pretty good player. We'll have to move some players around. Right now I haven't really made my roster up for next game. I can't give you that answer right now. 
 But we'll find solutions. We always do. We'll try and get the best fit for that line by next game. 

 Q. When did you get updates on Horton, and when did the players find out how he was doing?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, basically I found out the first time I saw was up on the scoreboard. Then I went in the dressing room between periods and I went in the clinic and asked a little bit more. It was basically the same thing. They didn't know more than what was written there: that he was obviously moving around a little bit. 
 But I think, again, it was a blindside hit. I think everybody has a pretty good idea what the issue is. 

 Q. Could you comment on the special teams both ways. 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, it's been criticized enough, the power-play, anyway. Our power-play, or even for that matter, I think in this series it's been pretty good. Just the fact that, again, when you look at where our issues were before, we had a hard time getting in the zone, had a hard time keeping the puck in. 
 At least now we're getting in, moving the puck around. You'd like to see maybe more shots. At the same time it produced tonight, which was good. 
 Our penalty kill to me has been excellent, even against Tampa. Except for Game 6 where we gave them three goals, our penalty kill has been really, really good for us. That's really helped us survive as far as the power-play struggling. When you're power-play struggles, your penalty kill has to do a really good job in order to at least even things out. They've done a great job at that. 

 Q. Henrik Sedin said he'd rather lose 8-1 than the way you did the other night in overtime. Do you think you get anything more out of winning a game by a lopsided score like this?
 COACH JULIEN: A win is a win and a loss is a loss. What he prefers is his own preference, I guess. As far as I'm concerned, that overtime loss, a lot of people thought it was devastating. I said all along, our team has been through a lot this year. That's not what was going to put us down. 
 We went out there and proved it tonight. That's what we're all about. Maybe if they would have lost that way, would it have put them down? I don't know. Maybe that's what he's saying, they can't handle those kind of losses. 
 What I'm saying is for us it doesn't matter. A loss is a loss and a win is a win. 

 Q. Could you talk about Timmy. He stayed at home tonight. 
 COACH JULIEN: Well, he had a reason tonight to stay in his net. I thought we did a pretty good job of keeping them on the outside. We didn't give them those opportunities coming with lots of speed and shooting and doing things they did in the other games. So I think Timmy just adjusted to the game. That's why we talked about Timmy's game. 
 He didn't change his style. Let's not get this wrong here. He just played the way he had to play. Tonight was a night where he could stay in his net a little bit more. There's going to be nights when he has to come out and challenge, and that's the way he is. 

 Q. The Canucks only have one power-play goal in this series. Without giving away state secrets, what are you doing to shut them down?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, we're doing the right thing obviously. I think we've done a pretty good job of getting in the shooting lanes. We've done a pretty good job of taking away the passing lanes. That's not giving away any secrets. It's what penalty kills have to do. Our guys have done a pretty good job of sacrificing themselves, blocking shots, you saw Soupy Campbell doing it. And Salo shooting the puck. It shows a lot of guts on his part against a guy that shoots the puck that hard. 
 It's about sacrifice. More than anything else, our penalty kill has taken a lot of pride in these playoffs to be very, very good, and has been.
