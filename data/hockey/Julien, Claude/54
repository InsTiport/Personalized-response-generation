 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Julien. 

 Q. Claude, have you seen anything on the Bergeron/Burrows incident?
 COACH JULIEN: I haven't seen it, to be honest with you. I haven't had time to look at that stuff right now. I'm going by what Patrice told me. Obviously there was something that happened. I guess I'll save my comments for after I see it. 
 But if that's the case, it's a classless move, not something players should be doing at this level anyway. 

 Q. Your view on the final goal?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, it's obviously a nice goal by them. I thought for the first two periods we played a pretty even game. Obviously, in the third we just seemed to lack some energy and lost our legs. They just seemed to come at us pretty hard. 
 They kind of took the game over in the third period and obviously found a way to win it with a late goal.

 Q. Just to clarify, did you see it on side or did you feel anything on that?
 COACH JULIEN: I haven't really looked at it. Even if it was or wasn't, wouldn't change the outcome right now. 

 Q. Does it feel like one that got away at this point, given how well your team played?
 COACH JULIEN: Yeah. I think we played a real good road game, to be honest with you. To be in the situation we were after two periods, I didn't mind it, especially against this hockey club. 
 I thought our PK did a great job against their power-play. Timmy made the big saves when he had to. Like I said, for two periods, I was pretty pleased. Obviously, third period they were the better team and they ended up scoring that goal. 
 It got away from us, but we still got an opportunity here in the next game to hopefully get that one and kind of get the home-ice advantage. 

 Q. With both goaltenders playing as well as they did, can you get a sense maybe this is the way the series could play out?
 COACH JULIEN: It's the way it happened tonight. I think it's pretty hard to predict what's going to happen, because throughout the playoffs there's been different situations happen. Some games you get those kind of scoreless games for most of it, and then other games everything seems to go in. We'll take it one game at a time. 

 Q. The power-play and then also just scoring chances in general, some of them got away. How frustrating was it for the team as each one goes on there?
 COACH JULIEN: Again, I think our power-play was better tonight than it had been in a while. We spent a lot of time, we had some shots, had some opportunities, had some chances. We didn't score. Obviously when your power-play isn't doing well, people are going to criticize because you didn't score. 
 But I think the same thing happened on the other side. As long as we're able to stay on even terms with them when it comes to special teams, we're okay with that. 

 Q. Can you assess your team's play in the neutral zone, particularly at even strength. 
 COACH JULIEN: Again, when it was one of those tight games, they certainly had a tight gap. What I didn't maybe like as much from our neutral zone is that we turned too many pucks over just in front of their blueline, didn't get it deep enough for our liking. That's something that wasn't probably at par tonight for a hockey club. 

 Q. Were you surprised by how chippy it was and overall the amount of penalties on both sides?
 COACH JULIEN: Well, I think both teams were trying to make a statement, I would imagine. Although we talked about discipline, we were obviously going to stand up for each other. This was the type of game that was played. 
 I think, you know, like I say, when two teams don't know each other that well, they're facing each other, obviously the buildup to this final, there's going to be some strong emotions out there. Both teams obviously reacted to that.
