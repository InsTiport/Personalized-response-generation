  Q. You must be very happy about the way your team played tonight within the system.   
 COACH JULIEN: Yeah, I think tonight's game probably resembles a lot more of what I think everybody expected from this series, two teams that make it hard for you to score, and I thought our team tonight was very good in regards to that.   
 We made some stronger plays, some better decisions, and seemed a little bit more aware out there of what was going on. So comparing it to last game where I thought it was pretty sloppy, I thought we bounced back well tonight.  
  
  Q. Your thoughts on Patrice Bergeron's game tonight and also the hit he took in the first period, were you momentarily concerned when he took that hit?   
 COACH JULIEN: Not at all, as far as the hit was concerned. If that would have been a concern, I don't think we would have dressed him tonight.   
 When we decided to dress him, he was 100 percent. And we felt confident about that.   
 So that hit certainly wasn't a concern, and when I spoke to Patrice today, when he was cleared, my first question to him was: Are you comfortable coming back? And there was no doubt in his mind. He said, I'm fine, I'm ready to go.  
 And that was something that was important, I guess, for everybody.   
 I really liked the way he played. Obviously, you see the difference he can make for our hockey club faceoff-wise, but also his responsibility at both ends of the ice.  
 His line was definitely better. His linemates obviously felt comfortable because they've been with him all year. So there was some chemistry there. And that certainly helped us tonight. I liked the fact that we had our four lines that were pretty stable and pretty good for us and very reliable.  
  
  Q. Tim said that he's basically a product of the defense in front of him. Do you think he was anything more than that tonight?  
 COACH JULIEN: Tim, we've said so much about Tim, rightfully so. He's been a great goaltender. He makes big saves when he has to. And he's been good. And I guess this is the way this team is. He'll give credit to the people in front of him. And I think it's very deserving, because our team did play well in front of him.   
 But when they had some great opportunities he was also there to make the big saves. So I think it's really tonight one of those games where you want to spread the credit around.
