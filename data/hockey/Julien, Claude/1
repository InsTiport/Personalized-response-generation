Q. Claude, what were the issues with trying to get that bottom six, some rhythm in the game? It seemed like that was a challenge, especially in the first period. 
COACH JULIEN: It was, I think we just had a tough night, when it was‑‑ it's the unfortunate part is that I think we played one of our probably worst games at the worst time. I think it just seemed like it was one of those nights we couldn't get anything going the first period. They were all over us. And it just didn't matter what we tried to do here we just couldn't get it going. 
We obviously didn't deserve to win, and we kind of have to push this aside and unfortunate that it was on a big stage like this, and you would like to have your team give a better performance. But we didn't.

Q. Claude, considering what was at stake here, plus all the build‑up to it, could you put your finger on why you got off on such a rough start?
COACH JULIEN: Well, not really. And that's what happens sometimes. Matt, we have nights where things just don't go your way, and we just couldn't seem to find the rhythm. We couldn't seem to find our game. 
And we know we have challenges, but we didn't want to use that as an excuse and we shouldn't. But they came out really hard. They came out well. They seemed to be on their toes. And they had us on our heels early. As I said, from there I think the only rhythm I saw in our team was when we scored that goal, for about five minutes we seemed to have some life, but then it dissipated again.

Q. Claude, did they give you an explanation on that no‑goal in the second period at all?
COACH JULIEN: All I can say it was probably a quick whistle. The puck was loose underneath his skate. The referee lost sight of it. There was no explanation given to me. I'm just going by what they seemed to indicate the whistle had blown before the puck went in.

Q. Claude, how would you describe the conditions as far as the ice and everything and the boards and whatnot?
COACH JULIEN: I don't know, I think you probably have to ask the players that. Because, again, I didn't really talk about that, because to me it has no impact on our game, when you look at both teams playing on the same ice.
I think that wasn't my concern, more than it was trying to get our team to try and get something going here. So you'll have to ask them.

Q. You're facing a pretty tough stretch coming up with a road trip. How do you want your team to put this one aside and reload?
COACH JULIEN: Well, you don't have a choice. I always say the same thing, you don't have a choice. You've got to put these aside. Things aren't going to get any easier right now. I don't know if we anticipate having anybody back for the next game yet or not. 
So we have to move with what we have, and when you have a lineup you just have to tell yourself you need to be better, and we have to be better as a group. And we're challenged right now, but that's where team comes into play. And you have to play for each other, probably a little bit harder and probably a little bit more determined.
