THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Your team seemed to get stronger in the first and second overtime periods.   How difficult was it to lose when you were playing as well as you were at that point? 
COACH JULIEN:   It's never easy to lose a game when you're in the third overtime period. 
You're right, I liked our first period.   Second period was okay until those three penalties.   Kind of gave them momentum and took it away from us. 
But, you know, I thought that in overtime we got better.   We got a little stronger.   We had some great looks, some great opportunities, we just didn't bury them. 
Eventually somebody is going to score a goal as fatigue sets in. 
Not disappointed in our effort.   There's certain things you're going to want to fix for next game.   But as far as the game's concerned, it was a hard‑fought game.

Q.   What can you tell us about Nathan?
COACH JULIEN:   Nothing right now because there's nothing to say because our doctors haven't finalized the evaluation properly. 

Q.   There's a lot of stars on that Blackhawks team.   Where does Andrew Shaw fit in game planning for this team? 
COACH JULIEN:   Where does he fit in? 

Q.   Your game planning for the Hawks. 
COACH JULIEN:   I don't think we do our game planning around Mr. Shaw.   Our game plan is against the Chicago Blackhawks, so... 
We know he's an agitator.   We know he's good at embellishing, too, at times.   We know all that stuff.   We've done our research. 

Q.   Because you have such a veteran team, does that lessen any concern you have that this could be a devastating loss?
COACH JULIEN:   Not really.   Last time we won the Cup, we lost the first two games to Vancouver.   It never stopped us from coming back.   This certainly won't. 
When you look at the game, it could have gone either way.   I thought we had some real great looks in overtime.   With a little bit of luck, we could have ended it before they did. 
But that's the name of the game.   They got a good break on their tying goal going off one of our skates.   That's the way the game goes.   Some nights you get the break going your way, some nights you don't. 
As far as I'm concerned, two good teams tonight that played extremely hard.   Unfortunately it took a loser and a winner. 

Q.   Do you say anything to Daugavins after that? 
COACH JULIEN:   No, I haven't talked to the players at all. 

Q.   With a guy like Krejci, what has it been like to have him throughout these playoffs?
COACH JULIEN:   Good, because he's been really good for us.   On a hot streak.   Seems to make things happen every game.   Been one of our best players so far in the playoffs. 
He's excelled since the post‑season and continues to do that.
