 Q.   Coach, what did you think of the way your team came out right away in the first period and dictated the pace of the play?  
COACH JULIEN:   Well, that was what we had talked about before the game.   We knew they were going to be a better team, and we had to be better than we were the last game in here.   So we didn't have a better start anyways.   And we got some good bounces go our way and because of that we were able to establish a lead and then we just kind of took it from there.   But sometimes those forecheck bounces go your way, and they did tonight.  
   
 Q.   Did you think when the bounces go all your way, that kind of all avalanches, all kind of runs together and things continue to go your way?  
COACH JULIEN:   Well, you know, the confidence certainly builds pretty quickly.   When you start off with an early lead in the visiting building, you're certainly happy with that start.   
So I thought our guys did a good job of, again, playing a solid game, solid two‑way game, and some great plays.   I mean, Marchand, two goals; Jags, the passes he made and even so that hit in front of our bench, that turned the puck over and allowed Marchand to score a goal.  
He's come in to play for us and he's played well.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of the job Rask did in goal, because it usually seems like when goalies don't see a consistent rhythm of shots, sometimes they can get a little shaky, but he looked steady back there?  
COACH JULIEN:   Like I said, he's been in zone for a while.   He's obviously confident right now.   Puck seems big to him.   And you've got to ride that goaltender when he's like that.  
   
 Q.   What do you tell these guys in what might not have been a scenario they envisioned going back to Boston up 2‑0?  
COACH JULIEN:   It's pretty simple; we were in that situation before, and we were able to come back in the series and win it.   
So I don't think‑‑ we've been through enough positive/negatives, not to get ahead of ourselves and we know this is a good team, and I'm not saying we know it.   Penguins are a good team, they're deep, and we're going to have to continue to play extremely well if we plan on winning the series.  
   
 Q.   I certainly don't expect you to second‑guess the decision of another coach, but were you surprised to see Vokoun check out of the game right there?  
COACH JULIEN:   You're right.   I'm not second‑guessing.   It's a tough enough job that you don't second‑guess.   And I've got too much respect for Dan to even go there.  
   
 Q.   The forecheck, what were you able to do there in the defense zone, causing them trouble in that regard?  
COACH JULIEN:   That's our forecheck.   Our forecheck has been there all year.   And when guys are doing it well, they're putting pucks in the right areas and we've got speed coming through the neutral zone, we were able to establish that.   
But I think it's a big part of our game, and it's gotta be there night in, night out.  
   
 Q.   Might seem a silly question the position you're in, but anything you're concerned about in terms of being up 2‑0, going home, seems like a really good situation for you, any danger of being comfortable with it, I guess?  
COACH JULIEN:   You're not concerned with being comfortable.   If anything building up 2‑0 you've got to be happy.   But the concerns are going to be in our game and after every game, we critique it with the players.   And it's not so much about what we're doing well, we've gotta compete to do that, but there's areas you want to improve after every game, and we're a team that's responded well to that.
