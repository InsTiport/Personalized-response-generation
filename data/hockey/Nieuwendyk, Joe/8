 Q. Safe to say that you are glad to have Langenbrunner back?
 
 JOE NIEUWENDYK: Oh, yeah, we had a lot of jump that first period; spent a lot of time
in their own end. But he's an impact player, he plays with a lot of energy, he's great to
have in the lineup. 
 
Q. Penalty killers also did the job. You have to have a little more discipline?
 
 JOE NIEUWENDYK: That is for sure. We had the momentum going playing in there in almost
the whole period there; middle way through, anyhow, and then we ran into a little penalty
trouble at the end, but our penalty killers are doing a great job for us. Trying to get on
the same page. 
 
Q. Down 2-1, are you still a confident team?
 
 JOE NIEUWWENDYK: Absolutely. We have been here before and people have written us off.
We got a lot of character in this dressing room. We win this one, we are back 2-2. And
that is our focus right now.
