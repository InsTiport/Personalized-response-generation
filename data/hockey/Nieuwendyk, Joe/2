Q.  (Inaudible)?

JOE NIEUWENDYK: Well, I would say my status is doubtful for tonight, and there is no question about that.  I mean, I just have to try and keep getting myself ready to go mentally and physically in case this thing does go on.  I certainly hope it doesn't, but those decisions will be made when they have to.

Q.  Is there anything that makes you feel better about it, any improvement you can tell us about?

JOE NIEUWENDYK: It has improved every day.  There is no question, from two weeks when I got hurt against Ottawa.  It's at a point now where I can do the things that I have to do.  I don't want to be a liability out there.  The team is doing really well, and I'm hoping I don't have to play.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JOE NIEUWENDYK: Well, part of hockey.  I understand these things, and I think it would be a lot more difficult if I didn't really feel a part of it.  These guys treated me unbelievably.  They've made me feel a part of it.  If we do happen to win, I'll be out there on the ice with them, and I'll still enjoy it just as much.

Q.  You've already got one of these rings?

JOE NIEUWENDYK: I've got a couple.  Obviously, you want to be a part of it and it's very frustrating for me.  I have been awful proud of these guys.  I do feel a part of it and I'll hopefully share the moment with them.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

JOE NIEUWENDYK: I think so.  I think I'll know right away like I did the other day when I skated.  I can do everything I can off the ice.  It's when I get on the ice and start driving and doing motions like that, I know in an instant if it's going to go or not.
