JOE SAKIC: We just tried to shake things up, tried to get a five on three.  Obviously some guys thought it was illegal, but I guess it wasn't.

Q.   It didn't look like you guys played a bad game and you had some opportunities.

JOE SAKIC: Obviously we have to be better.  We expected what they were going to do.  They came out hard.  Like I said, they had a good jump early on.  We didn't get anything, and they got the 1-0 lead.  That goal, that was kind of unlikely for us.  But they played well, and we just have to go into Detroit and play better.

Q.   Do you know why you play so well on the road?

JOE SAKIC: Not really, but we hope it continues.  Especially in Detroit we have played three pretty good games and hopefully we will just go in there and play one more.

Q.   (On Hasek's play.)

JOE SAKIC: He made some huge saves for them.  We missed a couple of chances there, but that's the game.  We're going back to Detroit for Game 7.  We've played well there all series and hopefully we can continue to.
