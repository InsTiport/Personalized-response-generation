Q.  Another Game 7, are you tired of them?

JOE SAKIC: Not at all.  I mean, you get enough rest in the off days, and as long as you take care of yourself.  Tomorrow, it's all emotion anyways, and they're going to be high.

Q.  Going into Game 7, what type of a head start do you guys have with Patrick Roy?

JOE SAKIC: Well, obviously for us we're very confident for him.  He's been there.  He always plays his best games when the games are on the line.  I'm sure Detroit is fairly confident with Dominik as well, so it's just going to be a great game.  I look forward to it.
