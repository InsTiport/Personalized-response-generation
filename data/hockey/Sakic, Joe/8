Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
JOE SAKIC: We didn't get that second one.  We had a couple chances in the second period, but for the most part they controlled the game and they deserved that one. 
 
Q.  You guys got that four-minute penalty on Holmstrom.  It looked like you guys didn't take control.  Were the chances not there for you?
 
JOE SAKIC: That was a long time ago: I would have to look back.  I don't know if we had a lot of chances.  If we did, there wasn't that many, but I mean, that was a key moment of the game.  I mean, we could have got another one there. 
 
Q.  Do you guys feel like you had momentum at that point?
 
JOE SAKIC: If we could have gotten another one, yeah, but it didn't happen, and like I said, they just played a lot better than we did tonight.  We were flat. 
 
Q.  How do you explain the shot differential?
 
JOE SAKIC: They were skating and creating a lot of different things, and we were standing around kind of watching.  You can't afford to do that with them. 
 
Q.  Were you guys just not able to generate the offense?
 
JOE SAKIC: I think so.  They had the legs tonight, and we seemed to be flat all night.
