Q. It is a game now.

JOE SAKIC: Yeah, it is. I believe it is 3-2, so we knew it was going to be a high
scoring game, so hopefully we just put a few more in.

Q. What would you say was the strategy, just to get Cujo into it?

JOE SAKIC: We will give him a lot of shots, give him a chance to win the car. So I
think we gave up two shots, so we did our goal.

End of FastScriptsâ€¦.
