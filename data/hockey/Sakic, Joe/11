Q.  Joe, in on both goals, you haven't had a lot of time to get back into this whole rivalry.  Do you see it happening all over again?
 
JOE SAKIC: Yeah, no question we have had two good periods by both teams, and it's going to be a long series and pretty exciting, so hopefully for us we've had two good periods, and hopefully we can keep building and try and get a win here. 
 
Q.  It took the max to get here, both seven-game series against LA and the San Jose Sharks.  Envisioning a third now, it's a tight game.  Any chance to run out of gas?
 
JOE SAKIC: No, I mean this is something you go on adrenaline anyways.  I think we got a good break last series.  Twice we have had two days between games, so that's enough time for anybody.
