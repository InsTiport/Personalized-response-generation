Ohio State   2
  Michigan State   1

THE MODERATOR:   We have Ohio State Coach Rohlik and forward Tanner Fritz and defenseman Drew Brevig.   We'll start with an opening comment from the head coach. 
COACH ROHLIK:   I don't know if you expected anything different between these two teams.   Four games in a row of overtime.   We just knew there was going to be no shootout tonight. 
Two good hockey teams.   Two great goaltenders.   Just not a lot of difference.   Fortunately, we got the bounce at the end. 
I didn't like our start, but I thought we responded after the first period and had a good second, third and overtime.   I thought our guys started to get their legs. 
We're excited to still be playing and have a chance to play tomorrow. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'll start with questions for Tanner and Drew. 

Q.   Drew, what is it like to come home and score that kind of a goal?
DREW BREVIG:   Yeah, it was pretty awesome, especially at that time in the game.   I was glad that the puck found its way through there.   It was definitely a fun night for me there. 

Q.   Tanner, coach mentioned you got off to a slow start.   What did you do to turn things around?
TANNER FRITZ:   Just started playing our game.   We were a little bit nervous at the start, a little tentative.   I think we just started to get our legs moving, pushed the pace on them, get pucks deep, really pressure their defense. 

Q.   Drew, a couple interesting homecomings for you, the outdoor game, then tonight.   Did you have a lot of friends and family here tonight watching?
DREW BREVIG:   Yeah, pretty close to home.   Friends and family supported.   That was very nice. 

Q.   Drew, what did you see in that last goal?
DREW BREVIG:   Fritzie made a great play.   I think he brought some guys with them.   I think they had some chaos out front.   I think the puck had eyes and found its way through. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, guys. 
We'll continue with questions for Coach Rohlik. 

Q.   Halfway through the first period, you're down 1‑0, you don't have a shot on goal.   What changed after that point?
COACH ROHLIK:   Well, we couldn't punt (laughter). 
Frustrated and, again, as a head coach you start to think about all the things you do to try to prepare guys for this. 
Ultimately, I think our guys were on a big stage and they played like it.   For some reason they played tentative.   Again, I tip my hat to Michigan State.   They were all over us.   Definitely was their period.   Was kind of like try to hang on and get through the period almost.   Then we had to talk about it there after the first. 

Q.   Your thoughts going into the game against Minnesota tomorrow.   You had the outdoor game.   Now in this arena, probably pretty one‑sided, the atmosphere.
COACH ROHLIK:   Pretty one‑sided (laughter).   Welcome home, huh? 
We know they've been the top team in the country all year.   Credit to them.   We're just excited we're still playing.   It's a great opportunity for our guys to come out and compete.   It's going to be a great atmosphere. 
We're looking forward to it.   I mean, we got to get better.   We're going to have to play our best hockey game tomorrow night to get the win. 

Q.   You mentioned all the overtime games.   What is it about the matchup with them?
COACH ROHLIK:   You saw the will they have to block shots.   I talked to our guys about it.   There's no fear.   I give lots of credit to Coach Anastos there.   They buy in.   They'll do whatever it takes.   That's a team effort. 
I think it starts with that.   They got a great goaltender and they got everybody that's on the ice buying in to keep that puck out of the net.   That's why they're tight games.   They've done that all year round. 
We're very, very fortunate to get the win tonight. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
