Q.  Adam Oates, give me some kind of read on the amount of emotion that's possessing the team right now.

ADAM OATES: I think both teams are very high.  Obviously you can hear it in the building.  It's obviously a very, very big game.  Big goal by Paul to come back and get us up 3 again.

Q.  He was rocked early, came back into the game and you got him the puck and it's in the net.  Comment on that?

ADAM OATES: It's a huge goal, obviously.  It was a big hit by Scotty.  I didn't see it because I was on.  It laid him out pretty good.  But it was nice for him to come back like that.

Q.  Get your crystal ball out.  One period left here to make this thing happen.  How would you play the game?

ADAM OATES: We're going to keep playing hockey.  We're going to play, play smart.  They're going to come, protect our goalie, and play smart.
