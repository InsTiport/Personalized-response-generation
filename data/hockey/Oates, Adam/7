Q.  Adam, obviously, this is disappointing.

ADAM OATES:  Yeah, it's disappointing. Obviously, we were on such a good roll and to lose four straight was obviously hard.


Q.  What was the difference this series?

ADAM OATES:  A lot of things.  You know, I think they proved to be the Stanley Cup champions. They played really well.


Q.  Talk about Olie and what he has done for this team.

ADAM OATES:  Yeah.  Olie has played great all year long.  He's played in the Playoffs -- played fantastic.


Q.  Is it difficult to look back and reflect on a year that obviously was very, very good for this team?

ADAM OATES:  Yeah, a little difficult. Obviously we're frustrated.  It happened so quick and that's one thing that you learn as you get older and you play in Playoffs:  All of a sudden, it happens pretty fast.  In eight days, all of a sudden, we lost four games in a row.


Q.  You had a great season for the games and the Caps all together had a great season.  You had a great first couple of Playoff rounds.  Tell us about that. 

ADAM OATES:  Yeah, obviously some positive -- some things to build on and the first time this organization's has ever been in the finals.  Very positive.  That's a little hard to think about right at this point.
