Q.  How would you describe the feeling two-goal lead you guys had and you let them come back.  Is it devastating?
 
ADAM OATES:  We are obviously hurting a little bit now.  Such a big game, two 2-goal leads, third period. Obviously the team is feeling really down.  Obviously a blown opportunity.  Why?  I mean, we were obviously let down a little bit in the third period.  We let them come to us and they came strong and it is going to hurt for a little while, but we have been pretty resilient all year long.  We will bounce back in our building.  They are obviously a very solid team. They are very deep.  They played well all year long.  Stanley Cup Champs.  I don't expect them to quit ever. 
 

Q.  Did Steve Yzerman's goal, that had a lot of magnitude to it at the time, it seemed like.
 
ADAM OATES:  Obviously it was a very big goal, but we answered right away.  Tell you the truth, I thought after Joey scored, I thought it was going to be it, because they were so pumped up from the shorthanded, that when we answered 30 seconds later I thought it took all the wind out of their sails.
