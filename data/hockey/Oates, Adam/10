ADAM OATES:  I that it was a pretty good period. They did get a goal, but for the most part, we matched pretty even.  They had a couple of powerplays; we didn't.  But it was pretty even, I thought.


Q.  One of great passers in the history of the game, a lot has been made of the lack of shots by Washington tonight a lot of long shots on Chris Osgood.  Is that part of the strategy?

ADAM OATES:  A little bit.  We are trying to get it in their zone.  They are very smart back there, very good at blocking the neutral zone and you have to try get it in the zone, just get it into the zone and try to forecheck.  And, you know, you have got to give them some credit, too, they are a solid defensive team and we are just trying to throw it in and do some cycling and try and generate some turnovers.


Q.  How about the nervousness in Game 1 that everybody talked about, was it present in this first period?

ADAM OATES:  I don't think so.  I thought a lot of guys felt a lot better today, a little bit more relaxed.  I think it was human nature, last game, obviously, everybody was a little nervous, I thought, a little bit on both teams. Tonight was much more of a normal hockey game, I thought.
