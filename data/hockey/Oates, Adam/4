Q.  Adam, what's the biggest adjustment you guys have had to make?

ADAM OATES: I don't think we scored a lot of goals obviously, but we've played better.  We've managed the puck a lot better.  We put it in better spots so we could get on it.  Our whole goal is to keep it away from Brodeur, but obviously get it in their zone.  I think we've done a better job at it.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Well, I think when you do that, everybody gets their spots and better positions and you get more opportunities for a defenseman to come late kind of thing, or guys in better positions.

Q.  Talk about, Adam, what you expect now on Thursday night.

ADAM OATES: I expect more of last night.  I expect a good hockey game.  They're obviously a good team at home.  We have been the best team on the road.  We've got the best record in the playoffs.  I don't think there is any home-road issue tomorrow.  I think we're feeling good about ourselves.  We just won two in a row.  We're confident, not cocky, but confident.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, I don't think anybody is thinking that way.  I don't think Mike will allow it.  It's one game.  Thursday night is the most important game, and we're just preparing for that.

Q.  How difficult is your mind-set now?

ADAM OATES: Not really any difference.  As I just said, it's one game.  We want to win tomorrow  -- excuse me, Thursday.  We want to win Thursday.  That's what we're preparing for.  That's the biggest game right now.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, it's tough to play after a six-hour flight, but it would be the same for both teams.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, I know what you mean, and possibly.  I've got a feeling they're coming home.  They're going to feel good about their building with their crowd, just like we did.  I don't think the day would matter when it comes to that.  There is definitely something to feel that they're back a little bit even though they've lost momentum.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Well, the centerman who is at home gets to put his stick in last.  Depending on your match-up, I think it favors you.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, obviously a lot better today.  A lot more smiles.  We weren't devastated going back home.  Obviously down 2, but we had a chance to hold serve, and we did that.  We were pretty positive when we went home.  We knew we didn't play our best games, and it had been ten days.  We've obviously played better each game.  Obviously we're in a good mood today.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Tremendous lift.  He's been fantastic all playoffs, as you guys know, started in Game 1 in Detroit.  He's won games for us single-handedly.  It's tremendous to have him back there.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: The good thing about playing every other day is you don't have too much time to think about it.  You're focusing on the game, the next game at hand.  That occupies your brain a lot.  I reflected more after the last series because we had 12 days.  Right now it feels great to be here, and we're going to do our best Thursday night.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: We talk all the time.  He was telling me how he felt after Saturday night after the Masters.  He said the same thing we had been saying.  He went home, did his regular routine because tomorrow is the most important day, go play.  And that's kind of how we are.  We won last night.  Now we've got to get ready for Thursday.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Oh, yeah.  I know that.  Since we beat Detroit, he's been on the bandwagon both ways.

Q.  Could you analyze what went wrong the first time in New Jersey?  Have you corrected it?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, I'm really sure we're going to play better.  I think we are playing better.  We had ten days off.  It was hard to play, and I think timing a little bit  -- the layoff didn't affect us in terms of conditioning but timing.  We didn't play our best games.  We expect to play better that way.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: I think both teams are comfortable with their match-ups.  Obviously we have a couple guys we want to watch, and they put Scott and Rafalski on Paul and have the whole series so far.  There is nothing that the people that are getting shadowed are not used to.  I think both teams haven't really worried about it too much.

Q.  Do you think Jean-Sebastien is in their heads now?

ADAM OATES: I hope so.  He's been fantastic.  Clearly head and shoulders above everybody else.  We're obviously very glad he's played this way for us.  He's so grounded as a guy.  He's been great, and I think we obviously feel he's going to play that way from here on end.  It helps the team's confidence.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, you don't like to talk about that too much.  7 and 0 is a little freaky.  We're obviously glad we have been.  We feel good in overtime.  I don't think anybody ever really feels bad.  We feel very confident in overtime.  We have been very fortunate.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

ADAM OATES: Yeah, I think so.  Both teams are very good defensively.  When they get that goal, obviously, it helps.  If we score first Thursday night, I don't think they're going to fold.  They beat Ottawa in Game 7, right, Ottawa scored first.  They've shown they can come back.  We've shown we can come back, too, in the past.
