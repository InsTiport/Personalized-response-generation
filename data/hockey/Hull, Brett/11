Q.  Who would have thought it?  Did you ever imagine this?

BRETT HULL: Well, I think that's about it.  You imagine and you pray for something like this, but you don't realistically think it's going to happen, and, you know, I can't say we're disappointed, but it's very unexpected, like you said.

Q.  From your way of thinking, what is the credit for what's happened here?  Is it that they've not played well, or is it that your team has completely come together?

BRETT HULL: I think it's we put the onus all on us.  And we've played very good hockey, and we've come up on the short end and we've made some bad defensive errors at the wrong time, gave up some overtime goals that we probably shouldn't have.  But, you know, we played well.  We have controlled the pace of the play and we four check very well, and we just stay and keep doing the things we're doing, and it is Game 7 and it happens.  And fortunately, we've done it early.
