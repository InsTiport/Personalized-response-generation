 Q. Give me the sense of you guys after one period tied at one.
 
 BRETT HULL: Good. We played a heck of a lot better than we did in Game 1 and still too
many turnovers in our end and if we can eliminate those, we are going to be fine. I don't
think I'd believe the shot clock if I were you. 
 
Q. Looks like your goaltender is feeling a little bit better tonight.
 
 BRETT HULL: He has been playing great for us all year and even last year when we won
the Cup so we have got a lot of faith in Eddie. You can't be perfect every night. We have
got a lot of faith in him and everyone else. We just have to go out create less turnovers
-- or create more turnovers and give away more -- less.
