Q. What do you see through two?

BRETT HULL: I think it has been a great game so far. A lot of quality chances and a lot
of good play on both sides, and it is going to be who makes the biggest mistake probably.

Q. Every indication that if you stay in this situation, they will shorten the bench,
you get more time, do you welcome that?

BRETT HULL: Always. I think you want to be out there especially in situations like
this. If you don't you are in the wrong business. Hopefully we get one, and go from there.
