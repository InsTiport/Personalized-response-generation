Q.  Your team is like a chameleon; you come out flying in Game No. 2 and then you smother them in the opening period of Game 3.  Are you pleased with this first 20 minutes?

DAVE LEWIS:  Oh, yes, very much so.  We knew they were going to come out with a lot of energy; try to get the puck in deep on us.  We didn't let them set up much of a forecheck at all.  First goal by Tomas Holmstrom was a big plus coming out of the first period.


Q.  Kozlov looks pretty good.  How is his situation?

DAVE LEWIS:  Yeah, he is getting very well.  John Wharton, our trainer, worked with him all day yesterday and today.  He was iffy going into the warmup tonight, but he has responded very well.  He feels 100%.
