Q.  (INAUDIBLE)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Kind of, I mean, when it gets to the end of a round, you just don't know what is going through your mind.  He kind of gave my a wink.  I sort of got the feeling that they were going to take me and they did. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  I still had doubt.  The doubts are still there.  I was just thinking, wow, maybe that would be great, hopefully -- the people I live with, I guess, supposedly saw my name on the back of a Jersey and they had already been feeling pumped up and one of the scouts gave me a wink and right there and then I kind -- hopefully not messing with my mind, but it turned out great. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Yeah, finally happened.  I separated my shoulder in November, never got -- was out six weeks, came back out in the juniors, wasn't 100%, but, hey, that happens and New Jersey must have seen something, so hopefully I can prove them right. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Oh, yeah, it doesn't matter no more. I am sure -- people made a big deal about me slipping all that, it happens, so -- 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  That was it.  The first serious injury I ever had.  And, I guess, you know, took a back seat and finally then God -- has been fortunate to let me play all these years without getting hurt, it finally happened but just have to move on. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  I have known Mike -- we have played each other since growing up all these years in Canada.  And when I was still working in the college and he was going to Michigan -- at least I will know someone.  It too actually pretty cool if you think about it. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Yeah, at this point haven't even thought about it.  Whatever they want me to play, I play it at this point, so, if they needed a goalie, I am sure I would suit up.  So it doesn't matter. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Yeah, there is talk about wing - there is always talk about whether I could play or not.  When you get to this point, when you get to this level, whatever it takes, I think that is the attitude you have got to have. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  No, not yet.  When I talked to him in meetings and stuff, they talk about, you know, they like the way I play; they like my style and stuff, but, no, they never talked about what position. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Create offense, I can find the open guy.  I need to work on strength, a little defense, but definitely, you know, there is room for improvement. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
SCOTT GOMEZ:  Yeah, I grew up in Alaska.  Born in Anchorage, Alaska.  My dad is Mexican.  My mom is Columbian.
