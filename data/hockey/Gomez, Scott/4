Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT GOMEZ: The first couple of games we got them and they played great at home, and once you get into overtime.

Q.  Have you ever seen a goal like the one that Marty had, the second goal?

SCOTT GOMEZ: Yeah, I've seen worse.  It happens, but it didn't affect us one bit.  It's Marty.  That guy,  he can let in two and no one would even ever question him because it's Marty.  We let that go right away, and it's part of the game.

Q.  What was different with them tonight?

SCOTT GOMEZ: They came back at home.  Everything we expected.  They played a great game.

Q.  What did they do differently tonight?

SCOTT GOMEZ: Anytime you play at home, your emotion is going to be a little different.  They got the puck in.  They were going there.  Their key guys were going all night, and you've got to give them credit.  It's 2-1.  They won their home ice, and now we've got to get one.
