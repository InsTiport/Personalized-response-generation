 Q. Beautiful assist on a 4-own-4 goal. Can you go through it?
 
 SCOTT GOMEZ: Scotty made a good play moving the puck up. I didn't have complete control
of it and I saw how it is flying and I think the only way I got it to him was to kick off
my skate; got a little lucky and Alex has been shooting great and it was a nice goal. 
 
Q. Eddie Belfour looks different tonight. A lot tougher to beat him, you think?
 
 SCOTT GOMEZ: Oh, yeah, the whole team we knew they were going to come out. We knew that
doesn't happen usually when you play the defending champs to come out and score that much.
We got to stick to our game plan. We know it is not going to be that easy and hopefully
get the bounces again.
