Q.  Congratulations, can you you say a few words about getting your dream?

STEVE YZERMAN:   It is unbelievable.  It's been a long time in Detroit-- been a long time for me.  Detroit's been wild here, up and down for a while.  We got going on the Playoffs. It is unbelievable.


Q.  When was the turning point that got you early in the Playoffs, I know you at the All-Star game I kept trying to offer you a drink.  You have been on a mission.  It seems all year--

STEVE YZERMAN:   I think maybe in the Anaheim series in the second round where we had some post games, low scoring games that we won in overtime in double overtime, and one in triple, I think that got us going.  Then going to Colorado the first two games there to play well and get a victory, I think that really got us really going.


Q.  Stanley Cup is going to be over your head in a minute?

STEVE YZERMAN:   Thank you.


Q.  Joey, we are all he, gets the win as it turns out. Just can't over the fact that at Christmastime you are playing with the Alumni and here you are to another Stanley Cup.  What do you feel?

JOEY KOCUR:  Alumni team must be getting ready this I got a chance to play with a lot of guys that were here in 1955.  This city is going to go crazy, hopefully it is all safe and we are going to have a lot of fun.
