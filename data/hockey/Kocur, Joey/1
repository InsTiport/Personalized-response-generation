Q.  Terry Gregson appears to be calling this one by the book.  Does that interrupt the flow of the game as the Wings are concerned?

JOEY KOCUR:  There is no question.  We got our powerplay going.  I am sure we would love him to call all the penalties, but seem to do our best when we just rolling with four lines and six defensemen.


Q.  Much better period for your team in the second. What was the way you tried to turn it around?

TIM HUNTER: We were really disappointed with our effort in the first.  One shot is horrendous in this building, Stanley Cup Finals, the guys came out; we were much more determined, more physical; just got to be a little more persistent at the net and find one.


Q.  I would think finishing this thing is now the key.

TIM HUNTER:  That is right.  We have got to find a way to get one and tighten it up here and hopefully, you know, they are going to change their game if the score is a little tighter, 1-1 game.
