Q.  Is the feeling that you think your career is over and you get yourself psyched up an and maybe you appreciate it even more the second time around?

JOEY KOCUR:  There is no question.  When you see the end is near and you get a second lease on life, so to speak, you make the best of it and you notice all the little things that happen.  Stuff that maybe you didn't see your whole career playing.  Now you notice because it is not going to be around for long.


Q.  Stuff like what?

JOEY KOCUR:  Things -- the way fans treat you; comp tickets here and there, that when the career is over, those people forget about you pretty quick.  

Q.  What did Scotty tell you when you came here last year?  Did he tell you play a little differently?  

JOEY KOCUR:  He is a different style of coach.  He doesn't want you to go and start fights and play that style of hockey.  He feels if we go out and start fights, it is going to change the style of the game and this team isn't suited for that.  Our team stands up for ourselves - stand up for each other, but not to go out and create things.
