   HAL GILL: Couple good chances. We thought we'd bear down on them and it will be nice to get back home.

 Q. What do you need to do better? 
 HAL GILL: Instead of hitting the post, we have to hit the net. Hockey is a funny game, and we have to make the bounces go our way. 
 But, you know, it takes a lot of hard work, and we've got to stick to it, and make sure that we're in the right position to get the bounces.

 Q. You're down two games. 
 HAL GILL: I think we've proven that tonight I think we outplayed them. 
 Last year we got outplayed pretty badly. And we have to go back home thinking of what are we going to do? Right now, I think we know what to do. We've just got to keep sticking to it, and things are going to go our way.
