 Q.  Did you start to get worried you might fall even further?

You know, it's a special place.  I I would love to play with them and we'll see what's going to happen.  I will do anything for it and hopefully it will be good.   
 Q.  Is there more motivation when you play teams like MontrÃ©al, Ottawa?  
FILIP ZADINA: Yeah, I'm telling my agent if they will pass on me, I will fill their net with the puck.  Yeah, it's just I want to prove (to) them that they have done like bad decision.  But I'm so glad that I am in Detroit right now, so I just want to prove to prove to Detroit that they have got a pretty good decision.
