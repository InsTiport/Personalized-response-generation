ERIC DESJARDINS:  As a team, we are trying right now as a team.  That is how we are going to come back, as a team. And, it is not the time to be pointing fingers.  We will let you guys do that at the end. 
 

Q.  Are you frustrated now?  Angry?
 
ERIC DESJARDINS:  Of course there is a little bit of frustration.  But, it is no time right now to be upset or feel sorry about it, feel sorry for ourselves.  That is something we have got to come back.  We have got to be positive and we will  -- we know it can be done and we know we had success on the road. 
 

Q.  All the personnel changes that have been made ( (INAUDIBLE)
 
ERIC DESJARDINS:  I think we have done it all year with the players we have right now and this time of year you are going to bring one guy or another guy that is going to make a difference or he is going to do miracles -- we did it with the guys we have here.  That is how we are going to come back and do the same thing.
