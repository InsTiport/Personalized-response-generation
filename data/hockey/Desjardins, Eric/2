Q.  Was it an emotional meeting --

ERIC DESJARDINS:  A little bit of both, I think. There's times you get emotional a lot and -- but at the same time we know what is wrong and we know we have to change and that is what we discussed.


Q.  Do you feel like there is any confidence left in the team?

ERIC DESJARDINS:  Of course.  We have pride and there is a lot of good things left in this team.  And, we know we can win one game.  That is the only way we can do this by winning one game.


Q.  There has been a lot of focus on what Eric has not been able to accomplish in this series.  Is that not fair because he is the star this team?

ERIC DESJARDINS:  If it is fair?


Q.  To single him out?

ERIC DESJARDINS:  Not really.  I think, of course, he is our leader.  He is the best player.  But, it is not only him to blame.  You win as a team and you lose as a team.  Of course you need your big guns to carry you in rough times.  But, again, we are humans and they need help from everybody, from the guys on this team.


Q.  How did you decide to have a meeting?

ERIC DESJARDINS:  We just had a meeting with the coach and we just -- when he left, we just decided that it would be good to talk a little bit.
