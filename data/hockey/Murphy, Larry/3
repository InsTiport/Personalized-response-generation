LARRY MURPHY:  I don't know if we shut them down.  I think Ozzie played real well and the opportunities we had, made some great saves.  They got more opportunities than we hoped to give them.  Their shot total was low, but I think they had a lot more scoring chances than you first think --


Q.  It seemed to build in the third period, they got more and more?

LARRY MURPHY:  Yeah, they got some real key, some real sharp chances.  We got the lead and we didn't play as well as we should have after that.  They got their legs.  In the second period you could see that they are playing -- they are starting to feel comfortable again in the fact how they carried the play.


Q.  What did Scotty say to you in the second period?

LARRY MURPHY:  I mean, it was a pretty obvious situation, we needed to try to come out and play, build on the first period; that is what we tried to do.  We weren't successful at it.


Q.  How much of this game is a learning experience considering you don't know the Caps that well?

LARRY MURPHY:  It was definitely a feeling out process.  Always happens in the first game of a series.  When we play teams from the other conferences - you just don't see them that often.  I think that was the situation early in the game.  As we got in the second period, things started to pick up.
