LARRY MURPHY:  We hung on.  I thought we handled it pretty well after they tied it up.  I wouldn't say we took the play back by any means, but we held our own.  Get a goal scored on you at that point in the game, it was pretty hard to take.  We hung in there pretty well.  We didn't collapse.


Q.  You guys seemed pretty confident, they come back and score and the momentum going but you guys seemed --

LARRY MURPHY:  I didn't feel too comfortable out there, one goal lead, it could evaporate pretty quick which it obviously did.  We were hoping to get the second one and we weren't able to do it and they persevered and got back into the game.


Q.  You guys seem to just -- you don't fall apart.

LARRY MURPHY:  I thought we handled it pretty good. It wasn't a case of going out there and taking the play off. It was just kind of -- we didn't totally collapse and hung on pretty tight there and the difference was -- Sergei's play was obviously huge.  It was a timely goal.  Tonight's game you chalk it up to, I thought, two teams played well, played probably balanced play and but Sergei makes the big play to win the game.
