Q. How are you?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah, I'm happy at the moment.  I was a little surprised but I heard that they are looking for center, so I hope that they choose me and they choose.  So I'm so excited at the moment.
Q. Did you meet them often?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Last time we were in Combine.
Q. Inaudible.
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: No.
Q. Inaudible.
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah, it's a great feeling.  I think the biggest thing that I get in a great team.  So I'm very excited to go there.
Q. Did your performance at the championship change expectations?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Of course, I think that helps.  I think that's the only good thing.  I think if the team plays well, players are better, yeah.
Q. How would you describe yourself?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: I'm mostly a play maker I think.  I love to find the passing lanes.  That's my thing but I also have a good shot.  I need to use it a little bit more I think but yeah, I'm a big guy.  I love to go in the corners and battle hard.  That's my thing, yeah.
Q. When do you see yourself playing with this team?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: That's hard to say.  I just go day by day.
Q. Most people think it's two or three years.  Would you agree?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: It can be.  What I say, day by day.
Q. What's your contract status?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: I have two more years.
Q. And your father is the coach?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah.
Q. How is that being coached by your own dad?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Sometimes we have fun moments but (laughter) I think we are doing really well.
Q. Do you go to the games together and drive home together?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah.
Q. What's the drive home like when you don't play well?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: That's not nice.
Q. What's his influence been on you as a player, growing up, former player, someone involved in professional hockey?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Of course this helps a lot.  I get good advices every day.  That's big thing to me.
Q. Do you know Zach?  Have you ever met him?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: I know him but I haven't met him.
Q. Did you follow -- you're pretty young but did you follow his career at all?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah, some games, but I was so young.
Q. You obviously know what his history is with this organization?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah, I know.
Q. Do you hope to have the same impact he had on the MontrÃ©al Canadiens some day?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Yeah, I hope some day I will be as good as him.  That's my mission.
Q. What have these last couple days been like for you?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Excited.  I'm a little nervous at this moment.  I think I'm doing really well at the moment.  (Laughter).
Q. Did you have any expectations before the draft?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: Wasn't any special interest to me I think.  We were just in the pool, in the hotel with my friends and I think wherever I go is a good place to me.
Q. Inaudible.
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: My family and my agents, so there's ten or something.
Q. This is an organization that's had a gaping hole at center for quite some time and has always been -- they need to fill it.  I know it's a long-term thing but are you feeling any pressure to be that guy?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: I think I'm the cool guy.  I don't take pressures.  I think everywhere I go, it's just hockey.
Q. Do you think your value over the last few years --
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: If the team plays well, then better -- playing better.  We win gold, so I think that was the big thing.
Q. Have you spoken English for a long time?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: It helps me a lot, last year we had a few USA players on our team.  I spoke with them and that's helped me.
Q. Will you start playing at center full-time to prepare for the NHL?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: That's why I played winter last year because I was the youngest center in our team and we had many centers in there.  So they put me in the wing.  But I think that was good thing, too.  It's good if you can play many positions -- yeah, if I want to play center, we speak that at the breakfast table (laughter).
Q. Did you have any conversation with Artturi Lehkonen?
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: No, actually I haven't met him but I hope I will.
Q. Inaudible.
JESPERI KOTKANIEMI: I think that's possible to play.
