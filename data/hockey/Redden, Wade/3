Q.  How do you feel?

WADE REDDEN:   It's feeling pretty good, actually.  I didn't go on the ice today, just to rest it.  You know, it's been positive.

Q.  Will you play tomorrow?

WADE REDDEN:   Yeah, sure. 

Q.  How did it feel after, having to go through the whole game?

WADE REDDEN:   Yeah, it responded well.  Right after the game, it was feeling good and even this morning, waking up, it felt good.  So obviously it wasn't as serious as we initially thought it was but it responded well. 

Q.  What do you guys need to do in Game  4 to get even in the series, as opposed to what you did last night?

WADE REDDEN:   Well, I think we've got to come out like we were in the third.  I think we played a lot better.  You could just see, I guess, the energy we had.  We were skating a lot better.  We weren't looking around.  We were just going out there and playing and then making things happen.  I think earlier in the game, we were waiting around a bit too much I think, and then looking too much instead of just moving forward.
