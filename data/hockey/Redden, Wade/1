 Q.  Obviously disappointment after getting the lead and being dominant in the first? 
 WADE REDDEN:  Yes, good start for us.  We got off what we were doing early, second period they had a lot of the play.  And still in good spot after two, but, again, just a few mistakes and it cost us and real disappointing. 

 Q.  Knowing it may be 3-1 being able to play with them quite a bit and still being down so far in this series? 
 WADE REDDEN:  I think that's - I don't think we can take much solace in that, the fact that every series it's close.  I mean throughout the playoffs and it's always a bounce here, there.  You obviously have to work hard to get anything done out there.  
 And disappointing just because I think we weren't as good as we could be, and we're going to have to have a great game Wednesday night, come back home. 

 Q.  Can you describe what happened, what turned out to be the winning goal on that change? 
 WADE REDDEN:  Bad decision, neutral zone, I think.  Jumped on the ice, kind of look up and should have just probably backed off, obviously, and underestimated the quickest guy in the league as far as getting to the puck.  So bad read and cost us. 

 Q.  What happened between the first and second period?  I know that's an easy question to ask, but anything tactically change?  Were you doing anything differently? 
 WADE REDDEN:  Well, just didn't execute, I think.  They obviously after the start they had probably felt pretty good about being down 1-0 and came out with a good second.  They were in our zone quite a bit early forced us to take some penalties.  We need to focus on finding a complete game down there and getting the series back to Ottawa.
