Q. There are a lot of teams, obviously, that you play in the National Hockey League that play with an edge.  Where do the Ducks rank in terms of that in terms of their physicality and their willingness to push the envelope?
COLTON SISSONS: I think they're up there.  In my experience, obviously, they are battling and playing physical.  And there is some stuff, extracurriculars after the whistle, that they're trying to use just to get us off our game and try to get us undisciplined.  So I think we've done a pretty good job staying disciplined so far.
Q. As a player, what is that process like?  We're all humans, if someone jabs you, you want to jab them back.  How do you restrain yourself from retaliating in certain situations?
COLTON SISSONS: Just holding yourself accountable.  As a teammate, you don't want to let your team down and put them in a bad spot, putting ourselves on the penalty kill.  And that's all it is.  We know that we can't be doing stuff like that in retaliation penalties.  So that's all it is, just being accountable to your teammates.
Q. When you guys get a chance to watch the Ryan versus Ryan battle, it's certainly captured the attention of a lot of people.  What's it been like to watch those guys go at it head to head here?
COLTON SISSONS: That's Playoffs written all over it.  Obviously there's some bad blood there and they've been competing hard and battling all series.  And it's only going to get escalated from here.
