 Q. Maybe just your thoughts on the game and what it meant to you, especially getting through the first period, a couple difficult stops early on there, and your impressions of that game, what it means to you.   
CAREY PRICE: Well, it was definitely nice to get a few shots off the get‑go and start to get a feel for the game. Obviously, as the game went on, we started to feel more comfortable, and I thought our team play was very good tonight.   
   
 Q. How different was this game from Sochi? I know it's two years ago and different sized ice, but how different was the play in front of you from what you remember from the Olympics?   
CAREY PRICE: It's very similar. Obviously the ice is different, so everything happens a little bit quicker. There's less time for our guys to hold on to the puck, but I thought our guys showed a lot of poise, made it really difficult for them to come up the ice. That's the type of hockey that we play. We make it hard to get on the offensive side of us and make it really difficult to come up the ice. You know, our puck pursuit was relentless all night. I think that's what provided the result that we got.   
   
 Q. The team that wins this tournament is going to tell us at the very end that they came together quickly, they gelled quickly, etcetera, that kind of stuff. As a player, as a goalie, when do you see that kind of stuff happening? Is it what we saw tonight or is it other stuff off the ice?   
CAREY PRICE: It's a combination of both, I think. Guys get together off the ice and get to know each other and get the feel for each other's personalities. I think that leads to good chemistry on the ice. The type of personality that every player has and how to approach them and how to talk to them, you get a feel for their game‑time personalities.   
And as far as on‑the‑ice chemistry, I know we have a lot of champions on this team that know how to play hockey the right way, and it shows. Everybody plays gritty, everybody plays composed, and everybody buys into what the game plan is, and that's the reason that Hockey Canada is so successful at every tournament that we go to.  
   
 Q. The first save in the first minute of play, that could have been a goal. When you have to make a save like that, the first one of the game, what's going through your head, and how aware were you of how great a save that was?   
CAREY PRICE: I don't try to overthink things and overcomplicate things. I think that's something I've improved on over the last couple of games. It just comes down to preparing the right way and just letting your instincts take over. It was definitely nice to kick one out in the first minute and kind of start feeling good and just kind of let it roll from there. Just a reaction save, just tried to boot one out, and it hit me.  
   
 Q. Can you say a few words about the way Sidney Crosby played today? He was unbelievable.   
CAREY PRICE: Yeah, well, he's an unbelievable player. He's a world‑class player for a reason. He plays the game hard. He plays the game with a lot of pride. That's the type of player that if you're a young kid watching how to play hockey, that's the way you do it. You know, that's all I really have to say about that.   
   
 Q. Going back to Sochi, you haven't given up a goal in almost four games now. Is that something that aside from winning that you take a lot of pride in and that's really a goal for you is to‑‑  
CAREY PRICE: Yeah, not just me, though. Hockey Canada is really‑‑ we play very good defensive hockey. We make it really difficult to score goals. It's just‑‑ look at the roster and how many championship players there are on this team, and there's a reason why they're champions. They play the game the right way. They're on the right side of the puck at the right time. It's just a Hockey Canada staple to make it difficult to score. It's a real pleasure to play behind.
