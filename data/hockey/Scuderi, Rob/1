  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Rob Scuderi.

Q.   (No microphone.)
ROB SCUDERI:   I don't think it's so tough now because we've lost a game, we've kind of let them back in the series a bit.   I think if anything should refocus us is the fact they outplayed us in Game4.

Q.   What is it about this team on the road?   How do you continue that tonight?
ROB SCUDERI:   I think we just play simple, play smart, play our game.   We've been down a couple times, but we always feel that we have that confidence, if we just continue to play the right way, that we'll get back into any game.   It's served us pretty well so far.

Q.   Were they hard to handle down low?
ROB SCUDERI:   I think so.   I noticed the forecheck was a lot more aggressive.   I noticed they tried to send their first two guys in pretty hard.   I don't know if it caused a lot of turnovers, but it was a lot more physical.   We took a lot more hits on the defensive side of things. 
I can't remember if it led directly to a goal, but they certainly put an emphasis on it. 

Q.   How important is getting that first goal? 
ROB SCUDERI:   I think it's just a confidence booster.   You're playing not defensive, but you're just kind of waiting.   You're trying to play, trying to do your best, see what happens.   When you get that first goal, it's a little bit of confidence, a little bit of a boost.   You feel your hard work paid off. 
Usually the team with the lead plays more confident.   It would be good if we get the first one tonight, too. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Rob.
