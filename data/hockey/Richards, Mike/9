Blackhawks  Â– 4
  Flyers - 3

 Q. Mike, a roller coaster ride all the way through, wasn't it? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It was. It was a tough game. We had a lot of opportunities. We missed the net on a lot of them. He made a bunch of big saves. 
 They threw everything at the net. At the end they got the last bounce. 

 Q. Was your approach to overtime as specific as it looked? Throw everything early? Press forward early on? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Yeah, I think as the third period went on, that's when we had the most success. Just getting pucks to the net, creating scrambles and getting it back. That's what we did in overtime. It happens every time you seem to have control of the overtime. They go down and they capitalize on one of their chances. 

 Q. Mike, so close. How much does this hurt? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It hurts a lot. 

 Q. Mike, when you talk about the roller coaster of the bigger picture of this season, this team predicted in October to make a Cup run, it didn't look like it was coming together for a while. How proud are you of what you were able to pull together as group and do? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It was a good learning experience for us. I mean, you have to take out of it what it takes to win. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. 

 Q. Do you believe most great players and most great teams have had to at least been hurt once and felt this kind of sting to make a push the next level? I know it's early to talk about the loss and the positives, but do you think this is a bit of a necessary step? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: I mean, I hope so. We went through a lot this year as a group. I can't analyze the season right now, but like I said, we went through a lot. We've gone through a lot together. When you go through stuff like that, I think it brings the group closer together. 

 Q. Mike Richards, thanks for everything. 
 MIKE RICHARDS: No problem.
