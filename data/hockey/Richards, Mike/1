    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Mike Richards.   
   
 Q.   What is so special about this Kings team right now?   
    MIKE RICHARDS:   Right now or always I guess?   
    Ever since I came to this team, it's always been a team that has fun around each other, fun to go to the rink, enjoys each other's company.   It's no different to this day.   We seem to be a big family.   
    I know a lot of people say that.   I've been on some close teams, but this is probably the tightest knit group that I've been a part of.   I think it shows on the ice how hard everyone plays.  
   
 Q.   Talent‑wise what is special?  
    MIKE RICHARDS:   Well, we can start with Quicky, one of the best goaltenders in the world, and Drew, one of the best defensemen in the world.   Then you go to centers and have Kopy, one of the best centers in the world.   
    That's a pretty good start, I think.   
   
 Q.   Could you talk about how big your goal was?   How big a lift did that give you guys?  
    MIKE RICHARDS:   I think Cart's goal was the big one.   In a series, we haven't played well off the start.   I thought we played a pretty good first period.   To get that at the end of the period made us feel good going to the dress the room.   
    Any time you can increase your lead I think it's important.   Muzz got the one in the second, and then another one late in the third.   
    We're a team that plays a lot different I think when we have the lead and we play with confidence.   We don't sit back.   We just keep pushing.   I thought we did a good job of that tonight.   
   
 Q.   You've come back from a 3‑0 deficit in these playoffs in the first round.   How much is that in your mindset that you're up 3‑0?  
    MIKE RICHARDS:   Well, we know it's possible.   The last game's always the hardest.   No matter what series or what the series is at, it's always the hardest to do.   
    We played a good game.   We're going to have to play a better game if we're going to want to have success.   
    It's a good hockey team over there.   We're fortunate right now to get some bounces.   Hopefully that continues.   
   
 Q.   You guys were out‑shot by a wide margin.   What is the confidence level that this group has when you know that Jonathan Quick is behind you?  
    MIKE RICHARDS:   Yeah, he made a bunch of big saves in the first.   Gave us a chance to get the lead for him.   When he's on top of his game, which he is most of the time, I think that allows us to make plays with confidence.   
    When we can make plays, knowing if something happens, he's back there to save us.   When we start making plays and we're confident with the puck, I think that's when we play our best.   
    THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Mike.
