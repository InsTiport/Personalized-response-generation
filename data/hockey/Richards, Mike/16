Blackhawks  Â– 2
  Flyers - 1

 Q. How disappointed are you to be going home 0-2? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It's disappointing. We had opportunities in the third period. We had a mediocre second period, and it cost us. We were doing a lot of good things in the third period. 
 We were doing a lot of good things near the end of the game, getting shots, getting pucks deep. It's got to be there as a consistent sixty minutes next game. 

 Q. What do you think this does confidence-wise to the team? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It's tough. Obviously, not the way we wanted to start the Series. But going home, I said all along, we played well there. We feel very comfortable playing there. So we have to go in and play like we have been lately. 

 Q. What was the difference in this game than the last game in physical battles, et cetera. 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Yeah. It was a tough Playoff hockey game. The refs let us play. They did a good job. It was just a good hockey game. Unfortunately, we had lapses in the second period that we didn't do the things that we needed to do, and eventually it cost us the game. 

 Q. How about the thoughts on both goaltenders tonight? Different games? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Both of them played well. Leights kept us in there early. Niemi kept them in there late. Both good goaltenders and played well. 

 Q. Do you take some solace in the fact these have been two pretty tight hockey games? The last 90 seconds you were in both of these games to tie it up. 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It's just a bounce here or there. Unfortunately, they're getting them right now. But we have to work harder to create some for ourselves. 

 Q. Mike, has Niemi played some of his best hockey in the third period of both of these games? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: He's played well. He's made saves, obviously to keep us off the scoreboard in the third. We just have to bear down a little bit stronger on the net and get the puck up. 

 Q. Can you talk about Carcillo's play? It seemed like there was a bit more energy right off the bat with him out there, and how you felt having him back there? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: He's a guy that brings energy, momentum. He hits everything that moves. He creates a lot. He played well tonight. He stepped into a tough situation. Hasn't played in a couple of games. Eventually carried us through the first little bit and gave us some energy in the second half. 

 Q. How about Eager on the other side? Did he get under your guys' skin? Especially with Pronger at the end of the game? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: I didn't really see what happened at the end. He's actually a good player. I played with him for a while. His skill level has been big. He's obviously a strong guy. So a guy that I think we have to try to stay away from and not let him take us away from the game. A guy we have to know who's on the ice when he's out there. 

 Q. 2-1 game. Similar styles to Game 1?
 MIKE RICHARDS: I just talked about that. 

 Q. You've been in some tough spots regular season and Playoffs. How does this compare being down 0-2 to the Hawks here in the Stanley Cup Finals? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: It's a position, unfortunately, that we're familiar with. And obviously not the way we want to go home, but in a situation where we can't get discouraged. We have to build off of how well we played at home lately. And get ready for Game 3. In the second period we had some lapses. Unfortunately it cost us.
