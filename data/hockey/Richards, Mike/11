Blackhawks  Â– 7
  Flyers - 4

 Q. What happened first period? It wasn't like you guys at all. 
 MIKE RICHARDS: We came out slow. We came out tentative. Didn't move our feet and turned a lot of pucks over. We got all our success this series was not turning pucks over, getting the puck in deep, hitting their defensemen and we had none of that going on in the first period. 

 Q. I know you're disappointed in the result. Are you disappointed in the way you came out and the way you played this game? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: I'm disappointed, obviously, in everything about the game. Seven goals is obviously a lot to give up. Came out slow. Didn't move our feet. 
 I don't think we had the physical presence as we did in the past couple of games. And it's unfortunate, but we have an opportunity on home ice to bring it to seven. 

 Q. Michael, I think a lot of people thought you were going to feed off Game 3 and Game 4. Are you surprised you weren't able to carry that over? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Like I just said, it's something we're obviously disappointed about. Maybe we might have been a little bit cocky and might have thought we had to throw our sticks on the ice, but obviously not the case. 

 Q. Change in lines make a difference there for them at all? Their line changes? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Must have. They scored seven goals. 

 Q. Chris Pronger has had such a good series. I guess tonight he's on for six of the seven, the other one he's in the box. Is that one of the games for the defensive pairing? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: I mean, it was one of those games where they got a lot of the bounces, and we didn't. We had some opportunities early. They capitalized on pretty much everyone of their chances. Pucks off the boards. Pucks off sticks. I guess you can say it's just one of those games. 

 Q. What's the message from the leadership group? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: Just play better than today. Play like we did, what gave us success. Stop turning pucks over to a great offensive team. 

 Q. Mike, this team has always responded with their backs against. Against the wall. Are you pretty confident you can do that again? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: I think so. I mean, we have to. Obviously it's an important game to say the least on Wednesday. We have some time to recover here. We have some time to look at some things and do things differently. 
 But overall, it's just us playing hockey and playing the Flyer hockey that we've been prone to to have success. 

 Q. What did you think of the play of Leighton and Boucher coming in for the penalty periods? 
 MIKE RICHARDS: We just came out slow -- just came out slow, didn't move our feet, and turned pucks over. Gave a lot of stressed attacks. Gave them a lot of great looks at the net and great shots. They went in. It was just us leaving a goaltender out to dry. 

 Q. Thanks, Mike.
