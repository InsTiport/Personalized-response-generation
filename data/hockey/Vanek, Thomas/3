Q.  Anyway to explain how important it is for Austria, for hockey there?  How important is it back at home, do you think?
 
THOMAS VANEK: Hopefully good.  Back home it's more soccer, tennis, skiing, so hopefully little kids back home recognize that kids from Austria have a chance to make it hopefully in the National Hockey League.  Hopefully has a little bit of an impact and hockey is going to get bigger. 
 
Q.  Obviously a lot of fans like to see you play in Buffalo at the pros before.  How did what that make you feel and how comfortable is that a lot of people know who you already are?
 
THOMAS VANEK: That's great.  I love the rink; won a Championship there already, hopefully there's more to come.  So I am real happy I am in Buffalo. 
 
Q.  How did you feel the entire time sitting up there waiting through a few picks there and how do you feel throughout the entire day?
 
THOMAS VANEK: Pretty good.  I slept pretty good and I wasn't really nervous or anything.  All my family and friends are here so I was pretty relaxed and very happy that they can be a part of this and yeah, there's some great players that got picked in front of me.  That's the way a draft works.  I am happy I am in Buffalo and we'll see what is going to happen next. 
 
Q.  Now that you know the team that you are going to do you give some thought to at what point Minnesota is going to have to say good-bye to you?
 
THOMAS VANEK: Well, got the whole summer to think about that.  Have to sit down with the organization and the coaches and we'll make the best decision what is best for me.
