 Q. Looked like you had a ton of chances early in the second, Scott.
 
 SCOTT THORNTON: Yeah, we came out; pretty good second period game - right where we want
it to be, real close game like this. That is when we play our best. Right now we are
trying to follow that puck into the net as much as we can. Like you say, we had a few
chances we didn't capitalize on. We have to be comfortable with the positive parts of the
game. 
 
Q. Why does this play into your hands? Are you an opportunistic club?
 
 SCOTT THORNTON: No, I just think the more the game heats up, more pressure on us out
there in tight games like this, the more confidence we have. We are a real confident
third-period hockey team and the tighter the game the better it is for us.
