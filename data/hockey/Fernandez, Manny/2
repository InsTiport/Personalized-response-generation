Q.  (Inaudible)?

MANNY FERNANDEZ: We had a tremendous season.  We played with a lot of heart and a lot of character through the tough times.  I think everybody is going to be happy at what we've accomplished this year.  We've never given up.  Obviously, it would be nice to finish on a good note.

Q.  Manny (inaudible)?

MANNY FERNANDEZ: Well, like I was saying before, you know, it was just like the first goal kind of killed us.  We came out and did everything and worked hard in the first period, and we had some good chances and, like I said, we needed a break and we needed to get our confidence going and get our spirits a little higher, and instead they scored the first goal and scored another one.  It seemed like everybody died out there.  It's disappointing, but, you know, after all is said and done, this game is over and we've got to look forward to the next one. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

MANNY FERNANDEZ: They had some good chances tonight.  They really came through.  Unlike the other two games, I really felt like they showed up tonight.  I mean, they were at the right place at the right time and the puck just went where they expected.
