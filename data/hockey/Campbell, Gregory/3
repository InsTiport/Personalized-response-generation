  Q. One win away from something that a lot of you guys are dreaming about since you started playing hockey. I know you have been talking about the one game at a time, but is this probably the toughest time to start -- to keep looking at it that way?  
 GREGORY CAMPBELL: Yeah. I mean, it's -- obviously it's only natural to look ahead to really see where we are right now, and what the actual -- the Finals, it's pretty exciting. But I mean, we're not there. And that has to be our mentality.  
 Hockey -- hockey, in this game it changes. Things change quickly. So if you look ahead too far and not focus on playing hard, then bad things usually happen. So as a team I think we've done a pretty good job of that in the Playoffs so far [indiscernible], but as you said, it's an exciting time for us, and huge opportunity for a lot of players [indiscernible] and [indiscernible].  
  
  Q. Now that you've been twice already in the Playoffs, does it give you more confidence, knowing that we've been here, done it, you've done it in Game 7?  
 GREGORY CAMPBELL: In the Montreal series, obviously we took for granted the opportunity. (Indiscernible) having to do it in Game 7. I think in the Philly series, we did a really good job (indiscernible) first opportunity.   
 So we learned from our trial series, got better in the next round. So hopefully when the opportunity presents itself now that we'll have that mentality that there's no time to wait and just because there is the possibility for a Game 7 doesn't mean that we should want to take it to that step.   
 I think hopefully we've learned from the two previous rounds and we'll be ready for tomorrow night.
