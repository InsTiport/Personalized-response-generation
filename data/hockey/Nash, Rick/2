 Q.   (No Audio).  
RICK NASH:   I thought it was great.   I think all the guys liked it.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Right, yeah.   I don't know if I caught any Islanders.   I know on the regular show there is a lot of Islanders stuff.   I don't know if I caught any in the movie.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   I think we've tried to control our gap better.   I don't think the forwards were helping the "D" as much on our back pressure in the last two games.   Wasn't allowing their defensemen to stay up and create their gap.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Yeah, hopefully, hopefully we can ride some momentum and gain some confidence and play with it.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Yeah, I think when he skates he's a different player, when he moves his feet he creates a lot of offense.   He's got a great shot.   He's a physical guy.   He's kind of got a lot of tools of a top power forward, so he can definitely open up some room on the ice as well.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Yeah, I think any time you have someone on your line if you can achieve that, it helps.   I've never played on a team with so much depth where almost any combination you feel comfortable with, and nine with play on the first line or the last line.   It doesn't really matter.   But J.T. seems to kind of back off their defensemen a little bit.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   It's a struggle when you're not scoring.   I think it tests you mentally, it tests you emotionally.   But at the end of the day it's not about you, it's about the team and anything you can do to help the team win.   If the team's winning, you're obviously happy and smiling.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   No, I didn't, actually.   It's really strange.   I was having great sleeps and then last night I couldn't sleep.   It was weird.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Yeah, it's a good feeling, but for me, it's one game.   It's not that big of a deal.   Things can turn around pretty fast.   Whatever happened last night is over.   We'll try to carry some momentum, like I said earlier, but at the end of the day it's a new game, and it starts 0â€‘0 again.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
RICK NASH:   Yeah, there is really not much you can take advantage of.   They're a pretty good team.   I think it was just minimizing what we were doing to ourselves, our mistakes to the neutral zone and kind of not getting pucks deep.   It's allowing their transition against a team that has as much talent and skill that they have, we have to minimize those turnovers.
