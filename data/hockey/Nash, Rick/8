Q.  Rick, obviously going to Columbus, we talked about this yesterday, but for Doug MacLean to make that trade and for you to be the No.  1 overall, talk about your feeling about that?

RICK NASH:   It was amazing.  I was sitting there, just thinking about Bouwmeester going first to Florida, and next thing you hear, there's been a trade and then Columbus trades him to Florida, my stomach sort of went and I didn't know for sure yet.  It was like going do you know a big rotor coaster.

Q.  Doug told me he was impressed with you and you were impressed with them.  At that meeting last night, did you know at that point?

RICK NASH:   No.  I had no idea what was going on. 

Q.  Talk about coming to Columbus.  Are you ready to step in and play?

RICK NASH:   Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.   It's going to take a lot of hard work over the summer.  That's my goal, to play next year, and I'm really looking forward to coming to Columbus. 

Q.  Did it really matter what team it was, in the end, to you?

RICK NASH:   The Top  3 teams had good situations with young forwards and young teams, great GMs and great coaching staff.  I was really looking forward to being picked by Columbus, and now that I have the chance to, I'm really happy here and very excited.  It's a great organization.  Seems like a great situation to step into, so I'm very happy.
