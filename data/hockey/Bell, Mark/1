MARK BELL:  It is a small town of 100 people.  Then you go to Ottawa, which is like Chicago, I am ecstatic.  This is unbelievable right now. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  There is a lot of pride with this Jersey on right now.  I am going to wear it with a lot of pride.  It probably means more to me - it might not mean more to other people. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  Mike is my cousin, so it makes it even bigger.  It is a big thrill from a small town for this. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  I jumped around a lot this year in positions.  I really don't have a preference.  I feel I get more involved with left wing.  That is just my personal feeling.  I think coach wants me to play center, so that is where I will play.

MARK BELL:  Yeah, I went there two weeks ago to Chicago. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  I have been to a lot of rinks.  It is the biggest rink I have seen in a long time.  It is good for me skating and stuff.  It is a great town and a great suburb, downtown is nice and I couldn't be happier right now. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  I kind of thought I was going to go there.  It was definitely a shock. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
MARK BELL:  No, I didn't.  I spoke to them pretty much all through the year and it was a guy who comes to practice, Mr. Hagan.  He comes to practice.  He is a scout for Chicago, so he was talking to me the whole year, seeing how I was and stuff, so....
