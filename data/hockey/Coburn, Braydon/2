Q.   After two games, what do you guys need to do differently or change differently? 
BRAYDON COBURN:   I think we've just got to play better.   There are a lot of aspects of the game that go into playing defense.   Obviously, our penalty kill, we've got to make sure we shut them down and defensively we've got to pick things up.

Q.   (No Microphone) are you happy with the chances that you were given? 
BRAYDON COBURN:   I don't think so.   I think we can definitely do a better job of limiting the quality of their chances and trying to keep them to the outside a little bit more.   They scored some goals in front of the net, so maybe that's an area we can clean up as well.

Q.   Ben Bishop has been so good for you all playoffs and the regular season, to allow five goals in back‑to‑back games is probably not indicative of his goaltending? 
BRAYDON COBURN:   Probably not.   But he's a great goaltender and we lean on him a lot, and we expect him to be better as we expect our team to play better.

Q.   What's made their power play effective the last two games? 
BRAYDON COBURN:   It's been a couple different things.   They just capitalized on the chances they've had.

Q.   Is it hard to have a tight checking game just because you have so much speed on the ice on both sides?   I know you guys want to play a 2‑1 style game, but it's not turning out that way.   Is it just impossible to play that kind of game? 
BRAYDON COBURN:   Impossible, no, absolutely not.   For whatever reason the games have been on the higher scoring end of it, but I don't know if that's going to be the case going forward.   I'm not sure.   But you know what?   There is a lot of skill on both sides, but as teams tighten up, maybe that will change.   I don't know.
