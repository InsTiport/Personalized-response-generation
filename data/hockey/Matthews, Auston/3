 Q. Matt, one goal away from a shutout. Can you talk a little bit, are you a little disappointed you didn't get the shutout in your debut, and how about the performance of the team in front of you?   
MATT MURRAY: I don't know, I think it's just about winning the game. It sucks in this tournament because I know that goals against is a tiebreaker at some point, so yeah, it hurts a little bit. But we won, and that's what matters. I think we played the way we needed to tonight. We were on the puck quick and moving the puck fast and shooting a lot, which I think is key.   
   
 Q. Auston, how did it feel to play in front of the crowd that you're going to be playing in front of for so long and the effort of your team tonight?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: That was pretty special. I think we played a solid 60 minutes besides that one goal they scored. I thought we controlled the pace of the game, utilized our pace, our speed, controlled pucks down low, and we were able to take control of it.   
   
 Q. Auston, did you feel any extra nerves because it was your first game, especially in front of this crowd?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: Not too much, honestly. I think a little anxious just to kind of get going, two‑week camp, three exhibition games. I think all of us were pretty anxious to get going in the tournament, and I think it showed. We were flying around the ice tonight, utilizing our speed, getting pucks in behind their defense, so it definitely worked out in our favor.   
   
 Q. Auston, what was working with Connor and Mark tonight and are you hoping Todd keeps those lines together?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: Yeah, I think all of us kind of bring different things to the table, obviously Connor with his speed, myself and Scheifele are two big guys who can control the puck down low. I thought we created a lot of pretty good opportunities with Connor's goal getting called back. We obviously generated some scoring chances.   
   
 Q. Matt, that early penalty kill, just the number of chances, that's right away, first game, you're put under some serious pressure, come out shining. Can you go through that penalty kill for us?   
MATT MURRAY: Yeah, I think that's a big point of the game. I think if they score on that, obviously they get the momentum, and maybe it's a different game. But I thought our penalty kill did a great job, kept them to the outside for the most part, and yeah, to get that kill was huge.   
   
 Q. Auston, I think it was your third shift. I don't remember what, but to get a point right off the bat in this building, what was that like?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good feeling just to go out there and contribute. Like I said, I think all four lines really brought something tonight. Everybody was out there kind of doing their part. Like I said before, we were utilizing our strengths, and I think we definitely put them on their heels.   
   
 Q. It seemed like the game got more physical and gritty as it went on. Auston, how did it feel to be in that kind of battle where it seemed like Finland was trying to get under your skin? And Matt, any time there was a scrum or whistle, what was it like in front of you?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: Well, I mean, that's hockey. It's a physical game, especially when they're down. They obviously want to get momentum. I think being physical, they were trying to kind of grab some momentum, but we stayed calm and cool and just continued to play our game and not really let that affect us too much.  
MATT MURRAY: Yeah, I think both the scrums in front, it's definitely playoff style hockey out there a little bit. It's not like a normal exhibition season where guys are kind of dipping their toes in the water. Guys are going hard to the net. A lot of times that's probably how the majority of goals are scored in the NHL is shots through traffic or with tips and rebounds. That's a big part of the game if you're able to fight that off, and I thought our whole team did a great job of boxing out, letting me see the puck, and made my job pretty easy.  
   
 Q. Auston, are you a nervous guy? Did you have any nervous moments before the game or during the day today?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: Not too much, to be honest. I think, like I said before, I was pretty anxious to finally get going. I think we all were. It was a pretty special night. I know first game playing here in Toronto, it was definitely an exciting time.   
   
 Q. Question about tomorrow's game against Russia to both players. Could you compare the Finnish team and Russian team? And second question, are you prepared for a tough game tomorrow?   
AUSTON MATTHEWS: I mean, they're both different teams. I think Finland is a little more structured defensively. Obviously Russia has got a lot of firepower up front. They're both going to be difficult games tonight. It wasn't an easy game for us, but we definitely stuck to our game plan and were able to work it out.   
Tomorrow should be just as tough. We're going to have to come prepared.
