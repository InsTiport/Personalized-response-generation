   TODD MARCHANT: ... between Anaheim, I didn't see too much of a difference between Anaheim and this game tonight.   
  
  Q.  (Question off microphone)?   
 TODD MARCHANT:  You know what, I mean, it's not about hate.  It's about going out and playing our game.  It's about going out and 20 guys in our locker room playing our game for 60 minutes.  And I'm sure there's going to be little battles, and it's during the game, but you know what I mean, bottom line is tonight we didn't play the game that we could play.   
  
  Q.  (Question off microphone)?   
 TODD MARCHANT:  I didn't see it.  I was on the ice.  I just saw the puck go across the ice, and I mean, obviously Danny O'Halloran felt it wasn't a goal on the ice.  But, again, that's something we can't control.  They went to Toronto.  They determined it wasn't a goal.  They went upstairs and determined it wasn't a goal and we have to move on and accept it.   
  
  Q.  (Question off microphone)?   
 TODD MARCHANT:  Well, you know, they capitalize on the power play.  Got a power play going against us.  They weren't able to do that in Game 2.  You know, they played their game plan tonight and we didn't.  And I don't know - I don't have a reason for it.  I wish I did.  I would have corrected it about two and a half hours ago.   
 But bottom line is this game is behind us as it is for them and we have to focus on Game 4.
