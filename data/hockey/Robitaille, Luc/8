Q.  Almost 2-1 in shots, you guys outshot these guys all night.  Obviously you deserved this win?

LUC ROBITAILLE: We played real hard.  We played real hard in the corners.  We kept the puck in their zone, which is a big thing against a team like that, and we played well as a team.  I felt we deserved to win.  But you never know what's going to happen in OT, so I'm happy we got it.  

Q.  (Inaudible.)

LUC ROBITAILLE: (Inaudible) plus two got us a little more ice time and we were a little bit more in the game, and I thought we four checked well.  A guy like Sergei can hold on to the puck so long, gives guys like me to get a chance to get open a lot of times.  It was fun.  It was a big game.  We had to come out hard, and I think everybody played hard tonight.
