Q.  Do you sense a certain frustration on some of the  bigger scorers for the Wings, that they're just not getting enough?
 
LUC ROBITAILLE: No, there is no frustration.  The series is 2-2, and we want to come through in games like tonight.  What's important is that we've got to put the puck on the net.  We are doing it in the first period, and we've got to continue through the second.  We're going to keep putting the puck on the net and it will go in sooner or later.   
 
Q.  What is your sense of the type of game that you would like to play?  Do you want to play the speed game with Colorado?  You know they can do it.
 
LUC ROBITAILLE: Yeah, we could play the speed game.  I think the key for us is we have to do a better four check than we did in the first period.  We did that the last two games there, and we have to do that in the second and third period and we'll get a win with this game.
