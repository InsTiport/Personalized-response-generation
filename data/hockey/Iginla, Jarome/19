 Q.  Have you made changes? 
 JAROME IGINLA:  Yeah, we're trying to make changes all the time.  We had a few more chances tonight than on other nights.  That's the way it goes.  We're not always going to get the ones we want or vice versa. 
 I don't know what he was doing at the end, but that's fine.  They don't have to be fans of ours, and we don't have to be fans of theirs.  Naturally it grows throughout the series, and it's growing. 
 Q.  You had a few scoring chances.  A couple times you elected to pass and not shoot close in.  Why? 
 JAROME IGINLA:  I don't know.  It's not always shooting.  You can't always shoot, shoot, shoot.  It's trying to use hockey sense, and sometimes I feel like a pass is a better play and sometimes a shot's a better play.  Sometimes I'm wrong (laughter). 
 But there were some scoring chances, but personally and as a group we've got to find ways to make it harder on Nabokov than we did tonight. 
 First two games we were more in his face, more driving the net harder.  He played very well, made some very big saves.  But if you look at it, he saw too many, and we weren't there for too many rebounds.
