Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, you know, we've had pushes here and there or stretches where we're playing pretty good hockey.  But I don't think we're playing the way we wanted to.  (Indiscernible) we had some tough goals at tough times, but I think we can do a better job of putting it together and playing a little better.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, I don't know.  It's always the last couple seconds of periods.  Game 2, two in the last minute or so.  It's hard, but that's where we've got to come together as a group.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, like you said, they're doing a good job of holding their blue line.  I think we've just got to continue to try to get pucks behind them and have some speed on the forecheck.  I think we're doing (indiscernible) on our forecheck, and that's why we haven't been able to get on their "D" sometimes.  They're getting easy breakouts, so I think it's try to get more speed.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, I mean, he's been awesome for us all year.  He's made a lot of good saves in this series too, some big-time saves.  He's been playing great.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: No, I think he's playing great.  I think he's playing great.  Like I said, we've got to do a better job in front of him.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Message for the fans?  Thanks for the support, thanks for coming.  We'll try to get them in Washington, I guess.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Just thanks for the support.  We're going to try to put the best product we can on the ice in Washington, and hopefully we're going to get some wins and bring it back here to Tampa.  But I just say thanks for the support.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, they definitely have a lot of speed.  And the first two games we were giving up too many odd-man rushes because we were not on top of their guys and neutralizing their speed.  So I think the neutral zone play is definitely a big part of that.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Maybe.  I'm not sure.  I can't really.  He's the coach.  I can't really comment on something like that.  But maybe we're holding back or whatnot.  But I think we still have more to give.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: I mean, it's obviously not the spot you want to be in, but for sure other teams have done it, but they just did it best.  So we're just going to focus on playing the best we can.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: Yeah, I think the first two games it just seemed like they wanted a little bit more than us.  They were skating and on top of us.  Winning a lot of races and a lot of battles.  So I think that's definitely a big part of it.  So hopefully we'll be better in Game 3.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
BRAYDEN POINT: I'm sorry?  Yeah, it's a big difference.  Every game is obviously super important, and you want to win them all.  So it's not necessarily a must-win, but it's definitely a huge game for sure.
