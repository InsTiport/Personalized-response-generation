Q.  Looks like you had a lot of fun out there.

TEEMU SELANNE:   Loads of fun.  I think we are not so serious about winning. It was a good time. It's great for the fans. It's great to be a part of it.


Q.  What's the funnest part, just being out there with the guys?

TEEMU SELANNE:   Yeah. Most of the fun is watching how the other guys are doing.


Q.  Any fond memories?  Anything special happen tonight?  Anything that sticks out in your mind?

TEEMU SELANNE:   This is my sixth skills competition and I've never lost. But we've never won the game.  And we're gonna have to fix that problem tomorrow.


Q.  How about Martin Brodeur, he was pretty spectacular, wasn't he?

TEEMU SELANNE:   Yes. Yes, he was. I didn't get to make the move that I wanted. He is just a very good goaltender.


Q.  How do you feel about playing against your  teammate, Paul Kariya tomorrow afternoon?

TEEMU SELANNE:   Oh, it is definitely going to be fun. I have told him that there is going to be no mercy.


Q.  What are you expecting tomorrow?

TEEMU SELANNE:   I'm expecting a lot of goals tomorrow.
