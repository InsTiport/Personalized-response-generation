Q. Ending up in New York must have been a bit of a shocker for you, considering all the
deals that were made today. What was your reaction? 

JAMIE LUNDMARK: Like you said, I didn't know quite what to think, where I was going to
go or anything. You know, I'm really excited about the choice, can't wait to get to New
York. 

Q. Can you just describe your game and what you think your strengths are, what you need
to work on. 

JAMIE LUNDMARK: I think I handle the puck pretty well, handle the puck good in tight
situations. I like to create a lot of scoring chances in the offensive zone. I played
solid defense when I can. Just be an asset to the team every time I'm on the ice.

Q. Do you feel like you're ready to go into the National Hockey League now or do you
think you need a while?

JAMIE LUNDMARK: Yeah, I've thought about that quite a bit. I think I'm going to have to
do a lot of hard training this summer, get myself ready for the training camp coming up.
You know, I think I'm going to go into the camp with all the confidence I can. Hopefully
things work out. If I have to go down and play another year of Junior, I'll be happy with
that. I'm just going to stay really positive and hopefully next year or the year after
I'll get a chance.

Q. Considering the Rangers kept Manny Malhotra last year, do you think your chances of
sticking are better?

JAMIE LUNDMARK: You know, I think so. I think they have a pretty young team. They kept
Malhotra last year. You know, I'm excited for camp. This day has been pretty overwhelming.
I'm just excited and hopefully things turn out.
