THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.   
   
 Q. Conor, can you take us through that play on your overtime winner there?  
CONOR SHEARY: Yeah. Sid came up to me before the draw and told me to line up on the wall. We hadn't really done that before. He said he's going to wing it back and Tanger is going to find me in the soft area there. Found it pretty perfectly.   
   
 Q. Can you talk about what it's like to score in overtime in the Stanley Cup Final?  
CONOR SHEARY: No. It's surreal. Important moment. Most important we got a win and we're up 2‑0 right now. It's a good momentum shift for us.   
   
 Q. Phil, can you talk a little bit about the contributions of this young group, obviously Conor tonight, Tom. Seemingly every night it's someone younger than you and some of the other veterans.   
PHIL KESSEL: They came in, done a great job for us. They bring energy, a great work ethic. Obviously you can tell they're great players. They've been getting it done for us night in and night out.   
   
 Q. Phil, the play that led to your first goal, imagine that comes up a ton of times in the regular season. How many times has it worked like that? What is the likelihood of that happening?  
PHIL KESSEL: The ice is real bouncy tonight. Just whipped on a pass, it bounced over his stick, he didn't get anything on it. Kind of bounced over mine, right? Their D, Haggy stripped them, passed to Bones. That's kind of how it happened.   
   
 Q. Conor, a few weeks ago Mike suggested when you were first recalled and put on Sid's line, you were too eager to pass it back to Sid. Eventually you started taking shots, being more confident. Do you remember a flash point or moment where maybe that confidence kicked in for you?  
CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, I mean, the first time I got on his line he told me I was there for a reason, I was playing with him for a reason, don't look off a shot to make a pass to him. Even though he says that, it's a little hard to get used to.   
At this point he's just my teammate and he's my line mate. I'm comfortable playing with him.   
   
 Q. Conor, listening to both you and Kris Letang, sounds like there's not one shred of surprise that Sid said everything that was going to happen on that play. Did he say you were going to score?  
CONOR SHEARY: That's the only thing he left out. It usually doesn't work out like that when you draw up a play or even talk about a play.   
I think they kind of lost me when I came off the wall there. I had a lot of time to shoot. It worked out.   
   
 Q. Phil, looking at the numbers over your playoff career, you've always scored a lot of goals in the playoffs. What has it been about your game at this time of year?  
PHIL KESSEL: I just kind of play my game, right? Don't change anything. Obviously you try to raise your level out there. Just try to play your best.   
   
 Q. Conor, did you still feel like you were the faster team out there, pushing the pace?  
CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, I think that's the identity of our team. Coach has been trying to implement that all year. I think a lot of guys have bought into that system. It's not always about speed, it's about playing quick, getting pucks up, getting pucks in. I think when we do that, play in people's face, we overwhelm teams. It's been working out well for us.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
