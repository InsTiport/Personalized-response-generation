Pardon me? 
 
Very excited, happy to go to Phoenix because I had a really good interview with them and had a good indication that they might take me in the first round. 
 
Very -- I've heard good things about Phoenix, so it sounds like it's going to be a pretty nice place to be in the summertime.  Sounds like the crowds are going to be really good there and I'm looking forward to it. 
 
Yeah, going in too young sometimes might be harder to make because they have younger guys, but then again, you know, it's going to be positive because they play their younger teams along a lot faster.  
 
Yeah, it's been quite the year for me. Never really -- like at the beginning of the year, I was just worried about making the Tri-City team, and I wasn't quite too sure whether they were going to keep me.  And Bobby Loucks (ph) from Tri-City showed a lot of faith in me and with a lot of his help and with Tri-City's help they helped me a lot.  Getting second to the Toronto game, All-star game or top prospects really helped me a lot doing good in the skills competition. 
 
Right now I'm going to focus on making the team for sure.  It's like it's -- I really expect to have a really good summer and July is going to be the biggest month for me yet, and I'm going to have to get in really good shape and the best physical condition as possible and try and make the Junior World Team and go from there.  If I make the World Junior Team, that gives me a little bit better indication how I'm going to do at the NHL camp world junior team.
