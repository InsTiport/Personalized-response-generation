 Q.   Talk about going to the Dallas Stars.   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   I know that Dallas is the fourth biggest city in the United States, and Mike Modano played there.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about your game.   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   I score.   I can do it all, basically play physical.   You guys can watch me soon.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   From here, from New York I'll go to Dallas.   I'm going to start training in Dallas and I'll be there until training camp.  
   
 Q.   Are you ready to play in the NHL this year?   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   I don't want to go that far ahead and say what's going to happen is going to happen, but I'm pretty sure I can make a jump to the NHL.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts about playing with somebody like Jim Nill who obviously has experience coming from Detroit and dealing with Russian players in Detroit.   How do you feel about the idea of playing for somebody like Jim Nill?   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   I know a lot about him.   I met with him, and my agent told me that he's been really great with Detroit, and he can put a very, very strong team together really quick.   So I'm excited about Jim being my general manager.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   The level of the World Juniors is really really high, and after the championship I got a lot of confidence in my game.   
   
 Q.   Recently the Dallas Stars have struggled with their power play.   How is your power play game?   Would you consider that one of the strongest aspects of your game?   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   I can't say it's a strong point, but I'll play on the power play and on the penalty kill anywhere I need to do.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
VALERI NICHUSHKIN:   No, I'm very happy that I'm in Dallas.   Everything is really good.
