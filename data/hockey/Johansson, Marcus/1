   MARCUS JOHANSSON: Anton I know but not Beckstrom. We played national team a couple of times together and sometimes he's up where I play, because he's from there, and so I know him pretty well.  
  
  Q. How do you see yourself as a hockey player? What type of game do you play? What do you bring to the table here?  
 MARCUS JOHANSSON: I would say I'm a two-way center man who likes to play offensive hockey and play with the puck and make things happen. I'm a hard worker.   
  
  Q. Do you think you're ready to start already?  
 MARCUS JOHANSSON: I don't know. We'll see what happens. I've got a couple of years back home and at least one year now, and he'll see what happens with the IHF agreement and stuff like that. So we'll see.   
  
  Q. What players did you admire growing up?   
 MARCUS JOHANSSON: Peter Forsberg and Mats Sundin, those big players. Most of the Swedish guys, of course. But I would say Peter Forsberg.   
  
  Q. A lot of Swedish guys taken today. What's it like to be part of that group, six or seven guys?  
 MARCUS JOHANSSON: It's a great group. We all know each other. We hang out together when we are at this kind of stuff, and it's great kids, every one of us. You know, it's good.
