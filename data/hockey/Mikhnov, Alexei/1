Q. How are you feeling right now?

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: I'm happy.

Q. Can you expand on that? How happy are you?

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: I was hoping somebody would pick me up, and I'm quite happy with
Edmonton.

Q. What do you know about Edmonton?

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: Five Stanley Cups. In the middle of '80s, this was a team of All-Stars,
they've been playing like nobody's business. It was an incredible team, and I hope it will
be the same team now.

Q. Talk about the adjustment of coming over to North America.

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: I don't think I'll have too many problems adjusting. I think it will be
quite easy to adjust.

Q. What will be the hardest thing about leaving Russia?

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: The toughest part is adjusting to a different life-style because it's a
different life-style from where I come from. But other than that, if I manage to adjust to
that, I think as soon as I make the ice, it will be easy to adjust.

Q. Could you describe for us your style of play?

ALEXEI MIKHNOV: I'm a forward, and I think that I can play very well one-on-one. I
think I have good passing skills, and I think I can score a few goals, too.
