Q.  Is the series living up to your expectations?
 
BRAD LARSEN: Yeah, I mean, the hype's there, I guess.  I mean, this is awesome.  It's fun to play in these games.  I mean, the energy is incredible, you know, and this is what you dream of as a kid, you know, and this is probably two of the top teams in the league right now, and they have the best record, and, you know, we're the underdog in this one. 
 
Q.  Do you like being the underdog?
 
BRAD LARSEN: It's different.  I think it's kind of weird with this much talent to be the underdog, but they had a real good season, so we look at it as an opportunity to go out and challenge ourselves and just try and play our best hockey, and that's all we can do.
