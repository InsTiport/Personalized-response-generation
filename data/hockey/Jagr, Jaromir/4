Q.  (Inaudible)

JAROMIR JAGR: They played good.  Great team, a lot of talent.  With the four lines and the kind of system they play, they play for a whole year, last two years, they have played with the same players, same lineup, you cannot beat it.  They know if one guy has the puck the other 4 guys on the ice, they know what he is going to do with it. 


Q.  (Inaudible)

JAROMIR JAGR: I think today, I thought we played a pretty good game.  Of course they were a better team than us, but I thought we played pretty smart.  When we had the puck everybody goes back, skates together, like they always play.  I thought it was probably the best performance we had in the last five games.
