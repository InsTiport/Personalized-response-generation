Q.  On a day when so many goals are scored and you don't hit too many people, what can you do as a defenseman to prevent the goals from going in?
 
JANNE NIINIMAA: There is not too much you can do.  Like you see, I am breaking sweat, I am working hard.  Guys are coming pretty hard up there.  You just try to stay in lanes and not let the guy beat you one-on-one. 
 

Q.  I know you are enjoying the experience, particularly because you are partnered with a legend from your country.  What has that experience been like for you?
 
JANNE NIINIMAA:  It is great.  I played with Teppo in the '98 Olympics.  It was great, great experience.  Like you said, he is a legend in my hometown and one of my idols growing up, so it is great to be out there with him.  Although not having too much fun. 
 

Q.  Edmonton Oilers are in Playoff position right now.  What do you search for after the All-Star break in order to get there for sure after the post-season?
 
JANNE NIINIMAA: I am sure everyone is aware of the standings.  The race is tight, and it is going to go 'til the end, so it will be tight, but we are ready.  And right now before the break we got a couple of wins and things are looking good, so we are going to be there to be the contenders.  We are going to make it.  Like I said, there is a lot of tough teams to beat.  Tough race all the way 'til the end.
