Q.  You said before this is kind of chaos.  Do you feel like you are in the middle of chaos, especially the rapid fire thing? 
 
JOHN VANBIESBROUCK: That was pretty chaotic. I think, you know, you never know who you are going to get out there.  They say that everything in life is timing.  I got bad timing out there, but there is no good timing in these things.  And, you know, it is always fun.  I think that each year the fans become more interested not only in the game but in the skills and, you know, that is what our game is about, the skills.   So, you know, looked like everybody had fun. Really did. 
 

Q.  The rapid fire, though, when you stand there looking at those guys, you kind of are just throwing up your hands.
 
JOHN VANBIESBROUCK: You are kind of hoping to get hit, very straightforward, you are hoping to get hit.
