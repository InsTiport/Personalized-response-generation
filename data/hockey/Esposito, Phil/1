Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

PHIL ESPOSITO: I skate until 10:00.  If I can get a goalie to come out because I love to shot.  You know what I mean?  I still love to do that.


Q.  That's why your microphone was on during the game?

PHIL ESPOSITO: It was distracting.  It was distracting, but it was also fun because I can hear the other guys talking.  I can hear what Suzie was saying and the boys were saying.  It was really fun to be part of that.  I enjoyed it.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

PHIL ESPOSITO: We were down 5,2.  So, we'll take it.  We'll take it.  When Terry missed the penalty shot, I said "oh wow, we're in trouble."  But Reggie shut the door and we came back and tied the game.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

PHIL ESPOSITO: Well, Terry is the guy that handles the puck the most.  So, we decided if anybody would take the penalty shot, it would be Terry because he would put moves on the goalie that the goalie would  not see.  So what does he do?  He shoots.  Terry doesn't shoot.  I can do that for crying out loud.  The ice wasn't as good as I thought it was.  It sure wasn't as good as the old Garden.


Q.  They were complaining about that.

PHIL ESPOSITO: Is that right?  But everything else was gorgeous.
