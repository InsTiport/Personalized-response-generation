 Q. Jeff, can you put into words how good it feels to come back after being out?
 JEFF CARTER: It's awesome. When I got hurt on my second foot there, I was told that my season was over. So I was being the cheerleader for the boys.
 Got a call from Jimmy last weekend saying there is a chance I might be able to play, so that definitely lifted my spirits. I love to play hockey, and this is the best time of year to play, so I want to be out there. It's definitely a great feeling to get back.

 Q. When did you know you were going to play? Was it a game?time decision? Was it yesterday?
 JEFF CARTER: I practiced yesterday with the team, pushed it pretty hard just to see where I was at. I felt pretty good. I told Lavi I think I can give him a pretty good 10, 12 minutes, and I left it up to him. He let me know last night that I was in, so it was a good feeling.

 Q. Do you feel like you're a 100%, and, if not, how close are you?
 JEFF CARTER: It's my first game back, so I don't think I'm 100%. My foot, where the break is, feels really good. Really since I started skating I haven't had that much pain. The main thing was the fact that I didn't put any pressure on my leg for four weeks, so all the muscles in my ankle and my calf, my quad, there is a lot of atrophy, so I lost a lot of muscle.
 When I first started skating, the ankle was really the main issue. It was so weak, that I'd cross over and it would kind of give out. Every day it's gotten better. I went out there today and I felt great. I felt a lot better than I expected, so it was a good sign.
