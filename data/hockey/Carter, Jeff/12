  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jeff Carter. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   He's great for us.   He has a huge body.   He's pretty tough to stop.   Pretty big guy, has a lot of skill.   He can make the quick little plays down low and whatnot.   When he gets playing in front of the net, not too many guys that are going to move him out of the way.

Q.   Do you think he's using his size better or... 
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, I think he's been great for us.   He's been doing everything that the coaches have asked of him.   He's been getting in the hard areas, winning battles.   He scored a couple big goalsâ€‘for us here lately so it's been good.

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   We got a couple real good days of practice.   We look at our series here, had a few days off in between. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   That's the last thing we're thinking about, is going undefeated on the road.   The main thing is Game1 here.   When we get on the road, we're real comfortable. 
There's no distractions, nothing going on.   It's been going good for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   I don't think it's going to be too bad.   You know, we watch enough film, we do enough scouting stuff that we're going to become familiar with them pretty quickly. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   You know, it benefits us a little bit.   A lot of the guys that are playing for them now have been around for a few years, so we're pretty familiar with them. 
You know, it will be good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, maybe a little bit.   Obviously both teams had to battle for the last month or so just to get in.   I think for us that run there at the end just to make the playoffs definitely helped out.   It got us on a roll.   Playing some good hockey at the right time. 

Q.   What do you think are the most striking similarities and how do the teams contrast?
JEFF CARTER:   I think they're both very similar in a lot of ways.   They're both real competitive guys.   They lead by example out there.   I think Browny is probably the more physical of the two.   They're both great players. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, definitely.   Anytime you have a guy like that behind you, it gives you confidence.   You just have that calm feeling when you go out there knowing that he's behind you and he's going to shut the door.   It's been great. 

Q.   (Question regarding forechecking.) 
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, I don't know if you want to go in too reckless, especially against these guys.   Yeah, I mean, Quicky has shown all year what kind of player he's been all year.   He's the backbone of this team.   Just knowing he's there if something might happen instills a lot of confidence in the guys.
