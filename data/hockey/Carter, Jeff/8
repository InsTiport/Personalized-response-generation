  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jeff Carter.   
   
 Q.   Few hours now to reflect upon last night's game, what do you take out of it?  
JEFF CARTER:   Obviously a little disappointing.   Would have liked to have got a win on home ice.   But we've got to move on from that.   Think about it last night, move on, get ready for Saturday.   
   
 Q.   Brodeur, Hall of Fame goalie, as good as they come.   He was on top of his game.   
JEFF CARTER:   He was.   He did what he had to do for their team.   He made the big saves, he played well.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Jeff.
