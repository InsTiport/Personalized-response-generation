 Q.   Jeff, going back to your linemates, do you feel suddenly old?   
JEFF CARTER:   I'm sure I do.   You'll have to ask them (laughter).   
Yeah, I mean, it goes quick when you're in this league.   Seems like yesterday I was that young guy kind of going out there and just wheeling around and playing hockey, having fun.   You can definitely see that in them when they get the puck and they create chances, they put the puck in the net.   Tyler scores last night, you see them laughing at each other.   They have a blast out there.   It's a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   With Tyler, you had some success last year in the series.   You're both players who can shoot and make plays.   Any particular chemistry that because you can both pull the trigger and shoot, you have had some success against Chicago the last two years?   
JEFF CARTER:   I mean, he's a confident player.   He had success last year in the playoffs.   He's played well against them this year.   I think everybody has those kind of teams that they feel comfortable going out and playing against.   Usually have their best games against.   
Probably for Tyler, that's fitting here in this series.   He's a guy that has great skill.   He's got speed.   He's got obviously a great shot.   You know, he puts it all together, he's a great player out there.   So hopefully he can keep it going.   
   
 Q.   Jeff, as a guy who doesn't need a lot of chances to score, can you talk about the Hawk's ability to do the same?   
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, I mean, you look at their roster, they got a lot of skill up there.   Their top six are pretty strong.   You give them oddâ€‘man rushes, turnovers in the offensive zone, there's a pretty good chance they're going to end up in the back of the net.   
That's something we definitely need to limit.   We know that.   We'll get better at it.
