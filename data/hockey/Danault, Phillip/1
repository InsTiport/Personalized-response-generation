  Q. You had a huge smile on your face. Pretty exciting, obviously?   
 PHILLIP DANAULT: Yeah, it's amazing for me to be drafted. I don't have any words to describe this moment. Today I come here with my family just to be drafted maybe in the second round, but first round for me is unbelievable and by the Blackhawks is amazing.  
  
  Q. Do you follow the Blackhawks and know their players?   
 PHILLIP DANAULT: I know Jonathan Toews for sure. He's the captain of his team.   
 And they are a young team, and I think they have a lot of plays and a lot of success in the future.  
  
  Q. You've been a captain too throughout your career. Can you talk about your leadership skills?   
 PHILLIP DANAULT: Yeah, for sure. I've got leadership and character, and I will try to do the same if I play some day with the Blackhawks. But to be drafted is one thing, but the second thing is to make the team. I will never stop working.  
  
  Q. In center, do you have a preference one way or another?   
 PHILLIP DANAULT: No, no preference. I just want to play in the NHL one day.  
  
  Q. What would you say is your best asset? What makes you stand out?   
 PHILLIP DANAULT: For sure my character, my leadership and speed. I've got a lot of speed. I just play hard every game, my consistency, that's why I'm there now.
