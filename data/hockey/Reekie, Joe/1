Q.  Joe, you came roaring out of the gate, but they got the first one again.  How deflating was that?

JOE REEKIE:   Well, it's been the story of the series: They score in the first period and we're playing catch up.  But we played hard.  We know our backs are against the wall, and we just want to go out and have a solid game.  We have to win.  There's no question.  We just want to keep the pressure on.  But they are a great team and they're going to score and we've got to score, too.


Q.  In order to prepare yourself for this game, facing elimination, how did the coach attempt to motivate you, how did you motivate yourselves?

JOE REEKIE:   1942 Leafs.  I don't know.  We know we're -- it's been done before and the team's talked about us with Leafs in our previous series. We've just got to play our game and go out strong. We'll never quit.


Q.  Keep those Leafs in your mind.  Good luck.

JOE REEKIE:   Thanks very much.
