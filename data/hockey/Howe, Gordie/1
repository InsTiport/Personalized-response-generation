 Q. You hold the record, 23 appearances in NHL All-Star games. Are you able to relate to
a game like this where it is wide open and few checks?
 
 GORDIE HOWE: Not really, our first one was against champions of the League, the Stanley
Cup winner, (inaudible). There was animosity. We went out there and I remember we put on
the first fight, but that was in my case, it was one year prior to that, but any time you
are out (inaudible). 
 
Q. What did you think of honoring Wayne Gretzky before this game today and retiring No.
99?
 
 GORDIE HOWE: It was beautiful. I was kidding Vic Lynn. He was the last guy to ever
score a goal against me when I was a goaltender. (inaudible) That kid earned it. He worked
hard and sold the game out throughout the West and the numbers indicate he knew what he
was doing. He is a wonderful man. Off the ice, he is every bit as nice if not nicer.
