  Q.  I'm joined with Nicklas Backstrom with the hot Washington Capitols right now, because your team has played so well.  Nicklas, how have you found your first year in the National Hockey League?   
 NICKLAS BACKSTROM:  I think pretty good.  Better and better.  I think the whole team has played better.  Got a lot of pro points now.  I think every point is important right now in the situation we're in.  So we have to keep up working.   
  
  Q.  It appears that your style of play and your skill has been emphasized even more as of late.  It seems that you're getting more comfortable as you go on.  And that can be expected.  Are you feeling now that you can really do the things that you knew you could?  Maybe not so much earlier in the season when you were learning how to play in the NHL?   
 NICKLAS BACKSTROM:  I think it was tough in the beginning, but it's a lot different between Sweden and here.  I mean, you feel more comfortable to play center now.  I mean, it's good.  I play with good players, too.   
 I play with Ovey and unbelievable player.  So he makes me feel comfortable.   
  
  Q.  Did you ever think last summer when you decided to come to the National Hockey League that you'd be here at the All-Star Game?   
 NICKLAS BACKSTROM:  Actually, no.  I didn't know that they had the Young Stars game.  But it's fun to be here, and I appreciate to be here.
