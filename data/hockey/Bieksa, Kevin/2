   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kevin Bieksa.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 KEVIN BIEKSA: Occasionally, bu, you know, I think this is what you want in a Stanley Cup final. You want two teams that don't like each other and are going to battle it to the end.   
  
  Q. Did you want to treat it like a normal game or did you want to treat it differently?   
 KEVIN BIEKSA: A bit of both. We realize obviously what's at stake, which means you have to be focused every time you're out. Every shift could determine the outcome of the game.   
 But at the same time, we're praying the game of hockey so the rules are the same and the ice is the same and the pucks are the same. So you've got to go out and play. You can't put too much pressure on yourself.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 KEVIN BIEKSA: We obviously wish Mason was in the lineup right now, but I've said from the beginning, we don't need extra motivation. The Stanley Cup is enough motivation for us. So we're not looking for any extras to help us get to that peak motivation.   
 We're in the Stanley Cup finals. We would like to win it for him and for everyone in this dressing room.
