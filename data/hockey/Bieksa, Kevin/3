   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kevin Bieksa.   
  
  Q. How does it feel to be a rockstar?   
 KEVIN BIEKSA: This is pretty cool. It gets bigger and bigger every time we come on the road. A lot of support in the city, as you can see. Last night was a lot of fun, driving home, seeing everybody out on the streets.   
  
  Q. You're not going to get a lot of support where you're going. Talk about what you need to do differently to get through Boston.   
 KEVIN BIEKSA: We have to be very focused, I think, stay together as a group. It's going to be a hostile crowd. They're loud there. They're violent. They're everything.   
 We got to stick together, the 25 of us, play in a five-man unit. We're one game away right now. We have to put it all together for one game.   
  
  Q. On some levels, this team has been called the most hated team in hockey. Does that help you come together?   
 KEVIN BIEKSA: Well, I don't know. At the same time, who really cares about what the guys are tweeting and stuff like that. If I was on my summer vacation, I wouldn't be tweeting right now about the Stanley Cup finals, I'd be enjoying it.   
 Consider the sources.
