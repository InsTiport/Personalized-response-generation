 Q. (Inaudible). 
 CHRIS PRONGER:  Yeah, it was.  It defensively wasn't the way or has been the way we have been playing throughout these playoffs. 
 Whatever the case was, we have got to rectify a few areas and build on it.  But there's not much we can take out of that game.  We have been beat in a lot of different areas, you start trying to run around and they are skilled players, they are going to make plays and obviously they capitalize on the power play. 
 Q.  When did you think it started going wrong? 
 CHRIS PRONGER:  First period wasn't that bad.  They got their power play goal later in the second period and then they got late third goal with a couple of seconds left, it obviously hurt, but we come out in the beginning of the third have a couple of good scoring chances, don't score and Sammy gets pushed into the goalie and they get a power play goal on that, and it makes it 4-0.  And we start running around and they are capitalizing. 
 Q.  Talk about the play of Jussi.  You guys were a little bit undisciplined but what about his performance? 
 CHRIS PRONGER:  Played good.  For not being in there and in three, four months, he was sharp.  He made some good stops early in the first period, and played very well.  You know, a few of those goals not much you can fault him on. 
 He battled hard in there and gave us everything he had, and we didn't give him our best, that's for sure.
