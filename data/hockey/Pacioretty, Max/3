 Q.   It seems to be tough for Vanek right now, did you have a conversation with him which guys are trying to help and find his game again?  
MAX PACIORETTY:   He's a veteran.   He doesn't need that.   He's contributed to this team's success in the playoffs.   He knows it.   We all talk. Behind closed doors we're all having a good team and we all want to help this team win, and we all like where we stand right now with the team.   He's fine. He's going to be fine.  
It seems there's always got to be a story when you lose, and obviously, with the questions  
I'm being asked, that is the story right now.     But he's a tremendous player and he's helped us a lot in these playoffs and he'll continue to do that.  
   
 Q.   David just repeated the words that are   written   on   the   wall,   no   excuse   for tomorrow?  
MAX PACIORETTY:     We are down two, and we are going on the road. Yeah.   Obviously, would have liked to have Game 2, but we can only worry about Game 3. We've got to be better Game  
3.     We have to make life difficult for their goalie, and if we do that, I like team s our chances.  
  
 Q.   Do you like MSG?  
MAX PACIORETTY:   I love MSG.   I grew up watching games there.   I love going there.   I haven't played in the finished building yet, so this will be fun for me.  
  
 Q.   Do you think it will be much of a difference?     They spent a billion dollars to renovate it, and some people said it doesn't look like   they got   a   billion dollars  worth of work done.  
MAX PACIORETTY:   Yeah, those are the people who don't know the amount of history in MSG.   I've grown up seeing not just hockey there but concerts and other things.   There is a lot of history in that building, and it's a lot of fun for me to play there.
