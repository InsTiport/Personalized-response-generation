Q.   I'm assuming your lineup is going to be a game‑time decision.
COACH TORTORELLA:   Yes.

Q.   Are you able to say, not whether he's going to play, but is Dubie possibly available?
COACH TORTORELLA:   I have no update.

Q.   All great athletes find fault even in their best performances.   I'm just wondering about Lundqvist after Saturday.   Would he be looking at that and saying I could be better, or would he be looking at that and say that was pretty...
COACH TORTORELLA:   No, that's why he's getting better.   He's never satisfied.   That's what everybody loves about him here in the organization.   He's never satisfied.   So he wants to be better. 

Q.   Your history with Callahan, have you noticed him ever get frustrated if he's not putting the puck in the net, except for an empty netter, seems like he does everything else, but does he ever get frustrated?
COACH TORTORELLA:   No, he's doing some other things for us, as you said.   Does it bother him?   He hasn't been consistent as far as the other part of the game, sure it does, because he wants to help the team.   But it doesn't get to the point where he puts himself in a bad way.
There's a fine line there.   He cares.   And he wants to help.   But, again, he's in a good situation here.   He'll find a way.

Q.   If it is Bick up front, are you comfortable with ‑
COACH TORTORELLA:   Stop asking me about lineups, Andrew.

Q.   I'm asking if‑ Bick's played up front before.   Are you comfortable with his play away from the puck when he is up front?
COACH TORTORELLA:   I don't know what my lineup is today.

Q.   How about if he plays three weeks from now?
COACH TORTORELLA:   I don't know what my lineup would be then.
