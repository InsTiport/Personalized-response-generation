 Q.   The guys you brought up, how do you use them, not in the series, but what is the thought behind having them up here?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   Just have players ready to play in case we run into injuries.  
   
 Q.   What has been the key do you think of your strong recent third periods, these last three?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   Staying with it.  
   
 Q.   Being aggressive?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   Staying with it.  
   
 Q.   John, you've got a guy who is not going offensively that you know can.   What has historically been your tactic?   Do you talk to him?   Do you just ride it out?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   Depends on the player.   Depends on the player, depends on the situation.   It's a question that I can't answer because it all depends on the situation.  
   
 Q.   So if I asked you about Ryan Callahan?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   I won't answer.
