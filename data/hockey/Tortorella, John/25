COACH TORTORELLA: We just kept on playing. We stayed with it.   


COACH TORTORELLA: No.   


COACH TORTORELLA: He played very well tonight. I'm not going to single out him. I mean, it's our whole team. But his skating ability certainly showed there and made a couple of big plays.   


COACH TORTORELLA: Yeah, he's been doing pretty good. He's playing left wing on that line. He's done a fairly good job there.   


COACH TORTORELLA: I have no idea what you're talking about. He played good, though. He played a good game.   


COACH TORTORELLA: It's important. Going into tonight, we have a couple of guys that are right there, as far as top defensemen, scoring and also defending. And these are tight checking games. To get some offense, some of your best defensemen defensively and the offense, it's important. And Dan (Girardi) has made some really big plays. Not just getting on the scoreboard, but big plays offensively right on through the playoffs here.   


COACH TORTORELLA: Tired. It's an icing call. And that's why he called it. I can't change the players on the icing rule. I can't change the players.   


COACH TORTORELLA: Feds? He did a lot of little things tonight. And he's been very consistent as we've gone through here.   


COACH TORTORELLA: It was an important period for Hank. I thought the first period was kind of a feeling-out period. I thought Hank gave us a chance to stay there in the second. And then we found our way in the third. That was an important sequence. We worked off a puck, and Parise ends up with three great chances, Hank was really good in the second period.   


COACH TORTORELLA: We turned it over and we got sloppy. I thought we had chances to get it out. We didn't. And teams that are playing this time of year are going to try to capitalize. So some of it was them. Some of it was us, as far as we had two times it was right by the blue line, we don't get it out, and we're fortunate we don't get scarred there.   


COACH TORTORELLA: We've been in these games all playoffs, with some of the experiences we've gone through. I have a tremendous amount of confidence in our conditioning, and, more importantly, in our mental makeup, as far as handling the situations. And I looked at our third period in Game 7. I thought it was probably one of our best periods, eliminate Washington, and I thought tonight's third period was a really good one also.   


COACH TORTORELLA: Yeah, I think he's been responsible away from the puck, and he's been consistently understanding how we have to play. We want him to be instinctive. I think he's done a really good job of that as far as chasing down things, shooting a puck. Obviously a quick release tonight on his goal. He's played well.   


COACH TORTORELLA: I don't know where you guys get all this stuff being tired. If we're tired this time of the year, there's something the matter. We still have a month to play. You might as well not even ask me questions about being tired. We're not a tired hockey club. We are ready to play. So it seems like it's a lot of questions about that. You guys get the figures of the seven games and you don't win a Stanley Cup and all that  this club will be ready to play.
