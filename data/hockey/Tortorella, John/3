Q. John, how do you explain not creating the scoring chances and really the sustained pressure the first two periods?
JOHN TORTORELLA: Yeah, it's something we have to work on. I don't totally agree with you as far as the pressure, but developing quality scoring chances, it was a struggle for us. I think we're going to be able to chip out some of the glorious odd man rushes we gave them early on for a couple of freebies. I think we'll get those chipped out, but the part of the game that bothers me most is creating some scoring chances, some better quality scoring chances. 

Q. Can you talk about what was the thinking behind scratching Dustin Byfuglien today?
JOHN TORTORELLA: Well, I have to take someone out, and Buff has been used on defense and forward, along with Kyle Palmieri as a right winger, too, and we made the decision for this game, this was our best lineup. It's certainly not a negative thought on Buff, but we decided to go with this lineup tonight. 

Q. What do you think was at the heart of not being able to generate the kind of sustained scoring chances, quality scoring chances that you wanted, certainly until you got down 3‑0? 
JOHN TORTORELLA: Yeah, you know, we're trying. And you have to give the opposing team some credit here, too, as far as how well they defended. But I thought there were chances where another play was there. It just didn't happen. I thought our guys tried hard. The bench was good. We tried to stay together, even through a little bit of adversity there, but we just couldn't create better scoring chances. I thought for really a good part of the game, we had the puck quite a bit, but we just couldn't develop those good scoring chances. 
We'll look at the tape. We'll see what we have as far as people playing with one another. We're still trying to find those combinations, and have a couple of days here to go to work, and we'll see what happens Tuesday. 

Q. Typical situations when you talk about chipping away, over time it takes some time to establish chemistry. This is a far different scenario than an NHL season with an NHL team, so how do you approach this now?
JOHN TORTORELLA: Like I said this morning, this is not a marathon, as coaches always talk about in the NHL season, this is a sprint. We've put ourselves in a spot now we're chasing. We're chasing the tournament. It's a spot that we didn't want to be in. It's a very dangerous spot. But we are here. 
We just need to stay together and not blow ourselves up here and have a couple good days of practice and get ready for our next opponent and try to do better. 

Q. I just wanted your thoughts on the overturned goal, what they told you and what you saw from your perspective. 
JOHN TORTORELLA: Yeah, when I saw it on the screen on the bench, at one view I thought he did move his arm to knock it in. Bottom line is I think it hit Steph's helmet. But then I looked at another view, and JVR just skates into it. I think it's a goal. First of all, no matter what he did, it hits Steph's helmet before it goes into the net, so I think it should be a goal.
