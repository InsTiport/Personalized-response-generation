  JOHN TORTORELLA:   If we don't think it's a good fit, we're certainly not going to sign or trade for someone just to make a change.   We'll stay with it.   We've got some good people looking at a lot of different situations by free agency or trade.   If it works for us, we'll try to do it.   
   
 Q.   I know you mentioned time and again that the team wasn't tired by the end of the playoffs.   
JOHN TORTORELLA:   We weren't.  
   
 Q.   You mean they weren't mentally and physically?   
JOHN TORTORELLA:   All teams chip down.   As you play that much hockey and the scrutiny, the playoffs, all teams chip down.   
We're certainly not going to use that as an excuse.   
Quite honestly, for me it's the mental fatigue that gets to players.   Do I think that happened to our club?   No, I don't.   If you watched Game5 and Game 6, I thought we were the fresher team in the second and third period of those two games.   
We just didn't make enough the plays, didn't have the puck enough, and Jersey was the better team.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the play of Dan Girardi might have run off on McDonagh?  
JOHN TORTORELLA:   Obviously once with you put them together, they stayed together.   They're a very good complement, helped one another.   Marc Staal coming back helped also.   
Ryan McDonagh, he is a guy that has an intangible about him that he looks, watches and tries to learn every day.   I think that's why he has progressed so quickly, because he doesn't think he has all the answers, he's trying to improve in all facets of his game.   I think that's why he had the year that he had.
