 Q.   (Indiscernible) which series you said before, but you were asked if you looked for something in the team and you weren't going to say what it was, but you had seen it.   Is that still the case?   
COACH TORTORELLA:   I can't even hear you.   Our team?   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   I mean, now that you're two rounds in, are you still looking for the same things as before the first round, before‑‑ in just how your players are acting and...  
COACH TORTORELLA:   We're fine.  
   
 Q.   And you've seen what you need to see?  
COACH TORTORELLA:   We're fine.  
   
 Q.   Is there a challenge emotionally with the quick turnaround from one series to the next?  
COACH TORTORELLA:   No, none.   
   
 Q.   You alluded yesterday to you're glad the team had the experience of two Game 7s.   So when other people are suggesting maybe 14 games isn't the best way to start out...  
COACH TORTORELLA:   It's a bunch of crap.   
   
 Q.   What does Ovechkin or (indiscernible) or the Capitals or the Devils ‑ does it really come down to what your team does?   Is that what your focus and preparation is?  
COACH TORTORELLA:   We don't spend too much time on the other team.   We're worried about our team.  
   
 Q.   You said home ice doesn't matter until you get to a Game 7.   Why is it different in Game 7 as opposed to any other home game?  
COACH TORTORELLA:   I just feel that way.
