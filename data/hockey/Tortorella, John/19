Q.   Dubinsky skated for the first time today   is there any other update?
COACH TORTORELLA:   No, there is no update.

Q.   Was he able to get on the ice? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   Other than that there's no other update.

Q.   Was Zuccarello skating with the other group? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   Yes.

Q.   How do you divide up who is skating? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   We have just one group.   As far as we want the other guys getting at some other guys in a game situation.

Q.   Can you talk about all the distractions and how your team has handled it as the season has gone on.   That was obviously a concerted effort by the whole team.   Have they just gotten better at it? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   What distraction? 

Q.   Just anything that's going on outside? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   We're good.   We have been good.   That way you could see our team right from the get go this year.   How busy we were with some of the different things going on with our club. 
Like I told you and some of the other guys covering the team, we addressed that in the summer.   I don't worry about that at all.

Q.   What more would you like to see out of the Boyle checking line, and what did you see from Mike Rupp's game last game that you think was positive?
COACH TORTORELLA:   I'm not going to talk about individual players.   What we need to see is better play from all of them, not just that line, not just Rupp but our team.

Q.   Do you think the guys were annoyed by their performance?   Does that motivate them? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   Annoyed by their play? 

Q.   Yeah. 
COACH TORTORELLA:   Absolutely.   Annoyed isn't the word, but we'll be in the right mindset tomorrow afternoon.

Q.   What's been better about the power play in the postseason compared to most of the regular season for you guys? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   I don't know.   I think it's been pretty crappy at times.   We've found a way to score a couple of goals.   I think on a couple of them, in front of the net.   Kreider has done a good job there the other night. 
The power play's a funny thing.   Sometimes even when there are some struggles, you find a way.   Sometimes when you move the puck very well and it's working well, you don't score.   So we've scored a couple.   Obviously, we've got to come in behind that with some five‑on‑fives.

Q.   You're getting great contribution in goal scoring for the defense.   But your forwards are not scoring that often.   What do you do to fix that? 
COACH TORTORELLA:   Keep playing.   That's all you can do.   We have some good players here.   We wouldn't be in this situation if we didn't.   So we just keep on playing.

Q.   That line that was out there today, Rupp, Boyle, and Anisimov.   I know you're not going to comment on if that's the line, but those three big guys, how important for those big guys to play physical on the wall against the Devils?   Just because Peter DeBoer said they're heavy along the wall there. 
COACH TORTORELLA:   I'll speak on our team.   I think that's a big part of how we play.   Big, small or medium build, we play hard along the boards.   Obviously that was void the other night.   So no matter who it is, when you're at this point in the season, you're playing against teams that we're playing against, Jersey, and the other two teams playing in the West, that's a big part of playoff hockey.   That's a big part of who we are, and we certainly have to be more consistent with that part.
