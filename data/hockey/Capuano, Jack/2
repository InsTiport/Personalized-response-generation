 Q.   Jack, did you feel like when those power plays went by the board early that they were going to come back and haunt you?   
JACK CAPUANO:   Yeah, we talked about special teams being an integral part of this game, and you know, we had them early, and we didn't capitalize on our chances.   Looking back at that, obviously, it's the last few games to be honest with you.   So something's got to be better.  
   
 Q.   Coach, when they tied it, did that kind of change the whole feeling in the room after the period?   
JACK CAPUANO:   No, I think we were good.   We wanted to come out and respond.   They're a good hockey club.   You know, they threw the puck to the net, took a bad route behind the net, they get the rebound, and it's in your net.   So, that was a good game.   
Again, I still think we're in a good spot.   We'll regroup after the second and come back out, and we got away from our game a little bit.   There is no question.   Six or seven shots we had in the third period, you know, and we needed to do a little bit more and we didn't do it.  
   
 Q.   In that first period it felt like both teams were maybe feeling each other out.   How much of that was just the conditions, and how much of that was both teams trying to play a little safe?   
JACK CAPUANO:   I don't know if it was playing safe.   We tried to dictate the pace, and they were pushing the pace.   I think you saw some good structure from both teams as far as the team concept.   Chances were limited and it was from both sides.   Second period it's the one change.   We tried to win that change game and go short shifts.   We started the game with momentum, and I thought we could have one or two goals in that second period.  
   
 Q.   Despite the loss tonight, just your thoughts on the experience tonight and the surroundings?   
JACK CAPUANO:   It was a great experience.   Obviously, you don't want to be on this side of it.   I mean, the NHL has done a great job.   You go out there and you look at the atmosphere, you look at the fans and the show that they put on was pretty amazing.   We're fortunate to be a part of this.  
   
 Q.   Coach, your thoughts on Nabby?   He looked pretty good for someone who hadn't started in almost a month.   
JACK CAPUANO:   Yeah, we had full confidence as we talked earlier today that he was healthy, he was a hundred percent.   He made a couple big saves when he was called upon.   Nash had a couple chances there and I thought he came up big for us.   So felt good after the game and that was a positive sign for us.  
   
 Q.   Your top line had a lot of chances but they weren't able to score tonight.   How did you feel about their game overall?   
JACK CAPUANO:   I'm not going to single certain guys out, but I think that line knows they can be better.   I think we talked about it before with them.   They tried to do a little too much.   Less is more.   You know, 26 was in front of the goalie, Lundqvist, a few times and we never generated pucks through to him.   That was the one area of the game that I thought could have been better.  
   
 Q.   The end of the second, you had them 1‑zip, what broke down and went wrong on the tieing goal?   
JACK CAPUANO:   We just took a wrong route.   You can go back and we just swing away on that goal and the second goal we do the same thing.   We're tracking.   We're there but we're not there.  
   
 Q.   You're playing as well as you were during the winning streak with the 3‑1 lead.   Do you feel you were close to get back to where you were?   
JACK CAPUANO:   I don't look at the leads like you guys look at the score because there is too much skill in this league whether you have a goal lead or two goal lead and special teams played a part in it.   I look at the foundation and the way we played.   To answer your question, I think we played well.   We're not getting the results right now, but mentally it's how you handle it.   
I thought we played a good enough game tonight to win.   The power play wasn't good, but we did a lot of good things.   We had a chance of dealing with Okposo, point blank.   It goes off his toe and he doesn't get the shot on net.   
We're playing well enough to win, but we've got to find a way to win, that is the bottom line.   Because we played quite a bit of hockey now, and we've got a week left here before the Olympic break.
