 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Marian Hossa and Henrik Zetterberg. 

 Q. Marian, without Pavel and without Nik, did you feel it was on you to make a difference in this game? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: Well, you know, we were missing key players on our team. You know, we have to step up. You know, playing with Fil, he's a great skater, can give you the puck anytime. I just knew I just have to drive to the net more often, try to be more dangerous and, you know, play a little more physical. I just have to do that. 

 Q. Henrik, when did you hear about Nik being out? Did that just put an even greater emphasis on defense today? 
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, we heard it this morning when we had our pregame meal, that he's not playing. Just had to deal with it. Cheli comes in and play a really good game. Other players had to step up. You know, I think we did a good game. 

 Q. Marian, you talked about pressing a little bit, being frustrated, not having pucks go in the net. To get that first one to go in, and the second one, just the relief of that a little bit?
 MARIAN HOSSA: Yeah, for sure. When you're getting chances and the puck doesn't go in for you, you know, it's a human nature, you start pressing. So I told myself I just have to play more relaxed, play with my instinct, just keep the thing simple. 
 I tried to do that, holded the puck a little longer, protect it more often. We got the first one. Always when you get the first one after a few games, it kind of calm you down, then you start feeling it, start being more patient. 

 Q. Henrik, it looked like the Blackhawks were doing some running around, trying to chip it up a little bit. Did you see that, too? Talk about your response to that. 
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, we just tried to keep it, you know -- play with poise. We knew they were coming. You know, they didn't basically have anything else to do, you know, when the game kind of ran away there. Tried to play physical, and I think the ref did a good job, you know, made the calls, and we took advantage on the power play. 

 Q. Henrik, you're obviously 3-1. You have double home ice advantage now. Talk about the difficulty that it can be, getting that fourth and final win?
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: You always play, you know, just for next game every time. You know, I think we did our job at home. We came into Chicago, want to play two solid road games. Starting in Game 3, we went to overtime, it was a tight game. 
 You know, today we just came out and tried to play with a little more poise, a little more confidence. I think we did. We made some plays from the beginning in our own end, got our legs going and moved up the play into their end. 

 Q. Marian, had you realized that all your goals have been in Game 4s in all three series, in each of those games you scored twice? Did you realize that anomaly yet? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: Yeah, when you don't score, you realize when you score. It's just funny. You know, in every fourth game in the series, you got two goals. It's just funny how it goes. 
 You know, I try to stop that next game. 

 Q. Henrik, you've had trouble starting out, slow starts. You are now short-manned. How important was it for you to get the momentum, take the crowd out of this one?
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: You know, we had some troubles during the playoffs starting off good. Every game we talk about it. I think a big key is just go out and make plays, talk a lot in our own end. They're coming with a lot of speed. If you execute on the first pass, it's a lot easier for you. You know, we did that today. Just have to stick with it and go home and play same way in Game 5. 

 Q. Henrik, did you feel like the way they were running around, were they still thinking of the Kronwall hit on Friday night? Did you feel they were trying to make a statement there? 
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: I don't know what they were thinking. You know, that was the way they were playing. You know, we just pay attention to ourselves, try to stick with it, play the way we want to, don't care about so much what they're doing. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, guys.
