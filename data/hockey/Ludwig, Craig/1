 Q. Intensity is picking up. There was a little bit of bad blood during the end of the
period. Hasek wanders. Your team has been told to do what in that situation?
 
 RICHARD MATVICHUK: We got to go for our stick. He is out there like a third defensemen
and we can't have him -- we are going to have like a third defenseman we don't need that.
We have to take advantage of our powerplay right now and hope we can get back in this
thing, like I said, if it takes 25 or 30 minutes, that is what it takes. 
 Q. Craig Ludwig blocked shots, great defense turnover tonight. Go over your perspective
on it. 
 
 CRAIG LUDWIG: The puck was just dumped out of their zone. It was going into our end I
was just trying to throw it over to my partner Shawn and it bounce the right off the top
of my stick, right on, I think it was Ward's stick, and he just shot it over the top of
me. I think I screened Eddie on it and he didn't have a chance. 
 Q. With the goal scorer second period Dixon Ward, even your shift, line shift after the
goal, seemed to be the best shift you guys had; maybe the best period so far in this
series for the Sabres? 
 
 DIXON WARD: No question about it. I think we just got our energy going; started
throwing everything at them and we had our defensemen really involved; keep the pucks in;
that is what we have to do to create some chances.
