Q.  You participated in this competition in 1994. How do you compare the two competitions?
 
ARTURS IRBE:   It was very different. First of all, there was no shooting for the goalies across the ice and, secondly, there were different drills for the players here. They could circle the nets this year and guys kept coming in hard for rebounds. It is similar to what they do in practice. They shoot really fast. It's hard for a goalie to get ready for the next shooting. This time it was more of a game-like situation and a better chance for the goalies. 
 

Q.  When you lost your blocker, it took a while for your teammates to give you a stick, right?
 
ARTURS IRBE:   Whatever works. This is a newly-assembled team. It got assembled this morning, you know. We didn't know how to communicate on this team. And finally Dom, (HASEK)  came and rescued me by grabbing his extra stick.
