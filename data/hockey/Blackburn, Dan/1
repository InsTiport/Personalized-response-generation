Q.  Danny, were you starting to wonder whether Pascal was claiming and watching the dominoes fall?
 
DAN BLACKBURN: Well, I had a couple good interviews with two of the teams before the Rangers picked me.  So I knew I'd get my chance and I'm really glad to be part of the New York Rangers organization.  
 

Q.  With all the hype leading up to the draft and then you were picked by the Rangers and I guess you learned firsthand the amount of media especially in New York, how they get you right away, is that something that you're looking forward to or are you going to have to get used to?  What kind of guy are you; do you like or dislike the feel of that?
 
DAN BLACKBURN: I like dealing with the media.  There's only one newspaper, one reporter in Kootenay, so there's going to be a little bit getting used to, but I'm looking forward to that.
