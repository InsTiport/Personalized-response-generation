 Q. Can you remember line ahurricane fans have never seen you play hockey, how would you describe your hockey?
 PHILIPPE PARADIS: Maybe a little bit like Iginla, can score goals and make plays.

 Q. Is there a trademark goal? 
 PHILIPPE PARADIS: I can go in the slot to take a rebound from a big guy, a big D man and sometimes I can take a good shot from the harsh mark or something like that. 

 Q. What do you know about the Hurricanes franchise? Have you looked at their roster? 
 PHILIPPE PARADIS: Yeah, I looked at them but I see them in the playoff, they are always good, like it been five or six years they have been in the playoffs, Stanley Cup not too far, and no playoff this year, so I think they are a good organization. 

 Q. Were you surprised they picked you or did they interview you? 
 PHILIPPE PARADIS: I know they have some attention about me but not as much to pick me in the first round.
