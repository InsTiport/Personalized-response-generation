PETER BONDRA:  Hopefully not.  Our location is bad, you have a short travel, especially East Coast.  We get some good days off so we can recover and get back to high level game. 
 

Q.  More days off than normal?
 
PETER BONDRA:  Yeah, for sure.  You've got to use them. 
 

Q.  How many goals do you think we'll see scored this year?
 
PETER BONDRA:  I think it will be a game like in Boston a couple years ago.  I think the key in this game going to be goalies.  Good goalies on either side. Hopefully we going to win the game. 
 

Q.  Do you look at the two teams to see disparaging talent at all?
 
PETER BONDRA:  Well, both team compete against each other.  Maybe our team is skating a little bit better, a little bit more speed, but the other team maybe have more strength.  We'll see.  It will be exciting.  I want to see  the game, too.
