PETER BONDRA:  We'll play hard and keep it simple.  Just keep a simple game and create chances. Don't try to do -- don't try to score on the rush because. 
 

Q.  It seems like today's practice was a little light -- I mean -- it was fun.
 
PETER BONDRA:  Yeah, it was fun.  We tried to stay positive.  If you look at it our way, we had a chance to win either game and we'll just go from there.  Still, we have to work hard, especially in the first period.  We have to somehow score first and hopefully it will go our way in the game. 
 

Q.  Have they said anything special with you, your chances have not been as -- you haven't had as many chances as you usually have?
 
PETER BONDRA:  Well, if they play well.  I've got to give them credit.  But, sure, I'm not in the top of my game.  Sure, I missed some in there.  But whatever we can do, I guess I will have to play harder and keep it more simple and be patient, I guess. 
 

Q.  Have you found it -- how would you categorize your first trip in the Stanley Cup finals?
 
PETER BONDRA:  Probably different than the  series in Buffalo.  Somehow, we just, you know -- for my game, I just somehow can't get into it like -- I try to do whatever, but maybe it's a little bit of pressure there or maybe not enough experience.  But, for sure, I will try to get better and hopefully I will have a chance. 
 

Q.  Could some of that blame be attributed to Detroit being as good as they are?
 
PETER BONDRA:  Oh, yeah.  If they're very, very good, then there is not much room there to play -- you know, like they come back and tell you -- I mean, you try to change stuff like, you know, shoot a little earlier than usually and then it's just not working for you.
