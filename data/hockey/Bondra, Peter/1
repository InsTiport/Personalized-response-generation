Q.  All of those cheers from the fans, did that lift you up enough to know that you still made a great accomplishment?

PETER BONDRA:  First of all, congratulations Red Wings.  They deserved to win the Stanley Cup.  And for us, I guess, it's sad.  We tried but -- everybody tried to do the best job they can and we came up short.  But at the same time, we learned something new and, hopefully, I will use that new stuff in my career and, hopefully, I will get to the point where I'm going to have a chance again to win the Stanley Cup.


Q.  You like this Stanley Cup thing?

PETER BONDRA:  Sure.  We work hard for all year at training camp, you work all summer to get to the point where you have a shot for it and it looks like this year we had a shot.  We played well as a  team.  We lost as a team.  And that's the bottom line.


Q.  What was the difference in this series?  In your mind, why were the Detroit Red Wings able to come in here and win four games from you guys?

PETER BONDRA:  They played, obviously, better than us.  But probably the key was the second game, if you think about it.  That was probably what took the confidence from us.  We still fight for it, try our best to win a game, try to turn things around for ourselves, but I guess our effort wasn't enough.  But we gave it our best shot.
