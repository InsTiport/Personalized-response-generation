THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.   
   
 Q. Nick, walk us through the goal.   
NICK BONINO: Yeah, just came into the zone a little bit late. I saw Tanger in the corner. Haggy was down there battling with him. Wasn't sure if I should get out of there and get above their guys. They kept alive and Tanger put it right on my stick.   
It's one of those shots that wasn't my hardest shot by any means, but just found a way to kind of flip it over him. Great pass from Tanger.   
   
 Q. Nick, as someone who has been traded a couple times in the past couple years, do you feel extra validation scoring a goal in the Stanley Cup Final and do you feel you finally found a home here long‑term maybe?  
NICK BONINO: I don't know about long‑term, you never know. Especially me, the last few summers.   
I think I found a home for sure. I enjoy the guys, enjoy the team. Organization is first class. Definitely feels nice to be in the Cup Final playing with these two guys, it's been a lot of fun for me.   
   
 Q. You were on the ice during the penalty kill. Have you ever heard a building that loud?   
CARL HAGELIN: It was obviously cool to be out there. There was a lot of energy in the building. It was super loud. Any time you can kill off a penalty that late, it's a really good feeling. I think we did a good job of not giving them any shots.   
We got to keep doing that.   
   
 Q. Carl, I'm not sure many players in the league can catch you on a breakaway. Brent Burns did. The whole game looked like a track meet. Did it feel as fast as it looked?  
CARL HAGELIN: Yeah, it was a fast‑paced game for sure. Two teams that came out with a lot of intensity. We skated really hard in the first obviously. They kind of caught up to us in the second when we stopped skating a little bit.   
I think overall we have to use our speed to be successful in the series.   
   
 Q. Nick, you scored a couple of big goals in these playoffs. Is there sort of like a rhythm you feel like you found in these close playoff games, a style of play you feel comfortable with?  
NICK BONINO: I think the biggest thing for me is to stay even‑keeled, not change my game, whether it's game one of the season or the Stanley Cup Final.   
I think that allows me to kind of stay in the moment there. When you get passes like I've gotten, pucks to the net like Haggy did, the pass tonight from Tanger, it makes it a whole lot easier to score those goals.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
