 Q. Is this much more what you expected of this series?
 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: I think so, tighter checking more; more dumps. The ice isn't so great
out there. It is more conservative. 
 
Q. Defensemen going out, tight game, tie game, last period, Modano and Hull, more
attention to them? How do you play them?
 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: I think they are going to be playing more than what they had; maybe
double shifting and have to be ready and pace ourselves and keep them to the outside.
