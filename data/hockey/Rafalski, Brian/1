Detroit  Â– 5
  Pittsburgh -0

 Q. What was so different about special teams for you guys tonight? 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: Actually, that first kill was a big boost for us. I think it gave us a lot of confidence going forward. We did what we had to do. We were focused throughout. Thought we shot the puck more. Obviously, having Pavel back helps, too. 

 Q. Can you expand on Pavel's impact on this game? 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: Well, I thought he did very well for being off as long as he has been. He, obviously, didn't have full -- he wasn't full 100% Pavel Datsyuk, but I'll take 85% of Pavel Datsyuk and 100% of most other guys. 
 His vision is obviously very good, and his ability to handle the puck. It's only going to get stronger as we go forward.

 Q. Did you guys feel at the time on the bench that Talbot had gone after the injury for Datsyuk? 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: Yeah, I guess you see it. But I didn't realize how much it happened. I don't have time to watch all of that. Trying to focus on what I have to do. 
 But, obviously, Pav's a heads-up player. He's not going to put himself in a bad situation, and I thought he did very well out there. 

 Q. After Game 4, there was a lot of chatter coming out of the Pittsburgh side that you guys were a little tired. Particularly Zetterberg from chasing Crosby around, and maybe you were a little old and a little worn down. Did you guys pay attention to that at all? Was it a motivating factor? 
 BRIAN RAFALSKI: I don't know if it's a motivating factor. Obviously, we had a tough schedule the last week before the stretch of games, the last few games here coming up. You battle through it. You do what you can. You do what you have to do. 
 Honestly, I haven't read or heard or been paying attention at all really to the media. Just focus on what we have to do, and that's the mentality of our locker room.
