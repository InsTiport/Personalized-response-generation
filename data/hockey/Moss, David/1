  Q. Talk about the conditions out there and how they compare to the past experiences playing outside before.   
 DAVID MOSS: I think the conditions were good. The ice was fast. There's a few spots that were chippy, but overall I think they were pretty good.   
  
  Q. Just what about the weather? It didn't seem too bad once the sun was out. Was that how you found it?  
 DAVID MOSS: Yeah, the weather was surprisingly good. I think it was fairly warm once we got moving. And maybe a bit different for people who are standing around. But, yeah, it was good.  
  
  Q. Have any of your teammates approached you and with advice at all or any questions on how to deal with the conditions?  
 DAVID MOSS: No, I think the conditions are pretty self-explanatory. It's cold and the ice is different in every outdoor game you play in. So, yeah, I think guys kind of got a chance to get their feet wet, me included, and you see there's different things, the board is balanced. And, like I said, the ice is pretty good.
