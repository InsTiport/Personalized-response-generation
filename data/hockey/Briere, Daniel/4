Blackhawks  Â– 2
  Flyers - 1

 Q. (Question off Microphone).
 DANNY BRIERE: We didn't give them much. I understand that. But it's not really our type of hockey. We didn't forecheck, we didn't create much offensively. We didn't spend much time in their zone. 
 Obviously, when they take the lead, they're going to play a little bit more passive and give us a chance. The first two periods was way too conservative for what we're used to seeing from the Flyers. 

 Q. How good was Niemi in this game? 
 DANNY BRIERE: Honestly, I don't think we tested him very much. I thought we made him look good with outside shots way too often. I thought he played well in the third period. But we didn't create much traffic. We didn't have many quality chances. We have to do a better job there. 

 Q. Danny how about -- what happened in Game 1 because there's so much loose play? 
 DANNY BRIERE: Certainly, yeah. We all talked about tightening up defensively. But tightening up defensively doesn't mean no fore-check and no offense. I thought we sat back on our heels a little too much. 

 Q. You guys seemed to be a lot more physical before the game. Did he get you guys going or have that kind of an impact? 
 DANNY BRIERE: He was fired up. He was certainly ready to play. Had a lot of big hits. Especially in the first period. You could tell he was getting on their nerves. But they have a lot of guys that can do that well, but Danny played well, I thought. 

 Q. Any similarity to the Boston Series?
In that you played pretty well the first two and had a little feeling of confidence coming out of those. 
 DANNY BRIERE: Well, we're certainly not leaving Chicago feeling like we can't win. Both games I thought a bounce here or there going our way and the Series could easily be tied 1-1. We're down 2-0. We can't change that. We can't look back anymore. 
 Just like the Boston Series, we have to move forward and find a way to create our own bounces now. 

 Q. Danny, how did the play of Leighton in kind of a bounceback game, what did you think of his game tonight? 
 DANNY BRIERE: He played okay. He played well. He kept us in the game the whole time. I thought we did a good job limiting their chances. We didn't give them much. 
 But at the same time, just felt like it was a little too conservative. 

 Q. You guys in the first period, especially, did you feel as if they had ramped it up a little bit physically? 
 DANNY BRIERE: We knew they were going to try to do that. Especially the first ten minutes of the game in their building with their fans. That was to be expected. We were trying to weather the storm early on. 
 But we just held on to that same conservative play, I thought, for too long until we gave them the chance to take the two-goal lead. 

 Q. What was the feeling here after those two goals late in the second period to come back in the room, you have a little chance to regroup, what was that atmosphere? 
 DANNY BRIERE: Well, we just kept telling ourselves we're not quitters. We haven't quit yet so far this season. We're not going to quit now. We're going to do everything possible to get back in this game. We did with a quick goal on the power-play early in the third. And I thought the rest of the third we played extremely well. We created a lot of chances. We spent most of the period in their zone. But we just couldn't find the back of the net. 

 Q. How are you able to do that? What was the change between the second and third period? 
 DANNY BRIERE: I think it's an attitude change. We played with a little more desperation. Like I said earlier, the first two periods we were just too casual -- not too casual, too conservative on our heels. I understand that we we're trying to play better defensively, but we just sat back a little too much for my liking. 

 Q. How tough is it to be in that 0-2 hole, even though you're heading home? How much has it shaken your confidence? 
 DANNY BRIERE: It doesn't matter. We can't change it. We've been in the hole before. We found a way to climb back out. That's the same thing, the same attitude we're going to adopt once again. 

 Q. You guys got a boost last couple of rounds with Gagne back and Carter. What are you going to turn to now that you're facing the same deficit? 
 DANNY BRIERE: The guys in the room. That's all we can rely on. That's all we've been since the beginning of the year. We haven't had many additions. In the trade deadline there were no trades. It's guys in this room that have been doing the job the whole year. It's not going to change now. 

 Q. You say the team is still very confident? 
 DANNY BRIERE: Yeah. At this point, there's two teams standing. We have to be confident. We have to believe in ourselves. And, you know, like I said earlier, we never quit before. We're not going to quit now.
