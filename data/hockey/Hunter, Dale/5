Q.  Dale, talk about the incident with Steve last night.  Nothing personal?
 
DALE HUNTER: Just playing hockey.  They have got guys that play hard.  We have got guys that play hard. 
 

Q.  What does it mean to you to be here and in this situation in light of the number of years you have played?
 
DALE HUNTER: It is an honor to come play in the Finals like this.  And, everybody wants to win the Stanley Cup and you have to go in the Finals to win it. 
 

Q.  Dale, what do you see in Game 2?
 
DALE HUNTER: Play the same style.  Keep playing the same way.  We just got to create more scoring chances.  It is 17 shots, I think it was at the end.  Wasn't it?  Definitely, we have got to get some more rubber on the net.  17 shots, you don't take that many shots; it lessens your chances to score.  I think we have to go harder like as far as taking the shots and not getting the rebounds and stuff.
