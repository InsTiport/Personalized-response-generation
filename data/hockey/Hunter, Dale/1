Q.  Can you express the feeling of being this close and then not getting all the way there?

DALE HUNTER:  It's disappointment and one of those things where they're better than us.  Four games.  They beat us.  It's disappointment.

Q.  Is it harder to stomach now knowing after all of this time having worked so hard and knowing how together this team has been to have tasted it and then lose?

DALE HUNTER:  We game up four games short. That's all.  You know, guys played great for three rounds and, tonight, you know, we played a good team tonight and they were better than us for four games.

Q.  There are some older and younger players on this team.  Do you see this as the beginning of a great run for this Capitals team or do you see IT changing in a major way as it comes back to next year?

DALE HUNTER:  No.  I really think, you know, Olie Kolzig was one of our best players all Playoffs. I think you can really -- when you've got a goalie like that, you can really build a team for a lot of years.

Q.  How difficult is it for you right now to look back and draw some positives on what was a really great year for this hockey team? 

DALE HUNTER:  To get to the finals and lose, it's a big disappointment, but, you know, -- the way "Olie the Goalie" played, you know, you get goaltending like that.  It's just a matter -- it didn't work out this year.  We played a good team and they beat us.  They beat us.
