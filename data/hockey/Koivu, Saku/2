SAKU KOIVU:  Well, he's the best player that ever played hockey, but I don't even realize how big his career is, all the goals, all the Stanley Cups and everything. He's a great player.  Also he's a really, really nice person.  I think that's the great thing.  He's still the same guy.


Q.  What's the best thing about going to the Olympics?

SAKU KOIVU:  I think being part of the Olympics, it's the atmosphere there and playing for your country.  I played once in '94, Lillehammer.  It's really special.  It's not only the hockey; it's other sports.  Being part of something like that.  It's great.


Q.  What's the worst?

SAKU KOIVU:  What's the worst?  I don't know. Nothing bad.  I'm just happy to go there.  If you do well, it's great.  But if you do bad --


Q.  -- it's a long trip home?

SAKU KOIVU:  Yeah.  I guess the only thing bad is coming back here and start to playing again. 


Q.  (Inaudible)

SAKU KOIVU:  Well, that would be great.  Four Finnish guys in the same line, that would be good, to be playing in the same line with Jari Kurri, that would be great.


Q.  (Inaudible)

SAKU KOIVU:  It's easier to come here because of them.  That makes his career even better because he was the first.


Q.  (Inaudible)

SAKU KOIVU:  When I was ten, 12, like I said, his career made it easier for us.
