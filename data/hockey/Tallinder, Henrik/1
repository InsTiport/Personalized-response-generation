  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Henrik Tallinder.   
   
 Q.   What was your view from the sidelines of the first games of the series?   What were your thoughts watching the team?  
HENRIK TALLINDER:   The first game was maybe our poorest effort, at least the first two periods.   But after that I think we played pretty good.   Third period we tied it up, went to overtime.   Any team could have won.   Same thing second game.   I thought we played a pretty good game.   
The thing is, the first goal has been really important in this series.   Once you get that, the other team opens up a little bit.   You're going to see more scoring opportunities.   
I think that's the key in this series.   
   
 Q.   What is it like for you to have stepped on that ice in the Stanley Cup Final?   What is it like to be this close for you?  
HENRIK TALLINDER:   It's a lot of words:   excitement, nervous, happy.   I mean, there were so many emotions out there.   
I just enjoyed it.   It was so much fun.   It's another level, even from the Conference Finals, to go to the finals.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you played better because maybe you appreciated it a little bit more with the time off and coming back?  
HENRIK TALLINDER:   I felt pretty comfortable.   I've been skating for three weeks.   Felt better and better and better.   Once you start practicing with the team again, you know, you get to feel a little bit.   It's not the same, but you get the feel a little bit if you lost something or not, something like that.   
But I felt really good, yeah.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
