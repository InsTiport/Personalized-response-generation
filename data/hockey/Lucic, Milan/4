  Q.  Another one of the great young players and stars in the National Hockey League, Milan, just give us a little thought, feeling about what all this means to you?  You know, coming here for an NHL All-Star Game?   
 MILAN LUCIC:  It's a huge honor to be a part of this weekend.  It's such a great weekend for hockey.  It's a real exciting weekend.  So any time you get to be a part of it, it is a huge honor.  Just come here and have a lot of fun with it.   
  
  Q.  Who, in particular, of all these great players that are going to be here, are you most looking forward to meeting and talking to?   
 MILAN LUCIC:  Jerome Iginla.  He's one guy, he's my favorite player in the NHL growing up.  He's one guy that I always looked up to.  And I always try to model my game after his.   
  
  Q.  Because of the way he plays?   
 MILAN LUCIC:  Oh, yeah.  He plays hard.  As much as he scores, he's physical.  He's not afraid to have a scrap here or there.  So I think he's a good all around player.   
  
  Q.  Who is going to be more nervous?  You or your parents that are flying in from Vancouver?   
 MILAN LUCIC:  You know, I don't think any of us are going to be nervous.  I think we're going to be more excited than anything.   
 So again, like I said before, we're just going to have a lot of fun.  I haven't seen them much this year, so I'm glad I get to share this experience with them.   
  
  Q.  Your Boston Bruins are going well, good luck the rest of the way?   
 MILAN LUCIC:  Thank you.
