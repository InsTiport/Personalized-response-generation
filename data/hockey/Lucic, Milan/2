   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Milan Lucic.   
  
  Q. (Question on the hit suspension.)   
 MILAN LUCIC: It's the league's decision. They have a hard job definitely with these kind of things. Like you said, regardless, it doesn't bring Nathan back. He's been one of if not our best forward throughout the playoffs. It's a big loss for us, but it's an opportunity for someone now to step up. We need someone now to step up.   
 Like I said, Nathan has been one of our best players. We still have to go out there and focus on what we need to do in order to have some success.   
  
  Q. Can that be a rallying call?   
 MILAN LUCIC: You know, you definitely want to win for a guy like that. He's done so much for our team this year, getting us to this point. You can use it as motivation if you want, for sure.   
 Especially for myself, he's made a big impact in my life as a good friend and as a line mate. You can definitely use that as a motivation.  
  
  Q. Do you have to watch yourself to play inside yourself, try not to do too much?   
 MILAN LUCIC: Yeah, you know, this isn't the time of year where you're trying to go out and get reparations or get back at someone for something like that. The best revenge is beating them on the scoreboard. That's the way we have to look at it.
