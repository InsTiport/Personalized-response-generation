  Q.  Your thoughts of being down two now?    
 RAY EMERY: Not a situation you want to be in.    
 But you know, it's a one-game at a time thing, any situation you're in.  So we are disappointed, but we gotta win the next game and that's it.   
  
  Q.  What happened after that start, after that first period?   
 RAY EMERY:  We played great in the first.  Giguere kept them in it, and we battled and got one right at the end of the first.  It was a big goal, but I think part of it is them bouncing back.  Playing a big second.  And maybe us not playing the same way that we did in the first, not getting pucks deep, the simple things.   
  
  Q.  How big of a hole is this?   
 RAY EMERY:  That's the biggest one we've been in this year.  Is it impossible to come out of?  No.  We won three games in a row against great teams this year tons of times.  So certainly can win two games in a row, no problem.  Once you do that, it's just whoever wins Game 7.  We have to look at it one game at a time and something we're definitely capable of.    
  
  Q.  Ray, how is the confidence level now (indiscernible) score five-on-five in two games?   
 RAY EMERY:  We're confident.  We realize if we play our game, which we have in spurts, you know we dominate on the ice there.  So we just gotta do the things that have been working during those stretches where we're the dominant team, and we'll be fine.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible) especially the way you played them, you were so good?   
 RAY EMERY:  We take pride in our game at home.  We realize there's a big opportunity to even the series, and we're never happy with a loss.  So it's a tough spot to be in, but one that we're definitely capable of coming out of.
