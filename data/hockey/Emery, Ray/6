 Q.  Your thoughts on having the lead going into the third and not coming away with a win? 
 RAY EMERY:  It's tough.  You gotta take one in their building, and give ourselves a chance going into the third.  We want to have a better period than that.  I want to play better than that.  That's a disappointing one.  But we did a lot of good things and made a lot of mistakes.  We continue to do the good things and fix the mistakes we find. 

 Q.  You didn't have the bad game in the playoffs, was this it? 
 RAY EMERY:  I think we made maybe more mistakes than we have in most of our games, but we did a lot of good things.  We drew a lot of penalties.  We kept our composure.  The power play was good for the most part.  (Indiscernible) was good. 
 You've got to fix some of those mistakes but you can't forget about the positives. 

 Q.  Rest factor? 
 RAY EMERY:  You know, they were out for a while, too.  So I don't think that's the best hockey we can play.  I don't think we're - especially in the start of the game we're fully in game mode yet, but it's not an excuse.  Both teams had some time off.
