Blackhawks  Â– 3
  Flyers - 4

 Q. Kind of similar in the sense that it could have gone either way. It just goes against you. 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: I mean, we have to be way better. Especially right after when I don't think we were hungry enough. Today was a tough game. We stayed with it, and in overtime it could go either way. We had one good shift there. Leighton made a couple of good saves. 
 We have to just keep going to the net more, keep scurrying him and throwing everything at the net to get the rebounds, second and third chances. 

 Q. Tomas, that chippiness, is it taking away from the skill game, the team skill game at all? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: No, when you make sure your skills come out. Each guy in this dressing room is competing 100%. Skills is going to come out when you work hard, everything takes --

 Q. Anything you could do defensively in the third period? Because the last two games the Flyers have really taken it to --
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Play better offensively. More we hold on to the pucks in their zone, it's going to be tougher for them to score. I think we just have to protect the puck a little more. Keep cycling and keep the puck -- once we get in our zone, we got to keep it more simple. Get it out. Flips and foot races. And we have a fast enough team to push the pace and just make sure we make their --

 Q. Pretty deflating on the bench after Kane scores and they respond right away? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Yeah. It's always a big shift after we score or they score. We know that, and each guy in the dressing room is basically doing what they can. Today was one of those games we were going to take five minutes like we did after last game and we are going to learn from it. The one good thing is we're playing back on Friday. 

 Q. You just have to forget about this fast? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: I agree. There's no reason to panic or anything. It was one game, and take five minutes, learn from it. We know where we made our mistakes, each and every one of us. We just have to keep growing and bringing even more on Friday. 

 Q. (Question off Microphone).
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Not really. We usually play good when we are out. I mean, it doesn't really matter. Obviously, the crowd is loud here. But I don't think any of the players are paying too much attention to it. Doesn't really affect us. 

 Q. Obviously, a huge relief when the goal is disallowed in overtime. What were the thoughts there? You guys just couldn't capitalize for the next one? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Yeah, I thought we were going to -- there was a little energy for us. I thought we were going to change momentum right away. They just came with another goal. Not much you can do. Take five minutes, learn from this and get back on working harder on Friday. 

 Q. What is it about the third period? It seems like they've been the energy team in both games so far in the last two? Does it feel that way? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Not really. Like we had lots of energy too. We played four lines. All the guys were contributing as well. Not really. I wouldn't say they have more energy than us. They are a good team. We were expecting a long battle, a long Series before the Finals started. 
 So it's one game, no panic, we have to get back on Friday. 

 Q. All three games so far, just one goal the difference. Can you talk about how thin that line is between winning and losing? 
 TOMAS KOPECKY: Very thin. Especially right now, this time of the year. You have to have lots of things to go your way. You have to be a little bit lucky and always you have to work really hard and earn that luck as well. It's a really thin line between losing and winning.
