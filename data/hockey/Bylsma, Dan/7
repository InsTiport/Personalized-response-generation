 Q.   Dan, did you guys do anything differently tonight defensively to look so different than what we saw in Game 1 or 2 or was it just the way the guys went out there and played?  
COACH BYLSMA:   It was I think the way our team played, competed and battled.   I thought we made a couple minor adjustments, but that was a hard‑fought game.   It was hard‑fought all over the ice, and we threw a lot at them.   We threw a lot at them in regulation, we threw 50‑plus shots, and we played exactly how we wanted to play, just couldn't find the second goal.   
   
 Q.   Simply put, where do you guys go from here, with the way you guys played tonight and the 3‑0 deficit?   
COACH BYLSMA:   Do that right again.   We planned on winning Game 4, as well, and now we're going to regroup and get back and play just like that again and win one hockey game.   
   
 Q.   Tomas Vokoun after the first shot, can you speak about his game and keeping the guys in it time and time again?  
COACH BYLSMA:   I think unfortunately there the first shot was the play off the skate and the pass that went off the skate and got by him, and it's unfortunate because that looked like the only way he was going to let one in.   He played really, really well, really solid, and I think there were a number of four or five really good chances in particular there in the first overtime where he made some great saves, played really solid for us.   Again, we threw 50‑plus shots, and unfortunately they get one off a skate bounce early on, and the last one in the game.  
   
 Q.   The power play certainly had a lot of opportunities, and when you were on the power play it's not like you didn't have chances to win the game.   Are you pleased in general with how they executed with a man advantage and just a matter of needing a little bit of a break at this point to get that unit going again?   
COACH BYLSMA:   Yeah, you know, we had some opportunities both regulation‑wise and in overtime, too, to score a power play goal.   We did a lot of good things.   We had some good looks.   We had the puck on the stick, people in spots we wanted to have and got great opportunities, and at the end of the day, a power play goal would have made the difference in the game.   You don't feel like you capitalized on those opportunities, especially in overtime; it would have sent us home winners.  
   
 Q.   You said this morning that this game would give you an idea of where your team's mindset was, and it's probably tough after such a long game and whatnot, but can you talk about what that response was that you saw from your team?   What answers did you get?   
COACH BYLSMA:   It was a hard‑fought game on both sides.   It was a very good response from our team.   We did a lot of things to get opportunities to win the hockey game.   We have to bounce back from a goal very early on in the game, and I thought we did that very well and stuck with it, got the goal to tie the game and really was a hard‑fought game all over the ice.   Again, we did everything but get the game‑winning goal there.   
   
 Q.   Sidney and Geno obviously played a lot better today, but they're still not getting those points.   Is there anything you can say or any particular situations other than just keeping going to get them back in it and get them better opportunities?   
COACH BYLSMA:   I don't give goal‑scoring tips to too many guys, but again, that's the way we need to play.   That's the way we can play, and we pushed it and we pushed it hard, and we had opportunities.   Those guys had great opportunities, five on five, Evgeni had a mini breakaway there, we had good chances on the power play, they all had good looks and we just have to keep playing that way, and that's what we're going to do.   We know the situation being down 0‑3 but we're going to come back for Game 5 and we're going to play exactly that same way and get a win in Game 4.  
   
 Q.   Obviously the Bruins are a very good team, but people are going to say at this time you're the head coach of the No.1 seed in the Eastern Conference on the verge of getting swept by a lower seed.   Is there any extra pressure to come back and just turn this thing around given the situation that you guys are in and have been coming into the Playoffs?  
COACH BYLSMA:   Not for the reasons you mentioned.   You know, we're competing in the Conference Finals for a chance to win and go to the Stanley Cup, and that's where we're going to be.   We're down 3‑0, we have lost the first three games, and we're going to battle and lay it out there, and we threw it at them tonight and didn't get the win, but we are going to‑‑ it's a race to 4, and they're not there yet, and we're going to come back in here, regroup and go after Game 4.   
   
 Q.   How much of a shift did you feel in the game after the Campbell blocked shot because it seemed like you guys were really starting to get some pressure going on that power play and he blocks that shot and obviously stays on the ice and it seemed like it gave them a pretty big lift there.   
COACH BYLSMA:   There was numerous times in the game I thought where there were momentum shifts.   We had a‑‑ they had a couple shifts there.   At the end of the third period we broke a stick and played D‑zone coverage without a stick and they had a three‑ or four‑ or five‑minute stretch in that time, certainly after the kill with Campbell the next four or five minutes of the game was at a frantic pace going both ways.   I think both teams fought through that at different times.   
Yes, that did‑‑ that kill and then the next five minutes was a momentum boost, but I think it went back and forth at different times in the game, and we certainly got it back later on in the game, later on in the contest.
