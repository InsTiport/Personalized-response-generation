Pittsburgh  Â– 1

 Q. Did you get a clarification what happened at the end there with regard to the instigator and the ramifications of that? 
 COACH BYLSMA: Didn't get clarification, no. 

 Q. What is your understanding of his availability now for next game? 
 COACH BYLSMA: I think if he got -- I haven't seen the score sheet, but if he got an instigator in the last five minutes I think there are rules that are clear. I don't know. 

 Q. You did have a discussion with Bill McCreary before the third, did it have something to do with the Hossa-Dupuis situation, was it a more general thing? Can you tell us anything about it? 
 COACH BYLSMA: I actually was more I think, I was more concerned about their guy being top of the crease in the blue paint. But it's normal talk between a coach and referee, when to do it. 

 Q. Could you just give us a little sense, Dan, for how this game differed from last night's in terms of what you needed to do and what you saw happen out there for your team? 
 COACH BYLSMA: I think it ended up being a lot alike. We had stretches where we played good. We got scoring chances and pucks around the net. Didn't capitalize them when they need to, and we got timely goals and goals in around our net and end up with the victory.

 Q. Did you see the Hossa hook-slash on Dupuis before the second goal, and if so, what did you make of the whole sequence? 
 COACH BYLSMA: I think the way I saw the replay that our guy was trying to get the puck out. Hossa came in and used his stick to lift up their guy's stick. You can make the judgment. The referee made the judgment that it wasn't a hook. 
 I can slow it down and look at it myself and make my own judgment, but that was what happened. We failed to clear it with that hook and it led to the goal. 

 Q. Going into Game 3, what can you guys do differently? What did you tell your team to get the fire under them to come back and take Game 3 at home? 
 COACH BYLSMA: I think in each of the first two games we have been able to play in the offensive zone for periods of time. We've been able to get shots. Been able to outshoot a good Detroit team. But they've been able to get the timely goals. They've been better at getting pucks in and around the net and getting that goal. That's what I've done better and as a result they've got two wins. 
 So as there are some positives we can do and draw on, and focus on ask get better at our game. Continue to get there. Get to the on offensive zone, get to the goalie. Look for those loose pucks and build on that. That's what we'll do when we get back for Game 3.
