THE MODERATOR:   We are joined by Ohio State, defenseman Curtis Gedig.   
We'll start with an opening statement from the head coach.   
COACH ROHLIK:   Well, it's that time of year where one team moves on, one team goes home.   Obviously, unfortunately for us, they got the last shot and scored the big goal there.  
I'm really proud of our guys in the locker room.   They emptied the tanks this weekend.   They gave it all they had.   That's all I ask.   It's a big, big step for our program.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Curtis.   
   
 Q.   Three games in three days catch up for you?  
CURTIS GEDIG:   No.   When you're playing for something like this, feels like the first game of the week.   You want it so bad, don't have that as an excuse.   
   
 Q.   What did their two goals in less than a minute do to you guys?   Take the wind out of your sails and did you recover from that?  
CURTIS GEDIG:   It's definitely heartbreaking.   It was definitely a shock.   But, I mean, it's part of the game.   It happens.   You just got to step back and prepare yourself for the next shifts.   
   
 Q.   Their top line, what was your hope going into the game?   What were the biggest challenges for you trying to manage them?  
CURTIS GEDIG:   I mean, we didn't try and separate them too much.   We just tried to play against every line as well as we could.   
I thought the team did a good job of team play.   Obviously at the end there they got the goal.   
   
 Q.   What does this mean overall for you guys as a program, essentially win a road game last night?   There's progress, right?  
CURTIS GEDIG:   Yeah, for sure.   I think it's a huge step for the program.   Sad I won't be around for it.   To play for this guy beside me, it's a huge honor.   My other teammates will be back next year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Curtis.   
We'll continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   How do you move forward into next year?  
COACH ROHLIK:   How?   Like I said earlier, we build on this.   I mean, this is a huge positive.   Right now it hurts.   But to get the experience that our guys got that are coming back, it's priceless.   To be on the big stage, to be one shot away from winning what this is, I think it's a huge building block for us.   
Certainly that's what we're going to build on.   The guys are going to get a little time off, get back to the school part of things.   I think our guys are really going to have a taste in their mouth for wanting to get back to this.  
   
 Q.   Three games in three days catch up to at least some of your guys?   
COACH ROHLIK:   These kids are young.   We gave it all we had, you know.   Wisconsin just came on there at the end.   We're not going to use it as an excuse.   We're going to play to the bell.   Our guys were ready.   We were prepared.   They just had the last shot.   
   
 Q.   The two goals in 28 seconds, did you sense anything on the bench change after that second goal?  
COACH ROHLIK:   When they scored the second one?   Obviously, you know, you're playing against one of the best teams in the country with eight seniors, six guys in the top two teams in this league that were named.   We know they're very good.   We just had to take a step back.   
We still felt we were in good shape.   It's still a one‑goal game.   Next goal wins probably.   We felt okay at that point.   We just didn't generate enough to finish.   
   
 Q.   What was the biggest challenge holding that line?  
COACH ROHLIK:   The biggest challenge there is they have three other lines we have to stop, as well.   They got one of the best teams in the country.   We had to stop all of them.   
When you put guys in that line that have as many games under their belt, the experience they have, in the end that was probably the difference.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
