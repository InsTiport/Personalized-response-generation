Q.  How big is the disappointment?

COACH RON WILSON: Dave, I don't want to answer questions where the answer is obvious.


Q.  Ron, is it a question of the fact of three 1-goal games of not getting the breaks?

COACH RON WILSON: Well, to an extent, but Detroit is working hard and good teams make their own breaks.  We have gotten breaks in other series when we worked hard and, you know, Detroit has been persistent and they amere to be on a mission without a doubt.


Q.  What do you think you can do for Game 4 given the fact that the teams played well, played hard?

COACH RON WILSON: We have got to continue to do the same thing and score one more goal than Detroit.  I mean, what can you say?  We had a bad start to the game.  We basically didn't show up in the first period, but after that, it was very happy and we just kept plugging 'til we tied it up and the great player made a great play and we lost the game by a goal.  I mean, there is nothing more that can be said.


Q.  What do you think was happening in the first period?  Why wouldn't the team show up in the first?

COACH RON WILSON: Well, I really don't know to be honest with you.  I will have to stay up all night and analyze that one.


Q.  Do you think that Detroit's experience in the Finals from last the three years is a factor here?

COACH RON WILSON: Well, I mean, that is easy to say.  I don't see why you have to be in the Finals to know how to play hard.  I mean, you work so hard to get here and we have had some guys just not play very well at all at this point.  And, part of it is how we are playing and a lot of credit has to go to Detroit for not allowing some of our key people to accomplish things.
