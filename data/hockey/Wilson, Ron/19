Q.  Obviously last year you were in this building, you went to triple overtime.  What was your team's thoughts going into overtime this night?
 
COACH WILSON:  Well, I think it was kind of difficult for us because of what happened in the third period.  We had a 2-goal lead a couple of times and we let things slip away.  We had made too many soft plays against a very hungry team and they took advantage of some of our mistakes.  We were stick checking instead of getting our body in the way, and you can't do that against a team of Detroit's caliber. 
 

Q.  Can you share anything with us in terms of what you told your team after the game?
 
COACH WILSON:  I didn't say a word.  I don't address the team after a game. 
 

Q.  Whether you lost 15 nothing or the way it was tonight, still would have been 2-nothing deficit you have got to look at it that way, but is this a particularly galling defeat because of what happened; it is going to be difficult for some of your players to get over?
 
COACH WILSON:  It makes it difficult for tonight, but we will bounce back.  I mean, we bounce back.  Yesterday they beaten us by a goal in each game.  We had the win right Esa's stick; for God's sake, could have made it 5 to 3. There was a lot of positive things we will build on and we will bounce right back at home.  We have to win one game in Detroit.  If it takes 4 tries to do it, so be it, we will bounce back at home. 
 

Q.  Did the goalie appear physically exhausted?
 
COACH WILSON:  No, he was making some great saves. Looked like our defense was tired because we were backing off giving up the blue line and a lot of perimeter shots.  I thought Olie was fine.  You couldn't fault him on any of the goals.
