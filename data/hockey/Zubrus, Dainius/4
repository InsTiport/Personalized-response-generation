  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dainius Zubrus. 

Q.   You have pretty much won the first period in these games.   Do you have to come out harder and stronger in this one knowing what's at stake? 
DAINIUS ZUBRUS:   Well, I think they going to come out real hard.   Now it's best out of three, they play in their building.   First two games the crowd was up.   I'm sure it's going to be the same thing and they going to feed off that. 
Maybe in a way we have to make sure we're ready for that.   But on top of it, we have to stop that.   That's how you win games, you match it if anything early, but you still have to top it and win the game and get some goals. 
I think we've done a pretty good job so far in a series where we're able to get maybe some of the momentum early in the game.   Like you said, hasn't always turned into goals, but when it does, makes any team that scores early feel good. 

Q.   No secret they capitalized off the power play.   Last game they only had one and did not score. 
DAINIUS ZUBRUS:   Any undisciplined penalty, any penalty for that matter, can really cost a momentum swing.   I'm not saying it cost the game, but it does sometimes turn out that way.   Like I said, being undisciplined is not really an option right now. 
I'm sure there will be penalties.   There's penalties that are taken that we'll try to kill off.   I think we've done pretty good job so far of not getting into all the scrums and stuff that happens afterwards. 
We've done pretty good job so far I think in the playoffs.   I don't have much doubt we're going to do the same. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
