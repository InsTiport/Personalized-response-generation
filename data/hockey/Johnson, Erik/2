  Q.  How do you feel to be just the fifth U.S.-born player to be selected No. 1 overall?   
 ERIK JOHNSON:  You know, it's a really amazing feeling.  You know, I'm proud and everything, but it's been a lot of hard work.  I've had a lot of support from my parents and everyone around me, so it wasn't just me.   
  
  Q.  How is this going to affect your decision regarding schooling and do you think you can step in and play this fall?   
 ERIK JOHNSON:  You know it just depends on what St. Louis wants me to do.  If they think it's in my best interests to try and turn pro, I'm definitely open to doing that.  Right now, I'm committed to Minnesota and I still have pretty firm intentions on doing that.   
 You know things could change, depending on what's best for me.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the response today from the fans in Vancouver compared to the response you had when you played here in the World Juniors?   
 ERIK JOHNSON:  Yeah, it's always good to be supported by the fans here.  I just think in Vancouver it happened because we were playing in Canada and it was their hometown.  I respect that, and it feels good to be back here in Vancouver and get the respect that I got today.   
  
  Q.  What do you think of St. Louis with the new staff, new ownership?   
 ERIK JOHNSON:  I just know whenever they have, they are going to do a tremendous job and just do the best they can to bring St. Louis to a Stanley Cup title.  I lived in St. Louis and I thought it was a great city and I'm really happy to be a part of that organization and the team.
