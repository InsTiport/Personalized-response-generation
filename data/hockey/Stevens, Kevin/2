KEVIN STEVENS:   Tomorrow is a big game.  You know, you don't want to go back.  It's not a must-win, but you don't want to go back to Pittsburgh with a 2-0 deficit and the third game is a definite must game.  So right now it's important for us to go out there and play better than we did the other night, and hopefully, score some goals in the first period and then go from there.  So we'll play better, but we expect the Devils to play better, too. 

Q.  You played a great game defensively.  Was that more about how they played or was it you guys were just a little tired? 

KEVIN STEVENS:   They played a good defensive game.  They didn't give up much, especially after the first period.  They did a good job there.  I don't think we skated as well as we can gait, but we'll be better come, but like I said, they will be better, too.  It will be a dog fight.  We have to generate some more offense.

Q.  Niedermayer, looks like he is coming back, too a lot more speed, how big is that for them?

KEVIN STEVENS:   He's a great player, great offensive player.  He helps their offense.  But defensive, they are been playing pretty well the defensemen, so he comes back in and adds a little more speed, same type of player as Rafalski, so hopefully we can wear them down, get some pressure on them.
