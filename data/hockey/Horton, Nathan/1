THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
NATHAN HORTON:   I feel good.   I'm going to be ready.   I think I'm in, ready to go.   
I'm excited.   Feel good.   
   
 Q.   What have the last couple days been like for you?  
NATHAN HORTON:   Just trying to get ready for Game2 like any other player here.   Just looking at clips, what we need to do better.   
But I feel good personally.   
   
 Q.   How much pain were you in?   How long has it taken you to get back to where you're close?  
NATHAN HORTON:   I'm not in any pain.   I feel good.   Like I said, I'm ready to play.   
That's it.   I'm just excited to get going here.   
   
 Q.   What actually happened?   
NATHAN HORTON:   Respectfully, I'm not going to talk about it.   Like I said, I'm ready to play and excited to be back.   
   
 Q.   You're in for tonight, everything is good.   
NATHAN HORTON:   I'm good.   Ready to be back.   Ready to go.   
   
 Q.   How tough was it watching two and a half periods of overtime?  
NATHAN HORTON:   It was tough.   It was a long game.   But obviously we didn't come out on the right end of it.   We got a chance to turn that around tonight.  
   
 Q.   Was there a fear, when you came out, that you may not be able to play?   What has it been like getting clearance?  
NATHAN HORTON:   No fear at all.   I mean, I knew I was going to play.   Like I said, I feel good.   I'm ready.   
You know, like I said, I'm just excited to be back in it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
NATHAN HORTON:   No, no limitations on anything.   Like I said, nothing.   
   
 Q.   Do you sense they'll be targeting you?  
NATHAN HORTON:   It's the playoffs.   Everyone's playing physical.   Everyone is playing strong.   That's the way the game is out there.   
Like I said, I have no limitations.   You know, I'm good to go.
