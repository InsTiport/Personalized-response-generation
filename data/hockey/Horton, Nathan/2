  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Do you feel this is fundamentally the same team that won the championship two years earlier? 
NATHAN HORTON:   I'm not sure how many guys we have on it from two years ago.   Every year is different.   We do have a lot of guys.   In my three years in Boston, we have pretty much the same team.   Our chemistry with each other is amazing.   That's why we've done so good. 

Q.   Did you bring a water bottle with you?
NATHAN HORTON:   Not yet, not yet. 

Q.   Is it extra special to be back, considering the last time?
NATHAN HORTON:   Yeah, it is.   It's definitely special for me to be back, being able to really have fun with it, enjoy it. 
It was tough that year, not to be a part of it.   But everybody wants to be on the ice.   They want to enjoy, work for it.   I never got a chance to do that.   Obviously with the playoffs last year, why I play. 
I know I really want to enjoy it this time, have a lot of fun.   It doesn't come all the time.   I think everybody knows that.   I'm just excited to be back and be here with my team.
