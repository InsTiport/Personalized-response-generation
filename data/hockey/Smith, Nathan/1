 Q. How are you feeling right now?
 
 NATHAN SMITH: Oh, very excited. I mean it's always nice to be drafted and go in the
first round. I'm really excited with that, so I'm pretty happy. 
 
Q. Tell us something about your game.
 
 NATHAN SMITH: I'm a two-way centerman. I'm not really a gifted offensive guy or
anything like that. I think my game sort of revolves around hard work and sort of knowing
the game and just working hard. So I'm a two-way player. 
 
Q. Did you know they were interested in you?
 
 NATHAN SMITH: Not really. I met with them a few times. I never really thought I'd stay
with Vancouver or anything. 
 
Q. What do you think the Canucks expect from you as a player?
 
 NATHAN SMITH: Probably just continue playing the way I am and improving. I don't think
they're going to expect me to play next year or anything like that, so I just got to keep
playing hard and keep improving. 
 
Q. You played against your brother in the Eastern Conference this year. Now it's
possible to play against him having Jarret sign with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. What did it
mean this year getting to play against Jarret in your own conference?
 
 NATHAN SMITH: It was pretty exciting. Then just playing against my older brother made
it that much more exciting. It's definitely exciting playing someone in your family.
