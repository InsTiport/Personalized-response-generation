 Q.   Dominic, a lot of playful ribbing from your teammates about it going off your shin pad.   Take us through the goal from your perspective?   
DOMINIC MOORE:   Well, it was a good kill right before that, then we had that odd‑man break.   I thought I put the puck in Brass's hands, but I guess he wasn't expecting it.   So just tried to stay with it after that shift, and when Hazy got it, I knew it was eventually going to get to the net, and good thing happened.  
   
 Q.   Your celebration maybe spoke to a level of relief maybe as much as passion that that puck went in.   Was there a little extra spring to your step when you got out of the box?   
DOMINIC MOORE:   I don't know about that.   Maybe.   I think it's just a matter of wanting to win.   We had lots of looks, couple just before that.   I drove it in front and puck rolled off my tape.   Just tried to stay with it and work for a good bounce, and finally it came.  
   
 Q.   Throughout your career you've had an uncanny knack of scoring goals like this at times like this and on a calendar time like this as well.   Do you have any explanation why or is there something you could point to?   
DOMINIC MOORE:   I don't know.   It's a fun time of year for us.   Everyone in this room relishes playing in these games, and it's a good thing to enjoy it.  
   
 Q.   Every playoff game has been decided by one goal.   As long as you guys are winning, is it okay to keep winning by that margin?   
DOMINIC MOORE:   Well, you know, you don't plan on that, but it is a good thing when you know how to play those games.   We've played them pretty well.   That is the way the playoffs are, just the margins are small, and they're not for the feint of heart these games, for sure.
