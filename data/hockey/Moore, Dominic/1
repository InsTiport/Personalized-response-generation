Q.   How do you treat game 2 without overreacting?
DOMINIC MOORE: I think the way that you treat all of these games is the same with the previous game philosophy or each game you're trying to win, and assess honestly what you did well and what you can do better and move on. You have to have a quick way to forget things and move on like we've done in the previous game. That's what we have to do.

Q.   Penalty kill has been so good, was it poor penalties last night or frustration?
DOMINIC MOORE: I think they executed well on their chances on the PP. We can do a better job collectively as a group on that. But that's one of the things that we thought we looked at.

Q.   Regarding seeing the puck?
DOMINIC MOORE: Yeah, I mean, you're a man down, and all PKs you're trying to figure out the best way to stop certain power plays. Every power play has a little bit of a different set-up, and you're trying to make adjustments to try to give up the least dangerous option that you can.  Like I said, we've got to try to buckle down and try to redirect together, and we've done a good job all season long. Our power penalty kills has been one of the better ones in the league. Our coach has done a great job leading us, and we'll definitely look at it and improve.

Q.   Are they better with the tough passes?
DOMINIC MOORE: Yeah, they have good movement on their power play. They can strike from a few different angles, so you have to honor those different vantage points. And when you do, you have to give something up, so we'll just have to do a better job of trying to close off some of those lines that we can.

Q.   What bothered you the most about last night Â’s game?
DOMINIC MOORE: I don't know. I mean, any time you lose a game, you're frustrated. You can be frustrated at any number of things. All of us want to do more. Whenever we lose, the first thing you ask yourself is what could you have done better? What could you yourself have done differently? I think we've just got to, as a group, honestly assess what we can do better collectively as well and forget about it and move on.
