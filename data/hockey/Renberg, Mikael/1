MIKAEL RENBERG: I tried to play with a new pair of skates because I don't have to tie the skates as hard with the old pair.  It gives me better support.  So that helped me.


Q.  He has put you with Eric.

MIKAEL RENBERG: Yeah, he put me there now.  I think I am going to play there.  I mean, I play wherever he wants me to play.  Whatever is best for the team and that is Terry's choice.  Whatever he wants, I will play there.


Q.  Does Eric seem more relaxed to you?

MIKAEL RENBERG: Yeah, I think he does.  I mean, he is  -- just the last two years he is becoming a big, big leader. I don't know.  I think he will learn a lot from playing in like the World Cup.  He had learned a lot from guys like Messier. That is just the feeling I have.  He learned a lot from those guys and he takes the experience and he uses it, you know, with the Flyers right now.


Q.  How does he exert that leadership or how do you see that?

MIKAEL RENBERG: Yeah, I know, sometimes when I get frustrated on the ice, he always comes and sits besides me and tells me to relax, just go out there and relax and play hockey and have fun.  It is great to have that kind of leadership in the locker room.
