  Q. Talk about the game tonight?  
 ERIC STAAL: Well, we took two penalties, and then the bad break on the power-play goal they had.   
 They got ahead by 2-1. And we had some looks, but, you know, none of those seemed to hit the back of the net.   
  
  Q. How deflating was that goal in the last minute?   
 ERIC STAAL: It's tough. You never want to give away a goal in the last minute, especially in a big game like this one. Tried to battle back. Came within one, and it just wasn't meant to be tonight.   
  
  Q. Does it feel like the energy you had from the first two series is kind of hitting the wall at all?   
 ERIC STAAL: No, I don't think so. We feel good. Our legs are there. I don't know. We're just not winning enough one-on-one battles in the offensive zone, and coming back better in their zone.   
 They wait for their chances, and they have good sticks and good back pressure, and they pick those off and go the other way. They're countering hard, and getting their goals that way.  
  
  Q. Eric, do you have to play perfect to beat this team?   
 ERIC STAAL: No, I just think we need to play better. You know, we're a very good team. We didn't get this far for no reason. We didn't get this far because we're not good.   
 We haven't played our best yet, and, you know, that's showing. Because we're down three, and we're in a tough hole. But all we can do is bury our heads and take it one game at a time. Come back Tuesday, and get one, and then try to go from there.   
  
  Q. Talk about Cam's performance tonight?   
 ERIC STAAL: Well, you can't really blame him on a lot of them. There are some pretty good players coming in. That first one, the breakaway. You know, some odd man rushes, some three-on on-twos, some screens. He made some big saves in the second period. That kind of gave us a chance in the third.   
 Like I said, we came within one, and a few looks after that. But we weren't able to capitalize to tie it up. Then they got that one that put them ahead by two. And that was it from there.   
  
  Q. What do you do against Crosby and Malkin? I think they've gotten another five points. It seems to be just them that's pretty much doing it all.   
 ERIC STAAL: Well, they're good players. They're creating some space, and some opportunities with their feet and with their tenacity on the puck. You know, I think we just continue to try to do a better job of getting five and six out on them and being physical. Good players with the puck, they're going to make you pay. On the opportunities that they're getting, they're cashing in.   
  
  Q. You guys have had your backs against the wall pretty much the entire playoffs. This is nothing new. But in a 3-0 hole, is that a little different than what you guys have faced?   
 ERIC STAAL: Well, we've never been in this spot before. But if I was to pick a team to be in this spot to try to come back, this would be the one. Because what we've done earlier, and we've done at this playoffs, we're going to take it one game at a time, we're going to come back Tuesday, work our tails off, because that's what we do. And we're going to go from there.   
 We're going to go with one game, and just take it 60 minutes at a time.
