 Q. It seemed like on the first one, you got the better of them for the most part. Talk about going against them? 
 ERIC STAAL: It's an important part of the game. As far as match-ups go and controlling the puck. You want to make sure you're winning those face-offs. 
 He did get the better of me in the first one in the game, and the crowd liked that. But the rest of the game, you know, I did have the advantage on him. But I've got to make sure that keeps getting better as the series goes on.&nb
