  Q. Talk about Marc and being a shooter. Talk a little about the road you guys have taken?   
 ERIC STAAL: Yeah, it's playoff hockey, and it's a fight. You know, for us, obviously, we had a good second half of the season, but not good enough in the first half to get that   
home-ice advantage.   
 But I don't think it really matters. I think the type of hockey that we need to play, whether we're in our building or theirs, we need to have our best, and we'll keep working.   
  
  Q. You guys are comfortable, you've had enough experience?   
 ERIC STAAL: Yeah, I thought we were a pretty good road team all year. You know, we've shown that we can win in tough buildings and win in tough situations. So we're comfortable in our game plan and what we need to do. We'll continue that as we fight forward.  
  
  Q. One thing you have done is lost the game 1 in both series. Can you put a finger on that, and how do you change that?   
 ERIC STAAL: Yeah, we need to be better. We know that. We've talked about it. And we've got to get to our game early and have a little extra edge, a little extra snarl. I think if we have that, we're going to get our chances and get a better result than we have in the last two series.
