  Q.  Congratulations, first of all.  How does it feel to wear that Blackhawk crest on your sweeter?   
 JONATHAN TOEWS:  It's pretty awesome.  It's great to be here and at the top of the draft and everything, and to have a chance to be part of the Chicago Blackhawks is unbelievable right now.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you can step in right away and make an impact in the NHL, or do you think it's going to take a couple years?   
 JONATHAN TOEWS:  You know, it's tough to tell.  Obviously you always believe in yourself and what you're capable of doing.  Obviously I think positively that way, so I think at the end of the summer I'll be getting stronger.   
 You know, until I this, I'm ready to play, I have a great place to play and a great coach and great teammates at North Dakota.  Whether or not it's this year, I'm looking forward to going back  there, so I'll see what happens.   
  
  Q.  How much do you think your World Junior experience in helped you in being such a high pick here?   
 JONATHAN TOEWS: It was an unbelievable experience to be at the camp and be selected.  To be part of that team with Coach Sudder, and all of the guys we had on that roster; it was very special to win a gold medal in city like Vancouver where everyone is watching.   
 So definitely learned how to deal with pressure and those sort of situations, and I think after that, I went back to my team with a lot of confidence and played pretty well in the second half of the season.
