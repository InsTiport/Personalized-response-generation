 JAMEY HORAN: Questions for Jonathan and Patrick. 

 Q. Jonathan, six goals -- seven goals from six different players. Can you talk about what the line changes meant to you guys and how it affected your depth and the scoring? 
 JONATHAN TOEWS: I mean, the line changes obviously looked like a good thing. But number one thing was the way we played as a team. We all understand in our locker room it doesn't matter who you are playing with. You have to go out there and make a difference. 
 It was just bouncing back from those two tough losses we had on the road. As a team, we played much better at the start we needed. And when everyone is working, we have enough skill across four lines that we're going to get contributions from everybody. Same way we did in those first two games. 

 Q. Pat, can you talk about the power-play tonight? Obviously it was very effective. What you guys did tonight that maybe you weren't doing earlier in the series? 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah, two big goals. The first one I thought was huge by Seabs to get us going. I thought we were playing pretty good. To get some results off that was pretty nice. 
 You know, the second power-play goal I thought was just a perfect entry. That's exactly what we're looking for. Quick puck movement and you saw the thing with Sharp to me, to Keith to Tazer and a great pass to Buff. It was off our stick within two seconds every time. 

 Q. Patrick, talk about your game today. You seemed to have a little more room to move and room to operate. What is opportunities or do you think it was more effort? How do you think that worked out for you? 
 PATRICK KANE: Sometimes you get the puck in different situations and sometimes you're just feeling it out there. To be honest with you, I didn't think I played great. Sometimes you get the puck and you make some plays and just helps out the overall team. It was nice to bounce back from last night's game. 
 Obviously, the whole team had a great game overall. I thought we play like that every night, it's going to be tough to beat us. 

 Q. Jonathan, was it more energy or more confidence, or did the energy create more confidence? 
 JONATHAN TOEWS: Well, those are two big parts of our game tonight. Biggest thing is the start we had, whether we come out of the first period with the lead or not, we can be happy with that pressure. We want to keep that going, especially for the next two periods and the next one. 
 So our pace was as high as it's been in the series. But we know there's still another level we have to get to if we want to get that fourth win. 

 Q. Pat, back to the line changes. Going into this, we were all talking about who was going to play with who. I know you guys downplay that. When were you told who you were going to play with? And it had to mean something or else why not do it? Why do it? 
 PATRICK KANE: I think I found out right before the game. Some of the guys might have found out earlier, but that's when I found out. I think -- it didn't really matter who played with who tonight, to be honest with you. I think everyone just had the energy, and we had to make sure we wanted to win. 
 I think everyone was flying from the get-go. We had a great first period. Got ourselves pretty comfortable lead to put ourselves in a good position. 

 Q. Patrick, just talk about Buff's game. It seemed like he came out with a whole different attitude today. 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah, I think he got rid of us and started performing. That's all he needed. He was a force. He had some big hits. The one on Pronger, I think everyone remembers, where he threw him into the boards. Great game overall by him. It's good to see. 

 Q. Jonathan, getting the crowd involved early, did that help you guys keep your energy up? 
 JONATHAN TOEWS: For sure. It was good for to us come out the way we did and every single line was working so hard. We played the right way early. When you get those bounces, when you score a couple of goals, whether it's five on five or power-plays, it's going to give that you confidence to keep going. 
 You need those big plays, whether it's a goal or a big hit, to get the crowd into it. That's what makes you feed off of their energy and only makes you better. 
 So we used that as good as we could tonight. But we know, as you've seen all series, it's been an advantage to play in your own building. Hopefully, we can buck that trend and really play our best game this series in the next one. 

 Q. Patrick, given what Jonathan just said, what is it going to take to finish this series in Philadelphia? 
 PATRICK KANE: We've been pretty good on the road throughout the whole playoffs. Didn't play the way we wanted to, obviously, in Games 3 and 4. 
 But I think you saw tonight, you get out to an early lead, it benefits your whole team game. If we can do that, get the lead on the road and play a simple game like we have been throughout the playoffs, it obviously should help. 
 I think we got two days off here to kind of get ourselves ready for the challenge. It's exciting. We have one more win and you have the grand prize. 

 Q. Patrick, you mentioned that you felt like you didn't really play your best tonight. Is that just you kind of being a little too harsh on yourself? What areas could you have gotten better? 
 PATRICK KANE: I mean, I guess overall probably a little bit defensively. I think in the third goal there I made a turnover where they ended up scoring. You always want to get yourself into the game as soon as possible and make plays. But I think in my own end I can be better. 

 Q. Patrick, in the second period that was sequence where you beat Pronger for a pretty good scoring opportunity. A few seconds later you drew penalty on him. He was on the ice for six goals. How important was it for you guys to have that much success against him? 
 PATRICK KANE: I think we've been looking for that throughout the whole series. With him on the ice, he's a big guy. But we feel we can get around him and make some good plays when he's on the ice. He plays a lot of minutes. 
 I don't know if we can get him tired out there and make him make mistakes or -- obviously, he was on the ice for a lot of goals. You have to be aware he's probably going to bounce back with a better effort. If we can play like we did against him tonight, it's going to make it tough on him and try to make him draw penalties and hopefully score when he's in the penalty box. 
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you, guys.
