THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Jonathan, for a game to extend that long, obviously you need some critical stops by your goaltender.   How big was Corey Crawford for you tonight?
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Can't even put that into words.   He made some unbelievable saves.   I can't remember if it was still in regulation time or not, but we had a couple too many men penalties, I think they were both in overtime. 
Anyways, you know you're going to need some big stops.   One went off the posts there.   A couple times we gave up a few too many chances off the rush.   He was there every single time. 
I think we created a lot of chances of our own.   We were close to putting the game away quite a few times.   But we needed Crowe to make those stops to keep the game going. 

Q.   Jonathan, the game went on for so long, like two full games.   It seemed that fatigue was at certain points a factor.   Do you kind of zone out, just play automatically, or constantly are you on edge?
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Well, obviously that sort of thing is going to set in.   That's the reality.   I mean, both teams are just kicking, trying to survive.   Every time you go back on the ice, you just try and get that feeling that it's just going to be that one chance that makes the difference. 
Obviously we got a big one with Shaw going to the net there. 
Both teams wanted to win that game and no one was going to give it up easy.   We're obviously feeling pretty good about it. 
But it's time to go home and get some rest now. 

Q.   Your emotions after ending a game like that?   Fifth‑round pick a year ago. 
ANDREW SHAW:   Yeah, obviously emotions are high.   Too exhausted right now to express it. 
I think the guys had a great game.   All four lines were going, six D.   Corey stood in there strong for us.   We came up with a big win. 

Q.   I think some people asked you about going against Chara.   What was that like for you? 
ANDREW SHAW:   He's a big boy.   He's strong.   A good battle in front of the net with him there. 
I think I held my own.   He's a great player.   Logs a lot of minutes.   Got to get on him and try to tire him out as much as we can. 

Q.   In the first period you came out flying.   Was it just the excitement, adrenaline? 
ANDREW SHAW:   Yeah, Stanley Cup Playoffs.   Something you dream of as a kid.   The opportunity's there.   You have to seize it when it's there. 
I think all the guys are excited to get it started. 

Q.   Can you talk about what happened on the goal. 
ANDREW SHAW:   Luck.   Kind of Bicksy finishing his check.   The puck goes to the point.   Rosy gets a nice shot through.   Bolland got his stick on it.   I just happened to be going to the net wide.   Kind of went off my leg into the net. 
An exciting moment.   I think guys are just glad the game ended. 

Q.   Jonathan, it seems like a long time ago, but their PK had a couple big kills early.   What makes their PK tough?
JONATHAN TOEWS:   You got to give them credit.   They're good at what they're doing. 
At the same time, I don't think we were too happy with our start tonight.   It took us a little while to get going.   I think that included our power play.   We easily could have gotten the momentum going our way a little bit with a big goal, five‑on‑three there. 
We had the puck in good areas.   It just seemed to bounce off our stick, go out of the zone.   We had to regroup.   A couple little breaks didn't quite go our way there. 
We know we got to be better there.   We expect them to be aggressive.   You know, they're a solid defensive team.   They're going to be the same when they're short a guy. 

Q.   Jonathan, for Saad to score that goal, maybe the relief he felt. 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   It was huge for him, huge for our team.   That was a timely goal.   I think we need something to get our crowd into and give us energy on the bench.   It was a great shot by him. 
I think as a line with Hoss, Saad and myself, we created quite a bit of offense tonight.   For him to get one tonight, that was big for us.   We want to keep playing well. 

Q.   Jonathan, with coach moving around a lot of guys in the first, large sample size, do you think the lines will be pretty solidified for Game2?
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I'm not sure.   I mean, we'll see.   I think Joel always has a pretty good feel of what he wants to do, especially after one game against a team that we haven't seen all year. 
I think it's something as a player you're ready for that you might be with different guys.   If we need a little boost, he'll try a couple different combinations.   That's not a big deal for us.   It's something we're used to.   We'll see what comes in Game2. 

Q.   Andrew, how would you describe your style?   If someone said 'irritating,' would you take that as a compliment?   Jonathan, how would you describe Andrew's play? 
ANDREW SHAW:   I take it as a compliment.   It's how my game has developed through my career.   It's what's got me here.   I got to stick to it, just compete and work to the best of my abilities. 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I mean, I think you could ask players on other teams and they'll tell you that he's not the type of guy that they like to play against.   But that's what we love about him. 
We love having a guy like that on our team.   He's not afraid.   You saw him going up against Chara tonight.   Probably the guy on our team that got up against him the most, hit him.   Stirred him up a little bit, drew a penalty, scored a huge goal, unbelievable goal, for anybody to score just going to the net.   Doesn't matter how it goes in, I think everyone on the bench, like Shaw said, we were happy that it was over.   Happy that we got the win. 
Big game by this guy.   I don't know if he had like nine, ten hits, whatever it was, but he kept going all night and didn't stop. 

Q.   Andrew, on a team with guys like Jonathan, Patrick and Marian, as you're going through overtime, is there a mindset that you might be the one to score a goal?
ANDREW SHAW:   Well, you know, we knew it wasn't going to be pretty at that point.   You could tell both teams were physically exhausted. 
We've preached it:   go to the net, you'll find a way to get a greasy goal.   We did a heck of a job of it there in the third overtime. 

Q.   Andrew, I guess your interview on NBC is already going viral.   Is that just you being yourself? 
ANDREW SHAW:   Slip of the tongue (smiling).   I couldn't think at all actually.   Could barely breathe.   I think I made up a word in there, too, actually.   I was never good in English. 
Just shows how much heart our team has.   We push each other to our limits.
