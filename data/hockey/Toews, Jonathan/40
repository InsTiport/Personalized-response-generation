  Q. What is your confidence level right now?  
 JONATHAN TOEWS: Pretty confident. As you can tell, we've been lucky enough to get some bounces, see a lot of pucks go in. It's nice to be a part of some of those plays that result in goals. I think that's the biggest thing that gives you confidence, when you see pucks go in like that.   
 Whether you're tipping them in or you're making plays, it doesn't really matter. I think as a line, we just want to keep working hard. We know we don't take that success for granted. We got to go out there and do the same things, do the right things, in order to have that success.   
 We'll keep doing that and keep moving forward.   
  
  Q. Big names in Blackhawks' history. How long do you think before they put your name up there?   
 JONATHAN TOEWS: I think in this locker room, we got a lot of talent in here. No one gets to include themselves in a group like that until you win something. Like I say, that's what we're working on here. That's the most important thing.   
 People remember certain individuals, but they certainly remember the teams that are special and that win championships. That would be the coolest thing to be part of.   
  
  Q. You seem to be so cool and calm on the ice. How about off the ice, things guys in the locker room do, family members do that get to you?   
 JONATHAN TOEWS: Always. Pretty much every single guy in this locker room. Not pretending that they can't (laughter). We all get on each other's nerves. That's part of what makes you a team.   
 We're all pals in here. We all have a great time. There's nothing like playing hockey at this time of the season because it keeps us together. We want to keep going, keep playing, having fun the way we have been.
