Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MIKE LECLERC: That was huge for us.  J.S. gave us an opportunity.  The game was on the line the first period tonight, and J.S. was huge, and then, you know, we got the first goal, and that's when the game was on the line, so I thought he did a good job of weathering the storm and got his chance to get into the game. 
 
Q.  Do you feel like you have to put them away Friday night so you don't have to travel to Minnesota?  Is that kind of an extra added benefit to you guys?
 
MIKE LECLERC: Well, you don't want to play any games you don't have to.  We don't want to give them any life, and that's going to be or main focus.
