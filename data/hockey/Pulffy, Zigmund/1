Q.  A lot of guys asking you about where to go to dinner?

ZIGMUND PALFFY:  I don't think they're going to ask me about that.  I think everybody knows where to go.  There's a lot of nice places. 


Q.  What are your thoughts about some top players who aren't here this weekend? 

ZIGMUND PALFFY:  I think everybody try to get some rest, rest up from injuries.  I think everybody wants to be here and play and enjoy it.  First of all, it's a big honor if you play the All-Star Game, you want to score.  I just come here, just enjoy it.  It's great to be in Los  Angeles, play for the whole crowd.
