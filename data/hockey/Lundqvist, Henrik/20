 Q.   What would make you happy tomorrow?  
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Winning the Vezina has been a goal for a long time, so it would mean a lot.   Just being here, it's a good feeling.   
   
 Q.   Would it help ease the feelings from being eliminated?  
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   No, that would still hurt.   But now you're at a point where you took a step back, learned something from it.   Train in the summer, got to get better.   
   
 Q.   Did you watch the finals at all?  
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   The last game.   That's the only game I watched.   It was a weird game.   L.A. played well the whole playoffs.   
   
 Q.   Talk about Stamkos.   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Well, his release.   You have so many guys that can skate fast, can shoot far.   Just the quickness of the release and always being in the right place.   You can just tell he wants to score all the time.   You respect that.   You have to be on your toes all the time.   
He's the whole package.   He was unbelievable this year.   It's always a challenge.
