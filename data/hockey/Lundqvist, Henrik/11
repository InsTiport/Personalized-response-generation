 Q.   Henrik, I know you didn't face a lot of shots tonight, but could you just talk about the couple saves you did make, especially that one where you were just kind of flailing around on the second period on a deflected puck?   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Yeah, well, we played so well the entire game, so for me it was more about just being focused on the few shots they had and in the second period.   Yeah, Danny made a great play.   We just had a tough bounce.   Tried to just react and have a little luck there.   
But it was such a great feeling to see how we responded from the last game.   The third period, I think we played our best period of the playoffs.   When it mattered the most, guys really stepped up.   It was awesome to be back there and see the way we took charge and earned this victory.  
   
 Q.   If you could both answer this.   I wonder if you consider how the year started, if someone told you at some point in October or November that you'd be standing here going to the Cup Finals, what would have been your reaction at that time?  
BRAD RICHARDS:   I think, yeah, you never know what can happen in a year.   I think on paper, and the way we felt going into the season we felt confident we all know now if you just get in and get hot, but then we had the start that we will, so got a little sneaky there for a while.   There were some down moments this year, to be honest.   It took a while to get everybody going.   It was a testament to the group.   Just kind of mirrored our whole season, our playoffs, everything.   It seemed like we never let it get to us too much.   We lost it, we kept battling, and figured it out.   We figured it out to get a chance to win the Cup.  
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Yeah, it was definitely a test for us.   I just felt the patience from the entire coaching staff.   They understood.   We talked about this earlier, but they understood the process for us to get to where we needed to be to be a successful team.   But we did change a lot of things going into the season.   I think it was a time where we had to find ourselves a little bit as a group.   
But personally, I think it was my toughest start in my career, my 12, 13 years as a pro, if I combine the Sweden years.   So it's definitely a tough test.   But it feels better when you turn it around and good things start to happen.   It's been a great ride so far, especially the second half of the season.   It's been a lot of fun to be around the guys, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   When you're standing in the net and the clock ticks on down and there are 3 seconds left and it goes down to 0.   What goes through your head after being so close two years ago and losing to the Devils?   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Yeah, when it's only 2 or 3 seconds left and you realize you did it, it's an unbelievable feeling.   But what took us there is the entire team really stepped up in key moments throughout the year, but especially the playoffs.   It makes it even more special, I feel like, when you have four lines stepping up in different times and just doing it together.   That's what it's all about.   Everybody feels like they're playing a big part.   I think that is a big thing when you're playing in the playoffs, and you go through ups and downs to make sure everybody feels like they're bringing something to the table here.   That's been the case, and that's why we're playing in the final, I think.  
   
 Q.   What would you tell to the young kids across the ice that you were facing in this series and what he gave?   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Yeah, he played really well.   He looked very confident.   It's not easy to do when they put you in that spot.   But I didn't know much about him when he came in playing here, but you have to expect any goalie that comes in to play at this level, that they're going to be good.   They're going to help the team, and he definitely kept them in a lot of the games.   So for me, you know, I try to challenge myself and try to be better, but he was really good.   But tonight, I don't think I've been more determined to win a hockey game, you know?   To put ourselves in a spot where we can play for the Cup is extremely special.   I've been here for nine years and this is my first year.   So I'm extremely proud of how we did it, to be in this spot.  
   
 Q.   Alain mentioned your focus that you just referred to for tonight's game.   Can you describe what the last 48 hours have been like for you leading up to this?   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   It's been tough.   You think a lot, and going into the playoffs you talked about it is a roller coaster mentally.   You have so many highs.   You have a few lows where you're questioning a lot of things, but then you just have to make up your mind.   You can't have any excuses.   You just have to go out there.   I kept telling myself all day, believe in what you're doing.   I've been in that spot before.   It gets silly, you get pulled.   You have a tough game, but you just have to stay confident.  
I didn't have to do much today.   The guys played so great.   But you still have to be in the right place mentally to make the few saves and the shots I had to face.   But it's definitely a test mentally when you play a game like that.   And in the position you're in, you have so much to lose, but also so much to win.   You just have to look at it the right way.  
   
 Q.   Brad, you were brought in not just the skill level you bring, but for your leadership.   Never has it been more evident than in the second half of this season.   What is it that you sent to this locker room that you needed to step forward and be the voice in that room?   
BRAD RICHARDS:   Well, I think it comes with the territory of the amount of years I've been in the league.   The role you have on the team, you always recognize that.   I think I didn't get brought in here just to‑‑ I was brought in more than just on the outside.   I had some experience.   But I think when you lose our captain, and you have to recognize when the room needs things.   I said, when you're in the league, you just kind of know.   You get a feel for the locker room, and I think it's been a good challenge for me to try to help out that way.  
   
 Q.   How much of a feeling of accomplishment is there versus there is still more to accomplish?   
BRAD RICHARDS:   Yeah, I think it's a great night, but we've already talked about as a group that we'll feel good for a couple days because we know we're not playing until Wednesday.   It's something you feel good, but you have to keep in the back of your mind that this isn't the ultimate goal.   It's an amazing achievement to be able to play for the Cup, but it doesn't come around in these two and a half weeks.   They go by real quick, and you don't want to get caught behind to start the series.   That is the mental focus we've got to keep, and we've got to stay sharp.   
I know it sounds crazy next Wednesday, but you can't let it slip.   We have to be ready and better than we were tonight in Game 1 to try to get into the series quickly.  
   
 Q.   Brad, some of the guys said that you instructed them not to touch the trophy.   What was the superstition and thought process there?   
BRAD RICHARDS:   Well, I just‑‑ Marty and I have been there, Carcillo, unfortunately, just wasn't dressed, so we didn't put his opinion in, but no one else was dressed that's been there.   We just won it without touching it, and it was instructed that way when we won.   If half the team was there maybe we would have had more debate on the ice, but it wasn't much debate.   We're not doing it, and that's where we went with it.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the emotion that you guys have played with, especially Marty, and for him to be the one to get that goal, what was the feeling?   
BRAD RICHARDS:   I mean, there's been quite a few story lines this year, and those two are obviously big ones.   I think as you go through runs, that's just the way things go with teams that go through runs.   There always seem to be little things that you can grab and build on, and that is what makes it so special to win a Stanley Cup, so many things you go through.   The stars have to align, and it's great that those guys have the feeling that someone's watching over them and helping them out.  
   
 Q.   Brad, can you talk about walking in that Stanley Cup Final with a guy like Martin St. Louis that you did win a Stanley Cup with ten years ago, and now you're back together here in New York?   
BRAD RICHARDS:   Yeah, I'll be honest, it's hard to believe.   Ten years goes by so quick.   We were just talking about we definitely thought we'd be back after winning in Tampa and the lockout and all that stuff happened, and the salary cap and the team just didn't stay together too long.   Never would have thought we'd be here today in New York doing it.   Even to start the season, I never imagined Marty being here.   
So the fact that all of that has come back, it's great.   We've created so many friendships this year.   Our group has come together so much, but obviously Marty and I go back a long way.   And we don't want it to be about us.   But it's still a pretty cool feeling.  
   
 Q.   You have a number of days off between now and Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals.   Are you worried about the six days rest in between?   
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   No, it's going to be good for us to get a couple of days to recharge.   I think, mentally, too, to let it sink in a little bit and enjoy it for a day or two.   Then you start preparing for the next challenge.   You know, it's going to be a great challenge.   We're going to play against a really good team.   It's about, for us, in the room to remind each other that this is such a special moment that you have to grab it.   You have to make sure you're ready and play your absolute best.   You're not going to get that many opportunities.   I've been here for nine years.   This is my first final, and now it's all about preparing the right way and try to leave it all out there.   
BRAD RICHARDS:   Yeah, same thing.
