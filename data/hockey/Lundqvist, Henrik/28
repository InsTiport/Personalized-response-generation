  FLYERS - 2

HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     He's a tricky guy, obviously there's a lot of pressure on me there.   I couldn't believe it when he called the penalty shot, but it was exciting.   The whole game was exciting.   Pretty intense.   It was great.   But yeah, just tried to be patient and it worked out.

Q.   Talk about the play that led to the penalty shot right there in the crease, what you saw and the ruling. 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     Yeah, you know what, it was just a big scramble in the end.   They tried to get pucks in front, and I didn't really see the puck.   I just stretch out my right leg and tried to stay on the post there.   Then I hear the whistle, and I couldn't believe it. 
You know, the last five, six minutes, it was a big battle and I think we really did a good job of keeping things simple.   We talked about going into the game.   We have to keep it simple because it's a different game and different approach to it.   You need to keep things simple and you know, good things will happen. 
They were really good, and after they scored the second goal there, we kind of regrouped a little bit and when we scored the first one, it was a big change for us. 

Q.   Can you talk about the whole experience of playing in the Winter Classic and what it's been like?
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     It's been amazing.   The whole build up, we had two games against the Flyers going into this, and then good games, there's been a lot of talk about this game already during camp. 
So it was exciting to be here and already at practice yesterday, it was fun to get a feeling for it, and today, it was just amazing, the atmosphere.   I thought they did a great job with the ice.   It was all great I think, and coming out with two points and a big win, obviously adds to it. 

Q.   Twenty years down the road, what do you think you'll remember the most? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     Walking out in the warmup, it was a great crowd, and you got really excited, and then you kind of have to calm yourself down a little bit.   You'll be tired after warm up because you go so hard. 
Just the whole game, the way we bounced back and the finish obviously later in the game.   But so far the build up and all of the talk, all of the focus, it was worth it.   It's been an amazing experience. 

Q.   Can you just talk about the visibility of the puck, through the middle to the end? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     Toughest part was warmup.   It was really bright.   So I had the trainers put some black stuff, whatever that is. 
But after that, it kind of slowed down a little bit.   To see the puck during the game‑‑ it was a little bright.   Like I said, the ice was great, and yeah, the lighting was good. 

Q.   People who watch this game nationally never really watch a lot of hockey.   You mentioned before you were surprised they called the penalty shot; do you think it was done to add to the drama so people would have something more to talk about? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     Maybe that's the only reason why he called it.   You know, it would have been tough to swallow that one if they scored.   But luckily he didn't, and I think there was a couple of calls in the end there where I was really surprised, I must say.   But, again, we came up big in the end with the penalty kill and just the way we worked. 
And it's been our thing this year.   You know, I don't think we are more skilled than anybody else, but we worked really hard and it's been paying off. 

Q.   Can you talk about what it means to get a guy like Marc Staal back on a day like this?
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     I was really impressed by the ice, but I was almost more impressed by Staal coming back.   I actually didn't know he was going to play the game.   It was‑‑ when I saw him out there, I was shocked.   Obviously we told everybody he was not going to play, and he did an amazing job.   It's not easy to come in here and play your first game in over ten months, outstanding. 
The confidence he will bring through our group, it's going to be big. 

Q.   Talk about playing relaxed and playing the way you normally play in a game like this. 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     You want to find a good balance.   I'm always very focused going into the game and during the game but at the same time, you want to be able to enjoy this.   I caught myself a couple of times being too relaxed and then a couple of times I just had to calm down.   You want to find that perfect balance where you enjoy it but at the same time you get the job done.   I felt like most of the time, I did that. 

Q.   I know you had not played since you were a kid outside; can you talk about that, and also was there a point you forgot you were playing outside and you were just in the game?
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     I don't know.   You know, it was great.   When it starts snowing in the second period, that was awesome.   I liked when it was a little darker, too.   It was easy to see the puck, too.   Again, last time I played outside I was ten, and a lot of things have happened since.   It's still the same game, it really is.   And then you try to‑‑ like today, you try to keep it simple. 

Q.   Do you forget you are outside. 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:     No, you don't.   It's very different, especially for me trying to track down the puck, because usually you have the fans right behind the glass.   But now it's different.   You know‑‑ not in a bad way, but I did not forget I was outside.   I did not.
