Q.   Is there anything special in Newark at that arena, the crowd, the lighting? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   It's a nice rink, but also especially during the regular season we have a lot of fans there, so that makes it very special to play every time.   We'll see how the building will be tomorrow.   Hopefully we have a lot of fans.   A lot of times the atmosphere is very good.

Q.   Is there anything you need to change for tomorrow s game?
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   You know, for the most part in these playoffs, we've been doing a lot of things really well.   We just have to continue doing that tomorrow.   We know what we have to do.   We know we've been playing a certain way the whole year, and we're not going to change too much.   Sometimes you have to adjust your game a little bit depending on who you're playing. 
So we had a good meeting and had a really good skate today.   So I'm confident that we're going to have a good game tomorrow.

Q.   Do you find that compared to the other series with Washington and Ottawa, they're more on top of you? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   Well, they're a different team.   They forecheck harder.   You have to expect games to get a little tougher the closer you get to your final destination, the tougher it's going to get. 
They're a good team, and we went into this series with the mindset it's going to be a big battle, a big war out there.   We also expect them to forecheck more than maybe Washington.

Q.   Did the extra day off come at a good time for you? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   It was good to get a day off.   It's been a lot of hockey the last week or so.   So to get an extra day and get the good skate in today to prepare for tomorrow was good timing, I think.

Q.   You've been through a couple of these Rangers‑Devils series.   Are there any advantages just in the fact that the whole thing is like a home series where you're not traveling?   Is there anything to that?   Does it make it easier on the players at all? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   I don't know if it makes it easier, but it's fun to play.   Like I said, a lot of times you play on the road there and you have a lot of fans in the building.   A lot of times when you play these rival games the reason it's so special is you can see how much it means to the fans. 
As a player, that's exciting to feel that excitement, especially during the regular season.   I don't think you need much to get going in the playoffs.   But during the regular season to see the fans react the way they do during these types of games, that's a great feeling. 
But playing there, a lot of fans in the building, great atmosphere, it just adds to it.

Q.   Do you feel more needs to be done to clear some bodies out from in front or do you see these tips and these deflections as isolated incidents where one mistake got some people out of position? 
HENRIK LUNDQVIST:   I thought we had more traffic in front playing in maybe Ottawa or Washington.   But Jersey has always been good knocking pucks down.   So you have to respect that.   We just have to play them hard.   I don't think they played more in front than the other teams we've played. 
But, again, they're a good team, a skilled team that always, like I said, knocking pucks down.   Especially in the middle of the ice, if you try to go across or something like that, they're very good at going the other way. 
So we've talked about a few things, and we're going to correct it and be better tomorrow.
