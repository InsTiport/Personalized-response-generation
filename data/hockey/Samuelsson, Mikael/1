 Q. Can you just talk about the giveaways tonight and just how they totally took advantage of the turnovers? 
 MIKAEL SAMUELSSON: Yeah, I guess they did. Yeah, when you're out there, actually, you don't even see what's going on. It sounds strange, maybe, but I don't know. We had a couple of turnovers. They had a couple of turnovers. They capitalized on it. 
 So I don't know. It's nothing we want to do, but it's there. We have to take care of it.

 Q. It's very uncharacteristic of this team to give up three goals in less than six minutes. Just your thoughts on that when it's going on out there? 
 MIKAEL SAMUELSSON: Yeah, momentum, I should say. They had, yeah, they had that going for them. They're good players. They made a really good play on both the third goal and the fourth goal, so I don't know. Unfortunately, yeah. 

 Q. Did the momentum get set early on with Kronwall going into the box less than two minutes into the game? 
 MIKAEL SAMUELSSON: No, no. 

 Q. It was just so early of a penalty, and it didn't look like he did trip?
 MIKAEL SAMUELSSON: It's up to you to say. I have no comments. I think the refs did a good job though. 

 Q. What about Ozzie? It seemed the couple times he got hung out to dry, and he's forced to make a lot of point-blank saves tonight?
 MIKAEL SAMUELSSON: Yeah, you can't blame him for anything, really. Like he's playing well. He's really, really good.
