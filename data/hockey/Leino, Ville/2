  Flyers - 4

 Q. Ville, how disappointing is this with the kind of the first period compared to the effort (Indiscernible)?
 VILLE LEINO: I don't know if we were nervous. We were thinking it's a big game. It was a big game. But we got to go back home now and start over. 

 Q. You guys are good at doing that. You have confidence that bam, you'll bounce right back come Wednesday? 
 VILLE LEINO: Well, we'll be disappointed today. Tomorrow is a new game. Then we have two days off. Got to be mentally ready. We play good at home. We have to keep it up. 

 Q. Did it matter who was involved -- the way you guys played in front of Boucher or Leighton? 
 VILLE LEINO: No, we hung Leights out to dry there at the start. Brian came in, he was good. But we just got to be better. 

 Q. Do you get a sense their line changes gave them an extra jump? 
 A. Probably. Obviously, their desperation level was little higher. They wanted to do something to get them going. They were going good today. 

 Q. How do you explain that not being mentally ready? It's your chance to be one win away from the Cup? 
 VILLE LEINO: I think we were ready. We were a little too ready. I think we were a little nervous. We weren't loose enough to make plays when we had and nobody wanted to puck -- we didn't make plays. 
 We were just giving it to them. Just gave it back. We got to be smarter and work hard, and we have to want the puck. 

 Q. When you say nervous, did you detect something before you dropped the puck there in the first?
 VILLE LEINO: I don't know. We were kind of holding back when the game was going. I don't know we just got to be ready to make plays there. 

 Q. Do you think it had something to do with it being played here? 
 VILLE LEINO: It's not easy to play, obviously, on the road. It's easier to play home. But we just got to be ready on the road. Shouldn't be that big of a difference. 

 Q. Ville, it seemed like you were pulling some double shifts and he was mixing and matching some of the lines in the second period. Do you think that worked at all better? 
 VILLE LEINO: Well, I don't know. We came back and they scored, like we came back to two goals can, and they scored right away. It's a little bit disappointing to do that. We got to just win at home. It's over now. 

 Q. When the team left the dressing room, did you feel you were ready to match that intensity they were going to bring here in Game 5 at home? 
 VILLE LEINO: I thought we were. But obviously we weren't. Because the result was there. Hopefully -- I'm hoping we learn -- we're going to play good at home. Hopefully we learn and come back. 

 Q. You're confident you can come back from the 3-2 deficit?
 VILLE LEINO: We came back and went in the hole after two losses. We're going to come back. We're going to win the games at home. And we're going to win the next game at home. 

 Q. Was this game a little bit like Game 1 defensively for you guys? Maybe the forwards not helping out as much defensively? 
 VILLE LEINO: Well, yeah, it was a little bit too much -- we were playing catch-up hockey. They were scoring at the start. We were following all the time. 
 So it's not the way we want to play. They got good players. They will score goals. So we have to be smarter. 

 Q. Ville, kind of bittersweet to break the lead record there for points, but you come away with this loss here? 
 VILLE LEINO: Yeah, it's not fun. It wasn't a good game. We know that. And we just got two days off so we can recharge our batteries and come back.
