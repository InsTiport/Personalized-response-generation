  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Zach Parise. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   It's excitement really.   A little nervous.   Maybe today now going through all this, but I guess it hasn't really sunk in that we're in the finals yet. 
But we got a lot of work.   That's the thought process.   We got a lot of work to do.   We know how great a team L.A. is. 

Q.   Did you envision the Stanley Cup at all at the end of this series?
ZACH PARISE:   I try not to think about that.   Like I said, there's so much that has to be done on the floor before you even start to think about that. 

Q.   How do you try to keep it as normal as possible as crazy as it is?
ZACH PARISE:   I'm sure once the games start that it's going to be normal for everybody.   This is all the stuff that comes around with it.   It's fun, being on the big stage.   But I think once warmup starts, everyone understands where we are, what we have to do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   No, no.   I don't.   Someone might. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I mean, you always believe that you do and you always hope right from the beginning that you've got a good enough team.   But it was hard for us just because we didn't have Travis right out of training camp.   Jake got hurt.   Right away the guys they penciled in as one and two centers were gone. 
Once Travis got back, really gave our team a lot of depth.   Once he got comfortable playing again, we strung together I think six or seven in a row at the end of the season. 
It's about peaking at the right time.   I think the way we played against Philadelphia really, really made everyone believe that we had a really good chance, just as good a chance as everybody. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I think I was on a fishing trip in Canada this time last year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I didn't watch Game 7.   We had an option whether we wanted to come back in and watch the game or keep fishing.   We decided to keep fishing. 
I didn't get a chance to watch the seventh game, but we watched them all leading up to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   It was successful.   We were up in Ontario.   It was very successful. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I mean, we've said all along how huge of a part they've been to our team, a huge reason why we're here right now.   They've scored huge goals, they've scored timely goals.   When you get contributions from everybody the way we have been, that's what you need to make it, to keep playing right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I mean, yeah.   Seems like during the season you play the Rangers or Flyers every other week.   We played L.A. twice, but it was in October, early games.   They've had a lot of changes with coaches and trades.   You try to be as prepared as you can.   We watched a lot of video, what they've done throughout the whole playoffs, made us prepared.   We know what to expect. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   I mean, it was earlier.   Luckily when you guys respected my wishes to stop asking me about it, everything was fine after that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ZACH PARISE:   He's playing with confidence.   We ran into the same thing with last series with Lundqvist, with how well he was playing.   Lundqvist had been playing great all the way up to the series. 
It's the same.   Every goalie in this league is very good.   More often than not, if they see the puck, they're going to stop it.   You're always saying the same things: get traffic around them, get rebounds, make it hard for them, stay deep. 
Looks like he's playing confident.   You can tell how aggressive he is with shots, how he's challenging the plays.   You can tell he feels really good about the way he's playing.
