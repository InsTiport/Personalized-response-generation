Q.  Do you think Kolzig smothered the puck and (INAUDIBLE) --
 
TOMAS HOLMSTROM:  Looked like he was looking for the puck.  He wasn't sure and I was looking too.  The pucked come out and scored.  It is a nice feeling. 
 

Q.  Up 3 to nothing, you guys have to feel that you have there in hand?
 
TOMAS HOLMSTROM:  Yeah, it is -- can't be better than this, going for a fourth game now and it is up to us and we are going to play hard and they are going to play even harder than they do.  It is going to be a battle out there. 
 

Q.  Tomas, can you talk little bit about how it feels to you to be contributing so much to this team?
 
TOMAS HOLMSTROM:  I am really happy about that. Before the Playoffs started, I couldn't imagine maybe that I can put up with so much points and help the team so much. But, I feel really good out there and I don't think so much, just go out there and play and have fun.
