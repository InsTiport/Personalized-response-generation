Q.  Having the home ice is one thing, but doing something with it has been a problem certainly in this series.
 
TOMAS HOLMSTROM: Yeah, it's been a problem for the team having Game 7 at home.  But we have to keep going.  We played a really solid game yesterday, and I think we have to go from there and play really good.  They're going to come out really hard and play desperate, and so will we. 
 
Q.  Is duplicating that effort from Game 6 enough in getting it done in Game 7, or do you have to be that much better in Game 7?
 
TOMAS HOLMSTROM: Oh, yeah.  Both teams are going to probably come out to play even better and tougher.  This is playoff hockey, and it's just great.
