NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  Well, once the tournament is over, don't have that long of a flight back.  Have a few days' rest and you're back into playing.  The time difference will be the toughest thing to adjust to.


Q.  Do you notice a difference in playing an international size rink?  Change the game at all?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I think it will be a high tempo game.  I think it will similar to NHL hockey.  Maybe the intensity won't be as high because of the bigger ice surface.  It will still be a good hockey game.


Q.  Does that change the way you move the puck up the ice or make other certain players better because it's bigger?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  Yes.  You really have to play your positioning really well.  That will be a key.  If you're out of position, the ice surface is so big, a guy can get a breakaway.  That will be a big key for any team.


Q.  And do you think Europeans going up on an  international rink have any advantage over North Americans?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I don't think it will be that much of an advantage for the Europeans.  I think everybody's been used to playing over here.  You only have three days to practice with your team before you're back into action the first game.  I don't think that will have much to do with it.
