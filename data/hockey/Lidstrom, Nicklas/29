Q.  Well, now you all can have illegal sticks because they're not going to ask again.
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM: I never know, you never know, but that could have turned the game around for them in their average if they had a five on three there and scored. 
 
Q.  Patrick obviously gave up a tough goal on the first one for himself.  A guy like him, you've got to be concerned about his ability to bounce back and rise to the occasion in these types of games.
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM: Yes, we know he's a great goaltender.  He's proven that in the past.  We know we have to throw a lot of pucks at him, but we have to have guys screening for him too, be there for deflections, stuff like that. 
 
Q.  Nicklas, is it a long and painful wait for Game 7 to start?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM: Not really.  Not after a win like that.  You feel confident and you feel relaxed on a day like this, an off day.  You just have to be relaxed and try to think of other things and be ready to play tomorrow night. 
 
Q.  What kind of things do you do?  Is it something that builds as the game gets closer, or do you do what you can to make it a normal game like Game 48 of the season?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM: Yeah, it is an important game, and you have to cut down on your mistakes.  But on the other hand, you have to be confident out there.  You have to try to make plays out there, and I think we are that kind of team.  I think we showed that last night.  I think we showed that we are able to play relaxed and play with confidence.
