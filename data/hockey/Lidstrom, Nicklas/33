Q.  All-Star Game -- what's it like for you personally being in the All-Star Game and being around this much talent?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:   It's great to be part of this event. I look around the locker room at everyone in this locker room and the players that we're playing against, it's the best talent in the world playing in this game, so it's good to be a part of it. 
 

Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the Red Wings going into the second half of the season and the challenges that you're going to face?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:   We've known the whole year that we have to play better defensively start in our own end.  That's where we've been working on in the last few weeks. So we know we have to take care of our own end first, and we know we have enough talent to score goals.
