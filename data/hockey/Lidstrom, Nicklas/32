Q.  How do you answer about an Olympic year, All-Star Game season?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  It's a compressed schedule for us.  I think everybody knew that, too, going into the year.  I think everybody was actually prepared for it, too.  Feels like you're playing more games in a short period of time.  Having this weekend, as well.  I think everybody is so excited about the Olympics, they're thinking about going there and playing there. 
 

Q.  Is there an obligation to be here? 
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I'm not sure if those guys had injuries or if they're nursing injuries or whatever.  If that's the case, I think they feel they need the rest to be able to play the whole year, play in the Olympics, too, I think they can do that.  Otherwise, I think they should come Andy play in these games. 
 

Q.  What does it mean for you to be an All-Star?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  It's an honor to come here and be part of it, play with the best players in the world. 
 

Q.  How about the schedule, a bit compressed?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I think it is a bit compressed, but everybody knew about that coming into the year, too.  I think everybody was mentally prepared for this season
