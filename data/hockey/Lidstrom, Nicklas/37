Q.  That period started off to be a little slow; then you came on the second half.  What kind of adjustment did you make?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I thought the first maybe 5 or 6 minutes I thought they were more hungry than we were.  They really put pressure on us.  We were able to ride that out and we had some good counter attacks. 
 

Q.  You scored the 2 goals you had traffic in front; is that the key against Olaf Kolzig in this series?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  That is the key against any good goalie in the NHL, get the puck to the net and try to create some traffic in front of them; be there for rebounds. 
 

Q.  When you compare this series to the other series in the Playoffs this year, does this team pose any different problems that you haven't faced yet?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I think they are playing a similar style to what Dallas did against us clogging up the neutral zone and make it -- you have to get some scoring chances on them.
