Q.  Great win for you guys?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  Yeah, we never gave up.  Really kept our focus even though they were up twice with two goals.  We just kept going and told ourselves that we have to keep putting pressure on them.


Q.  Talk about what was said after two periods, it is 3 to 1, anything said in the locker room or was it just a feeling that you guys still knew you were in and would come back?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  We weren't giving up at all.  We just said we have to get the puck to the net and have guys there.  That is how we scored some of our goals there too, even game winner where the puck is just thrown at the net and Kris is there for an tap-in.  We talked about that going into the third period throwing the puck to the net a lot more.


Q.  Did you feel like Kolzig was like a wall?  He had so many opportunities against him; seemed like he was standing there and stopping everything?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  Yeah, he stopped everything pretty much first half of the game and he cleared a lot of read bounds.  As well so there weren't that many rebounds laying around.
