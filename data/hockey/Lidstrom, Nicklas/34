Q.  Back-to-back Stanley Cup champs.  Great feeling after this Game 4?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  It's an awesome feeling. Especially doing it on the road.  I thought the team was really determined throughout the whole series.  We wanted to win tonight. 
 

Q.  How does it feel with Vladi on the ice, inspirational?
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  I thought it was great to see Vladi out there.  With about five minutes left in the game, everyone was standing up giving him a standing ovation.  I thought it was great from everybody here in the building. 
 

Q.  The long year has ended for this team, back-to-back champs.  You guys fought start to finish.
 
NICKLAS LIDSTROM:  Yeah.  We were determined going into this season and especially the Playoffs.  We wanted to repeat and I thought everybody was really focusing on doing that as well.
