Q.  (Inaudible.)

NICKLAS LIDSTROM: We had some mistakes in the neutral zone and they came down and rushed and scored on them.  That's what happened pretty much.

Q.  What's the best way to contain Peter Forsberg?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM: Well, you have to stay close to him.  He likes to buy time and have guys  -- almost like two guys go to him and then he can dish it off.  But you have to be patient around him and have one guy to work him out and another guy to work over his shoulder.  

Q.  Talk about having your backs against the wall, it's an old cliche, but there is no tomorrow for the Red Wings.  How do you approach the game tomorrow night?

NICKLAS LIDSTROM: We have to come out with desperation.  We have to play desperate hockey.  We have to be smarter too.  We have to be patient, and we can't really make mistakes because they're so good on capitalizing on our mistakes.  So we have to cut down on our mistakes but still play with confidence.
