VICTOR HEDMAN: The team we're playing were in a similar hole in the first round.  So they've proven it's possible.  We believe in ourself, we believe in this group, and we believe we're capable of winning games there and make sure that yesterday wasn't our last home game for the season.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: Yeah, he's proven that all year.  He's obviously been the most consistent, best player this whole season.  So we've got to do a better job in front of him clearing pucks and turnovers.  It's tough for a goalie when the puck's going east to west and you've got to recover.
But he's one of those guys, his compete level is so high.  He puts a lot of pressure on himself, and you want that in a goalie.  We've talked after the game, talked in between periods that we're a good team.  We're here for a reason.  We believe in ourself and in this group.  We've got to go out there and win games on the road, and we've done that in the playoffs and we've got to do it again.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: No, obviously not.  We were giving up too many scoring chances.  Odd-man rushes.  We've got to give their team credit too.  They're obviously finding ways to create those opportunities.  For us, it's about looking at ourselves, looking at our game plan, and looking at our video of what we can change to eliminate that.  That's what we're going to do.  We've got to bounce back tomorrow.  It's the biggest game of the year tomorrow, go down 3-0 or (indiscernible).  We're in this position now and nothing can change, all we can do is focus on tomorrow.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: Yeah, absolutely.  We've got the team and we're here for a reason.  We're fully capable of adjusting our game plan and adjusting the mistakes we've made.  We can't change what happened in the past few days.  We're just looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: No, there's no panic.  We're obviously not happy with losing two games on home ice, but that is not something that goes into our locker room.  We've got the experience.  We've got the guys that are in the playoffs for the first time, guys have been through this, and we're capable of handling that.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: I don't know comfort, but they've proven it's possible.  That's what's so fun with hockey.  Things can swing from one day to another.  Like I said, we've got the group.  We've got the team to rally around us and put these three games behind us and look forward.
So it's the first of four, not the first of two.  We're obviously pushed against the wall a little bit, but we're a team that's been known for rallying from behind and battling through adversity.  So we're going to have to do that again.
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: No, I think he's one of those guys that can put this behind him (indiscernible) and that goes for the rest of the team.  So Vas is a world-class goaltender, and we have to help him make the stops.  So it's a matter of us making it easier on him.  Don't give up too many opportunities.  They have a lot of skill on that team and they're going to put the puck in the net.  It's about eliminating those chances and trying to play more (indiscernible).
Q. (Indiscernible)?
VICTOR HEDMAN: Yeah, it is.  Obviously, we're a group.  We've got all the experience.  We've been down 3-1 (indiscernible) one year and been able to come back.  You go through the list, and guys have been down a series and found a way to come back.  That's what hockey is all about.  It's a fascinating sport when it comes to momentum swings.  You win one game and you feel a lot better.  So for us, it's all about resetting everything.
