Q. Got a penalty late in that third period. What was that like sitting in the box with
the season on the line?

BRENDEN MORROW: I think it felt a little bit like a heart attack. My heart was
pounding, and I didn't really want to watch. I just sort of had my head down and hoped my
teammates could help me out.

Q. If your heart was pounding in regulation, what are you expecting it to be like in
overtime?

BRENDEN MORROW: Same thing, our backs are against the wall right now. We want to take
this thing back home, so we are going to come out and we are going to have to have a
strong period.
