  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Now that the suspension has been handed down, your thoughts? 
COLIN FRASER:   I mean, I don't know.   I think you can't hit guys in the face with a stick at the end of the day.   If he does it on purpose, definitely tries to hit him, I don't think he tried to hit him in the face, at the end of the day he does hit him in the face, you have to be responsible for his actions. 

Q.   How do you take advantage of his absence in the lineup?
COLIN FRASER:   He's a good player.   He's a Conn Smythe winner‑‑ Norris winner.   He's a fast guy, plays a lot of minutes. 
It doesn't change our game plan, though.   Whether he's in or out, our game plan stays the same.   We have to execute it and do it as well, if not better, than we did Game3. 

Q.   The Campbell play last night, did you see it? 
COLIN FRASER:   The blocked shot?   Yeah, yeah, God, it's crazy.   You hear about that, a broken leg after, he finishes the shift. 
I haven't played against him much, but he's a tough player.   We don't play against each other very much, him being in the east. 
It's unfortunate to have an injury like that.   It was crazy.
