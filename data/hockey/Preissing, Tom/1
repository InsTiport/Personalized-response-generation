  Q.  What happened, looked like you guys dictated the play for the first 20 minutes.  Can you expand on what happened as you were playing?   
  
 TOM PREISSING:  Took a big shift (indiscernible).   
  
  Q.  Your group now, can you deal with that situation?   
 TOM PREISSING:  I mean, this is what we need to work on the most.  What happened before, being down 3 to 1, that's what we need to do.
