Union   5
  Boston College - 4

MODERATOR:   We will begin with some thoughts to start from Coach York.   Jerry. 
COACH YORK:   First of all, I thought Union played very well.   They certainly have an excellent hockey team, as do all the participants here in the tournament. 
We watched closely some film of all three clubs.   But they played very well tonight.   They're an excellent hockey team.   I thought our team, I loved how we competed, how we battled right down to the last second of the hockey game. 
There was never any give‑up in us.   We've been on the other side an awful lot with trophies, and this particular senior class has done an incredible job for us.   I'm very, very proud of them. 
But my hat's off to Union.   They made some plays tonight that resulted in a win.   I thought the power play goal in the third period, the shot from the point was a turning point in the game. 
We had to answer it with our five‑minute power play.   We just never got quite in sync with that major penalty.   But, again, four seniors and our team competed very hard, and Union's an excellent hockey team.
MODERATOR:   Questions first for the players. 

Q.   Johnny and Bill, just talk about that whole five‑minute sequence.   You only got eight shot attempts and three shots at goal.   What was it that Union did to cause you guys not to get a goal there?
JOHNNY GAUDREAU:   They have a good P.K., good defensive team.   We didn't get enough shots to the net.   And we didn't do what we were told to do on the power play.   So we needed to get more shots.
BILL ARNOLD:   Like Johnny said, we were just kind of out of sync there and not everyone's on the same page, maybe trying to force stuff too much, and you can't do that against a good penalty kill stop here.

Q.   Johnny, can you talk about being from the area, what it meant to play here and play in front of this crowd?
JOHNNY GAUDREAU:   Yeah, it was emotional.   Anytime family and friends are here.   And got to play with my brother here, too.   So it's going to be a pretty good memory I'm going to have.

Q.   Bill, can you talk about the emotions and how you had to combat those emotions after you guys didn't score after the five‑minute major and then right after that they scored the goal?
BILL ARNOLD:   You have to try not to get frustrated, and Coach called a timeout there.   It starts with him, he's our leader.   He stayed calm and kept us on point with the 4‑3 there but couldn't get it tied up. 
Just gotta try to keep your composure and stay calm.

Q.   You talk about that five‑minute power play and you both said you were out of sync.   Was this something that Union was doing defensively to cause that? 
PATRICK BROWN:   They're a great shot‑blocking team.   I was net front and I couldn't even see the puck because they had two or three guys in the lane every time. 
But we didn't create enough movement, get pucks to the net around them.   And credit to them.   They played unbelievable.
MODERATOR:   Anything further for the players?   Okay.   Very good.   Guys, thanks so much.   We'll finish with your questions for Coach York.

Q.   Coach, can you talk about how Thatcher Demko played tonight?
COACH YORK:   I thought he played well.   Made some really big saves.   The break‑away save, they followed with a rebound situation.   Made two clean break‑away saves.   I thought he composed himself very well for this stage, and that says nothing but bright, bright things for the kid.

Q.   Jerry, for the first two periods especially seemed like they were able to take you guys out of your sort of normal possession game, the rhythm you guys usually get.   What were they doing specifically that prevented you guys from having any real sustained pressure?
COACH YORK:   I thought really they had the edge in the first period.   We were leading 1‑0.   I thought they had the edge.   In the second period I thought we came back and started to play more type of hockey I like to see play.   I thought we had some good puck possessions, created some chances.   Two good clubs playing. 
They were just a little bit better than we were tonight.   But I told our players I'm extremely proud of the year they've had and disappointed that we're not playing for the national championship. 
But sometimes it just doesn't work. 

Q.   It looked like they kind of almost forced you to an East/West game for a period of time.   Do you think your guys were overpassing at times?
COACH YORK:   I thought at the power play during the five‑minute major, they were just a little bit ‑‑ like I said, a little bit out of sync with passing the pucks a little too slowly, not quick enough, and then it's easier for the lanes to be blocked. 
But I think during the course of the night we played pretty good hockey here.   And I don't want to take anything away from the other club.   They played very, very well against us.   So credit to Union for winning this particular hockey game.

Q.   It's always deflating when you can't score on a five‑minute major and giving up the goal.   What did you tell your team to kind of get the air back into the sails after they scored that extra goal after the five‑minute...
COACH YORK:   I thought there was plenty of time left in the game.   Clearly there was because we got back to win one goal.   And really thought we had a chance to tie it up there in the fleeting moments of the hockey game.   So the game's never over.   Fully understand that.

Q.   How much do you think nerves on your younger guys played a role in this game?
COACH YORK:   I thought they handled themselves pretty well.   We played big games before during the course of the season.   None of this magnitude.   But I thought for the most part they handled the surroundings and the of the game in a pretty positive manner. 

Q.   I think it was Bill Arnold who said yesterday that at BC the seasons when you don't win the national championship are disappointing.   After a game like this, when it comes to an end, is it hard to get those guys to see positives in this season?
COACH YORK:   We're very disappointed, no question in that subject.   I'm very proud of guys who are reaching so high that they want to be that type of team that wins national championships.   But it's hard to reflect back now.   We're certainly not ready to do that.

Q.   Daniel Ciampini with the three goals tonight, and also screening Demko on the Bodie goals.   Talk about his effort against you guys tonight. 
COACH YORK:   Can't specifically watch other players on particular teams.   I watched some film.   Not tonight or tomorrow.   I'll wait a while to do this. 
But I thought the team was good.   Certainly Gostisbehere is an impressive player from back there.   That's one player that jumps at me when I watch.
MODERATOR:   Thank you.
