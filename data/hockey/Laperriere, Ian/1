 Q. What were you thinking when they were going through the presentation?
 IAN LAPERRIERE: I don't know, no bitterness, if that's what you're asking. No -- that's with the way I play, that's the way I am and I'm proud of the way I play every single game and I said before it took me 16 years to get a puck in the face and just so happened I took two that year. I don't regret anything and it's too bad that I have symptoms from it but I wouldn't change anything. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IAN LAPERRIERE: Oh, yeah, you get up there and you walk and on top of it Luke was giving me the trophy and what I said up there was true, I learned how to be a professional through him and just to see him every day act the way he acted and to be a regular guy I can't thank him enough. I got to thank him and them. That many people you have to thank, it's not that easy. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
IAN LAPERRIERE: That's what I'm most proud of, my kids, my wife, I've been with my wife for 21 years and she is the backbone of my family and to have them here with my mom, it means the world to me. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IAN LAPERRIERE: Maglai, M-A-G-L-A-I. I did thank my mom, didn't I? Just checking. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IAN LAPERRIERE: I don't think it's ever going to leave, to tell you the truth. Maybe it will, I don't know. Maybe when I'm 45 and can't get out of bed, but I don't know. I'm born and raised in Montreal and hockey is my life. If I do come back it's going to be great but if I don't I'm still going to be involved in the game because that's all I know, and that's what I'm passionate about. 
 It's one thing to be passionate about and it's great if you can find that and I found something, 32 years of it and I won't lose it that easy. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 IAN LAPERRIERE: I don't know, like I said earlier, you know, I'm -- I still have a year on my deal, I'm going to give that year, if my eye can clear up, it will be great, if not, I'll move on and see what the opportunities are out there and I'll explore them. Promise you one thing it's going to be in the game, I won't go and be a chef or something, nothing against chefs or anything, but it's not in my future. Thank you.
