Q.   Is Brandon Prust available to you tonight?
COACH THERRIEN:   Yeah, yeah, it was an optional practice this morning.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH THERRIEN:   You'll see tonight.   Might be though.

Q.   Over the last four or five days, what have you noticed about the way Dustin has approached the pressure and excitement that goes along with it? 
COACH THERRIEN:   I thought he handled it very well.   We understand that with the loss of Carey Price we put the young kid in a tough spot.   But you look at his background, and he's a winner, and that was the number one priority for us.   I thought he handled really well for the first game, especially at the Bell Centre.   It's a different pressure when you're on the road.   He played really well on the road for us this year every time we asked him to play.   But the young man did a great job.

Q.   Is there going to be any different defensive strategy tonight with the rookie in the net considering where you are in a hostile building?
COACH THERRIEN:   One thing we know, we know the Rangers are going to play‑‑ right now they're playing with a lot of confidence.   Honestly, this is the best team that we've played in the playoffs so far.
So we all understand the challenge that we're facing tonight.   Yes, we've got a young guy in the goalie position, but for us we've got to make sure we play the way we play, to play the right way, to play the way with confidence.   We can't start thinking about changing things because of the goalie.   We have to make sure we play the right way.   We all know if we play the way we care about the play, we give our team a chance to win, and this is what we want to do tonight.
