COACH THERRIEN:   Dustin Tokarski was phenomenal tonight.   He's a battler, and most important thing, he's a winner.   You've got to give a lot of credit to the Rangers.   They got out of the gate tonight like we did at the Bell Centre our last game.   We weathered the storm, and I felt our team played with more confidence as the game went on, and they got a break at the end to tie the game up, it hit Alexei's skate.   But without Tokarski's performance, probably the result would have been different.  
   
 Q.   After the lead got away from you late in the third there, did you address the team between the third period and the overtime, or were you in the room?   What did you sense from the group?   
COACH THERRIEN:   You know what?   I always address the team.   But you know what?   They got a break hitting the skate, and it was a bad break for us.   But the challenge for us as a group, we have to refocus and just couple of things that we have to pay attention.   
But it's just a matter of refocus really quick.   For sure we know we're 20 seconds away or something like that to get the lead, and they score late in the game.   We've just got to refocus, and there is nothing you can do.   It's a one‑goal game, and we like our position.  
   
 Q.   Given how little the body of work is for Dustin at the NHL level, aside from knowing what he had done in the World Cup and the AHL, et cetera, did you talk to any people in or outside the organization to get feedback on making that call?   Is there a specific person you went to that helped you with that call?   
COACH THERRIEN:   You know what?   When you take a decision like that, first of all, it's not one guy, honestly.   As a group, we always work with the coaching staff, with the management.   We all sell the same thing the same way, with the kid's background.   The way that he played for us this year only a few times we knew the kid was a winner.   To be a winner, you need to be a battler, and this is exactly what again he shows tonight.  
   
 Q.   Are you concerned that the league may review Brandon's hit on Derek Stepan?   
COACH THERRIEN:   I'm not concerned, no.  
   
 Q.   Besides the league reviewing it, given Brandon's outspokenness about Chris Kreider, do you think that hit will give the Rangers something to rally around as well?   
COACH THERRIEN:   You better ask them.   I'm not the right guy honestly.  
   
 Q.   The Plekanec line wasn't giving you a whole lot when they scored that goal.   Is that the type of goal that should ignite that line?   
COACH THERRIEN:   We made some adjustments tonight with the lines.   The thing that I like, it's good to be on his line to give us a goal, with the Markov goal.   The Daniel Briere line gave us a goal, and in the end, Plekanec's line gave us a goal, and Gionta.   
Also, I think for them it's going to be good for their confidence, and especially a young kid like Galchenyuk who is 20 years old scored the goal in overtime.   I'm sure that's a good feeling for him.   He's going to feel good about himself, and that's going to be good for his confidence.
