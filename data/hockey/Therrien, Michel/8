Q.   Michel, we're very aware of the status of Carey Price.   But him in full equipment this morning, what's that indicate in terms of his recovery, the time line in his recovery? 
COACH THERRIEN:   That's just part of the process about making a comeback. 
But like you said, not playing a game.   He's not going to play in that series.   He's not going to play.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
COACH THERRIEN:   Everything's good.

Q.   Max was just talking to us about how he felt about his performance in the last game how it wasn't adequate.   In the time that you've known him or coached him, how do you feel he's generally reacted to situations where he, himself, wasn't satisfied with his own play? 
COACH THERRIEN:   Well, like I said, tonight is a game that we've been there, and we need everyone to be at their best.   Tonight, we've been there two weeks ago, and it's about preparation.   It's about attitude, and we need everyone to make sure they're well‑prepared and they've got the right attitude to face the challenge.

Q.   You touched on a bit there, but if you're going to wheel off three straight wins, do you need the big‑named guys to be better? 
COACH THERRIEN:   We need everyone.
