Rangers   3
  Canadiens   2

Q.   How did you see the winning goal develop?   It looked like there were a few chances to maybe clear the zone? 
COACH THERRIEN:   Well, we got a few chances to get out of it and move the puck harder on our own end, and it cost us the game.

Q.   When your power play is struggling to score and it gives us a shorthanded score, does that magnify the travails? 
COACH THERRIEN:   We had the opportunity on the power play and we didn't take advantage of it tonight.   Yes, we scored a goal.   It was a timely goal, but we gave up one, and that was the score of the game.   I thought our power play had to be better.

Q.   You mentioned earlier needing that break, the shot by Galchenyuk to hit the cross bar.   How difficult is it to manage mentally when you know you were that close to tying the series and you wind up in this? 
COACH THERRIEN:   It's nothing to do with the rest of the game.   I thought five‑on‑five we were playing well and we got some chances.   But we still got to battle hard.   I think this is what we did.
