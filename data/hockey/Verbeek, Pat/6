Q.  Nice game out there, Pat? 
 
PAT VERBEEK: Thank you very much, it was a lot of fun.  It was nice to see a nice close hockey game, a close low-scoring game. 
 

Q.  There was a lot of defense in the game, believe it or not; mainly because the goal tending was superb.
 
PAT VERBEEK: Well, the goaltender played extremely well.  And during the regular season you couldn't give that many chances as you gave tonight.  And the goaltender stayed strong and enabled this to be a very competitive game. 
 

Q.  Guys playing together in the same lines; you along with Messier, for example.  It's very helpful?
 
PAT VERBEEK: Well, it makes the game a little easier because you know what one another is going to do out there, and it makes it a little more special to be able to play with the players you play with all year during one of these things.  
 

Q.  How good are the Rangers this year?
 
PAT VERBEEK: Well, we're not bad.
