I sat down with management.  They primarily told me where they were at with their draft picks pretty much.  I was surprise as any, I guess, yeah.  I wasn't expecting going number 5 at all.  I was thinking about little ways down the road, but obviously with a ranking like that I will take it. 
 
They have a few "D" men in the system. That is primarily what I know.  We are not familiar with out west, the teams out east and with the schedule our team has in Prince George we are not too up on the NHL. 
 
Yeah, that would probably be the most logical thing.  But, stranger things have happened.  I will have to feel my way through in New York. 
 
I will be a 2 A game, a good offense and some defense.  It is quite rounded.  I am not the flashiest player, but I can do the things that need to be done.
