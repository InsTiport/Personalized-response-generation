  ELIAS LINDHOLM:   I've been working hard since I was a kid to be skill, tough.  
   
 Q.   What was the moment like when you heard your name called?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Undescribable.   I was so nervous all day, and when Carolina said my name, it was amazing.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a good sense that they were interested?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah.   We had a meeting in New York, so there was a couple of teams that were interested, I think, and Carolina was one of them.  
   
 Q.   Do you see yourself in the NHL next year?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   I don't know.   We'll see.   It's hard to say right now, but I don't know.   
   
 Q.   Is it possible we'll see you in the NHL next year?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   You never know.   
   
 Q.   That sounds like a yes.   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   We'll see, we'll see.  
   
 Q.   Who has helped you along the road?   Who comes into your mind?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   My dad, of course, my mom, my brother, and also my coach on the way.   They've been helping me and been there to support me, and so it's been good.   
   
 Q.   What do you know about Carolina?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   You know, I played a lot with them and know the whole team pretty well.   I know the players pretty well, but also the prospect that was drafted last year and Victor Rask, I talked to them about last year about Carolina, so I know a bit.   
   
 Q.   What kind of conversations did you have with Victor?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   How is Carolina and how it was in NHL and stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   I have a question about your next season.   Have you talked to your home team about this or been in discussions with them?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Actually not.   My contract, my plan is to stay, but you never know, like I said.   But I haven't been talking to them about leaving and playing in the NHL next year.   
   
 Q.   When will you sit down with them, as soon as you get back home?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah, yeah, and I want to talk to Carolina and know what they are saying about me.  
   
 Q.   And when will you talk to Carolina, right now?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   I don't know.   I don't know.  
   
 Q.   Tonight?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Probably.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   You know, I think that's part of the game, to be as solid all around as possible.   When I was a kid I was maybe just skilled, but then I watched a lot of Forsberg, and now when you play hockey you have to be a little bit all around, but some are more, some are less, but I think I'm pretty all around.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a favorite team growing up?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Actually not.   I watched a lot.   I liked Crosby, so I watched Pittsburgh more than other games.  
   
 Q.   You liked more players than teams?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What's this whole experience been like for you leading up to the draft?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah, you know, I've been watching the draft the last three years when my captain was able to get drafted, and also last year was Filip Forsberg.   To be here and be able to go in the draft and get drafted, it's amazing.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah, when we was kids we was always out to dinners, always playing outdoor hockey and always seeing how good he is, and he's been like a role model to me.   I watched him pretty close, and I would say he's a good role model to be at the same ice like six years up to 15.   It's been great.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   No, it's quick.   He's pretty hard to stop in the corners and he's smart.   Also he's got‑‑ I would say he's also pretty all around, but maybe some toughness.   I think he's going to be successful in the NHL.   
   
 Q.   Your dad played in the NHL?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did he have any problem with your going to Carolina or was he just happy?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   No, he was just happy.   We didn't talk so much.   It was just a hug.   
   
 Q.   You're here with all your family, mother and father and‑‑  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   Yeah, exactly.   
   
 Q.   A lot of people here may not understand the Finland‑Sweden thing.   What's it like you and Alex being the top two Europeans?  
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   You know, we played against both of us.   It's pretty tough going into the men's league.   They're always big and tough and strong.   So it's something I think is good for both of us.   But in the junior league I think it's pretty much about speed, and in the elite league it's pretty much defensive.   It's hard to get scoring chances and so on.   
But junior league is faster I would think.   
   
 Q.   I guess the other thing was a lot of people talk about this being a deep draft.   What was it do you think that separated you from some of the guys that are coming after you?   
ELIAS LINDHOLM:   I would say my all‑aroundness.   I can be skill, I can be tough, I can block shots.   I can do whatever the coach tells me to do.
