 SCHUYLER BAEHMAN: Questions for Coach Maurice. 

 Q. When Sid and Geno are playing at the level they're playing tonight, how tough is this Pittsburgh team to beat? 
 COACH MAURICE: Well, you're not going to be able to do it one-on-one. We're struggling a little bit. We left them alone at times one-on-one with a player. We're going to have to do a better job of getting a little better support. 
 I think they're hurting us too bad. They certainly are creating some opportunities for their team on the ice. 

 Q. Could you explain the way the penalty began? What was said to you? 
 COACH MAURICE: Well, it's a penalty -- I didn't get an explanation as to what happened. Two players came together, and it was a high sticking match but I didn't get anymore than that. 

 Q. You haven't been in this position in a 2-0 hole. You are going home for two games. Just talk about the things you need to do to try to turn this series around? 
 COACH MAURICE: We're going to have to do a little better carrying momentum at different times of the game. When we do have it going, it will be important for us. 
 They did what they needed to do. They won their two games on home ice. We'll have to do the same now. That's on our job. 

 Q. Did you get a sense that first period, second period, the momentum was going in your favor at certain points in the game? And how did the team actually lose that? 
 COACH MAURICE: I think it was the way we responded after the early goal. I thought we were in pretty good shape. I thought we lost the power play opportunities. It's not so much not scoring, we didn't generate enough on them. That was a big goal in the third period to get that game tied. 
 We just had a hard time finding that place.
