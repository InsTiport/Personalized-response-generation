 SCHUYLER BAEHMAN: Questions for Coach Maurice. 

 Q. The last two goals have been in the first period. How much does that suck the wind out of you guys?
 COACH MAURICE: I think that puts a considerable amount. It doesn't start the game the way we want to. We were going to score some power-play goals in the last two. It completely changed the way they were able to defend then at that point, and made it a little more difficult for us to get pucks through the net and get to that neutral zone. 

 Q. After three games, are they just too skilled, too quick, too fast for you guys? 
 COACH MAURICE: We're not as quick as we need to be defending. And it's more of 41 times shot the puck, and we have to manage that puck and move that puck better, quicker and faster. And then it certainly looks like it's coming around our gaps as well as the quickness issues. 

 Q. The obvious one. Facing history basically now, how do you guys keep playing? 
 COACH MAURICE: Well, on our challenge will be to find a way to beat them once, and then we'll try to revisit that. But we're not looking at beating Pittsburgh four times. We need one game. 
 You know, after two days here, it's not going to hurt their team any, but it will be a benefit to us. We'll at least try to get some of our quickness back in our game, and back in our legs that we're struggling with right now. 

 Q. It's another game where you guys haven't gotten a goal in the third period and in the game in the third it seems to fall apart in the end. What is the reason for it? 
 COACH MAURICE: When you're opening up against that team. You're at a distinct disadvantage if you're thinking well, they defend well. Then when they transition that puck, they don't need too many chances. 
 We got beat 3-1, so you don't need a whole lot to open up. They didn't have a hard time to get their shots. You don't want to be chasing on a team. 
 They played well enough defensively, and when they have a goaltend break down, they make the saves, they don't need as many opportunities. They had one.
