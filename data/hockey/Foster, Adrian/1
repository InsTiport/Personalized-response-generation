Q.  Adrian, can you describe to us the injury or injuries that you had in your abdomen?  Is it two separate ones or one?
 
ADRIAN FOSTER:  Basically it was one injury, and it happened at the same time, and just we decided to fix the right side first and not both at the same time.  Hopefully that would be fixed, but it didn't.  So I had surgery twice in Montreal and I'm skating now and working on it, doing absolutely everything and looking forward to getting back out here.  
 

Q.  Because of your injuries, are you surprised that you were picked this high?
 
ADRIAN FOSTER: It's always a surprise.  You don't know which team you're going to go to.  I knew the area that I was going to get picked in and I thought it was going to be around there and I'm really happy going to New Jersey. 
 

Q.  How many games have you played in the last couple years?  I couldn't find your name in the guide.
 
ADRIAN FOSTER:  Well, not too many.  I'm not sure.  Maybe 15, a dozen. 
 

Q.  In two years?
 
ADRIAN FOSTER:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  Independence did a report on you, said either you would be a first-line center in three years or out of hockey completely in three years.  Does that intimidate you at all that people think of you that way?
 
ADRIAN FOSTER: It doesn't bother me.  I think it just makes me want to try harder and prove people wrong and I mean I know where I'm going to be in three years and looks good. 
 

Q.  When did you have the two surgeries?  You had two surgeries?
 
ADRIAN FOSTER:  One in October and one in March, this year.
