 Q.   Travis, what does it mean to you when you see your coach so emotionally involved like that on the bench?   
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   He's an emotional guy, he wants to win, just like us, and it rubs off.   It rubs off on us.   And to see how much he cares about the players and his team and about us having success, that it makes us feel good.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday we were talking with Martin Brodeur, and he was saying how the younger guys must learn to hate the New York Rangers.   I know you've been there for a few years, but are you still learning to hate that team and would you say you hate that team and that rivalry; is that strong between the two teams?  
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   Was that question for me?   Well, you know we play each other so often and every game is, it's a war against those guys.   So it's easy to get emotionally involved in playing these guys.   For me it was the first year, you have your leaders like Marty and Patty and those guys and see how they compete against that team.   
It makes it easy to like you said get involved and hate that team.
