  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Travis Zajac.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about Jonathan Quick?   I know guys maybe get tired of talking about him.   What do you see so far from him?   
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   Well, he's a little different than any other goalie we've faced so far.   He plays low.   He's quick on rebounds.   He's fast.   He gets out and plays pucks a lot.   He's a great goalie.   He's been like that all year for them.   
For us, it's about getting more traffic, getting some more pucks to the net, try to test him a little bit more.   
   
 Q.   When you play the way you played last night and still can't come out on top, does it frustrate you enough where you start to wonder or does it help your belief that you need a break?  
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   Yeah, we didn't get a bounce last night.   I think that's what it came down to.   We can play.   We showed that.   That was just trying to get the job done, elevate your game to try to get that first win.   Once we get that...   
   
 Q.   Is it sort of a similar feeling to the Florida series?  
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   It's similar in some cases.   Obviously Florida, having our season on the line there, we wanted to bounce back and come away with two wins.   We can draw off that a little bit and have some confidence from winning those series.   
   
 Q.   Do you treat this similarly to the way it was against the Rangers, kept at it, found a way?   
TRAVIS ZAJAC:   No, that is true.   It is similar.   Same thing happened in the Rangers series.   We just stuck with it.   We believed in ourselves, found a way to get it done.   Eventually that series tilted in our favor.   
If we can do the same thing tomorrow night, worry about tomorrow night's game, get a win tomorrow, I think that would definitely help us.
