Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: We had two cracks this time, and the first one we failed and hopefully we'll be better in Game  7. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: No, not really.  I don't think we played well.  I think the Colorado game was different a little bit.  This game, we got out, played like we outplayed them in Game 5.  It was a mirror image of Game 5 in New Jersey, but swapping teams.  They beat us to everything. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: You have no choice.  You fly all day and get yourself ready for Game  7.  You've got to try to forget it as quick as possible.  You figure there is a great experience just to go out and play a Game  7 for the Stanley Cup, so we'll try to forget about it and be better for next game. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: No, not at all.  We have been skating since September.  I don't think one skate is going to make a big difference here. 
 
Q.  Were you surprised Paul was able to get up?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: I didn't see him get hit.  Definitely the way he was laying down, I didn't know if he was alive.  He just didn't move for a while.  I guess he got hit on the side and lost his wind.  Leaders are made and that's the reason why he's making $10 million.  He's a competitor and he shows he's there for the Mighty Ducks. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: I think the way that we play in our building.  I think the way that we've been playing in our building, and the way that knowing that we have guys that can score big goals at a big time, we feel we can play a lot better defensively.  I think it's important for us to try to get the lead.  Whenever we're trailing, we just have a hard time competing with these guys.  I think the fact is we never think well in this building for the three games.  
 
Q.  Do you do anything differently being as how you've dominated them there?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: Well, it's a hockey game.  We're going to try to do our best.  Get ourselves prepared, try to listen to what your coach says and follow the game plan.  I think we were out of control.  Defensively we ran after guys and tried to make some hits.  Every time we get on the road we seem to be like that.  For whatever reason, we would like to know because we try to play better on the road.  At home we don't seem to have that problem. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: Well, it's been like a homer series so far.  You never know what's going to happen in Game  7.  You rely on a bounce here and there, not just to win the series or advance, to win it all. 
 
Q.  What are your thoughts on what happened in the game, you getting pulled?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: It's my decision.  I make the decision with Pat.  I think Pat asked me how I felt.  Definitely we don't want at this time for me to get hurt in a stupid play or something like that.  Definitely it was a great opportunity.  The game was out of reach for us, a great opportunity for Schwab to get a little time in the Stanley Cup Finals.  Definitely I would like to play the whole game, but in a situation like that, it's not that big of a deal. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: Yeah, I mean, it's a figure of speech, he looked like he was out of it.  He wasn't moving, but, like I said, I didn't see the hit.  I miss all of Scotty's hits because I look at the puck all the time.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: When he hits?  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: No, not at all.  He knows his job.  Everybody is accountable in what they  -- how they play out there.  If you want to play through the middle of your head, head down, it's not cheap shots.  He's doing it with his skills.  It shouldn't be a problem.  I don't think it affects him.  He's been taking guys out a lot just by guys making mistakes on him. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTIN BRODEUR: That's why I'm a goalie.
