Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTY BRODEUR: Yeah, it's important.  It's how you handle yourself in a situation like that.  It's how you're going to play the next day.  It's important that you forget about good games and bad games.  Good games, it's also important and try to stay even keel.  
 
Q.  What do you think about tomorrow, because it's a Game  7 and one mistake could win you or lose you the Cup?
 
MARTY BRODEUR: We'll see.  Like I said, every game is different, and definitely, you expect there is a lot more at stake.  You can't control bounces and weird goals.  You can't control that.  Definitely, it's something that we're just going to go out there and not beat ourself and try to make these guys play a better game than they're playing now and play even better than ourself. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTY BRODEUR: It happens.  They made some good shots on the goals they scored, and they got some lucky ones.  You can't dwell on games like that.  You've got to move on. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
MARTY BRODEUR: It's hard.  One day you think you're in full control and the next day it's the end of the world.  You have to really keep your head clear and know that this is playoff hockey and you have to be able to deal with these mood swings as good as you can.  This is the last one.  We won't have to deal with any mood swings after that.  
 
Q.  Did you take yourself out, or did Pat?
 
MARTY BRODEUR: We talked about it.  There was nothing to gain in staying in the net.  I have been playing a lot of games, so we thought it would be good.
