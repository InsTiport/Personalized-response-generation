  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Martin Brodeur.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   It's been good the last two games because we got some results for our efforts.   But these guys are right here.   They're playing well, playing hard, competing at a high level.   There's no letdown to be had for us because it's not going to be easy.   
   
 Q.   What about the fact you've been able to neutralize their offense.   
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Well, we work hard on playing a good defensive game.   We like to have the puck, so that takes away a little bit of the other team's offense.   They're skilled guys.   We have a lot of respect.   We don't want to give them too many options.   
   
 Q.   When you think of what the Flyers did, do you think nowadays the 3‑0 deficit isn't quite what it used to be?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Well, I think hockey's changed in the new era.   I think the way the game is called by the referees, let the guys skate, no redline, really makes it anybody's ballgame.   
When the teams go down in the series, in games, there's time.   There's always time, regardless if you're down 1‑0, 2‑0.   We've done it to ourselves.   Makes it interesting.   I think you have to play 60 minutes of hockey now.   You can't just coast like you used to.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Marty.
