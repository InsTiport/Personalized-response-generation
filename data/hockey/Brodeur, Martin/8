  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Martin Brodeur. 
MARTIN BRODEUR: ‑‑   with the players and him, there's a lot of communication.   That really helps.   Not that we didn't have it before, but we have a coach that's been around for so long.   Sometimes it's a little harder not to break him, but to try to change stuff or talk about stuff.   Now he seems to be more open. 
The players you should ask.   I just try to stop the puck.
