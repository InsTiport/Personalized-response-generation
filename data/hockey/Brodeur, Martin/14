 Q.   Marty, from your vantage point, what did the guys do better on defense for you and offense?   What was different from the first game?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   I think defensively, I thought we battled really hard, our battle level was good.   But I thought we played well in the first game defensively.   We just got a breakdown that they scored on.   Offensively I thought we were able to get shots through to the net and a lot of tips and a lot more puck possession in their zone than maybe Game 1.   Tired them out a little bit more, and that paid off in the end.   
   
 Q.   When Clarkson plays like that, with that kind of energy, what does that add to your team?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Everybody needs to play with a lot of energy, but I think Clarky is a guy that is hard to play against when he strong on the puck, on the boards, and when he gets himself positioned well in front of the net and be able to make some plays around the net.   
I thought he was a pretty dominant player in the offensive zone.   And we need him to be like that a little more.   Every time he scores, it's a game‑winner.   We've just got to score more.  
   
 Q.   How important was Andy Greene's hustle icing late in the third period?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   You know what?   It's part of hockey.   You need to make plays.   Sometimes they're small plays.   Him skating, I think the communication I had with him letting him know that probably the fastest skater on the Rangers side was right on his tail there.   Made a hell of a play.   That became an important play in the game.  
   
 Q.   How big was it to get the tying goal before the end of the second period and to get it from your fourth line?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Well, you know what, it doesn't matter when you get it.   But I think after we surrendered two goals on their power play, I think it was a nice bounce‑back.   
You have hurdles to overcome in the Playoff games and Playoff series, and this one, I think, with the way we played early on and letting go of our lead 1‑0 right away, two power play goals on their side, we needed to bounce back, and we just did that and got contributions‑ you never know where it's going to come from.   
And these guys have been really good for us.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your game?   You made some sensational saves right off the bat in the first.   How do you feel about your game?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   I felt pretty good.   A little tired now.   Kind of overworked myself sometimes for no reason.   It was good.   The guys played well in front of me.   I saw most of the pucks.   But the Rangers came out pretty strong.   They had a lot of shot‑ a lot of crashing the net and being around without touching me they were just around me a lot.  
And it's a tough place to play.   There's so many bad bounces.   The ice is not good, the boards are awful and the glass makes crazy bounces everywhere.   In the second period I think two or three just went right in front of my net.   
So mentally it's a tough game to play because you really have to look at the puck all game long.   
But I feel pretty good whenever I win.   Doesn't matter how I play, I feel good.  
   
 Q.   You've had a good play back and forth going with David Clarkson.   Are you going to give him a pat on the back tonight?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Definitely.   We have a lot of fun with each other.   But I think you have to respect what he does out there.   He plays the game hard.   And for him to be that disciplined, that's even harder, and that's‑ I think that's to his credit.   
   
 Q.   That first goal took the crazy bounce off the boards, went off your gloves?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Went off my pad and my glove.   I kicked it in myself.   I was off balance.   I went in for Staal one time right there, and when it passed me I kind of just reacted, fell on my back.   
I think if I don't fall‑ if I don't kick it in, I think maybe‑ what is his name? ‑ No. 21 there, Stepan, would have put it in anyway.  
   
 Q.   When it happened, was there a moment like a moment of no, this is not going well again, or was it just something you just shook off?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   I don't know about shook it off, but I definitely rolled my eyes.   
   
 Q.   You've seen a lot.   Did you ever see anything that was a penalty box that doesn't open?   And how did it affect the game?   I see you laughing.   
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Yeah, it slowed down a little bit of the game, I think the pace of the game.   
Again, things like that happens.   You can't worry about it too much.   Because it just happened that they scored probably in the next shift after we had the long wait.   
So it's not a fun thing, but it was sort of both teams.  
   
 Q.   Savor the atmosphere for this Playoff game and beating that team in this building, what does it mean to you?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   It's a lot of fun.   I said it after the game, Game 1.   It's a great place to play Playoff hockey, great place to play hockey.   
But I think the atmosphere I think for us to go in and be able to pull the one game out of this building, we have to be really proud of ourselves.   They're a hell of a team.   They're hard to play against in their own building.   And we just gotta take this momentum into our own building now and make our building a tough place for them to play also.  
   
 Q.   What about winning on the road against Philadelphia?   You won a lot of games on the road.   
MARTIN BRODEUR:   We have no choice.   We start every series on the road.   If we don't win on the road, we're in trouble.   
I think we have to really play a patient game, play our type of game.   Grinding it out and put our head down regardless of what happens, bounce here, bounce there, we have to be strong mentally.   That's what makes you win in the Playoffs on the road.  
   
 Q.   One guy, unsung hero, could you talk about game in and game out Bryce Salvador, just the delivery?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Bryce has been good.   He's been our shutdown defensiveman most of the year.   He's been healthy, knock on wood, but he plays critical minutes against critical players.   And along with Volchy and a couple of the other guys, they're important, they're guys that take care of themselves really good and they care about the game and they prepare themselves as well as anybody I've seen since I've played the game, and no wonder they're having success in the Playoffs.  
   
 Q.   Can you just describe that save you made on Gaborik, where it looked like you sort of dove forward, your leg kicked up, how did that play unfold?  
MARTIN BRODEUR:   Too bad they scored right after.   But, you know, I wanted to surprise him.   But I didn't really‑ I didn't surprise him at all.   He kind of looked at me and stopped and I saw him flip the puck and I kind of kicked my leg back.   I know I hit it, but I didn't know where the puck ended up.   I stayed on my belly for a while just kind of looking for it.   Just the reaction, got a little lucky with that.   
Like I said, it would have been nice to be able to make that save and be able to recover from it, but they scored, so it doesn't really matter if I saved it or not.
