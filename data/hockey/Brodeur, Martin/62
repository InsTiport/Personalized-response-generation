 MIKE MODANO: I think in the last -- our two home games we had here were real tough, 3
and 4 - a pivotal point of the series, we fought back. Played a great team. Brodeur was
magnificent again. Both goalies were outstanding. My hats offer to them. Great thing we
accomplished. I know Gomez, Arnott how they are feeling. It is a great feeling. 
 
Q. Energy level and emotional tank getting empty playing so much?
 
 MIKE MODANO: You get to this point, I think there is really no emptiness in the tank.
Some nights you feel like you are running on fumes, but it is a great thing we have
accomplished here the last three, four years and the fans have been great. 
 
Q. Second time you have won the Stanley Cup. You must be elated.
 
 MARTIN BRODEUR: This is an unbelievable feeling. This time around, I think I realize it
a little bit more. What an effort. These guys played hard. It was really hard. We are on
the good side of it. 
 
Q. I noticed you did find where your wife and kids were sitting?
 
 MARTIN BRODEUR: I was looking for them. I couldn't find them. Finally I was: They are
up there and I am really happy that all my kids are here to see that.
