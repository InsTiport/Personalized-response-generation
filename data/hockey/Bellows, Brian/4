BRIAN BELLOWS:  It is a tough loss.  The team is going to have to rebound.  Throughout the Playoffs, I think, we showed a good tenacity.  I thought we played well tonight but in the third period we gave up to many chances, too many opportunities.  Maybe we just didn't, you know, just didn't execute the last ten minutes.  Hard to believe we gave up two, 2-goal leads like that.


Q.  Tough to pick a spot in the game when Olie faced 60 shots on goal and the other side -- (inaudible) --

BRIAN BELLOWS:  That could have been a 3 goal difference, eight, nine minutes to go.  After Juneau made it 4-2, I think there was like eight and a half minutes left, 9 minutes.  At the time it just got a little hard around the boards, can chip it out, it was so unlike our team, you know, to be in that situation where we would give up a 2-goal lead.  Give Detroit a lot of credit.  They battled and they battled hard.


Q.  Last 24 hours for you got to be the biggest set of mixed emotions you could ever imagine?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  Definitely been, you know, down and really up and this is definitely a downer this game, I really thought this team, we were going to pull it through the way we got up there in the second period, even the third and we came back after Yzerman scored and it is a frustrating loss, but this team isn't going to go up.


Q.  How is everybody at home?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  Everyone is doing good.
