BRIAN BELLOWS:  They know what it's like to lose it, they know what it's like to win it, and they know the difference and they have pride in that difference out there.


Q.  At this moment, is it difficult to look back on a year that was awfully good for this Capitals team and think about some of the positives that came out of it?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  You always think of the positives.  In the short time I was here, I've seen a lot of growth, but at the same time, we lost.  It's -- They don't give a lot of awards for second place in pro sports and that's what you remember.  Their superstars played rugged; they played tough.  You know, Yzerman, Fedorov,  they play within the system.  They don't think they're above anyone else.  You know, everyone back-checks; everyone does what's expected of them.  They have such a pride in the way they play that it would be unfathomable for one of the guys to play his own way and not give 110 percent.  I think they all feel responsible to each other and that's a big difference.


Q.  You got the tie goal in Game Three and thought that was a momentum changer for this team.  You get another big one tonight.  Did you think that's what might have been --

BRIAN BELLOWS:  I thought it would have been a catalyst and, 20 seconds later, I actually had a puck going under the bar and then I hit him in the head as he ducked to get out of the way.  So that could have been the difference.  But it's been a game of inches in some ways, but those inches turn into miles once you end up losing.  I thought we had them, but it just kind of wasn't there.
