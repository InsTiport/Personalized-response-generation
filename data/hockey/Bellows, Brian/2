BRIAN BELLOWS:  One goal away each game.  Play better each period, get in the game and we've just got to concentrate -- I know it sounds very simple, like a lot of cliches -- but just get that first period out of the way and keep going.  You know what?  It's not so much the effort.  I think we're working hard. Sometimes you have to work a little smarter and maybe it's -- you know, let's forget about being so nervous and maybe sometimes I think we're respecting them too much.  We need to just go out there and play hockey against them like we did in the second game.


Q.  I want to ask you about respect on the other side of this.  Do you guys feel like having to win Game Four would get some respect for you from this Red Wings team?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  I think we already have it because, let's face it, we've taken them down to the wire a couple of times and that makes a big difference.  Last two games they had to come back for  the second game, they had to come back and beat us and the last game we ended up tying out and they still had to overcome us.  So they know it's very close.


Q.  First period seems to be the period that's most difficult for this time.  How do you change things around for Game Four in that first period?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  I think we need to -- we've talked about it -- we have to play a little simpler.  I think we're come in prepared to work, but sometimes being a little too fancy.  We need to take a page from them.  Even their superstars are getting the puck in deep and forechecking hard, and we need to do the same thing.


Q.  Here it is, you're down 3-nothing coming into a big Game Four.  Yet you're able to have some fun out there in practice, kind of getting on Tik a little bit with that little drill.  What was that about?

BRIAN BELLOWS:  Like I said earlier, Ron will explain that one, not me.
