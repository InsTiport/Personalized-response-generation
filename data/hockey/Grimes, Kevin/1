For sure.  I mean I was rated 34th.  I didn't really expect to get picked much higher.  So I -- but I was sweating, though. 
 
To tell you the truth, I don't know really.  It is not something that I think about an awful lot. Just an honor to be here right now. 
 
No, I didn't really have a preference at all.  I had no indication of where I was going to go.  But, I definitely wasn't going to be picky. 
 
Pleasant surprise. 
 
I think my family is still a little stunned.  So am I right now.  I guess it was just a surprise to everybody. 
 
Yeah, I met with Colorado about a month ago, probably.  And I had a really good interview with them. But, there was no indication at that time how high on their list I was. 
 
I think so.  They are a hard working team and I am a hard working player.  And, I think it is a very good fit.
