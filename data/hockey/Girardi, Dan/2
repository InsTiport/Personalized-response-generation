 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: Well, obviously we're not happy how the first two games turned out, but it's the first of four, not two.  So all we have to do is go in there tomorrow, win one game and go from there.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: Well, obviously, both those circumstances there are pretty deflating plays.  The 2-2 game, they've got a couple last minute.  We go up two to go into the third.  That's obviously tough.  We're not going to be very excited going into the third period.  But, you know, two down going into the third in the playoffs, it's pretty tough to come back.   
But I think we need to do a better job of not getting in that situation, not letting two games in a row, 7, 8 seconds left on the power play and they get one.  Those are something we can definitely control ourselves.   
 Q.  You guys played (indiscernible).  
DAN GIRARDI: Well, I think if I knew, we wouldn't be down two.  But I think this is a really good team.  They have a lot of speed.  They clog it up in their G zone, and we're not getting a lot of really quality looks all the time.  It's something different we've faced in the last two teams.  We'll have to go today, make some adjustments and have a good start tomorrow.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: I guess you could look at that.  But Conference Finals, everything's a lot different.  Like I said, we don't want to look too far ahead here.  We want to see what we did that was right in the game and just do more of that.  So it doesn't really matter what happens at the start of the game.  We have to play the same way throughout the whole 60 minutes and opportunities throughout the game.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: I don't know.  I went to sleep last night and got up and came here, So I really haven't looked at anything yet.  But I'm sure we'll go over something later on today and have a good meeting and discuss some things.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: Well, he's a Vezina finalist for a reason.  We're not doing the best job in front of him as we have been the last two series.  There is a lot on us to help him out back there.  It's not him at all.  I think it's just how we are defending in front of him.  They're getting a lot of grade A looks and a lot of odd-man rushes.  He can't save them all.  We need to be there for him for sure.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: I think any goalie puts pressure on themselves that they're stopping the puck to help their team win.  Like I said, we have to do a better job in front of him to make his job easier.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: I think it starts with our forecheck.  They're coming out pretty clean with a lot of speed.  That's hard for us.   
The forwards need to gap up and take the time and space away.  We have to figure out how to forecheck, how to stop their breakouts being so clean, and everything all coming into place from there.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: Like I said.  I really can't right now.  It's been great for us the first two rounds, and I'm not sure why we haven't just played the 200-foot game.  Simple, get pucks deep and do what we've been doing.   
But that's something we need to definitely figure out why.  Maybe we'll talk later and I'll let you know how it goes.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible)?  
DAN GIRARDI: Well, it has to be.  That's what we need to do to be successful in this series.  Maybe it is.  Not being at home, we'll keep it a little more simple for Game 3 here.  Doesn't matter where we play.  We have to play with the same game plan.  We just want to get on the plane here, have a good flight, have a good meeting, and feel good about ourselves going into Game 3.
