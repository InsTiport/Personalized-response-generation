    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Problem with Bolland and Richards?
    COACH SUTTER:   Couldn't see anything, so... 
    Clearly behind the net, behind the goalie.   Guys changing.   Really couldn't see it. 

Q.   How did you react being out‑shot 17‑2 in the first period, but having the lead. 
    COACH SUTTER:   Fortunate.   How do I react?   Just like normal.   You should say, How do you feel (laughter)? 

Q.   How did you feel after that? 
    COACH SUTTER:   Fortunate (laughter). 

Q.   Did you ever think you were able to get to your style today? 
    COACH SUTTER:   I thought we were making progress as we went along.   We had guys fall off.   Shifts fell off primarily from the top end of our lineup. 
    It's tough to sustain it. 

Q.   You did change lines a bit in the third period.   Last series you talked about the left side, wanting that a bit more.   Is that it again?
    COACH SUTTER:   I didn't look at it like that.   It was more the way our lines are set up, the way some of our top guys were playing.   Having trouble keeping up. 

Q.   How did you think Jarret Stoll looked today? 
    COACH SUTTER:   I think what I said this morning, it's not just putting Jarret Stoll in the lineup.   Jarret Stoll has to give us a quality performance in terms of what his role is on our team. 
    I think it showed that he'd been out for a couple weeks. 

Q.   Having the lead on the road, does it feel like one got away? 
    COACH SUTTER:   You know what, if we could have tied it up late, similar to other road games we played, quite honest, it's another 2‑1 game. 

Q.   Any word on how Mike Richards is?   Was he okay after the game?
    COACH SUTTER:   I seen him arguing with the ref.   I think I answered it once. 

Q.   Their better players outplayed your better players? 
    COACH SUTTER:   I think the two guys that scored for them are going to score goals.   We have guys that have to score goals.   That's how close it will be. 
    Thank you.
