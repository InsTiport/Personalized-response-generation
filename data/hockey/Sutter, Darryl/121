 Q. Is Matthew Lombardi good to go? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  He didn't skate again today. 
 Q.  Did not? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  No.  So we're still hoping. 
 Q.  Are there guys you didn't have the last round you expect you can have back in this one? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  Simon, some point.  That's probably it. 
 Q.  Robyn Regehr, talk about the amount of responsibility he's been taking on in the playoffs, I guess all season. 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  Well, I think he's played -- not I think, I know he's played more minutes because of the injuries.  Once Gauthier went down, Lydman, it falls on your more experienced guys. 
 He's done a great job of it, playing the minutes he's had in all situations, playing against -- you know, he's done a good job against top players. 
 Q.  Could you speak about Stuart and Marleau's contributions in helping San Jose get things going this year? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  Well, I don't think it get things going this year.  I mean, Patrick scored 28 goals this year, scored 28 goals last year. 
 Q.  I mean for the Sharks. 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  Brad Stuart missed most of last year with a concussion, hold-out and then concussion. 
 You can basically write last year off for him.
