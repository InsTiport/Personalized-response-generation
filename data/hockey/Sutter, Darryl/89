  Q.  Can you update us at all on the stat of Robyn Regehr?   
 DARRYL SUTTER: He probably won't play.   
  Q.  How about Shean Donovan as well?   
 DARRYL SUTTER: Probably won't play.   
  Q.  Your team has been sort of the sum-of-the-parts team all Playoffs; Regehr is a major part.  Do you feel you can compensate the way you have done so many times?   
 DARRYL SUTTER: Yes.   
  Q.  You said at the start of the series that you felt the longer it went the more you guys had the advantage.  Do you see it now having played out that way in terms of being able to wear them down, the fatigue factor, that type of thing?   
 DARRYL SUTTER: I don't think there's a fatigue factor.   
  Q.  The one nice thing about Game 7 of the Final is that this morning you know it's your last practice.  You know this is the last date of the season.  Is there any feeling in you right now before Game 7 about how you feel about this group knowing that this group won't be together as this, it will be different?   
 DARRYL SUTTER: I don't think you can get too melancholy about it.  But at the same time I think it's our 108th game.  So we kind of are proud of our players for that.
