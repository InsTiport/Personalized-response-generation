THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Kopitar said that big save Jonathan Quick made on that two‑on‑one was the turning point for your team.   Do you agree with him even more so than when they scored the first goal?
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, I don't think there's necessarily one turning point.   I think killing five‑on‑three in the first, not going away when the score is 2‑0, scoring a goal late in the second, scoring a goal early in the third. 

Q.   Your power play finally came through.   They've been really good on the penalty kill.   You make a couple of adjustments in the third?
COACH SUTTER:   No, our power play was really good last game, too.   It's been really good the whole playoffs. 
Just wanted to get more at the net tonight and we were able to do that. 

Q.   Drew Doughty was saying he can tell you're not happy with them if you don't say much of anything during intermission.   What was your message going into the third?
COACH SUTTER:   Into the third?   Well, at some point they're going to lose a game at home.   They're not going to win every one. 
We probably played better last night.   The only difference between tonight and last night was not goals‑for, it was goals‑against.   Give up three against them, you're in trouble. 

Q.   I think it was this morning someone asked you about Jeff Carter and the two kids.   You said they haven't played together too much.   They played together in the third period. 
COACH SUTTER:   Scored a big power play goal right away.   Then the line scored two goals, then empty netter. 
Thank you.   See you in Los Angeles.
