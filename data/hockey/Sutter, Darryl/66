THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   Your thoughts on special teams play tonight. 
COACH SUTTER:   Penalty killing.   It was a huge factor.   Obviously the five‑on‑three.   Then three after that again. 
It's hard to believe, actually, for a team that has drawn the most penalties so far in the playoffs and per game has taken the fewest.   We've had a grand total of four in three games now. 

Q.   Could you touch upon the performance of guys like Matt Greene and Willie Mitchell, Scuderi, what those guys add to the whole mix back there. 
COACH SUTTER:   Well, they're a huge part of our penalty killing and they're the veteran guys in the back end.   They give us that stability.   You know what you're getting all the time. 

Q.   After that win, your team still remained extremely composed.   Very businesslike.   Do you credit their maturity to that?
COACH SUTTER:   After the game? 

Q.   Yes. 
COACH SUTTER:   I think that's a credit to the players and the leadership that they have. 

Q.   The goalie you have has got an incredible level head on him.   Talk about his composure. 
COACH SUTTER:   You need outstanding goaltending to win playoff games.   He's given us that. 

Q.   Basically what do you credit the win to?
COACH SUTTER:   Penalty killing.   Our ability to stay with it.   As I said, it's not easy when you've had that many penalties called against you. 
It's hard on your team because there's guys that don't play when they're killing and there's guys that probably play too much. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
