THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How soon before the game did you have to make the decision on Mike after warmup?
COACH SUTTER:   Right after warmup.   He was fine today, then I think just once his blood got pumping tonight, the adrenaline got going, there were symptoms.   I went in right after warmup, he was sitting there and I said, Unless you're 100%, you're not playing. 

Q.   How big a hole does that put in your lineup?
COACH SUTTER:   Quite honestly, knew he wasn't playing.   I said, Jeff, you're playing center.   Tyler, you go up and play right wing.   Really didn't affect that line at all. 
Obviously, it's a big hole.   Same thing we talked about last year.   Different spot in the center.   At the same time I thought we handled that part really well. 

Q.   Do you have any expectations about whether he could come back?
COACH SUTTER:   I don't really know.   Literally I talked to him for a minute before the game.   I didn't feel, and he didn't feel, he should play either. 

Q.   Robyn had to get stitched up as well?
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah. 

Q.   What part of the game didn't your team handle well?
COACH SUTTER:   I thought we played all right.   You know what, we gave them some wide‑open opportunities that they scored on.   One is a forecheck right away early in the game.   We didn't make the play in the wall we could have made.   Then the goal at the end of the first was a read play. 

Q.   Was that a mercy hook for Jonathan or do you feel there were things he wasn't doing?
COACH SUTTER:   No, no, I think we play five games in the next 10 days. 

Q.   How much do you think the back‑to‑back games affected Quick, or did it?
COACH SUTTER:   I don't think at all.   I think it's no different than it would affect him than any other player.   I don't think that should be an issue. 
Quite honestly, I didn't notice that as an issue for either team, back‑to‑back.
