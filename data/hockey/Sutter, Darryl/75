  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   The whole power play question.   It only comes to the forefront after you lose a game.   Your thoughts.   
COACH SUTTER:   You know what, I take the high road there.   It's won us a game.   We've scored two goals and they scored one.   You have to start fresh all the time with it.   
We're getting looks, we're getting zone time, you just have to get the screen or the tip for the rebound goal out of it.   
   
 Q.   Everything kind of slows down on the power play when the playoffs start.   
COACH SUTTER:   Again, it's a positive thing.   Teams that draw the most penalties.   Everybody looks at percentages instead of actual big goals.   Teams that are still playing draw penalties.   
   
 Q.   Darryl, can you talk a little bit about this team's road play, the fact that you seem to be so comfortable on the road.   
COACH SUTTER:   You know what, we've had to be.   That's a fact.   You're not a home‑ice team, you've got to be.   When you're a team that doesn't score many goals, you've got to be.   You've got to manufacture and find different ways to do it.   
We found it.   I know what the talk is, because of our road record.   When you look at all the different ways the team's won, it's won by your goalie being great, or your power play, or the other team taking a bad penalty, your penalty killing, overtime.   There's so many different ways to it.   It's not just, That's how you did it, that's how you do it.   There's so many different ways of doing it.   
The biggest thing we do is, win or lose, try and play the same way.   That's the most important thing.   
   
 Q.   Darryl, do you understand as a coach and perhaps as a former player, in a game such at Sunday's, when your team gives the appearance of perhaps not needing or wanting it as badly as the other club, is that where the old clichÃ© of the fourth game being the hardest to win?  
COACH SUTTER:   I said it after the last game, we said it publicly in the first series.   We lost the game.   You do lose games, right?   A lot of times you play really well and lose.   
I didn't have any problem with the way we played on Sunday, to be quite honest.   You know what, it's what I said.   We didn't score.   That was the problem.   They scored a rim goal.   A lot of guys thought it was icing.   One second letup cost us.   That's the way it works.   It wasn't that big a deal.   
   
 Q.   Darryl, on that play, was it just a miscommunication between Doughty and Quick?   Once Quick leaves his crease...   
COACH SUTTER:   You look at it, the linesman, where the puck went in, were really close together.   Johnson didn't know it was icing, right?   The linesman couldn't wave it off.   They weren't going to call it icing, right, just because of the position they were in.   Then they waved it off.   He never did see them wave it off.   He didn't know.   Just went out to play it.   Under pressure, you know what you do when you're under pressure as a goalie, you rimmed it.   
   
 Q.   I choked (laughter).   
COACH SUTTER:   No, you rim it.   Robby drew that up.   Jarret let up, Whitney comes down the wall.   Really it's a five‑on‑five play.   It's not a power play goal.   Shane comes out of the corner, power move.   You know what, Robby is not there.   He's just there in coverage.   
   
 Q.   That being said, how important is scoring that first goal?   
COACH SUTTER:   Doesn't matter whether it's playoffs or regular season in the NHL, the league is about the first goal, how difficult it is.   You know what, when you get veteran coaches, experienced coaching staffs, teams that played together and are still playing, what they've done really well is not protect the lead but play with leads.   That's why they're still playing.   
So it's important.   Our teams are teams that score a lot of goals.   They're close games.   So the first goal is important.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
