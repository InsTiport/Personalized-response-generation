THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   It was like an eight‑minute stretch in the first overtime between whistles.   From the bench, what was that sensation like?
COACH SUTTER:   Changes in, trying to get your shifts in.   Overtime is not a real timeout unless there's a stoppage of play at the 10‑minute mark. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Not really.   It's a tough building.   Damn near got it. 

Q.   Any big adjustments next game? 
COACH SUTTER:   You're a little premature in that (smiling). 

Q.   When is the last time you saw an overtime with that much pace, basically no stoppages?
COACH SUTTER:   Well, probably every one we've had.   How many have we played this year? 
Two good teams.   Not going to slow down in overtime. 
Thanks.
