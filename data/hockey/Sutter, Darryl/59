THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel any extra pressure to win it at home in Game 6?  
COACH SUTTER:   No.   I still think we'll digest tonight and travel.   Expect it to be another game like tonight.   
   
 Q.   Is there much more your team could have done against a goalie who was that hot at the other end?  
COACH SUTTER:   Well, he's played well, very well, the last two nights.   You know, we're probably saying what they said Games 1 and 2, where we got breaks and now they did.   That's how even it is.   We hit a couple posts again tonight, and you hope one goes off the post and in.   
   
 Q.   You've talked about how close it is, a real margin for error.   Talk about that in relation to tonight's game.   
COACH SUTTER:   That's pretty much it.   
I think if there's anything, you got to finish your opportunities.   You got to work to get 'em, you pretty much have to not give up more than one.   
   
 Q.   Your team talked about how important the first shifts were.   Seems like you started very well out there.   
COACH SUTTER:   I thought we had a really good first period, no question.   They scored a goal on the offensive zone.   Marginal call with a puck that was not in danger, right?   Other than that, we had a heck of a first period.   
   
 Q.   You were asked after the last game where you thought the pressure was.   Where do you think the pressure is right now?  
COACH SUTTER:   I'd say I'm not sure what you mean there.   Are you cheering for the Devils or for the Kings?   So you're cheering for the Devils.   
I'm going to say the pressure's on them because they're the home team and they had a hundred‑some points, okay?   
   
 Q.   Do you feel it's natural over the course of a playoff season you're going to have to at some point face a long series?  
COACH SUTTER:   I think that's why they have seven‑game series, unless they change it to five or something.   We don't know about next year in the new agreement.   
Long series, that's why they call it four out of seven.   
   
 Q.   You talked about finishing, how important it is to finish your opportunities.   Seems like it's gone back and forth in this series.   
COACH SUTTER:   The only way to really look at it in the series is the first goal.   Whoever scores the first goal, that's the way it's been.   We scored the first goal in the first three.   That tells you just really how close it is.   
   
 Q.   What was your view of the Salvador goal?   Freak goal?  
COACH SUTTER:   I think it was a screen.   Didn't see it.   You want your winger to go through the shot and through the point.   Starts on the other side of the ice.   Really a soft wrister from the right side.   We didn't get one forward off on a change.   He was tired.   I'm sure if Jonathan would have known that, he would have got a whistle.   Puck comes around this side, winger's got to go through the shot.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
