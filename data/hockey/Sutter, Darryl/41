 Q.   Was that the difference?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   Yeah, it was tough chasing the lead.   Trouble scoring goals.   We had it for quite some time though.   One goalie just started right there with one goalie, it's tough coming back from two.   He played a strong game.   But we've had trouble scoring.  
   
 Q.   Are there a couple of key reasons you're not scoring on the power play as well?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   I think that manifests from your whole game.   I think when you have good opportunities and don't score, you've just got to finish those opportunities.  
   
 Q.   Now that you're 19 points behind the Ducks, how are you feeling about your pursuit of them and what do you need to do to bridge that gap?   Can you bridge it?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   You're going to think you're going to close out.   It's hockey.  
   
 Q.   Did you take an opportunity to coach a game here for two points?   Did you take an opportunity to look around?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   Yeah, more during warm‑up.   It was unbelievable from where we stood to be able to look out and see everything.   We basically started in left field and went all the way around.   It was an incredible experience to see all of that.  
   
 Q.   How was the ice by the third period?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   The ice was all right.   I mean you guys or anybody that's watched hockey that would see a lot of jumping pucks and boards and pucks along the boards and things like that.   So it was all right.   You know what, they did as good as they could, and it certainly wasn't an issue.  
   
 Q.   How do you think the players responded to that environment?   Was the focus there?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   Pardon?   
   
 Q.   Was the players' focus there considering all the distractions and the environment going on?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   I think it was good.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone).  
DARRYL SUTTER:   We switched centermen up, not a whole lot.   I thought Kopitar had a really strong game.   I thought Jeff had a strong game.   Those are guys you count on for the offensive side of it.   At the same time you need it throughout your lineup.   That's when you see switching and lines.   That's probably right because I think the energy and all of that was there in the first period, and then I think the schedule got us a little in the second to see that, then the determination of the group in the third, they bring it on again.   It was just tough scoring.  
   
 Q.   You know the character of your guys.   How are they going to respond to this losing streak and heading into a toughschedule?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   It's a tough schedule.   We really didn't come home.   We came and played here, and then we go back out, so it's a tough schedule.   We're going to go through it.   It's been a tough month.  
   
 Q.   Coach, yesterday when we interviewed some of the players on both sides they said it's going to be a really physical game today.   Did you think it was physical enough?   Did you think your players were physical enough?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   Yeah, I didn't think that was a problem at all.   It's not like they're running around trying to hit guys.   That's not what physical means.  
   
 Q.   You see the way they score their goals and they go right to the net early in the game.   
DARRYL SUTTER:   We spent a lot of time in front of their net of their goalie.  
   
 Q.   As the game wore on?   
DARRYL SUTTER:   Yeah, I think we had‑‑ if you just go on shot and quality, I think we had better.
