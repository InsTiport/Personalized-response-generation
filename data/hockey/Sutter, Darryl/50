THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Justin Williams tonight seemed like a man that did not want to end the series. 
COACH SUTTER:   He was really good.   He's a veteran guy.   Back‑to‑back, good last game, too.   Probably didn't get noticed as much because everybody was talking about Mike.   But he was really good.   The line was really good again. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Well, we're not a slow team.   I don't know what it is.   We're coming off a really good game.   We just had another one. 

Q.   Chicago gets a late second‑period goal, but it looks like the Kings are able to go out there... 
COACH SUTTER:   The faceoff goal we won the faceoff on, we have to defend it better. 

Q.   The third period, how the Kings were able to continue playing their game. 
COACH SUTTER:   They're going to come on.   Chicago is the best team in the league.   We're just trying to make sure they don't win easy. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Just to get a better matchup at home.   Willie has been really good offense.   Just thought it was better to put Kopy there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, I thought we did a good job.   That's obviously a factor.   I mean, it's tough to limit their opportunities because of the high‑end guys that they have.   Their big, strong line.   They have two guys coming at you in the next line that are so skilled. 
I said it before Game1, I said it after Game1 and before Game2, you have to manage the puck really well.   You have to about play a perfect game to beat them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Didn't have much work tonight.   Hopefully he's even better the next night. 

Q.   Any specific message that you gave to the club before tonight's game so all the energy seemed to kick in instantly?
COACH SUTTER:   No, it didn't kick in instantly.   We're playing three and four.   I don't think the other team is really playing on a full tank. 

Q.   Players were saying after the game that working hard, you make your breaks, opportunities.   Voynov goal, a broken stick. 
COACH SUTTER:   I think we had several opportunities before that that didn't go in. 
You just got to continue.   That is our mindset.   That's why we're able to stay in games.   It's not like we're going to drift away from it.   We're going to try to stay with it. 
Quite honestly, they had the same about five feet in the very first shift of the game.   They could have scored.   Could have been 1‑0.   Not much separation there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   I didn't think it was a four‑minute penalty.   Thought it was a wrong call. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Retaliation.   That's three head injuries now in the playoffs for us.   I don't know how to answer it.   It's retaliation with a stick.   It's not a high stick.   Whatever they want to call it, they'll call it.   Don't even need video.
