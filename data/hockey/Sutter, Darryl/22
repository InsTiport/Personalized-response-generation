  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   You said a few days ago you were always aware of Kane; he's such a dangerous player.   What was he able to do in Game5 that he wasn't in previous games?  
COACH SUTTER:   He had the puck a lot more, which is a little bit related to special teams and a lot related to overtime.   
But he's a special player.   He doesn't have bad games.   He has good games or great games.   Had three or four points, I think, so...   Great players are going to do that.   
   
 Q.   A lot of your players were quoted as saying that they didn't want to get into a track meet style with the Blackhawks; that's not the way you guys are most effective.   Is that something you agree with and would you like to see more of a possession game?  
COACH SUTTER:   Well, both teams are fast team.   So possession is usually in the transition part of the game where the defensemen get the puck out to the forwards.   
Obviously there's been times where we've been better than them, and there's been times when they've been better than us.   
I don't think it's necessarily a track meet.   But I think both teams have enough top guys that when they get it, they can make it look like a track meet.   I think that's why when we talked about Drew or Duncan, those guys make that sort of game happen.
