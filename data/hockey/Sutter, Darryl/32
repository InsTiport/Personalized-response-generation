Los Angeles   4
  Chicago   3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Second and third period in a row you dominated.   What's the difference in the final 20 minutes?
COACH SUTTER:   I don't think it was dominated.   I mean, we out‑scored them. 

Q.   You got a great response after giving up the shorthanded goal.   Was that a big moment for the team?
COACH SUTTER:   Well, we gave up the shorthander right off the faceoff.   It wasn't like we were going to go away or we were tired, the power play or anything.

Q.   What do you see from the Carter line that's working so well?
COACH SUTTER:   Had some really good momentum shifts for us during the game. 

Q.   What was the key to your penalty killing success tonight?
COACH SUTTER:   Well, we had to kill three in the second.   Basically two sticks follow down in the offensive zone.   Tanner accidental.   Willie accidental.   It's to kill those three. 

Q.   Chicago's penalty killing was first in the league in the first two rounds.   You've managed to solve that just keeping it simple?
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, we use lots of different guys, use different looks, make sure that you're not passing the puck into the net.   You're shooting it in there. 
Sounds sort of silly, but screen tips rebounds are still the best way to score goals. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH SUTTER:   Was it our last power play goal?   Basically, it's coming out of the box.   Same thing:   guys pounding the pucks. 

Q.   Is there any pattern to your offense that's causing it to all of a sudden be able to score a pile of goals?
COACH SUTTER:   Well, we scored just over three a game the whole playoffs.   Since the Olympic break, I think, you know, probably getting Gabby coming here makes a difference because it spreads it around.   I don't think it's one thing in particular.   I don't think it's a one‑line deal. 
Kopitar's line didn't score a goal.   Got to spread it around.   Wasn't a problem for us in the 48 games and last year's playoffs.   It got to be made an issue, which wasn't something I was ever really worried about this year.
