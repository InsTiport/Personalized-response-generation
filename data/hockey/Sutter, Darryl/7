THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel about your team's performance?   Vigneault said it was the best he's seen your club.   
COACH SUTTER:   It was a good hockey game.   I thought both teams played really well.   
   
 Q.   Can you ever recall a game, as a player or a coach, where the puck stopped on the line twice?  
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, probably I recall several times it did.   
It did tonight.   
   
 Q.   We use the term 'momentum' all the time.   In your mind is there such a thing?  
COACH SUTTER:   No, I don't think so.   The question has been asked 20‑some times in the playoffs already.   There's momentum during games, but I don't think there's much that goes any further than that.   
   
 Q.   The pressure that you put on Lundqvist, you have to be satisfied with that.   Is that something that's definitely going to be carrying over into the next game?  
COACH SUTTER:   We had a lot of good opportunities.   But you got to finish.   Only going to get a handful most nights against the New York Rangers.   You got to finish a couple of them.  
   
 Q.   How about the opportunity to do it on your home ice in front of those fans that have been unbelievable for you?  
COACH SUTTER:   Try to win a game.   We played in front of some unbelievable fans tonight, too.   We were trying to win tonight, too.   I don't think you look any further than that.
