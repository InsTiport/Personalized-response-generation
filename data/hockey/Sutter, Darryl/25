  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Darryl, talking with the Blackhawks, I asked them a question about who is the pressure on, you or them.   How do you feel about that?
COACH SUTTER:   I think both teams are probably used to pressure.   That's how you get to the hundred‑game mark or close to hundred‑game mark.   It's what your players want and obviously what they thrive on.   I don't think it's more on one team or the other. 

Q.   Is Robyn close to being ready to play, in the vicinity?
COACH SUTTER:   I couldn't answer that.   I'm not a doctor.
