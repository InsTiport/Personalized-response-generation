 Q.   Darryl, just before we get to the game, just some thoughts on the conditions of the ice, and the atmosphere?   
COACH SUTTER:   I thought it was really, really good.   Like really fortunate.   For our organization to be able to say we did it two years in a row and two totally different venues.   But I think everybody involved did a really great job.   It's hard to have great ice because it was so humid as the game went on.   But I think they were doing everything they could to get snow off I think they got their money's worth.  
   
 Q.   On the subject of the ice, would you like to see these games maybe happen a little earlier in the season so there is not so much on the line when you're playing them on the tricky ice?   
COACH SUTTER:   It's two points on the line every night.   Not that there is more on the line now than there is any other division game.   This is a division game.   It's a division rival.   It's a road game for us.   I don't think earlier in the season would say anything for the importance of the game.  
   
 Q.   Is it different obviously because it's not the same place?   Do you feel your players had any kind of an upper hand just playing in a stadium series at Dodger Stadium last season?   
COACH SUTTER:   No, I don't think so.   I think that first off, it's not easy to play in these games.   There is a lot of‑‑ it's a totally different process for players in terms of preparation and especially with playing them in the fair weather part of it because you're practicing the night before where their routine is usually early the day before or mid afternoon and game day.   
So you've got to give‑‑ there is no advantage to anybody, I think.   It's a routine that I'm sure if you talked to the Sharks, they'd say they'd love to do it again, and I'm sure that's what the Kings would say too.  
   
 Q.   Darryl, considering you guys were down in the standings two weeks ago and now won 7 in a row in a playoff position today, do you put significance on that, even though you still have 24 games to go?   
COACH SUTTER:   It's a road game and it's a division game.   If you look at our schedule, we have a two‑game trip for us, and we have 14 road games and 12 division games so I wouldn't put too much emphasis on where we are right now.   In fact, I'm going to put money on it that we have more points this year at this time than we did last year after this.  
   
 Q.   What happened after the first period?   It seemed momentum upshifted?  
COACH SUTTER:   They're two very even teams.   To think that one team could dominate the other.   I think both teams have shown that over of the course of the season.  
   
 Q.   This winning streak, has it been significant?   
COACH SUTTER:   I think since the break, our penalty kill has been better.   But at the same time if you look at it, and it's probably going on around the league because there is more of a playoff atmosphere just wait for your penalties.   We've only had to kill two or three a game, and that is the big difference.   
What was it tonight?   3‑2 again.   It's been every game like 1, 2 or 3, and that's closer to what the playoffs are like, and that's probably tells you something about the balance in the league and where we are after coming out of an All‑Star break and so many teams are fighting for playoff spots.  
   
 Q.   In general, after coaching these two outdoor games, in your opinion are the whole conditions tougher on the skaters?   
COACH SUTTER:   It's a different condition.   It's a different atmosphere.   Just the feel of it is different.   Just being outdoors and how big it is.   It's hard for them all, but I'm sure that it's fun for them too.  
   
 Q.   Coach, your fourth line at one point seemed to get the Sharks top line.   What did you see from your fourth line tonight?   
COACH SUTTER:   The fourth line for playoff teams to be a playoff team, your so‑called fourth line has to be able to play minutes on the road.   If they can't, then you can't play them.   If they're only five or six or seven‑minute players, then you're not a playoff team.  
   
 Q.   This kind of game is fun for the players, but it also takes them a little bit out of their comfort zone, so how do you prepare for them that?   
COACH SUTTER:   Obviously, our schedule coming in here is we came in yesterday afternoon and had the practice last night, so that is different.   And you don't practice on their normal routine, so we don't have much problem with our team in terms of comfort zone.   We play as well as we can every night.   Doesn't always result in wins.   
So our focus coming in today was there was a big division game and it was a road game.   If you take any other approach, over the long haul you're not going to get the result you want.  
   
 Q.   It was certainly important you guys won the game.   Was there anything you took away from last year's Stadium Series in that your team played in the outdoor game last year as well?   
COACH SUTTER:   We didn't score a goal in the outdoor game last year.
