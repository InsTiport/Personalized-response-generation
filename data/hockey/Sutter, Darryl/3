  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   Darryl, you guys played so well last game and you don't get the win.   Is the mentality going into this game to show up and play the same way or find another level?
COACH SUTTER:   Find different ways every game.   I don't think last game will have any bearing on this game, as Game1 would be on Game2 or 2 on 3. 

Q.   You said earlier in the series that Anze Kopitar never has a bad game.   Has he always been like that for you or has that come as he's gotten older?
COACH SUTTER:   I think he's been a really consistent player.   Yeah, I would say that (laughter).   Instead of going into it, I'd say that. 

Q.   You've dominated in the third period in this series and throughout the playoffs.   How important is a strong start in the first?
COACH SUTTER:   Well, I think domination in third periods is not the right way to look at it.   I mean, there's different reasons that you have good third periods. 
Maybe you're down.   Maybe you're up.   Maybe you got penalties or power plays.   Lots of different reasons for third periods, the way they are. 
Quite honestly, you're probably saying that because of shots for and against, right?   It's pretty much irrelevant.   If you only had one shot and you needed that to score the goal and you did, then you'd take that, so... 
How important is a good start?   Well, that's why they put time on the clock always, that's when it starts.   Then you get 30, 40 seconds of it, then somebody else gets to go. 
It's not just the start.   I mean, what does 'start' mean?   Does that mean shift, period, till the first time out, O zone, neutral zone, D zone, faceoff?   What does it mean?
