 Q.  Biggest difference in this game from your standpoint? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  I think first goal.  First goal.  I think it was a game where we never scored the first goal.  I think that's the way it was going, the way both goalies were.  That's kind of what happened (smiling). 
 Q.  You guys got no follow-up shots to Nabokov tonight. 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  I think difference in scoring chances, he was allowed to see more.  When he does that, you know, those top guys are going to hold it in there. 
 Q.  Did their defense do a better job tonight of taking those chances away? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  Yeah, I think they did. 
 Q.  What happened at the end, how did that transpire, do you think? 
 DARRYL SUTTER:  I think it was just a scrum.  I don't think nothing really.  I didn't think nothing was really going to happen there. 
 I mean, we're trying to win a faceoff on the other end to start it.  So it's not a big deal.
