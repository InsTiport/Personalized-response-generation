THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   Again a road win.   What in your mind was the key to your victory tonight?  
COACH SUTTER:   It wasn't much going on offensively for either team.   The way teams play, there's such tight quarters out there.   Ability to stay with it, play four lines, six defensemen, I think both teams would say that.   
   
 Q.   Is there a reason for the low shot total?   
COACH SUTTER:   Well, I'm sure both teams tried to take shots.   It's not like they weren't trying.   Both very good defensive teams first.   
   
 Q.   You struggled a little bit in the middle there with New Jersey really pushing back, able to get the goal on a lucky bounce.   What are you telling your guys in the locker room after the second period?   
COACH SUTTER:   Well, I don't think there's a problem with focus or struggling.   It's pretty evenly matched teams.   Probably going to be more than one overtime game.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Quick a little bit in the overtime period.   Obviously the Devils really came at you in overtime as well.   
COACH SUTTER:   Well, I think Marty made two huge saves in the third period, too.   That's what both goalies are here for, right?   It's not one ahead of the other or anything different.   They're going to have to make big saves and keep it low scoring.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think your team is so good on the road?  
COACH SUTTER:   We won one on the road now.   Season started today, tonight.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
