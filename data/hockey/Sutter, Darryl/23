THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   What did you say to your team after the loss tonight?  
COACH SUTTER:   Fly at 11.   
   
 Q.   Great job shutting down Patrick Kane early in the series.   How do you shut him down in Game 7?  
COACH SUTTER:   We'll do our best.   
   
 Q.   Has he done anything different to be more effective later in the series?  
COACH SUTTER:   He made two great plays in the third.   We made some great ones, too, though.   
   
 Q.   Getting used to these Game 7s on the road.   Talk about the transition of how a series can change and the importance of how you guys seem to shift into some special mode.   
COACH SUTTER:   It's just one game.   
It's an old line.   But it's the truth.   If you could play one game, you'd play it.   Doesn't matter if it's one or seven.  
   
 Q.   Is this Game 7 going to be different than the one again Anaheim or San Jose?  
COACH SUTTER:   Not really.   Just a third round and a better opponent.  
   
 Q.   Doughty with a hell of a sequence there.   
COACH SUTTER:   There were some great plays in the third period by a lot of great players.   Kane made a couple.   Keith made one.   Drew made a couple.   You know, their goalie made some big saves.   
   
 Q.   Guys in the other room were talking about time and space, especially in front of the net.   How much adjustment do you think you have to make there?  
COACH SUTTER:   Well, I think both teams were making really good adjustments.   
I think both teams are competing like hell in those areas.   There's not much of a difference or a gap in these two clubs.   It comes down to those great plays at the end.   
We could have went away after the Smith goal, after the bad goal.   We battled back.   Both teams did.   
   
 Q.   Resilience has been a key word for you guys.   
COACH SUTTER:   That's why there's a Game 7.   That's what you call resilient (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Does that make you feel better about the situation?  
COACH SUTTER:   I don't have to feel better.   I feel pretty good actually.   
   
 Q.   Two heavyweights trading blows here.   
COACH SUTTER:   Yep.   Hey, it's been a great series.   Now it comes down to one game.   That's what it's been.   
   
 Q.   How can you say you feel good when you had a 3‑1 lead?  
COACH SUTTER:   Actually, we didn't have the lead going into the third.   
   
 Q.   In the series.   
COACH SUTTER:   Doesn't matter if it goes 1‑1‑1‑1‑1.   It's two really good hockey clubs bordering on the top of the league.   To think it wouldn't be a 7 or a 6 or anything like that, not disappointed in that at all.   It's a negative way to look at it if you want to ask that question actually.   
   
 Q.   Is that a reason why you feel that home ice hasn't been a major factor throughout most of these playoffs for you?  
COACH SUTTER:   I think I said I'd like to play Game 7 at home always.   
Thanks.
