  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   Can you reflect back upon last night, general impressions of Game4 from your perspective. 
COACH SUTTER:   Played better in Game4 than we did in Game2.   Differences, missed opportunities and Brodeur's play last night.

Q.   Mindset for this game, I assume nothing different for any other road games thus far? 
COACH SUTTER:   Go play on the road.   No big deal. 

Q.   Positives?   Anything in particular you might be looking for early in the next game or just the general flow is what you keep an eye out for?
COACH SUTTER:   Continue to play the way we're playing.   That's why you play series.   Unfortunately, we have some spoiled people that think that everyone wins 16 in a row or something. 
A little confusing to me. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
