  THE MODERATOR:   Question for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   (Question regarding Fraser.) 
COACH SUTTER:   No, he's back in Alberta.   Not that easy to get there or here. 

Q.   It has to be a gratifying feeling being up 2‑0.   Any injuries from last night?
COACH SUTTER:   I think there's lots of injuries as it goes along, right?   But that's usually not something that gets talked about from our side or from the players' side. 

Q.   Last night the discipline your team showed, it was impressive.   That could have gotten ugly last night.   You have to be impressed with the discipline. 
COACH SUTTER:   Well, it's nice to talk about it, right?   But this is a physical game.   You know, there's a time and place for that.   Numbers don't change, unless they change teams. 

Q.   Impressions of what Clifford was able to do after being out for such a short time?
COACH SUTTER:   Short notice.   He knew he was going in warmup.   I talked to him around 2:00 so he knew he was playing.   He got a few shifts.   You know, quite honestly, he was the logical guy to go in for Fraser because they bring the same sort of thing.   Can't take penalties, has to play hard, has to be responsible and be on the right side of the puck.   If he does that, he gets a chance to play. 

Q.   Dustin Penner was saying that this team still hasn't played its best game.   Do you agree? 
COACH SUTTER:   You know, it's always the best thing about being a player, is if you can say that and you honestly believe that, then that's a good thing.   Sometimes it's talked about, and that's not the case, where they can actually go to another level. 
I think as a group, clearly, I said it last night, I know everybody thinks that I'm not answering properly sometimes, but we were better in Game1 than we were in Game2. 

Q.   Given the circumstances in terms of travel, you have been pretty efficient.   Two trips to Vancouver, but only one to St.Louis. 
COACH SUTTER:   I think the big thing was the time between series. That's the most important when you look at it for our team.   That means that you won more than you lost significantly.   A lot of times when you lose more, if you lose in four or five, you get lots of rest, too. 

Q.   You get the whole summer?
COACH SUTTER:   Right (laughter). 
That's the key.   When you look at it, it's not very normal that you've only played this few of games in the third round, so... 
That to me is the biggest difference I see. 

Q.   You've seen some teams in the past not respond well to extended breaks.   Are you impressed with your team's focus?
COACH SUTTER:   You mean the breaks between series? 

Q.   Yes. 
COACH SUTTER:   Well, first off, if you can get two or three days, and it s not very often you do, there is a lot of recovery involved.   Then the next part is managing it properly.   We've done that. 
We'll see as we go along here. 

THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
