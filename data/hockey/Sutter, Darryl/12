  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter. 

Q.   I think the expectation here is we'll see the Kings be much more disciplined with the puck at the start of the game tonight.   Would you expect that?
    COACH SUTTER:   Well, I think you get the two days, we talked about it lots, we were a tired team.   I think yesterday was good for us, not just in terms of the onâ€‘ice stuff, but to be able to get a little more set in how we wanted to play against them. 
    We'll be better, for sure.   At the end of the day both teams will be better. 

Q.   How do you expect Robyn to play tonight?   What is your expectation for him?
    COACH SUTTER:   We'll make decision after warmup on our lineup.
