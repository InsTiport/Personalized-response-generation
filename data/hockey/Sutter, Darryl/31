  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Team is 3â€‘3 at home.   Do you feel that's an appropriate record?
COACH SUTTER:   We haven't played Chicago yet at home, so... 
We'll evaluate that after tonight. 
We played really good games at home.   Quite honest, the turning point in the San Jose series was Game 3 that we lost in overtime.   We don't really dwell on that, though, or think about that much. 

Q.   How has the ice held up?
COACH SUTTER:   Ours?   Again, we haven't played that many games here.   Certainly in the Anaheim series, both of us were complaining about our own ice. 
Hopefully it will be a little bit better again tonight.   You know, with basketball being gone, hopefully they've had some opportunity to do some work with it.   I know Dan, the iceman, has been a frequent visitor.
