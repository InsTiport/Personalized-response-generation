Chicago   3
  Los Angeles   1

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   (Question regarding fatigue.) 
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, only time I really noticed it quite honest was early in the game.   They were going to come out with some energy, they did two or three times in the first where we got caught at the end of shifts.   That's where it showed up. 
Other than that, I don't think it really hurt us that much. 

Q.   What was your understanding or the explanation you got on the disallowed goal?
COACH SUTTER:   They reviewed it because if the first shot doesn't go in the net, then it can't be pushed in.   That's why they were reviewing it, so... 
Don't get much opportunity to look at it. 

Q.   Your thoughts on Willie Mitchell's play, first game back?
COACH SUTTER:   He was fine. 

Q.   Tyler Toffoli and Pearson seemed to provide a lot of energy.   Obviously some very good scoring chances tonight.   How do you evaluate them?
COACH SUTTER:   Thought the line was good.   Jeff, Tanner, Tyler.   Obviously, they scored a big goal.   Tyler's play, he was a good player for us last year against Chicago, too.   I'm sure there wasn't any intimidation coming into this building.   Played with Dustin Penner, good line here last year.
