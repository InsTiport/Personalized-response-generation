THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the flow of overtime, all the chances they had up and down the ice.   
COACH SUTTER:   I think that's typical overtime.   There's lots of opportunities both ways.   In the end, probably their two best offensive guys made a great play to score a goal.   
   
 Q.   When you give up two early like that, anything you can say to the guys?   
COACH SUTTER:   We don't have to talk much about that stuff.   That's really a question that we get asked a lot, about resolve, all those things.   
Our team is highly successful because of that.   There's not much you can do about giving up bad goals.   If you put your head between your legs, you're going to get your ass kicked.   We don't do that.   We respond in the right way all the time.   
   
 Q.   Can you pinpoint anything that got Patrick Kane going in the last couple games?  
COACH SUTTER:   No, no.   
   
 Q.   Do you take any solace from the way your team played all year?   
COACH SUTTER:   As you know, I think we went farther than‑‑ we went to the Conference Finals again.   That tells you how fine a line it is.   We got beat in the Conference Finals by the best team in the conference at the end of the day.   
We accomplished everything.   Once you set the bar up there, then that's your bar.   So obviously we're disappointed to lose to Chicago, but we're certainly not disappointed in how we played.   
I mean, I think you look at our season, other than not getting home ice, we've done everything we've wanted.   
   
 Q.   Could you elaborate on how banged up the team was.   
COACH SUTTER:   Three, four guys that were game time after Game 6 in San Jose, literally.   I think most teams are going to say that the farther you go.   
Also tells you how tough it is to win, how you need that.   I know it's something that gets talked lots about.   You have to stay healthy.   Have you to be close to 100%, especially with your top guys.   I know we weren't.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on tying it up there at the end and forcing overtime.   11 shots on goal in the first overtime.   
COACH SUTTER:   I think just even to come back from two soft goals, then to come back from 3‑2 to tie it up, then just our ability to play the way we do.   
Thank you.
