    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe the road game strategy you used that worked so well tonight?  
    COACH SUTTER:   Well, we're used to the travel the day before.   Obviously being in the west, we do it a lot, going to the Midwest or the east.   We moved past all that fatigue part of it a couple days ago.   
    The next part is obviously coming into MSG knowing the atmosphere and the guys that haven't been in here, make sure they're clear on it, be ready for that.  
   
 Q.   What about the way the team played in terms of forechecking?  
    COACH SUTTER:   Played a solid game.   No more than that.   On the road you have to look at it like it's not the final game or anything like that.   You have to look at it like you have to play a really solid road game.   
   
 Q.   Jonathan Quick had not played here before.   He played the best game of the playoffs for him in this game.   
    COACH SUTTER:   Our playoff started again.   We don't look at it like playoffs.   In the big picture you take it a series at a time.   Each series is a season.   
    This playoffs started three games ago, and it was his best game of the series.   
   
 Q.   The way you handled the puck, decisions, especially coming out, is that as good as you've been here in a bit?  
    COACH SUTTER:   We weren't as clean as we wanted to be in the first two games.   We had a good first period.   Justin made a great play on the goal to Jeff.   Then we scored the power play goal.   
    Quite honestly, the game was sort of disjointed with all the penalties.   
   
 Q.   Was there ever any doubt during the season when Quick was coming back from surgery that he was going to be able to get to the point you'd be able to lean on him the way you have to?  
    COACH SUTTER:   I think that we gave him the full amount of time to make sure that he was 110% healthy, knowing full well that he wanted to represent his country at the Olympics.   We had kids that could give us some games.   
   
 Q.   Can you draw on 2012 when you were also up 3‑0, then the Devils win a couple, trying not to look past what's next?  
    COACH SUTTER:   I haven't even thought about that.   Really that has nothing to do with this series when you look.   I mean, hell, we got thrown under the bus by everybody on earth seven weeks ago, so...   
    Right (smiling)?   
   
 Q.   There are a couple guys we don't hear too much about.   The way Willie Mitchell has come back from a lot of hardship.   
    COACH SUTTER:   I think our bench on the back end has been really solid.   Whichever two have been in there have been outstanding.   They've all missed time with injury, Willie, Greener and Robyn.   Whoever we put in there has shown their leadership and complements the group.   
   
 Q.   So how did it feel playing with a lead?   
    COACH SUTTER:   We're used to it.   
   
 Q.   What was the key tonight for the penalty kill for you guys?  
    COACH SUTTER:   I think the key was obviously they didn't score on any of them.   I think the second period was probably the most important part of it.   We scored in the power play and they didn't.   That's a big difference.   
    If you look at the series, if you want to base it on that, coming into this game, we scored a power play goal, they scored a shorthanded goal, we scored power play goal.   They're up on the special teams, so tonight we're even.
