THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   You said the fourth win is always the toughest win.   How tough was this one tonight?  
COACH SUTTER:   Tough.   Hard‑fought.   Came back from adversity during the game a couple times.   Had such a great start.   Got out of the first period still in it.   Winning the second was huge.   
   
 Q.   Coach, Dustin Penner coming out the winner, the journey he's had this season.   
COACH SUTTER:   He had a journey tonight.   I stuck with him.   He struggled early in the game.   Stuck with him.  
   
 Q.   Why do you think you're having all this road success?  
COACH SUTTER:   Got to win in lots of different ways.   Look at tonight, we had trouble scoring the last couple games.   Tonight we were sort of on that ride again where Smith was not letting anything in.   Anything he saw, you weren't scoring on him.   That's kind of happened the last couple games.   
We won in a lot of different ways.   That's what you have to do.   You can't just sneak it out or get lucky or anything like that.   You got to earn it.   We have so far.   
   
 Q.   Another shorthanded goal for your team tonight, key to your success in the season.   
COACH SUTTER:   It was in the first round.   Soft goal, right?   Somebody sitting in a box.   But Kopie wins the faceoff, right?   It's not very often you get the faceoff in the other team's defensive zone.   
   
 Q.   Third period was so crazy.   Did you like the mindset going into overtime?   
COACH SUTTER:   Why not?   It's tied going into the third.   That's overtime also.   That's really what was going on for the last, what time did we score, almost 40 minutes.   It was the same thing.   
   
 Q.   Can you put your finger on what this means to the organization.   
COACH SUTTER:   I'm proud of the players.   That's the biggest thing for me.   Hell of an accomplishment for the players.   That's what it's about.   They're the guys that sweat and bleed.   That's what it's about.   I know from being a player.   I'm proud of them guys.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
