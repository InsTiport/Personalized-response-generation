    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.

Q.   The early part of the game, was that them or was that you guys a little sluggish coming out?
    COACH SUTTER:   I think they had a lot of energy and refresh.   If you look at their playoffs in the first periods, they've had really good first periods every game.   You look at it, not I think, I know that we were not full tanks.

Q.   You were facing some early setbacks. 
    COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, nobody is ever out of it.   Keep plugging away and make a big play to tie it, make a big play to win it. 

Q.   Is there anything Justin Williams does at this point that surprises you?
    COACH SUTTER:   He's a really good player for our hockey team.   He's our best right winger every night consistently. 

Q.   What was it that made you so effective in the third period?
    COACH SUTTER:   I'm not so sure we were.   I think Jonathan Quick was our best player tonight. 

Q.   They only had three shots on goal. 
    COACH SUTTER:   Is that a question (laughter)? 
    I know they only had three shots on goal.   I agree with you. 

Q.   Darryl, when Doughty has a giveaway like that in the first for a goal, then makes a great play like that in the second to score a goal, can you live with that tradeoff?
    COACH SUTTER:   You don't want to trade chances with the New York Rangers.   I said it yesterday and I've said it every day.   If you have to score more than three goals, you're going to have trouble. 
    If you trade chances, in the end you're going to have trouble.
