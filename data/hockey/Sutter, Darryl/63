THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   What was the difference tonight?  
COACH SUTTER:   Not much.   Pretty much overtime in the third period, same as first two games.   
   
 Q.   Was there a breakdown on the Elias goal?   If so, what happened there from your perspective?  
COACH SUTTER:   Which goal?   
   
 Q.   Elias' goal.   
COACH SUTTER:   Henrique's goal?   It's a turnover.   Misplay between the defensemen.   Not a coverage play.   Can't make those long passes and think you can get away with it.   
   
 Q.   Game4 has always been somewhat of a problem for you guys.   You're 3‑3 now when you can close out a series.   
COACH SUTTER:   Awesome.   Close out a series Game4 (laughter).   
It's the Stanley Cup Finals.   Game is the very same as the first two games.   
That's good.
