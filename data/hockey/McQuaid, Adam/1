  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   How do you respond moving forward into Game2? 
ADAM McQUAID:   Yeah, there's no question that it's a tough loss.   At the same time, it was a game that could have went either way. 
Take the positives from it.   Today is a new day.   We kind of start over and just have get ready for Game2. 

Q.   How emotionally and physically draining was triple overtime? 
ADAM McQUAID:   Well, I mean, creeping up on almost playing two full games there.   No question that physically and mentally, it was draining. 
I guess that's the name of the game.   You know they're going to be close, hardâ€‘fought games. 

Q.   Andrew Shaw ends up getting the winning goal for them.   In your first experience against him, did he live up to the billing of being a guy that's a little bit of a troublemaker out there? 
ADAM McQUAID:   I don't know.   He's a guy that got in, got in hard on the forecheck.   Not really worrying too much about their guys.   Obviously we prepare for them.   But we just focus on ourselves.
