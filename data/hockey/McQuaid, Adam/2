THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Interesting that the defense has had such a key role in the playoffs, especially offensively.   Somewhat ironic in the deciding game once again, a defenseman scores the game‑winning goal.   Just the excitement and your thoughts on having that kind of impact tonight.   
ADAM McQUAID:   Well, it's obvious when you can get a little bit of offense from your defense.   I think first and foremost, we're obviously trying to be solid defensively.   When we can get up into the play.   Marshy made a great play to me, just trying to get some shots on net.   
   
 Q.   Going back to 2011, Eastern Conference Finals, 0‑0 through two periods.   Same tonight.   Did this game have a similar feel that the first goal was going to win the game?   
ADAM McQUAID:   I don't think we were really thinking about 2011.   This is a new year for us.   We were just focused on tonight.   
   
 Q.   Just take us through sort of what you saw, how the play developed.   
ADAM McQUAID:   I actually came on for a change.   So I was kind of looking back to make sure there was no one behind on the change.   
Just got up the ice.   Like I said, Marshy, he kind of stopped up and made a nice pass to me.   Just tried to get a shot on net, and luckily it went in.   
   
 Q.   You're not exactly known for your goal scoring.   How do you feel knowing you scored this goal that sends you to the final?  
ADAM McQUAID:   Well, it obviously feels good.   It feels good to be able to contribute that way when you don't normally.   
But I think you look at so many great efforts we had from guys tonight.   The last 10 minutes of the game, guys were all over the ice, doing whatever it took to preserve that goal.   
You know, Tukko was phenomenal again for us.   
   
 Q.   Can you elaborate a little bit more, what was going through your mind as you laid into the puck.   
ADAM McQUAID:   Not a whole lot, to be honest.   
   
 Q.   Did you know you caught it, as hard as you shot it?  
ADAM McQUAID:   Yeah, you know, I felt like I got pretty good wood on it.   Maybe not necessarily felt like it was going to go in.   Found a way to.   
   
 Q.   Adam, you guys were an underdog coming into the series.   Could any of you have imagined, forget about winning, but sweeping the Pittsburgh Penguins who led the NHL in scoring?   
ADAM McQUAID:   I don't think our mindset, probably coming into the series, was thinking to want to sweep it.   We did a really good job of taking one game at a time.   That was something we needed to do against this team that, you know, is extremely talented and extremely dangerous.   
You know, you hear it over and over again, but it really was important for us to be focused on each game individually.   
   
 Q.   Pittsburgh has had so much offensive firepower.   Talk about your team's effort on defense with guys like Malkin and Crosby.   
ADAM McQUAID:   Like I said, they definitely are a very dangerous team.   You know, they can create scoring chances from next to nothing.   
It wasn't like we kept them to nothing.   You know, they did have their chances.   I think Tukko was phenomenal throughout the series, he really was.   He made the big saves when we needed him to.   
You know, I think our big guys on the back end did a really good job against their top guys, too, so...   
   
 Q.   How does it feel personally to get back to the Cup?   Is it satisfying for you with all the injuries you've been through?   
ADAM McQUAID:   Yeah, obviously it feels great to get to this point.   We have a little ways to go yet to where we want to be.   But, you know, we're getting closer.   
Yeah, I guess personally, you know, in December I wasn't thinking too much even about playing hockey, it was just trying to get back healthy.   It's definitely nice to see how things come full circle like that.   
Thank you.
