 Q. Could you tell me what your immediate reaction was when you heard them announce your
Dad's name?
 
 TAYLOR PYATT: It was pretty surprising, actually, kind of funny. It wasn't something I
was expecting. It was pretty funny. It's all right.  
 
Q. He must have got a kick out of it.
 
 TAYLOR PYATT: Oh, yeah, he was laughing quite a bit. 
 
Q. Did your Dad say anything to you after the announcement was made?
 
 TAYLOR PYATT: No, not really. Just sort of shook his hand, shook all of my family's
hands, hugged my mom, walked down. Really didn't say too much about it. He was just sort
of laughing about it. It was kind of funny.
