 Q. Just generally how do you feel about being picked by Edmonton? Were you surprised to
go where you did in the draft?
 
 JANI RITA: Well, I'm very honored because there have been so many Finns. Tradition is
very famous. A lot of Stanley Cups. I'm very honored.  
 
Q. Did you expect to go in the draft about where you were? 
 
 JANI RITA: Well, I haven't no clue because I didn't ask my agent. It was exciting.  
 
Q. Do you expect to be in Edmonton next season or do you expect to stay with your
current team? 
 
 JANI RITA: Well, it depends on team. I don't know. It's hard to say. It's hard to say.
Maybe in Finland. 
 
Q. Will you be talking to Jari Kurri or anyone else? 
 
 JANI RITA: Matti Hagman, he used to coach me two years, so I know him. But not other
guys so well. I have met, but don't know so well. 
 
Q. What was your injury this year? Did you have a bruised spleen late in the year?
 
 JANI RITA: Yeah, Aki Berg hit me. I got concussion and bruised kidney. That was in last
regular season game. My season ended there.
