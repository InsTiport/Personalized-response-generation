Q.  How about the Olympics?  Are you already thinking about Nagano?
 
PAVEL BURE:  Yeah, I do.  I'm really looking forward to go there. 
 

Q.  You think Russia might have a better team this time when everybody really, really wants to go?
 
PAVEL BURE:  Well, definitely.  I think it's really important for the team.  They have to have people on the team who really wants to go there. 
 

Q.  So the Gold Medal will definitely be your goal then?
 
PAVEL BURE:  Sure.  It's going to be hard to do with so many great teams over there, U.S.A., Sweden, Finland.  I think everybody got a really good shot. 
 

Q.  How special is it playing in front of the home (inaudible)

Q.  (Inaudible)
 
 PAVEL BURE:  I played with those guys when I was 16 years old.  It was always a pleasure to play with them.  You always thinking when you have another chance to play with them.  Every year something would come up, All-Star, World Cup.  We getting another chance. 
 

Q.  Do you like the change in the format this year for the All-Star Game?

Q.  Why?
 
PAVEL BURE:  Because, you know, I've been in NHL. I know most of the players, almost everybody from NHL.  New one, I don't know, we have to see. 
 

Q.  How do you think it will impact the game on the ice?  Do you think it will be a little more physical, a little more intense with the way they mix it up?
