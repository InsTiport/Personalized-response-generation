  Q. Very physical in the first period, and it may have led to some turnovers. Just talk about what they brought in the first.   
 BRENT SOPEL: Obviously, this is what they've done all year. They're in their building with their crowd. It's expected.   
 I thought we had a pretty good first period. We made a couple of mistakes and give them credit. They capitalized on them.   
  
  Q. Did you handle that pressure as well as you could have?   
 BRENT SOPEL: I thought we handled it fairly well. It was a couple of mental errors and it costs us.   
  
  Q. How could you come away feeling with this game (Question off Microphone).  
 BRENT SOPEL: No, third period, we were getting pucks in and battling, obviously. We got a few goals in there. It was a challenge all night long. But towards the end of the game, we started doing what we wanted to.   
  
  Q. (Question off Microphone).  
 BRENT SOPEL: Yeah, it was a couple of mental errors. Give them credit they capitalized on it.   
  
  Q. (Question off Microphone).  
 BRENT SOPEL: We still have offense. It's a seven-game Series. First four over. We have to take a pause in what we did in the third and go into Game 5.   
  
  Q. Is there another hunger level or another area you can dig deeper?   
 BRENT SOPEL: Oh, yeah. You have to. You have to get better every game. You have to dig deeper every game. Final two wins we're going to have to dig really deep.   
  
  Q. The forechecking in the first period (Indiscernible)?  
 BRENT SOPEL: Definitely give them credit. They were relentless. They've been all four games relentless. I thought we played a fairly good first period. We made a couple of costly mistakes. Give them credit. They capitalized.   
  
  Q. Are there any positives you can take out of this game at all?   
 BRENT SOPEL: Absolutely. We're obviously going to take a look at some tape tomorrow. We have to take positives. It's over. It's done with. We didn't do what we wanted to do. It's the best of three now.   
  
  Q. Does the finish give you guys a little more momentum or whatever? You know what I mean.   
 BRENT SOPEL: Yeah. Obviously, we have to take the positive from the last ten minutes of the third. We started moving our feet well and getting the pucks in deep. That's something we need to do for 60 minutes.   
  
  Q. Just a couple of missed passes and they took advantage. Is that kind of how you look at it?   
 BRENT SOPEL: Yeah, I thought our first period was fairly good. A couple of mental mistakes and they buried it. Obviously, we don't make those mistakes very often. Give them credit. They capitalized. We have to be smarter.   
  
  Q. What's the best way to describe your guy's mindset? Angry?   
 BRENT SOPEL: Upset. Upset, obviously, that -- the fashion how we lost the game. We have to clear our minds. There's nothing we can do. It's over, done with. We have to focus.   
  
  Q. Do you feel bad for Antti. Left out to dry at first?   
 BRENT SOPEL: Yes, definitely. Antti has battled for us. He did tonight. You can't blame him on some of those goals. The fourth one, I don't know wherever it went. He battled hard. We left him high and dry.   
  
  Q. As a defenseman, do you sympathize with the type of night that Hjalmarsson had?  
 BRENT SOPEL: It wasn't just him. Take a look at things. There's always more things you can do. One guy makes a mistake, there's four other guys on the ice who need to help him be in the right position. It just wasn't him. More than one.
