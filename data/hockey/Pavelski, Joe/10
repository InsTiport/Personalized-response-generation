Blackhawks  Â– 4
  Sharks - 2

 JOE PAVELSKI: At times we had it going, got away from our game, had a few too many turnovers. 
 They play well with a lead, especially a couple goals. We realized they weren't going to be sitting back. We wanted to keep forcing it, jamming it. You know you got to lay it behind and go to work. 

 Q. Talk about Game 3. 
 JOE PAVELSKI: Didn't have nearly enough guys out there. We didn't get the job done. When we have won so far this season, it's been a commitment by everybody, everybody's showed up, and that's what we need.
