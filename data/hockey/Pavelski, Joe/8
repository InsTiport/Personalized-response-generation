   JOE PAVELSKI: We need to come out and do the same thing we did the other night, you know, get on the forecheck, just create chances, create a few more power-plays. 
 We had our chances. It's all about production, though, right now. Doesn't matter how many shots you got. It's one of those things. We got to go out and earn another game. 

 Q. There are a lot of experienced guys. But this is kind of unchartered territory. Could something like that be the difference between this team and Chicago right now since they've been to the Western Conference finals? 
 JOE PAVELSKI: It's hard to say because we've been there every game. There hasn't been one time where we felt overwhelmed by any means. It felt like these games could have went the other way just as easily. 
 But that's not the case. We can't worry about experience. There's a job to be done. We have another chance tomorrow. 

 Q. How mad is this team? 
 JOE PAVELSKI: It's disappointing to be down 3-0, no doubt. But we're not hanging our heads. We know no one's feeling sorry for us. It's all about this group now. We have to earn more games right now. That's all we can worry about. We need the same kind of effort as the other day.
