 Q. You're the first Canadian selected. How does that feel?
 
 BRIAN FINLEY: It's a great feeling. I mean, I looked at a lot of guys in the draft who
were Canadian, well deserving who were really high in the draft. Beech, Lundmark, Pyatt,
who could easily have gone ahead of me. It's a great honor to be highly regarded like
that. It's a pretty big relief that I'm finally drafted and it's finally over.
