  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I feel good.   Things are happening quick.   Feel like we just got off the ice.   Long flight.   Happy to be here, looking forwards to playing Game3.   Tough schedule, three games in four nights.   We're excited being up 2‑0.   Looking forward to playing Game3.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Just got to worry about ourselves.   We had a lot of things we wanted to get accomplished in Chicago.   It's no different here.   We know about their record at home, but we got to come out and play our game, continue to do the things that have made us successful.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I think he's been great.   We have a lot of confidence in him.   He had a lot of confidence last year, the year before.   Been big for us.   He makes a lot of stops that sometimes other goalies might not make.   He's been great for us.   We have a lot of confidence with him at net.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yeah, sure.   It's a lot different playing away from the United Center.   I feel like we've been solid on the road the last couple years in the playoffs.   The team gets home for that first game, the crowd's into it, kind of gives that extra push.   
We expect L.A. to be good at home.   Obviously their record speaks for itself.   It's going to be a tough game for us to go in and battle them, battle the elements.   But it's something we're looking forward to.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Well, I would think everybody would like to score in the first shift.   It definitely creates momentum for us, stuff like that.   We've prided ourselves in having a good start.   Trying to continue that throughout the game.   
I think we've done a good job, you know, especially in this round, coming out with good starts.   We've got to continue to do that.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Corey is in a tough spot.   Being the goaltender, you have as much pressure on you as any other player on the team.   He's handled it well.   
As defensemen, we're out there doing our job.   I think our forwards have done an unbelievable job of coming back and helping us out.   That in turn helps out Crow.   
When we're playing and firing on all cylinders, back‑checking hard, making plays out of our zone, it's relieving some pressure for Crow.   
He's been great.   I don't think anybody stood up in the room and said we had to rally around Crow, by any means.   But he's been great for us, like I said.   We got to continue to play as a group out there, a five‑man unit in front of him, all 20 players to a man played well.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   We're up 2‑0 in the series.   You look back at the St.Louis series.   They were up 2‑0 coming to L.A.   We got to continue to focus on the game tomorrow night.   They're a great team, L.A.   Quick is a great goaltender.   We understand he's going to come back with a better game than he did last night.   We have to continue to get pucks to him and make it tough on him.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   That's a good question.   Kind of take it shift by shift.   I know it's a boring answer.   But L.A. is a team that has been in this situation before and responded well.   We know it's going to be a tough game.   We want to come out and play hard.   Every game in the playoffs, you want to win.   
Definitely we're going out there with the mindset that we want to play the way Joel wants us to and win that game.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yeah, I personally like it.   At the United Center, it's predictable.   When you score a goal, make a big save, a big hit, the crowd cheers for you.   
It's a little different when you're on the road.   People bang on the glass, cheer for the other team.   
It's a fun atmosphere to be a part of.   It's all part of playoff hockey.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yeah, I played with Handzus on three different teams now.   I played with him in Philadelphia maybe 10 years ago, I don't know how many years ago.   I was just getting started.   I think he had his career season there in Philadelphia.   
He's a guy that can play in every situation.   He has an offensive touch that he probably doesn't get enough credit for.   He's good on faceoffs, can play defensively, can play special teams.   The thing he's added to our team more than anything is leadership.   He says the right things at the right time.   
A guy that clearly wants to win at this stage in his career.   He's been on a lot of good teams.   You can tell he really has that passion to get it done this year.   
As far as our chemistry together, I feel like I know how he plays from watching him.   I had a pretty good seat to watch him in Philadelphia for a couple years there.   I know what he's all about.   Feel like he can help keep us going.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   We definitely take pride in our PK, whether it's blocking shots, keeping the puck out of the zone.   Crow has been outstanding, done an unbelievable job of pushing them into tough areas.   
You know, I think by helping us win games, that's the end goal.   Our PK has been a big part of that.   
L.A. has a big power‑play.   Detroit obviously had a good power‑play.   We'll try to go in with our chances and try to be solid on it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yeah, we get frustrated on our power‑play if we don't get it going and we get some chances.   
Just like I said, it's something we definitely take pride in.   We work hard on it.   The guys that are all out there, they're doing a great job.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   It's fun to be on the road in the playoffs at this time of year.   The Hawks do a good job of making it easy on us.   They set up a lounge with all kinds of food, drinks, video games.   Always have the basketball games on, hockey games on.   It's a fun atmosphere to go down there and hang around with your teammates.   Don't see enough of each other in Chicago with the families, people doing their own thing.   
It's always been fun to be on the road, be together, thinking hockey all the time.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I hate to see it, but I think Seabs is creeping up there.   Hands down the champion the last couple years, but he's slipping right now.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I had a lot of time during the lockout, I don't know.   We have a lot of fun with it.   It gets pretty competitive down there.   Like Sharpy said, something cool the Blackhawks have done the last couple years, set up a room and have some TVs in there so we can goof around and have some fun.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   That's probably a question they can answer better than me.   I played with Richie.   Won a championship with him in the American League.   I think everybody knows what type of player he is, how valuable he is to whatever team he's playing on.   He's won at every level.   
When you take a guy like that out of their lineup, I'll let them answer how it affects their team.   
Who knows what's going to happen going forward, but I'm sure it's a big loss for them.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I don't know if 'killer instinct' is the right word.   It's playoff hockey.   Tough to score goals.   We got a couple good ones there in the building.   In the United Center, things get loud when we score.   It can seem like everything is full of energy and excitement.   
It's going to be tough to get that first goal tomorrow, carry the momentum over.   We'll do our best to do that and see how things play out.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yeah, I didn't actually see him do it during the warmups.   I think that reflects how our mindset was at that particular time.   I know we weren't happy with not necessarily the way we played, but the situation we were in, some of the things going on in the series.   
You see a guy like Jamal that has been around for a long time, frustrated with how things were going as well, doing whatever he can to spark us, get us going.   
Thank you.
