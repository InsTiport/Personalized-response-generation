THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Patrick, were you feeling more like yourself out there?
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah.   I think the biggest thing was just trying to get the puck any way I could, skate with it, feel into the game, no matter how that was. 
I thought I did a good job of that.   Got a lot of support from whether it's coaches or teammates that want you to have the puck, that want you to start skating with it and moving it. 
It's a big part of our game.   If we play as a five‑man unit and come up the ice with speed, you see how successful we can be. 

Q.   The position you find yourself with this win, how important is it? 
PATRICK KANE:   It was huge, especially the way they're playing at home.   I think they won 15 in a row here at the Staples Center.   It was nice to come in and steal one for sure. 
We put ourselves in a good spot.   By no means do we feel the series is over.   You know they're going to come out with their best game in Game5.   We have a great opportunity to close it out at home.   It's a huge opportunity for us. 

Q.   Paying the price to get that goal, diving in there, is that what you need to do sometimes?
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, I told Bicksy I was kind of sorry I stole it from him.   It might have went in.   Kind of instinctive when you see the puck there, to stick your stick in and touch it. 
A big goal to tie it up at 2 in the last couple minutes of the period there.   Hjalmarsson and Hossa made a great play to make it 3‑2. 

Q.   When you went up to the top line, how did things change for you?
PATRICK KANE:   To be honest with you, I thought myself, Handzus and Sharp were playing good at the time.   Had a couple good forechecks, a couple good chances.   I don't know if at that time they wanted to switch it up.   For whatever reason it kind of worked both ways. 
I thought Handzus' line played great, and then myself and Bickell and Toews had some good shifts, too. 
Sometimes you switch it up, play with different players, it works out. 

Q.   Brent, defensively you had to work with Duncan out.   Talk about what you were able to do with them in the third. 
BRENT SEABROOK:   Dunks is a big part of our team.   It was a big hole losing him.   I thought Brooksy did a good job coming in.   The D did a good job.   We talked about it all season, especially in the playoffs.   But our team game, our team D, is really what's been doing such a great job. 
Crow in the net has been making some big saves.   When the forwards are coming back like they are, it's making it easy for us.   We're just trying to get back there quick and get outlet passes for our forwards to play with the puck. 

Q.   Losing Game3, losing Duncan, to rally back and win this one, what can you say about the effort of your team? 
BRENT SEABROOK:   It was big by us.   I thought everybody stepped up and played really well.   We weren't happy with our Game3.   I thought we came out right from the first couple shifts, we were moving our feet, playing with speed, we were getting in on the forecheck and making good plays. 
It was big for our group to come back with a good effort tonight. 

Q.   After they scored that first goal, you had to regroup. 
BRENT SEABROOK:   Yeah, they're going to score goals.   They're a good team.   I don't know, Voynov has been pretty hot lately.   He's got a great shot. 
I thought our team did a good job of forgetting about that, continuing to work.   Bicksy has been hot, too.   It was nice to see that one go in.   After the second one, we didn't get down on ourselves.   We just kept working.   It was a big goal by Kaner and obviously by Hoss. 

Q.   Looking at Bicksy, he's always shown flashes.   The last couple years he seems to be putting it together more and more.   Talk about his road to this point. 
BRENT SEABROOK:   He's been great.   He's been unbelievable in the playoffs all season for us.   He's a big body.   Being a defenseman, it's tough when those big bodies are coming down on you.   With his speed, momentum, it hurts.   It's nice to see him playing physical.   By doing that, gives himself some room.   He's got a great shot. 
He's really finding the soft spots and getting the shot through.   Probably the biggest thing, Kaner would probably agree, he's hitting the net now.   That's been huge for us.   I think it's paid off dividends for Bicksy. 

Q.   Patrick, when you went down 1‑0, were you still happy with the start and the pace you had coming out?
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, we wanted to have a better start obviously.   It's tough giving up that first one.   I think it was kind of a fluke play the way it happened.   Looked like Crow had it, then it squeaked out to the middle.   Voynov has been hot, like Seabs said. 
At the same time it didn't feel like we were down.   Felt like we had a good start to the game, a good period, a couple good shifts.   Really had the momentum in our favor. 
Sometimes those things are going to happen, like Seabs said.   They're going to score goals.   You can't get too down about it.

Q.   Patrick, you had a stare‑down with Jonathan Quick at one point.   Fun to watch.   Can you talk about what you saw in that play. 
PATRICK KANE:   It was a great play.   Seabs chipped it up to Toews and Toews dropped it to me at the blueline.   I know Bicks was going to do that, so was Johnny.   Just kind of held onto it.   Was patient.   Thought I made the right play shooting high. 
He made a great glove save.   You have to give him credit.   I remember being on the Olympic team with him.   He worked hard in practice, was a fun guy to shoot on. 
From whatever you saw in the stare‑down, wasn't anything.   Just kind of looking how he made that save, I guess. 
Thank you.
