  Q. (Question regarding discipline.)   
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: We just got to make sure to stay focused. It will be tough because they're a good team.   
 But, you know, we haven't taken that many dumb penalties in the playoffs.   
  
  Q. Do you feel it's a matter of time before your power-play gets going in the right direction?  
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: I think so. We're working on good strides towards it. It's a clean slate now. Hopefully our power-play can get going and it will help us, for sure.   
  
  Q. This is going to be one of the craziest crowds you faced all year. How do you take them out of it?  
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: Well, if anything, to take out the crowd is maybe getting the first goal. We had a tough series against MontrÃ©al. Their fans are very loud and proud. We did a good job against them.   
  
  Q. So many players on both teams haven't been to this point before. How do you avoid nerves?  
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: I think just staying focused, just worrying about what you have to do to help your team, staying prepared and focused is more or less the key.   
  
  Q. What are your emotions right now?  
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: We'll see about 2:30.   
  
  Q. Any harder to fall asleep last night?   
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: Wasn't too bad. I probably went to bed about 10:00, 10:30, then woke up 7:30 (laughter).   
  
  Q. What was the feeling after all the media day stuff?  
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: It's just nice.   
  
  Q. Sick of us?   
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: Little bit.   
  
  Q. What?   
 JOHNNY BOYCHUK: Not in a bad way (laughter). It's just nice because you get that over with. It was a long day. Now we just have to focus on playing hockey.
