  JOHNNY BOYCHUK:   I mean, he was obviously in pain, and then the ref is not going to blow the whistle because they obviously had possession, and then you just want to try and get it out.   I mean, they were trying to work over on his side because obviously he was in pain, but he got back up and tried to block shots, and you just wanted to get in the lanes beside him or do anything just to get it out so he could change or we could get a whistle.   You just want to do whatever it takes to get it out and help him out.   I mean, it's not fun being injured, and the ref doesn't blow the whistle because they have possession.   You want to make sure to do the job and try not to run around because once you do, then they start seaming you.  
   
 Q.   He barely even wanted to pick up his glove.   Did you know it was a lot worse‑‑  
JOHNNY BOYCHUK:   Not really, not at the time.   Sometimes you get hit in the leg and it's like a stinger, but obviously this isn't the case.   At the time I didn't know that it was that serious, but I mean, I knew it was obviously painful.
