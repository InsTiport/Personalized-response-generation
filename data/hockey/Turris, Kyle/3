   PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Kyle, come on up.  Kyle Turris, some of you have gotten to know as the course of the year went on.  I've seen you grow even more as the year has gone on.  It's unbelievable.  How many teams do you think have been out to see you play Tier 2 Junior this year, NHL teams?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  I think every team in the league.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Do you think some more than once?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  I know some of them have come more than once because I've talked to several teams several times.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Who has been talking to you most?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  There's been a couple.  And there's been a couple teams definitely showing interest.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Your dad was a great Lacrosse player.  Did you have any interest at all and what did you learn from your father in terms of Lacrosse translating over to hockey?  We have Gary Roberts, Joe Nieuwendyk, Adam Foote, other NHL players that were great Lacrosse players.  What did you learn from your dad?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  I loved playing Lacrosse.  Played until I was 14 years old then quit to play hockey in the summers.  But my dad taught me lots of things.  He taught me to work hard in the off season and it will help you in the summer.   
 And just work to improve all the little things in your game and not just things you're good at.  You have to focus on the things you need to improve and make you an all-around better athlete.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  James talked about why he went to the University of New Hampshire.  You have chosen to go to the University of Wisconsin, quite a hockey school with an unbelievable reputation.  Why did you choose Wisconsin?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  I was fortunate enough to take a trip down with my parents earlier when I was 15 and I got to see a game against Denver, and the atmosphere of the game.  There's 14,000 fans, just all wearing red and on their feet and cheering.   
 And the facilities were unbelievable.  The coaching staff was phenomenal, and the campus was beautiful.  So I thought it was the best fit for me.  And I knew right away I wanted to go there.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Give us a little idea of your short-term goals.  Obviously you have the NHL draft and then going to Wisconsin.  Any desire to play for Team Canada at the World Junior?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  That would be an honor.  I'd love to do that.  That would be a dream come true, and I'm going to be working my hardest to try and get invited.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  What courses are you going to study?   
 KYLE TURRIS:  I'm just going to go into general business to begin with.  I'm not sure exactly which route I want to go.  But I think that's where I'll start.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Thank you very much, Kyle.   
 Before we let the players go and you guys can ask them all questions, I'd like the players to introduce their family and friends that are here.  So we'll start with Karl.   
 KARL ALZNER:  Here I have my uncle, Ron Wessa.  He's here in place of my dad, Gunther.  He couldn't make it because of work.  And thanks for coming.   
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  My dad, Frans vanRiemsdyk, is with me.   
 KYLE TURRIS:  My dad, Bruce Turris, is here with me.  My mom wishes she was here.   
 PATRICK KANE:  My dad, Patrick Kane, is here with me.  And he supported me through the years.   
 KEATON ELLERBY:  My dad, Calvin Ellerby, is here with me.  He's excited about being here.   
 SAM GAGNER:  My dad, Dave Gagner, is here.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Thank you very much, gentlemen.  Again, we have Sam Gagner, Keaton Ellerby, Patrick Kane, Kyle Turris, James vanRiemsdyk, and Karl Alzner.  Congratualtions.  Thanks to you all.  Best of luck in Columbus.  Enjoy the game tonight and have a lot of fun with your media interview.  It should be fun.  Thank you everybody for coming.
