Q.  Were you surprised you slid in there.  A lot of people had you in the top four, maybe top two or three?
 
STANISLAV CHISTOV: No.  I wasn't surprised. 
 

Q.  You've been compared a lot to Paul Kariya.  Have you seen much of Paul Kariya and if so, how do your styles compare?
 
STANISLAV CHISTOV: I used to see him play on TV and Paul Kariya is a very fast skater, probably faster than Stanislav is and I hope to one day play similar style games.
