JIRI FISCHER:  I am so happy.  It was my dream since I was a small guy and it happened.  I wish to be drafted in the first round and it really happened, so I am very happy to be drafted by the best team in the League. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
JIRI FISCHER:  I follow NHL like anybody else, I guess I know something.  Like you mean about player, about coaching staff or -- no, I was hoping for a first round.  You can be rated first overall and you don't have to be in the first round, so, I didn't really look at the ranking.  I use my size and I am going to work on other skills next year so hopefully I am going to be a complete player.  I am going to work on it. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
JIRI FISCHER:  I don't really try to copy anybody, so, I don't know, maybe somebody sees that I am similar like somebody else, but I don't know. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
JIRI FISCHER:  First of all, I talked to my agent and talked to ^ Pavarozog because he played before me so I wasn't really sure if I should make that decision but now I am really happy for it.
