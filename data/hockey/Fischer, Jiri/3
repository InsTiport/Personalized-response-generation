Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
JIRI FISCHER: (Inaudible) way too many players, they can put the puck in the net.  So it doesn't really matter who carries the puck on their team.  And we just can't let them shoot from close by. 
 
Q.  You did take away Peter Forsberg for the most part in Game 1.  What's the key to that?  What's the most important thing to do to try to take him out of his game?
 
JIRI FISCHER: Well, I think we have to really stay sharp mentally and don't let any breakdowns affect our game.  Because he got his chances.  And, fortunately, Dominik stopped him.  And we really have to work as a team, all five guys on the ice.  It wouldn't just be one guy's shot or anything, so we have to make sure that, like I said, they don't get any rebounds; they don't get too close to the net. 
 
Q.  Is there a little bit of -- I don't want to say optimism, but is it a good sign when Darren McCarty is chipping in and Tomas Holmstrom comes from his seat and different guys are kind of doing something?
 
JIRI FISCHER: It's great.  That's exactly what we need.  It's great for everybody if everybody chips in a little bit.  It makes the team stronger.  And definitely Darren scoring a hat trick.  Hopefully he keeps doing what he's doing.  He's been great all playoffs long, but it wasn't going in for him.  He's probably one of our most physical players and he's been doing a great job grinding and grinding at night.
