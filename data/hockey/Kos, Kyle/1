It's just an incredible feeling.  I've been waiting for this all my life.  And I've come into a first class organization like the Lightning.  It's just the best feeling I've ever had so far in my life and throughout my career in hockey too. It's fantastic.

I wasn't really surprised.  I thought I still had like a lot -- I thought I could be rated higher than what I was.  It was really anxious to get taken.  And when I was taken this early, it was just great.  I still think I'm going to have a good year next year.  I'm just really looking forward to it and show them what I can do. 

I might -- I'd like to play a solid two-way game on defense.  I like to do my own job on my own end as a defenseman.  And once that's done, I like to jump up in the play and throw in some offense in there too.  I like to kind of play - I  like top get physical at times.  I like to step up to any of the challenges.  I also like to make good passes too.  I use my head a lot on the ice to think a lot and then make the right play and the right pass all the time.  And I like after I make that pass, jump up in that play and get up there and enjoy myself in part of the rush

Um, it was off and on.  I played about a quarter of the year with Mike Edbury, who we played with. But there was a time we actually did get to play quite a few times together. He's a great defenseman.  I learned a lot from him.  And I have everything good to say about the guy, and just going to have a great career

You bet. 

Yeah, he's -- well, he's probably not playing on that team next year.  He's somebody I can follow. I mean, he's the style of play I like.  And he's somebody I can use to follow my play in Major Junior to copy on the way of his play to do everything he did to make The Lightning happy.
