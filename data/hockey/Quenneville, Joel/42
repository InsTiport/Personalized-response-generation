THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   You had a lot of opportunities in the first period off their mistakes.   Was this ultimately them taking advantage of the miscues more than you were able to today?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we had a real good start to the game.   Being down 1‑0 after one was a tough spot to be in.   We hadn't been behind in the last four games. 
Second period, I thought we played alright, too.   But at the end, the second goal turned out to be a big goal.   They get the lead.   We put ourselves in a chance in the third with the big goal late. 
Third period, I don't think we generated much compared to the first two periods. 
When we're playing catch‑up, it's not one of our strengths.   At the same time it's a good hockey team.   We didn't get to the net as much as we'd like.   Put a lot of pucks into the net, but we got to get more bodies, more traffic. 

Q.   David Rundblad played a role in the first two goals.   How would you assess his play?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You know, you don't want to be on the ice when they score obviously.   I think defensively you can look at the plays.   We want to make sure we're making safe plays, quick plays, easy exits. 
A couple of those maybe could do differently.   But, you know, not an easy start, first playoff game.   Hadn't played for an extensive period. 

Q.   The Ducks having scoring goals in the playoffs, getting four more tonight.   Is that a danger sign when it's not coming from Perry or Getzlaf, they're still able to put pucks in the net?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They're a dangerous team.   All four lines can score.   All four lines have speed.   They push the pace.   They're not just a cycle team, they're dangerous off the rush. 
I think no matter who's on the ice, they're capable of making plays.   We got to be aware of that as well.   I thought we generated all four lines of offense when we had our moments, but we didn't cash in. 

Q.   You talked about Rundblad a little bit already.   Do you think with him and Timonen, you have enough depth to compete with the Ducks?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we're fine.   Every game's different.   I think when you're not playing much, you want to play it safe, keep it simple as best you can.   We'll work our way through it. 

Q.   We talk a lot about the power play.   Very frustrating to have those two back‑to‑back basically at the end of the third period and not get anything out of them. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Slowed us down in the momentum part of the game.   Those two power plays, we didn't generate much.   Maybe one late flurry in the second chance.   But I think that was probably the turning point when we lost the momentum of the game based on not generating anything. 

Q.   What do you do from here?   What is the major adjustment you see?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we started the right way.   We did what we wanted to do.   Playing catch‑up wasn't exactly what you want.   But they got the break scoring first.   The second goal turned out to be a big one again. 
We play the right way, we score first or do the right things again next game like we did today, that's what we'll be looking for. 

Q.   Can you take anything that you guys learned from Raanta playing against Devan Dubnyk to maybe going forward playing against Andersen?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think every goalie we talk about, they're always great goalies at this stage of the game.   They've obviously got some excitement to their game. 
We missed a great look there.   Kaner had a great look early.   He got some excitement to his game.   But I still think that we're more successful when he has a hard time trying to see through screens and second layers. 
They blocked a lot of shots as well.   We didn't get some shots through.   I think quicker shot selections, more bodies at the net is your best opportunity to get one and go from there. 
Thank you.
