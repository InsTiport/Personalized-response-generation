  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, it's been a while since we had back‑to‑back games.   Coming out, we're excited to be where we're at today.   A day off today.   Stay here and do our thing in the morning and be ready for the game tomorrow night.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   A long time since we played here.   A special day when we began the season here for them.   They played well here all season long.   I think the starts are going to be important to the game.   Let's be sure we take care of what we have to take care of.   
We expect a hard game.   Physically they come after you.   We want to make sure we're smart in that area and be proactive, as well.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Might have answered those in the off‑season going into the year.   I think we have a lot of confidence in Corey.   Look at the history of goaltenders, they come on their rookie year, they might have real good starts to their career.   Corey had an outstanding season.   The next year I think the standards of comparing those two years, it's tough to stay there.   
You get that job of being the number one goalie, expectations become different, teams are ready.   It seems like a number of top goalies come running out their rookie year and the next year is a little challenging.   
I think Corey's year was fine.   In the playoff series, he did what he had to do.   He got us in the playoffs at the end of the year.   We still felt he's capable of being an elite goalie, a top goalie.   This year he was ready to go.   The consistency of his game was in place.   That really was the key to our season, the goaltending, the tandem we had.   
He did what he had to do all year long and didn't change his approach whether there were a couple of goals in.   He hasn't had any games all year where we're disappointed with his contribution.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, they got a good rapport.   I think they're both competitive.   They both like to play.   I think Ray got a little more net time this year based on how well he played.   Didn't matter who he played in front of, the guys played the same way.   Got the same results in the net.   
They gave our team a lot of confidence knowing the predictability of the goaltending was in place.   The support they had for one another was there.   I think there's some competitiveness, too, that rushes the other guy that they want to do well.   They compete.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Last year they had a good road record.   You know, there's some buildings in this league that can get real loud, get the crowd into it, the team feeds off of that.   I think there's more success this year on the home team's side in the playoffs.   
Hopefully we can get off to a great start and quiet it as best you can.   It's tough on visiting teams trying to do that this year.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, going into Game 6 in Detroit, down a goal, the atmosphere was electric.   Got off to a great start in that period and took off.   
You want to keep control.   Be excited about it.   Whether you're at the United Center or here tomorrow, it shouldn't change too much how we have to play.   Whether you're screaming for the other team or for us, you're on the ice playing the game, utilize our strengths, play to them, and let's go.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we have to make sure we take reasonable penalties.   We took a few extra last night we don't like.   Discipline is always the key.   The first priority is that we start, when talking about penalty killing, the type of penalties we're taking.   Let's make sure we don't put them there unnecessarily.   
PK has done a great job all year, denying entries, blocking shots, goaltending, key saves.   The tandem is working well together.   
We want to make sure we don't change how we play knowing you have that in your back pocket.   Things change.   Making adjustments, as well.   I don't think we want to change.   We want to trust that type of thing knowing it's been a good thing for our team, as well.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He's one of those guys that quietly goes about his business.   He's a smart hockey player, very competitive.   Seems like he's always in the right spot.   He sees plays, makes plays.   He does everything he can to get himself ready to contribute on a regular basis here.   
When we first got him, we figured he'd give us a little more depth.   All of a sudden he moved up the ladder where all of a sudden he's playing in that nice slot for us.   A big line for us.   Have to make sure he doesn't get too high, too low.   But he's very competitive.   We've got to appreciate his positioning and his awareness.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, said he's quiet, but at the same time I think he's aware of where everybody's positioning is around the team, what's going on in the course of the game.   Real good instincts, things like that.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, it certainly helps, guys that have been there.   The guys that have been there, they know what it's like, what it takes, knowing they've got to be patient.   It's a long process.   Don't get ahead of yourself.   
We got a lot of new guys that haven't had that experience.   We're all in the same boat as far as how we feel as a team.   I think everybody wants to contribute.   I think the experience factor can help the other guys with the process of not getting ahead of yourself.
