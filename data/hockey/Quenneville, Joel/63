THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   As far as this one, was there a time where you guys just kind of started hitting the brakes or was it something that L.A. was doing?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I really liked how we played for 38 minutes.   We did everything we were looking to do.   They got a little momentum at the end of the period scoring a big goal for them on an innocent play, gave them some life.   
Took a couple funny penalties, they were both in our net, that was it.   
   
 Q.   Do you think maybe a key of not getting that third goal was significant?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Had a couple real nice looks there.   Still 2‑0.   We're still fine at 2‑0.   You know, we get in after two, you're up 2‑0, it's a different game.   
The way it turned on a dime like that, I don't know if we've seen a game like that all year where we're doing everything all right and all of a sudden it was a disaster.  
   
 Q.   Up 2‑0, playing as well as you were for 38 minutes, any lapse in concentration?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I don't know about that.   They got excitement.   One of those plays at the net goes in, you get energized off of that.   
We've seen this team in the playoffs, what they've been able to do when their backs are against the wall.   We got to play right through periods, we got to play right through games.   
They're relentless in a lot of ways.   We got to make sure when we get a chance like tonight, we got to put 'em away.   
   
 Q.   Did they deserve the credit or did you see the wheels coming off with your guys?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No.   I thought we played perfect for 38 minutes.   They get a break, it goes in.   Two power play goals that were nothing plays for me, ends up both in our net.   Now all of a sudden we got to press, open it up.   Played into their hands.
