 Q. Coach, just as far as this one, frustrating, disappointing that your team came out this way to start today?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE: Yeah, it was disappointing. It was, like you said, it was a tough start and it didn't slow down.   
I thought they were much more ready to start, way more intensity, way more urgency, way stronger in the puck area. We had delay in our game and too much hesitation.  
   
 Q. The Rozsival hit, just your thoughts on that and the game misconduct?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE: I think it was a major, it was a spontaneous play as a defenseman in that situation. He just played the man, unfortunately the player was injured.   
   
 Q. This week coming up, you've got one game in the next week. How tough is it to come off a game like this not be able to erase it as quickly as possible?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE: Certainly some things you can think about, and we can work on a couple of things in practice and get some emotion and intensity, even though a day like today we should be leaving it out there, but we got caught flat‑footed and basically chased the game.  
   
 Q. There have been a couple of these games here and there in the last couple of weeks where the slow start has developed into a 4‑0, 5‑0 game. Is it a concern or is it just blips on the radar?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE: We lost games here going into the break. It was an ugly game in Carolina. Thought we had a couple of games there, we can talk about the Florida game. We can talk about the [indiscernible] game as well. But not characteristic of our team game. From start to finish, you know, I think getting behind by a big margin or big number is something that we're unaccustomed to for the last three years. It's crept in a little bit in our game. It's something that can't happen at that regularity or happen at all.
