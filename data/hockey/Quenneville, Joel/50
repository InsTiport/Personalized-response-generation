THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Quenneville.   
   
 Q.   When they took the lead, did you say anything on the bench?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, the message was let's keep playing the right way and the same way.   We didn't want to change much.   They got a power play.   Obviously the building was loud.   
We didn't want to change.   We didn't want to go into an aggressive mode offensively where we get picked apart like a couple of games earlier.   
Obviously Duncan made a great move, Kaner had great play recognition.   Same thing on the next goal.   
These last two games, you can watch some hockey games, these are right up there.  
   
 Q.   What is the key from getting from the perimeter to the low slot, in the slot?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You need motion.   You need your D active in part of the attack.   Got some guys with patience and play recognition.   
But you got to get to the net.   That's how you get rewarded.   
   
 Q.   What is it about Kane, the patience he showed?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It wasn't like the first time we've seen it with him.   I don't think there's a player in the league that has a puck on his stick, time and possession in the course of a game, and he sees plays, makes plays.   The bigger the stage, too, he likes that challenge.   
   
 Q.   Talk about his demeanor.   He seems not to be overcome by the moment.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, that's a compliment to the quality of player that he is.   He's a special player.   Like we talk about our team, the bigger the challenge, the bigger the situation.   We don't change, we welcome the challenge.   
He can get it done as good as anybody in the game.   
   
 Q.   Crawford seemed frustrated by that third goal.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I didn't look at it after the game yet.   You know, guy is coming down the gut, we've seen a couple like that go in.   
I still think our team didn't change one iota or composure or thought process and approach.   I thought he battled back hard again, just like the last two games.   
   
 Q.   You've faced deficits like that, they've not surrendered.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Three lead changes in the third period.   In a big game like that, it's pretty amazing.   
But our guys, finding a way, it's a compliment to them.   
   
 Q.   How do they keep doing that over and over again?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, top players.   I mean, they want to win.   They find ways.   They challenge one another.   You see certain guys competing like that every shift.   I mean, you can't help but follow along and make your contribution.   
   
 Q.   Can you tell us about John Oduya, the big moment when he swatted that puck away?   Big relief?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We've got to get better at the front of our net.   I thought we were a little better that one shift in the second, a couple at the end.   
Johnny has a quick stick, good play recognition.   I think he's been good for us in the series as well.   Another good moment for him and us.   
   
 Q.   How does this series compare to a lot of the series you've coached, how is it playing out?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   This is the 'wow' factor in this series, especially the last two games.   We got two competitive teams that have experience, have experienced players, experience in the situation.   
You know, it's been amazing.   I mean, as good as it gets.  
   
 Q.   During the game, what does Kane do leadership‑wise?   Is he quiet?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I would say probably a balance between quiet, he can get excited.   He generally doesn't say too much.   
He wants to take charge.   He wants to do it by what he does on the ice.   His actions in the last two games speak very loudly about the kind of competitor he is, what type of player he is.   
He made us tonight, especially in that third period there, a couple huge plays.   We're going forward.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought tonight he was fine.   Stretch in the second period, that one shift, dangerous, battling.   They're hard at the net.   They make the goalies work.   They make him work hard.   You got to fight through a lot of traffic, loose pucks, get to the next save.   
   
 Q.   You shut down Marian Gaborik tonight.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's an ongoing challenge.   A test every shift, every game.   We talk about the meaning and value of every shift being important.   Against a team like that, there's no easy games or easy shifts.   That four‑line rotation is deep.   Gaborik, Carter line has been special this series.   That's the focus.
