THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Joel, it was last series you put Kane, Toews and Bickell together.   Kane comes up with a big goal.   Do it again tonight.   What was your thinking?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I like that line.   Big picture getting reunited, they seem to have some chemistry.   Scoring certainly helps.   
But, you know, got a little bit of difference, everybody in that line brings something different to the party.   Bicks off the rush can shoot.   Kaner has possession.   Johnny gets through.   It's a nice combination.   
So it was nice to see them back and productive, too.   
   
 Q.   With the way the Bruins came back, the chances you had, did you have any concerns in the back of your mind this could be one that was slipping away?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They got some momentum scoring that power play goal there, obviously tying it up twice.   Looked like they were in a good spot.   
I still thought in the third period we didn't give up a ton.   It was a five‑on‑five game.   Still had composure going into the overtime.   I thought the bench was where it needed to be.   
Certainly got the crowd, lost the momentum, had a nice lead.   But they press, their power play helped them tonight at well.   
We did a lot of good things tonight.   We'll look at the positives and move forward.   
   
 Q.   Are you kicking yourself a little bit that you didn't put Toews and Kane together earlier in the series?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You always get second guessed.   There's reasons why.   At the same time, you know, I think we didn't mind the way we played the first game, first part of the second game.   
Game3 we were disappointed with our offense.   So we went to the well.   I'm sure they're excited about returning together.   Maybe it looks like I didn't know what I was doing (laughter).   
   
 Q.   These two teams are so evenly matched, you and Coach Julien have a mutual respect.   What makes his team tough to play against?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They keep coming.   They're a hard‑working team.   They have skill on all their lines.   They have a mobile and active D.   They have big shots.   Defensively you're always going to get challenged and tested.   
But I thought we did a better job of our offense putting some pressure on their D.   
   
 Q.   Toews tonight gets a goal, but did you think this was one of his better games at least in the series?   Is Nick Leddy okay?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Nick is fine.   Johnny had the puck more today.   I thought he was more friendly with it.   That line was dangerous, be it off the rush, in zone.   Obviously scoring has got to help him.   
The excitement of that line, Kaner in possession, Bick around with the big body, they scored some different kind of goals.   But Johnny had a nice night.   
   
 Q.   Claude's defense is known for its layers.   You seemed to exploit that today.   How did you do it?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   One of those nights.   Some pucks go in.   We had some breaks around the net, found some loose pucks.   I thought we had way more traffic than the last game.   
If he sees the puck, he's going to be almost impossible to beat.   We want to make sure we get there and make it hard on him to find it, try to go on the second and third opportunity.   
Nice ending with traffic in the net, Seabs having a shot that tied us up.   
   
 Q.   Corey was fighting it a little on the glove side tonight.   Are you concerned about that going forward?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Corey has been great for us all year, all playoffs.   He just moves forward.   Commend him.   
We got the win.   You know, he'll be fine.   
Thank you.
