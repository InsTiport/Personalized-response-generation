    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Coach, talked about how important it is to be quick.   
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I still like the way we played the first period.   It was an injustice Tuesday being down 1‑0.   Make sure we don't get discouraged, find a way to persevere off the rush.   Nice entry, nice pass‑off, nice drive.   Good finish.   Good play by everyone on that line.   
    Good cycle shifts tonight.   
   
 Q.   Joel, going back to that first goal, is that almost a blueprint of what you need to do, fire and skate in position?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, that first shot against him is tough.   You need traffic.   You need a deflection.   He finds a way to find pucks.   
    I think the volume and traffics of shot is the only way to get to this guy.   
   
 Q.   You didn't have the lead, but had the puck the whole time in the first period.   Is that how you keep them from getting to their game?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I certainly liked our start.   I thought we did some good things playing in their zone, make them play in their own end.   
    It's easier said than done.   Everyone is going to get their turn.   But I still liked the way we played, the contribution we had from all the lines.   The D was active as well.   We're pleased.  
   
 Q.   Was Dave Bolland's shift his best?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Bolly is fine.   They're on there for the one goal.   One of those plays where you talk about everything going your way, then all of a sudden it's in our net.   
    I think Bolly is progressing in the playoffs.   Looks like he's finding a little bit more each way.   We're going to need him.   
   
 Q.   Do you have to tell a veteran team to stay with it, or do they already know that?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We mention it.   But they knew that.   We liked the way we played.   We exited the bench with a positive approach, keep playing the same way, stick with it.   
   
 Q.   What were your thoughts on the Bickell/Toews/Hossa line?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I liked it.   It was efficient.   A lot of puck time in offensive zone shifts.   They're dangerous off the rush.   Defensively down low in our end, a lot of kill plays as well.   
   
 Q.   Even though you get 17 shots, not all of them were necessarily with the traffic you'd like.   Was it good to have that kind of zone time on them in the first period?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Trying to get their D to turn or play in their end is something we want to establish.   Offensive zone possession is something that you're making them play in their end, you can wear them down, you get chances, shots.   Hopefully you get some power plays off of it.   
    It's easier said than done, like we just mentioned.   They're going to get their turn in our end.   
   
 Q.   Hossa and Sharp have been consistent for you.   What have they meant so far?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You can talk about those guys.   They scored big goals for us today.   We like their consistency, their production.   Today you could talk about every players' contribution to the team game.   That's what we're going to need and what we look forward to.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned you liked the first period.   Is it hard at all to fend off frustration coming into the locker room?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Our approach and demeanor was fine.   It's a long hockey game.   You keep doing that, eventually things should go your way.   Whether you get a lucky break or bounce, sometimes that's what we're going to need.   
    But let's make sure that the more pucks and the more bodies that go there, hopefully you get the right bounce.   
   
 Q.   Joel, one is on a rebound, a tip.   Those are things you talked about in terms of Quick and ways to beat this guy?  
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He sees the puck.   He's going to be tough.   He challenges.   He comes out.   It's the next one you have to hope for.   
    You want to make sure he has to look through something to find it.   Nice pass‑off, middle drive.   Nice entry as well, their D are activated.   We know if he sees it, we're going to have a hard time.   
    Thank you.
