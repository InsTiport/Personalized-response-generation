THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Coach, you talked about getting off to the fast start.   Could it have been any faster?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, I thought we had a real good start the first five minutes.   They had the next five.   I think we finished the rest of that period well.   They were all good starting the second. 
I think we got a little bit loose with our game after that.   But certainly put us in a real good spot. 

Q.   Your defensive core, how much are they activating what you do right now?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They've been quick in puck areas, they've been moving the puck, joining the attack, on the point in the offensive zone, complementing with our speed and forechecking. 
It's one more option offensively.   Seabs, exactly what we're talking about, exactly illustrates that deactivate with a big shot, heck of a shot, heck of a goal. 

Q.   You've been pretty dominant the first two games.   Going into a building where they haven't lost in the post‑season, what is the message?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We want to be excited.   We'll go on the plane tomorrow, get there.   It's going to be a hostile environment.   We want to make sure our start is going to be very important, that we're proactive in our game, and let's do the right things.

Q.   When you see your goaltender help defend your captain, is that a good thing or... 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You know, things happen.   Spontaneous combustion.   Sometimes you can't forecast or predict that stuff. 

Q.   How has Saad's play improved in the playoffs?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought he had a heck of a game tonight.   He was dangerous, a threat off the rush, had a lot of puck time.   Made some nice plays, some nice moves. 
Play like that really complements our team game. 

Q.   Can you talk about what Bryan Bickell has done the whole playoffs so far?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Bick, you noticed him in the game, with his size, whether it's on the forechecks with hits, getting to the front of net.   He's got a big shot, big size, skates well.   He does all the things you look forward to.   Power forward, talked about that earlier.   Around the net, some of them, they're going in for him.   I know he was fortunate in on that one, but fortunately he's in the right spots. 

Q.   With how hyped Jonathan Quick was coming into the series, are you surprised your team was able to chase him out of the game?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, we had some nice shots.   We had some high‑quality stuff off the rush, as well, in that period.   I still think that's going to be an ongoing challenge with him. 
Some nights they go in.   But I still think he's a special goalie that we got to keep trying to‑‑ if we got the quality, we got the quality.   But trying to make it quality by what we do has to be something we look forward to. 

Q.   For the most part through the first two games, you've been able to dictate tempo and style of play.   Is your speed game, transition game working the way you want it to?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, I know when we make them play defense, it plays into our favor.   We want to make sure if you don't get pucks in, you're in your end the rest of the shift.   We want to make sure making them turn, playing in their end, be it cleanly or indirectly, both teams, that's their motivation.   Getting it out as quickly as possible.   That's the game.   Utilizing the speed in the puck area is something we'll try to get better at, as well. 
Thank you.
