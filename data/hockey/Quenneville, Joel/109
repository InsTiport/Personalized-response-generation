 JAMEY HORAN: First question. 

 Q. Coach, you made a significant line change tonight. How important was that to the victory? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I thought we had good energy right from the outset. Great pace. Had speed on all the lines. I think there was some balance as far as offensive ability, reliability defensively. Kept that pace from start to finish. 
 And I think it was a good start, and I think we kept going and we made it a little interesting, more than we would have liked, but I like the speed in our game. 

 Q. Coach, was that your best first period of the postseason so far? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: For sure, for me. And I thought that was the pace that we have been looking for this whole series. Had something to build off of for sure. 

 Q. You alluded to it a bit ago, good start. Tell me about the finish. Could it have been better in your mind? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: They're a dangerous team. They've got a lot of guys who can make plays. They can see plays. They make plays. Especially when they can press and they are going for it. I think we have to make sure the score is important to shut down defensively and make sure that we emphasize coverage in our own zone. 
 I still thought our D did some good things. Whether it was I'm some getting involved in the attack. They had a pretty good gap most of the game. I think around our net we could be better. 

 Q. Joel, back to the line changes. Concerted effort to have Kane, Toews and Buff on three different lines? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, I think I wasn't really sure what line they were going to go after as far as Prongs what they were going to do with that combination, different combinations. 
 But I still thought the lines we wanted to play against, the forward lines was in place. We were going to take whatever we got. 

 Q. Joel, how important was it to sort of victimize Pronger at the same time that Byfuglien makes a big appearance in the series? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I think Buff has been a big factor as we've gone along here in these playoffs. Maybe everybody said he was quiet. I still thought he was a presence early in the first two games here at home. Maybe the last couple didn't make as much noise. 
 But I thought he was a factor like he's been probably in all the games in the last couple of rounds going into this round. I thought he made a big imprint in the outcome in the game tonight. 
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you.
