THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You said you wanted more from Patrick Kane as far as his performance the last two nights, but especially tonight.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   That was more than more.   It was certainly an outstanding game by him.   A great play, winning goal by Johnny.   I thought Kaner played a heck of a game in Games 4 and 5 for us, led with having the puck a lot.   Time of possession was very high end.   
   
 Q.   Was there anything different with him?   He sat and talked to us for 10 or 15 minutes before the last two games.   Was there anything different with him in the way he played?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, he stepped up.   He took on the responsibility of leading the team.   Proven he's a top player in the game.   He made special plays over the two games.   Nice to see him finish it off in a real positive way for us.   
But, you know, top players, they want to be great all the time.   Finding a way to be great in the tight checking that many teams have in our league, commend him on two outstanding games.   
   
 Q.   The feeling never gets old going back to the finals.   Talk about returning there to the highest stage of hockey.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We've had an interesting playoffs.   I think as we progressed here, had an ordinary start in the first series, on the ropes, three games against Detroit.   I thought we've gotten better as we've gone along in these playoffs.   
You look back over several games of your career, that was a game you'll always remember.   
That was an amazing hockey game.   Give L.A. credit.   You go up a goal late in the game.   The guys, commend them, staying positive, perservering.   L.A. might have played their best in overtime this series.   
Finding a way was exactly what we were looking for.  
   
 Q.   As far as that late goal, a couple of players were saying they kept the same attitude they did in Game 7.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, I think we had the approach when we left the bench, you know, it was almost like, Wow!   Going in the locker room, be positive, find a way.   But they certainly came at us in the overtime.   
   
 Q.   Corey grinded through again for you guys.   He watched the last time you were there.   He was sort of a part of it.   This is his ride now.   What's different for a guy like that?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You got to commend him on how he's played all year long.   I think the consistency, his approach where he just moves forward to see the next situation, the next shot.   Unflappable in that area.   
He's moved us along here.   Guys have responded in front of him.   But Corey has been rock solid.   I think his rebound control, his movement, you know, handling the puck has really been‑‑ really done a nice job in this playoff.   
   
 Q.   Given what you just said about the Kings and the overtime, was it then maybe to your advantage the longer this game went on?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You know, they played some tough games, a couple tough series.   But we certainly went through an emotional series with Detroit.   
You know, overtime, you got to get a break.   Obviously special pass, special shot ended it.   But it's tough to say.   You know, obviously you need a break.   We got the first one.   
   
 Q.   After the start, the first six minutes, such a flurry, very impressive.   Was it inevitable there was going to be a letdown?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I don't know if letdown is the word.   They got the Cup.   For all the right reasons, they're one of the teams that is going to keep coming at you.   Losing a shorthanded game, you're going to lose some momentum.   Then penalty killing.   Now it's a hockey game.   
It was very close.   I don't necessarily want to say high‑quality chances.   It was one of those games, very nerve‑wracking from the fans' point of view, exciting at our bench level, but definitely had some highs and lows.   I don't think you can have that gap any wider than was out there tonight.   
   
 Q.   Duncan obviously upset about the suspension.   What was his mindset like the last few days?   Did you feel good about him coming in fresh?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought he had an outstanding start to the game.   Logged 40 minutes.   Was out there with a great gap.   Cut up and stopped several plays with a quick stick.   
He was over it when it happened.   Put it behind him.   I'm sure he was excited about playing tonight.   Got a rare opportunity, one of those bag skates in L.A.   Let's go.   
   
 Q.   At any point did you feel the need to go over to Bickell and ask him how he was?   He was the one that committed the penalty to led to Kopitar's goal.   Do you feel a need to talk to a guy like that before overtime?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Commend Bick.   He still does a lot of things.   He creates a lot through the rush, in the puck area, around the net, finishing touches.   I thought Bick had an amazing series.   We want him to keep playing like that.   Sometimes you get called on it, but we don't want him to change much.   
   
 Q.   I'm sure you'd be happy facing anybody in the Stanley Cup Finals.   It is an original six matchups, first one in 34 years.   Does that add to the whole mystique of the finals?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's a special couple places, the tradition of the Bruins and the Hawks is special.   I'm sure, you know, the rivalry could return instantly come Game1.   
I think it's good for the league.   It's good for hockey.   Two great hockey markets.   We're very excited to be a part of it.   
   
 Q.   What about the uniqueness of this series because you haven't faced each other during the regular season?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, I think everybody was speculating that at the beginning of the year, how was that going to play out.   I'm sure we got to see Boston quite a bit.   I'm sure they watched every bit of our games.   
They're on an amazing roll.   They were on the ropes in one game, we were on the ropes for three.   They got a lot of momentum where they're at right now.   Should set up for a great final.   
Thank you.
