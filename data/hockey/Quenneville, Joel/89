THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   What was the thinking in terms of shuffling the left wings there? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We haven't seen this team there.   I thought offensively, defensively, I don't know if we've seen a line like that all year. 
I thought they had a monster game, their top line.   Maybe we were looking for a little bit more balance, keeping aware of that line. 
But they were tough to handle. 

Q.   In general terms, how do you describe the emotions of overcoming, and Corey Crawford?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Crowe was great.   He kept us in there.   He made several all‑alone plays and saves.   Had some odd‑man breaks, some dangerous looks.   He was great. 
Found the puck, challenged.   A lot of pucks at the net, a lot of bouncing pucks with traffic, and a big penalty kill as well. 

Q.   With Andrew Shaw facing Chara tonight, what were your thoughts of him tonight?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He's a competitor.   He does things game in, game out.   The bigger the stage, the bigger the challenge, he rises to the occasion.   He knows where the front of net is.   Doesn't have to be pretty.   He's a warrior.   He's one of those guys that you appreciate he's on your side and he's relentless. 

Q.   You weren't afraid to roll that fourth line a lot.   Talk about their performance as the game went on. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   All year along, they gave our team, you're comfortable against them, against any line in a defensive line faceoff, matchups, very responsible.   They had a lot of energy shifts.   Seems like they would always start in our end, end in the other team's end.   They haven't been together in a while, but like they played all year together today. 

Q.   In terms of the series moving forward, how do you regroup from something like this? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We got a couple of days in between here.   Just basically played two hockey games in one night. 
So get some rest for tomorrow.   Get excited about coming in here on Saturday night.   I think we haven't seen that team all year, but judging by the way the game went, we're going to have to be ready. 

Q.   How comfortable are you with the power play, especially the five‑on‑three problems?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Couple looks that could have been dangerous that didn't materialize.   Certainly we left one out there.
