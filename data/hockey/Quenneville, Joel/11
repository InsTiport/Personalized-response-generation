THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Team always talks about trying to find a way and everything.   Considering not a whole lot there in the first 40 minutes, how much was it really that in the third tonight?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we had a good second.   We had some good quality stuff at their net that we were better than we were in the first period, generated some flow in our game. 
Third period we got the lead.   They came at us.   They're a dangerous team.   If we're not aware by now, that's a good hockey team.   That's where we're at. 

Q.   In that first period, what wasn't clicking maybe?   Was it difficult for the guys to stay patient?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think half the period was special teams.   That was part of it.   Then we picked up some momentum in the second, got going, started skating. 
I don't think we were quick enough to begin the game.   Spent too much time basically not generating in our end. 

Q.   You talk about Brandon Saad's playoffs, his Finals.   Seems like every game he finds a way to bring it up another level. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I loved his game tonight.   Great power move to the net.   Gives us speed.   Use him in all situations.   He's fast, he's big, he's strong, he's dangerous.   Very good performance.

Q.   The gamesmanship at the lines, the players said they knew ahead of time, running the different ones in the warmups.   In a series this close, are you just looking for any edge you can possibly get, the element of surprise?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Whether it's an element of surprise...   I mean, we expected their other goalie in the net tonight, too.   I guess it's 50/50 tonight (laughter). 

Q.   You have a core group of Toews and Kane and Hossa who have been here for two championships and a third run here, Shaw and Saad came in after, Teuvo this year.   How do you bring guys into the fold the way the team has done?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Every guy's got a different file to him.   Saader and Shawsy spent some time in the lockout season playing in the American League.   Teuvo did that this year as well.   I think that's a good foundation for these young players.   Nothing's given to them.   They got to earn it. 
When they come into their team, they got to earn it as well.   They're certainly high‑end players that certainly contribute in their ways.   They get to watch some top players and learn the right way how to prepare, how to compete, how to play. 
Eventually they grab a little bit more responsibility, in all their cases.   It's an organization, there's some upside for these younger guys.   I think that's good for the future of the team, as well. 

Q.   Do you ever think that Duncan Keith might be able to play like an entire 60‑minute game?   It doesn't seem like there's ever too much for him. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, you know, we get asked that a lot in the last two rounds, how he handles it.   It's almost like the more he plays, the better he gets.   The more he enjoys it. 
So it's a great spot to be in as a team, knowing that as play picks up, the more he gets.   The bigger the games you're getting, the more he's getting, too. 
He prepares well.   Took the morning off this morning.   He was ready to go all night.   He's a great player and fun to coach. 

Q.   Could you explain what you were hoping to achieve or the motivation behind the shuffle up front?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We were looking for balance in our lineup.   I don't think we had enough offense from our group.   I just thought last game Johnny's line has been generating most of our offense.   We're trying to get some secondary scoring or secondary balance, get a more complete team game. 
I thought we had some better stretches.   Even though we didn't have any production for the first part of the game, the five‑on‑five game really wasn't giving up anything.   That's usually how I measure our performance. 

Q.   Corey talked about being displeased with his performance the last two games.   Did you feel he needed to play better to give you a chance to win?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We know the importance of goaltending game in, game out.   I thought he was outstanding tonight.   Call it a 'goalie win.'   Loved how he battled.   He's a battler.   Great illustration how he stayed with it, how they swarmed us at the end.   His movement, he was following the puck.   He was big.   He was big.   Nice response. 

Q.   How impressed are you by his resiliency that he's shown through the playoffs and over the years with all the criticism that he gets?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, you know, I think probably a little bit more than a lot of top players.   Goaltenders obviously get a lot more scrutiny.   They measure a lot of times the ones that go in, not the ones you save.   He always looks to push through, stop the next puck. 
We saw in 2013 what he's capable of doing.   This season, regular season‑wise, he was outstanding.   So we're happy to have him.   We know the way he prepares and likes the battle. 

Q.   What did you think of Timonen's game?   Did he earn the right to play again in the series?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I liked him.   He's safe, simple, smart, hard in the puck area.   He knows how to play in his own end.   I like that predictability in his game.   The crossbar in the end of the third, would have been a nice treat.   We didn't mind his game. 

Q.   What is it about your high‑end players that allows them to come through in this type of situation?   Is it mental makeup, skill? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We got a lot of guys that are top‑end guys.   We don't just really look for one or two guys.   I think they get some help along the way. 
When you make lines, there's a lot more options out there.   Sometimes we look for balance.   Sometimes we look for matchups.   At the end of the day, I think that getting the other team more concerned about different guys makes us a deeper team. 
That's why we say it a lot.   I don't care who scores goals.   Some nights it's the least‑expected guys.   But most of the time the charge is led by our top guys. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Thanks.
