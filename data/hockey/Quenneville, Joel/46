  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Heading into Game5, Brandon Saad said, We need to relax.   Are you kind of sensing that same vibe, that confidence, that optimism?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We want the same approach.   I thought Game5 we came into the game knowing we had a couple little changes in the line.   But I thought we had a good start to the game, good consistency to our game.   I thought we rose to the challenge of what was at stake. 
I thought each and every game in the series I thought we've progressed, played better.   We needed to, as well, in those last two games.

Q.   No idea if the lineup will look the way it looked out there in lines.   Looked like the third line had a change‑up with Sharp and Kruger and Smith. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They played a lot in the last two games.   They scored a big goal for us last game.   They give us some speed, some ability to check.   I think they give us some balance, as well. 
I thought the three of them worked well together two games ago.   Played together a lot.   For sure, the overtime part. 

Q.   Do you prepare any differently for a Game 7?   Obviously the emotional edge is there.   Do you approach it any differently?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No, I think it's our same approach.   We want to make sure we're playing the right way.   Expect the fast pace.   Expect the start to be at that point where you make sure there's a purpose behind everything you do because things are going to happen so quickly. 
Our game day routine, going into the game, in the game, on the bench, we want to be consistent.   That's the thing you like about our team, the way they prepare, the way they walk on the bigger stages, bigger challenges.   They seem to move on and grab it. 
We got a real good group in that fashion so it's the same approach. 

Q.   (Question regarding 'frills' speech pregame.)
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No frills tonight. 

Q.   Can you get a sense on the bench when Patrick has the puck on his stick that something might be happening? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He has the puck a lot.   Certain nights he gets through it a little easier than others.   He gets a lot of attention. 
But as far as play recognition, have a pretty good awareness of where the other four guys around the rink are, it's pretty unique. 
He's really been dominating in certain areas the last couple games.   His production reflects that the best.   The finish is something that some games you'll look at him, he looks like he could have had four or five points in the game, he didn't get any.   Some nights they do go in.   It's difficult to forecast the finished product with him.   You know when he has the puck on his stick, generally good things happen.

Q.   What do you remember about memorable Game 7s that you played in?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Last year is the most recent one.   It was a great game.   A tremendous pace against Detroit. 
It was an amazing start to the game.   The building was ecstatic.   Seabs scoring in overtime was a great ending. 
Certainly been some good ones along the way.   That's as good a one as I've ever been in. 
I remember Game 7 against the Canadiens in MontrÃ©al, Lemieux scoring.   That was a heck of a game.

Q.   What's the best explanation for the goals you've scored against this defense?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We have some balanced scoring.   Kaner's line, Saad and Shaw.   Our power play scored goals in the last two games.

Q.   There's been a lot of goals scored in the series.   You've talked about resiliency.   Is part of that sometimes there's goals that get in behind you that you think shouldn't have been scored and you have to overcome it?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, I think we've probably been the recipient of some of these situations you're talking about where we don't like the quality or quantity of goals we're giving up.   We always preach defense.   We measure our effectiveness by how low we check.   That's going to be our challenge tonight. 
I don't think it changes our approach, being ahead or being behind how we go into games in any key moments of the games.   Let's keep perservering with our personnel, there's ways to generate some offense.   We know our opponents have a lot of the same similarities.   It makes for a great matchup. 

Q.   Two straight years against L.A.   Doesn't seem to be bad blood.   Feels more like the Boston series where the rivalry is built on respect, great hockey.   Does it feel that way?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Great hockey for sure.   Bad blood, the guys are as competitive as heck.   We've seen some big hits in the last few games.   Respect is a key. 
But I think there's a lot of experienced guys that know what it takes to win.   Playing the right way is something that we stress.   You got to make sure that's a priority. 
Bad blood, getting even, is on the scoreboard at the end of the night.

Q.   Playing with this team the last couple years, is that an extra bonus for a guy like Saad's development?   Some guys go home in April, come back in October. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think it helps players, whether you get playoff experience, big‑game settings, big moments, quality ice time, important shifts.   You get more comfortable in that situation. 
I think a good illustration how he's progressed in this series, getting I don't want to say attention, but getting quality ice, taking advantage of it. 
But we like the progress.   A young kid that his upside is definitely big.
