THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Coach, going into the third period, obviously they're very good with the lead, at the same time how much did you talk about third periods have been good for you, pushing the pace a little more?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, we got better as the game went on.   I thought our second period improved after the first.   We had a slow start in the third.   A lot of zone time, threats off the rush as well.   Obviously a huge goal with traffic.   Nice shot by Vermy.   Turned out to be a great third period.   
   
 Q.   How do you explain Teuvo coming through in the clutch again?   What did you think of his first Final game?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought he got better like our team did as the game went on.   Couple of plays.   Made a play at the net.   He scored some goals in this playoff as they progressed by just putting it at the net.   He has the shoot‑first mentality.   He's got a decent shot, pretty good looks.   Getting that net front presence by Krugs.   He was the one that forced the play to Vermy on the goal.   
So it was a couple real nice plays by a guy that has a nice upside.   
   
 Q.   Is Bryan Bickell still injured or was that a coach's decision?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Day‑to‑day.   Upper body.   I think he's close.   We'll see how he is the next day or so.   
   
 Q.   You come away with the win, you're satisfied with that.   The first 53 minutes leave you enough to be satisfied with?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Last half of the game, I thought we were fine.   Playing catch‑up against a team that was comparable the last two series, when they get the lead on you, prevent defense, tough to get through.   They check well, got good sticks, they got quickness.   
Basically we had to get through.   But finding a way today is a good illustration of what this team's all about.   Finding ways to win, probably a good example of that tonight.   
   
 Q.   Kris Versteeg went face first into the post hard, then straight to the penalty box.   What measures are taken to make sure he's okay?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   There's a protocol in the league as far as head blows.   We'll call them concussions, but I don't think it was a concussion.   There's certain measures that we have to follow.   
   
 Q.   Were they followed?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Absolutely.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Thank you.
