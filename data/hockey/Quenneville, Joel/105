 JAMEY HORAN: Questions for Coach.   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I would rather be drinking champagne right now.   
  
  Q. Coach, just wanted to wish you congratulations. Before you break down the game, if you want to look at any tape, can you take moment and think about what you might be doing with the Stanley Cup soon?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, I know that when you get to this stage and everybody is wondering about those kind of things and we try to part that and not be a part of the conversation, it can be distracting.   
 But when you look at the chance to win the Cup and you have a couple of extra days in between days and it seems like the clock doesn't move and it's so far away, game day today seemed like forever to get to the game.   
 Now all of a sudden you're three minutes away from winning the Cup and all of a sudden they score. The guys just had a great approach in the locker room after the third. Very diligently went about our business in the overtime.   
 I think Kaner might have been the only guy in ice level who knew it went in. Brad in the video room knew it was in too. When the puck went in the back of the net at ice level, we knew the party was on. The guys at the other end celebrating knew it was in too. It's a great hockey game. Philly I thought was extremely competitive. Was a great series. Exciting games.   
 Wow, tonight's game, the pace was all-world. I thought we played our two best games, Games 5 and 6, maybe all playoffs.   
  
  Q. Coach, I think it was fair to say this is one of the stranger endings in sports history, probably. What were you thinking when you saw the puck do whatever you saw it do and all of a sudden your team is jumping off celebrating. Can you take us through that 30 seconds or whatever?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, when it went in, I don't think too many people knew it went in. But it made a funny strange sound. Like the back of the leather and the back of the net. And I asked Kaner where did it go in? He said it went in long pad, five hole, in that area. I couldn't look at the replay yet. I'm sure we'll see it a lot. It was just the sound.   
 We're standing on the bench, Brad came out from the video and said it was in. And the guys at the other end when they lifted up the net when they went searching for the puck, it was underneath in there deep. They lifted it up it fell through. We knew that was the winner. It was an amazing game. It was an amazing-paced played game. But it is a strange ending.   
  
  Q. I like what you just said about how these last few days, the clock didn't move. Could you maybe expound on how you helped the veterans and rookies alike this doesn't come along too often, the chance to win a Stanley Cup?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE: It is a special time of the year, and a special couple of days. Having guys been there and done that helped stabilize the guy's mindset. After winning Game 5 two days off, guys like John Madden, Hossa has been there the last two years. Kopey has been there. Laddy has won. I think they helped stabilize the guy's mindset.   
 Sometimes you try to move all of a sudden the distraction becomes part of your game. That never occurred with this group. I thought game days preparation today was outstanding. I thought we had a tremendous morning skate. Guys were tentative meetings. Bench was rock solid. Great start to the game and good composure after giving up a very tough goal where you look like you're there and it looks like it could be so far away. ahead and you can get off-kilter and   
  
  Q. Joel, I just wondered, the first guy Jonathan gave the Cup to was Hossa. I just wonder was that planned in advance? Also, what did Marian bring to you this year, after losing the Final two years in a row and to get one with you guys?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, I don't know if it was planned or not. Very apropos. I think the right guy got it first after being so close two years in a row. I thought he was a huge factor in tonight's game. I thought he was a monster out there. Had the puck. You couldn't get it off him.  I think he showed that he wanted to make sure he was winning the Cup here tonight. Finally achieved that goal of being a champion, even though not too many guys are going to go to the Finals three years in a row. Played 12 rounds and knowing that his approach in the last couple of days was just excellent. I think the guys fed off that preparation that he had.   
  
  Q. Obviously, being an original six city, you'll be fed and celebrated quite well, I would think. How soon before you start preparing for next year? Can you really savor this one long? Is your city going to let you just win one and be done?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, we're going to enjoy it first. I think the party in Chicago is going to be all-world. Everybody is excited. We had a lot of fans here today and tonight. That support is much appreciated. The city is going to be very excited when we get back. We're going to have fun with it. We'll have a couple -- we'll have plenty of time to sort outgoing into the summer and going into this next season. But it's been a long time. I think we should enjoy it for a while and then go from there.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about Jonathan winning the Conn Smythe?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Jonathan Toews is a special human being. A young kid, had one of those years. Big player in the Olympics. Big player for us in the playoffs. The bigger the setting, the bigger the game. The bigger he seems to rise to that challenge and that occasion. He was a big factor tonight.  I thought that line was -- had the puck in the offensive zone. Set the tone right off the first shift of the game. And was a big factor in his leadership. Doesn't say too much, but his competitiveness of wanting to be the best he can be every time he hits the ice is noticed.   
  
  Q. Coach, what did you tell Peter after the game?   
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I just said, Peter, you did a great job all year. You overcome incredible odds. And you should be very proud how competitive his team was and how organized the team played. I thought he did a tremendous job.   
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.
