THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   As far as Marian Hossa, when did you know it was possible he was in and out?   What is his status?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We'll say day‑to‑day.   We're hopeful he'll be ready for the next game.   
It was a game‑time decision after the warmup there.   That's when we made the call, after warmup.   
   
 Q.   Upper, lower?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Upper.   
   
 Q.   You had to insert Ben Smith.   Does that help at all that you had a player coming in who played here in college, is a little familiar?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Benny gives us energy.   He's one of those players that offensively, defensively, he's responsible.   He's been practicing hard.   
You lose a guy like Hoss, he'll fill a little bit of skill for us, as well.   
   
 Q.   In terms of just the lack of offense that the team has had lately, how much do you chalk that up to things they may be doing to shut the offense down, as opposed to playoff hockey?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's a low‑chance game.   It's a low‑chance series.   Scoring first is important, even though the winners of the last couple games prior to that didn't score first.   
It's hard to get A‑plus chances.   You have to manufacture the second, kind of ugly goals, tip screens, deflections.   
If they give up the rush, they're not going to give up much, even though we had a couple looks in the third.   The frequency of having high‑quality chances in this series at both ends has not been there.   
   
 Q.   If you can't get specific, can you clarify reports about Hossa being hit by a puck?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Nothing happened during warmup.   
   
 Q.   Dave Bolland had a tough night.   What did you see out there?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Haven't talked to him yet.   We'll reassess and reevaluate the game.   
Certainly I liked our first.   Didn't mind our third.   Lost a lot of momentum on their first goal.   Five‑on‑three situation was something, that was the game.   We got to make sure that every play is critical, every shift is important, value being out there and doing the right thing.   Managing the puck is kind of what we're talking about on those situations.   
   
 Q.   What in particular has Boston done to frustrate your power play?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Our power play coming out of the last round, you know, I thought tonight we had a real good look early, maybe another good look there.   Our power play tonight was definitely not good.   
   
 Q.   Did you get much consideration to putting Toews and Kane back together five‑on‑five?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They had a couple looks together.   It's something that is available.   But, you know, that's on a need basis.   That's something you can always go to.   
   
 Q.   The faceoffs were pretty lopsided tonight.   Do you know why?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You can talk about that and our power play.   Those were basically the differentials in the game.   
   
 Q.   Can you pinpoint what exactly was going wrong on the power play?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They box you out.   They got big bodies.   They blocked shots.   I think we had some chances to get some pucks through the net, we didn't.   Our entries weren't great.   That's something you want to look at.   
   
 Q.   You had a tough grind in the last series.   Are you finding this is even a heavier game they're playing?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, you're not going to get a ton.   I think as we progress, you look at Detroit, L.A. and here, scoring opportunities every day.   It's tough to get to double‑digits.   It's a tight game and scoring is going to be challenging.   
But we got to be ready to play that kind of game.   Let's look to get that first goal and try to sustain it.   It's not like that we want to go out‑race them, and exchange high scoring chances off the rush.   That's what they want to do.   We have to be ready.   We play a patient came, capitalize, get opportunities, and hopefully we get the power play rolling.  
   
 Q.   Hossa's absence seemed to jumble the lines from top to bottom.   How much did so many changes affect the rhythm or your offense?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I didn't mind the first period.   I thought we had a first period coming in here in this building, did what we wanted to do.   They got momentum off scoring first.   
The second period slowed us down.   Obviously getting their second goal.   But third period, we were pressing, we were coming‑‑ it's tough D.   They're a good D already, it's tough to generate a lot.   
I didn't mind the lines.   I didn't mind our start.   I thought we had balance.   That was the reason.   
   
 Q.   You're always going to face a hot goalie in the playoffs.   What is Rask presenting to you that maybe you haven't seen thus far?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We ran up against some of the best goalies in the league here.   Tonight I thought we made it rather easy on him as far as traffic and finding and seeing pucks.   I think we got to be better at going to the net in non‑puck areas.  
   
 Q.   Coming back to Ben Smith, late addition to the lineup, was there any message to him about what he were looking for from him?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, Benny, he can play both sides of the puck, brings a responsible game.   That's what we're looking for.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
