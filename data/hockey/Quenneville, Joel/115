 JAMEY HORAN: Questions for Coach Quenneville. 

 Q. Coach, it seems in the last couple of games that the Flyers have carried the play in the third period. I wonder how have they been doing that, and how do you counter it? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I thought we were pretty effective for the first 40 minutes. We were pretty good at the start of the third when we scored. Then they scored in the following shift. I think we lost a lot of momentum there right away. Didn't get a chance to take advantage of playing with the lead. 
 And they had some shifts in their end and maybe not as composed with the puck as we would like to be. We spent some time in our end, not as bad as last game. But I thought in overtime we had a couple of good looks there with a chance to end there. It's what happens in OT. 

 Q. Coach, every game so far has been a one-goal game. Is this what you expect for the remainder of this Series? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: You never know. It's very competitive. It's a fast-paced game. Fast-paced series. Both teams have some weapons that can attack offensively. I think they are respectful for their attack games as well. 
 You can't forecast scores. We have had a wild first game. A little bit lower scoring last game. This game is on the line from start to finish, as all three games have been. But it's entertaining hockey, and the pace is all out. 

 Q. Do you think that Chris Pronger got under the skin of Dustin Byfuglien at some point in this game? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I think Buff is pretty composed. I think Buff has been a factor and something they have to be concerned about. I just think we have to play hard against Prongs, and Buff knows where he gets rewarded by going to the net. But he'll continue to battle and persevere and do what he has to do. 

 Q. I know it's a tough loss. Do you take any positives out of the game? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: First 40 minutes we started the game there, and it was the way we wanted to begin the game, and did some good things. I thought we had speed. We were dangerous in a lot of ways. They had two power-play goals to get themselves in a good position. And we battled back there, key goal there in the second. 
 In the third period, anything can happen. You start overtime, that look. It's one of those games that from start to finish could have gone either way. Timely goal by them at the end. We had some timely goals ourselves. It's pretty competitive where we're at. 
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you, Coach.
