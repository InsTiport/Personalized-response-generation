THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   With that disallowed one happening, was there anything said as far as making sure everybody stayed the course after that one?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we lost a little momentum there.   They scored, equalized.   Dunk scored a good goal.   I thought playing with the lead, I thought we were fine, but still very tight.   It was a good hockey team over there.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I didn't get one right away, but a couple seconds later it was ruled incidental contact.   
   
 Q.   Are you buying that?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No comment.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we had some that were restricted, but they're a good off‑the‑rush team.   They create rush chances themselves.   
Just because you're going one way doesn't mean you're going back the other way.   I think we have to respect that knowing we don't want to get into a complete rush game with them, knowing the quality is going to be higher end with them.   It's all going to be determined by how well we check.   
We have to do things quick, quick, quick, whether it's puck movement or indirect play.   I think we have to use their speed.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel about Leddy's performance today?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He was okay.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about defending their top line.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's going to be a work in progress, a challenge game in, game out.   They got three nice players that all complement one another.   They're dangerous.   Every time they touch the puck, every time they're on the ice, you got to be aware.   
   
 Q.   Did you see fatigue from them at all?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we had a good first five minutes or so.   They came back on us pretty even most of the way.   Had some stretches in the second where they had the play.   
But they got balance on their four lines.   They get energy from everybody.   Very active D.   Every shift going forward is going to be important in this series.  
   
 Q.   Besides presence in front of the net, is it as simple as being there or is there a trick to be there, stay there?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You got to be there first.   There's a willingness to get there.   Probably a price to pay.   Sometimes they go off you.   I know they've had some success by being there, fortunate bounces off our pads or sticks, we don't even know it hits us.   
It all makes your power play work by being there first of all, then you get a shooting mentality.   If you're looking for a perfect goal on a power play it's not going to happen.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like the championship experiences of your team come to bear in situations like with that waved‑off goal, then L.A. scoring?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yeah, well, you got to commend our players for not changing their approach in big games.   I think there's always going to be adversity in the course of a game, you're always going to lose momentum in the course of a game.   Against a good team like that, you want to get it back as quick as you can, which I thought was a big point in today's win.   
I think our guys are very resilience and I think our top guys lead the guard in that area.   
   
 Q.   You can't review goalie interference.   Where are you on that?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think the way the standard is, the way the rules are, I think you've got to‑‑ goalies need protection.   I understand that.   
Thank you.
