    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (Question regarding Vermette.) 
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They're so competitive.   They want to play in the worst way and they want more ice time, as well.   You can understand where he was at.   Very disappointed.   He's a great pro.   Stayed with it.   That line had a couple looks in overtime.   I'm glad he finished it for us.   That was a huge goal for us.   Huge, goal, huge. 

Q.   What is about your team and success in overtimes? 
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think that our mindset is staying with it, somebody will either make a great play.   But then again you don't want to be too in a hurry to make that play because sometimes that can bite you.   Being patient. 
    The same approach that's probably gone on every single shift throughout this series.   That third period was a little bit haywire compared to what we saw as far as trying to score goals, scoring chances.   Pucks were going in at a different rate.   Got a little bit more consistent in that overtime. 
    Both teams had some consistent looks at well.   Commend the guys staying with it.   Probably their focus between periods, reenergizing, channeling in the right way. 

Q.   Joel, what was going through your head when they scored three goals in 37 seconds?
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought it was the worst time I ever called (laughter).   They scored right away, I'm going, Oh, my God, we don't have a timeout, down a goal.   10 minutes to go in the game.
    My group find ways.   It was one of those stretches where our guys find ways instead of looking for the out.   It's an amazing group.   Tonight is a good illustration of it. 

Q.   With Toews and Saad scoring their first goals since the beginning of the month, how important is it to get those guys going?
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Both those guys had monster games, not just production‑wise, but their pace off the rush, possession‑wise.   They were dangerous.   Two key goals.   Looks like we're on our way. 
    But I say two key goals, the two they scored in the third.   Saad's shorthanded goal was a special goal as well.

Q.   The three goals in 37 seconds was the fastest in NHL history.   You had the assist in Toronto in '79.   Do you remember that at all?
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No (laughter).   No, I have no clue. 

Q.   That didn't come up for you?
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I didn't get many points either, by the way (laughter). 

Q.   Joel, I believe if my math is right, this is the sixth time in the playoffs you guys have given up at least three goals in one period, but you've won four of those games.   Talk about the mettle that this team has. 
    COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Different ways.   I think this series has been played very tight, but there's a lot of pace to it that all of a sudden things could be a little unpredictable.   We've had some crazy endings with them in the regular season and past games as well. 
    This series has been played at that pace.   Tonight we saw a crazy third period, then got a little bit back to normal.   Can't be any more even than what I saw in four games. 
    Thanks.
