 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Quennville.   
  
  Q. Your team seemed to respond and control the game for much of the game, yet how tough is it to lose in that situation?  
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: It was a brutal loss today. Do a lot of right things. Still can't be satisfied with certain things. Got a couple days to gather some momentum and feel that the things we do well, we got to build upon.   
 But right now it's a tough one.   
  
  Q. Coach, the talk after Game 1 was better puck management, putting it in the right places. Tonight you had a couple of turnovers. Can you talk about were you guys better and what happened on a couple of those plays there?   
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: Well, I don't think we've seen it all year, but we've given up three goals with puck possession in the offensive blueline. We have the puck, but we don't block shots. All three of them are in our net, all huge goals.   
  
  Q. Joel, can you talk about the line changes, what your idea was in doing that before the game, how were you trying to shake the club up?  
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: We just wanted a little more balance. We feel like everybody's played with everybody throughout the year. You know, I just think that we had consistency in our game. You know, second period, slowed down a little bit.   
 But, you know, I think guys are compatible with whoever they're out there with. Got some different options. You know, I thought we did some good things. Tough loss, though.   
  
  Q. Coach, you had some better play from Jonathan and Patrick tonight. Can you talk about how they played tonight versus Game 1.   
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: Well, Game 1, I didn't mind the way they played, but they were better tonight. I thought our whole group was way better tonight. I thought we had more consistency in our individual games and team games as well. But I thought they both had real good games.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the daunting task of trying to beat this team four out of the next five?  
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: Well, we want to beat them one game, and that's the next one. That's our concern. We should be excited about getting back to the United Center. Get the extra day off in between here to recapture some confidence and enthusiasm and, you know, move forward.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
