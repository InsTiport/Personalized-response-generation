THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Coach, how much do those two quick scores deflate?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's a great play, a great goal.   All of a sudden you get momentum.   Two games we had the lead, but short‑lived both times.   Two tough losses in a row.   
   
 Q.   Are you seeing anything in common with those goals after you've scored or is it just a mental lapse?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Big shift after goals either way.   Should be excited about being out there.   
Got it to the net.   Loose puck.   Ended up in the back of our net.   You like to be going the other way after a draw.   But certainly you can't give up that type of goal.   
   
 Q.   Joel, you had a couple of really great chances in the first period.   Hossa, Teravainen.   Looks like Bishop is struggling a little bit.   Do you feel you maybe let that first period get away from you?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I liked their first period.   We had two empty nets and didn't capitalize on either one.   We still had 1‑1.   Scored a big power play goal, got some excitement.   The crowd was there.   I thought we had a good first, they had a good second.   Third was even.   Tough loss.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of Trevor's first game?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I liked his game.   He was fine.   
   
 Q.   Johnny Oduya didn't seem to play in the third period a lot.   Anything going on there?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We'll see.   We'll see tomorrow how he presents.   
   
 Q.   What is your take on what Bishop looked like at times in terms of his laboring?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He looks like he's got some issues.   But I think we still didn't put enough pucks at the net and traffic, obviously.   But certainly later in the game there we made it easier on him.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Thank you.
