 SCHUYLER BAEHMAN: Questions for Coach Quenneville. 

 Q. What kind of psychological advantage do you think you take home after tonight? What do you think were the keys tonight?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: I thought we withstood an early barrage in that first 10 minutes. Antti was rock solid again. They crashed the net well. Preserved second opportunities for us. I think scoring first certainly helped us to finish the period on a better note. I thought we got better as the game went on again. We did some good things. 
 I thought we checked well. I think we took advantage of some plays at the net with traffic. I think that's something Byf has been a big presence there and got rewarded there with a couple. 

 Q. What do you think it says about your team winning seven straight road games?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: We've been pretty consistent on the road. I like our approach. I think our focus is in the right areas. The guys are sticking together off the ice, come prepared for games, playing a simpler game than we've probably seen at home. 
 I think we want to duplicate the way we play here on the road, and think that's a recipe for being successful. 

 Q. As you guys have been on the road so long, do you think it's easier to take those things home now with you and the things that you learned that were successful here?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Quite a trip. At the end of the day, seems like we've been gone for a long, long time. It will be nice to get back home. Don't be satisfied or excited going home thinking, you know, we're in a good spot. 
 I think playing tonight's game, knowing we felt like we had to win this game, think that's got to be our approach Game 3. 

 Q. A couple more goals for Toews' line today. You tried different guys with Kane and Toews. Where is it that Byfuglien seems to be the best fit you found so far in the last couple years?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Byf, he seems really to come to the forefront in the playoffs. Was a big presence last year, influenced a couple series. He's been doing that in this playoff, as well. 
 He's a big body, tough to move, tough to look around, see around. He's got a quick stick. I think he complements the other two guys with their play-making ability, plays around the net. Byf seems to be the disrupter. His stick has been pretty dangerous.

 Q. Campbell and some other guys said the difference from last year to this year is they're not that excited even after these two wins on the road. Can you see the maturity from last year to this year?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Yeah. We like the approach. I think the guys have been really focused as we progressed here. I think not being satisfied going into games, or after games not being too excited or too high. It's a good start here. 
 I think we got more and we got to be better than we were in the first two games at home. I think that's something we got to build upon and stress, that we're looking to play our best, and our best at home, in some time. 

 Q. How dangerous do you think the Sharks will be for Game 3, playing with some desperation?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: We expect a dangerous team. We expect them to come out. Starts are something we stress coming into this building and going into and starting at our building. I expect a noisy crowd, very supportive in our favor. Take advantage of it, use it in our favor. 
 Knowing the start is critical to the outcome of the game, make sure we're ready to compete. 

 Q. Not sure if you asked a question about Bolland yet, but sign of frustration on Thornton's part that he's going after a glove instead of the puck?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, Bolland, I think he's one of those players that, defensively, can sometimes, I don't want to say get the better of you. I think against the Sedins, he was disruptive in ways. I think that line was very good tonight. Had good offensive zone time of possession. I know still trying to get that matchup is challenging. 
 I think we want to be smart when we're out there against their top guys. I think trying to keep 'em off the score sheet and do what you got to do. We'll take whatever happens. 

 Q. Joel, the first goal, you probably saw it up close, Versteeg went down. What was your perspective there? 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Well, obviously scoring first was huge for us because I thought they really came at us quick and hard. Antti, I mentioned, was huge early to keep us in the game. 
 The first goal kind of quieted things down, settled our team game down as well. It was a great shot. The transition game both ways are very dangerous. Both teams are respectful for those turnovers. 

 Q. I imagine you probably touched on this. David Bolland said there was a point last year where he noticed he was getting the tap for a lot of these defensive type assignments. Was there a point where you eyeballed him and realized he could be an elite-level shutdown guy?
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Last year that line was very dangerous, very effective in a lot of ways. This year he was going through some injury issues, trying to get his health and his game to that level all year. 
 I think we've been talking about his trending to recapture that pace that he set last year for himself. That's a standard. I think he's achieved that in these playoffs. Nice to see him get back to that top level and welcome the challenge of taking on some top guys. 
 SCHUYLER BAEHMAN: Thank you very much, coach. 
 COACH QUENNEVILLE: Thank you.
