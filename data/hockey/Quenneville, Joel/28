THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Coach, we talked the other day about giving up goals in bunches.   You've been scoring them in bunches, too.   How critical was it to have that scoring spurt in that time span?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It was a great stretch, great start there.   Saader scoring a special goal, nice place in the middle of the ice.   Dunks makes a spectacular play.   All of a sudden we got three. 
Put us in a good spot.   They got right back in it right away with a power play, scored one of those goals right off the bat. 
We know their success in the third period, how they come, having gotten beat in regulation.   We know we're going to have to spend some time in our end. 
Shawsy scores a goal and puts us in the right spot. 

Q.   I know you've tried to bring Duncan's ice time down in the past.   Now he has to play a lot.   How does he play so well?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He's kind of a freak as far as his metabolism and conditioning level.   I think the more he plays, the more efficient, the more he gets going. 
Just certain guys genetically, aerobically, Anaerobically, they can sustain it.   He keeps doing it. 

Q.   What did you see that made you decide on putting Toews and Kane together?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They're very high‑skilled players.   They got great pace.   They're very competitive.   They're great leaders. 
The last game in the third period, they played some shifts there.   They had some great looks together.   That got us thinking about it. 

Q.   Joel, what was it that makes you make that move to put Kane and Toews together?   Was there something that happened? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We were ready to try it.   Down a game here, we tried it.   Sometimes you go to the mindset of the game, we'll see what happens initially, but you're ready to go to it.   Sometimes whether you're down, we were tied at the time, just an ordinary start, then it picked up. 

Q.   Joel, can you talk about that eight‑minute stretch in the third without a whistle, one‑goal game, your ability to hold them off. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Tough stretch there.   We had some zone time against us.   Then you don't get the matchups.   You're just putting guys out there, whoever's fresh. 
But the game's on the line.   At that stage of the game, matchups really aren't that important.   It's get the puck out, get the puck in deep, try to get a whistle to settle things down.   Then you get your timeouts.   You get back to that rotation you're looking for. 
It's an amazing pace again today.   You look back at six games.   I don't know if you're going to get a faster or more competitive series than we've seen for six games. 

Q.   Is that fourth goal a personification of the little things that need to be done to get the upper hand in this series?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It was a huge play.   Give Desi credit.   Give Shawsy a little boost as well.   He made a great shot on the play in a hard area, a tight area as well. 
That certainly stopped the push or slowed down the push that was coming our way, against a team that just probably feels so good about themselves in the third period, have so many weapons.   They can force and pressure and I won't say gamble, but they're good at it.   That definitely relieved a little bit of the pressure we were getting. 

Q.   They're getting a lot of bodies on Crawford.   Do you think any of it's questionable?   How do you think he's handling it?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No, I mean, you don't want to be scored on a goal where you felt he was in your space.   I just think you got to keep pushing forward, let the referees do their job, you do your job.   Together as a team we'll fight through everything. 

Q.   Do you feel like Rundblad handled it better today than Game1?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Yes, much better.

Q.   How so?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   How so?   I thought he was safe.   He was simple.   Quicker with pucks, quicker to the puck. 

Q.   You were in the same position last year, Game 7, conference final.   You were so close.   What do you learn from last year? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We're on the road.   A little different in that area.   We had huge momentum from Game3, Game4, okay, let's go to 5 and 6 (laughter).   We're back here with a two‑goal lead twice in the game.   At the end of it that was the toughest loss of probably our lives.   That's what we'll take out of it. 

Q.   Joel, does it matter to have that extra day leading to Game 7?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No.   I think both teams have been flying back and forth the last few days.   It's been an amazing pace. 
Just like the other side, they got a breather as well going into Game 7.   Should be a couple great back‑to‑back Game 7s. 

Q.   You've seen this team come back so many times from so many different things.   Are you surprised anymore when they do?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Never.   You saw what happened in Game5, that ending there.   It answers that question. 

Q.   Duncan is a freak.   Can you illustrate that at all, fitness testing, trying to keep his weight up? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He constantly is eating.   He's constantly putting some liquids back into his system.   He rests properly. 
When we do the testing, his numbers are usually at the high, high end. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Thank you.
