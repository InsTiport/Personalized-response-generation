  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Kyle playing tonight?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Very likely.   
   
 Q.   Any other potential lineup changes for you guys?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Probably status quo.   
   
 Q.   Joel, you called up a few of the guys from Rockford.   What do you want them to experience?   Do you entertain the idea of any of them getting in the game?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We'll see.   Things will be determined by how things go here.   Got an opportunity to get some practice in with us, see them as well, see how they fit in with our team down the road.   
They're not coming out here right now, we'll see them when we get back to Chicago.   
   
 Q.   When you played for Timo, there were some question marks, his age, blood clots.   Why haven't you been able to show enough trust in him?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think he's progressing there.   I think he's getting a little bit more confidence in himself and his game, predictability, where the outlets are, how we play in our own end.   
I didn't mind his game the other day.   We'll see how things go tonight.   Hopefully we can get him more involved in the game.   
   
 Q.   Joel, how do you handle it when a kid comes in like Kyle?   He hasn't played in a long time.   Do you talk to him?   Do you have the veterans talk to him?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   As a staff, a couple guys will mention some things about what to be aware of, but play to your strengths, use your quickness, use your instincts, rely on that.   Knowing there's a certain way how we play our system, play along with that, trust your instincts, keep it simple.   
Thank you.
