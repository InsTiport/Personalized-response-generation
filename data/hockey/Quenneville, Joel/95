THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   We knew with Duncan out tonight, you needed the total team defense. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think our whole team game was where we were hoping to be last game.   But I thought we got contributions across the board, especially the guys that lugged a lot of minutes down there, did a real good job of having a good gap, getting some clears, strong in front of the net. 
The defense in front of Crow combined to do an outstanding job.   Tough team to shut down in the third.   They deserve a lot of credit. 

Q.   When you tweaked the lines in the second period, did you get the results you wanted?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   When you score like that, it helps.   Sometimes you're doing it just to change things. 
We were behind, I still didn't mind the way we were playing at that point of the game.   Maybe you get one, and we did.   But scoring early in the third really helped us. 

Q.   Did the loss of Keith inflame your club tonight?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, I know that we took a big effort, you miss a guy that plays the most minutes, meaningful minutes, shift in, shift out.   It was good to see Brooksy come into the lineup.   He's one of those teammates that guys love to see out on the ice, and we haven't been able to use him the whole playoffs. 
Commend him on coming in in a tough situation.   Him coming in helped as well.   Certainly there's a big void without Dunks.   I thought we got a good response after the way we played in Game3. 

Q.   When you switched up the top two lines, it was after a PK.   Is it just a case where you liked what you saw the first time?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we're going to do that.   Sometimes the guys that are fresh, you go with it.   We intended to try that and see what happened.

Q.   Why has your team been so successful shutting down the Kings' power play?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think our penalty killing has been the strength of our team.   It starts with our goaltender out to our defense, led by Krugs and Fro.   They're relentless.   Commend them on their work ethic.   I think it helps that our top guys are not out there in those minutes, as well. 

Q.   Bickell with another strong game tonight, how far he's come. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think he's one of those guys that you really appreciate all year long.   He's one of those guys that maybe flies under the radar. 
He's got all the assets that could make him a top forward power‑wise.   He can hit, skate, shoot, he sees plays and is big at the net, physical.   All the ingredients you want put together. 
That process, he'd like to see it come together game in, game out.   Probably this playoff round, it seems like he's really progressed. 

Q.   This win puts you in a good situation.   Can you describe how important the win is. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, it's important that we came in here and played a good game.   Look at our first two games.   We play the way we want to.   We're disappointed with the last game.   But playing the right way, playing the way we have to to be successful is what we're looking for. 
We want to keep trying to sustain that.   We're chasing it twice from behind in a tough building to come back in.   But the guys hung in there. 

Q.   Talk about the 3‑1 lead. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We got one game at a time.   We're going home.   We'll be excited.   I'm sure the building will be as loud as it's ever been.   We're looking forward to it.

Q.   After losing Duncan, having a chance to close it out, your team continues to respond to the adversity. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's the playoffs and we're deep.   It's an exciting situation to be in.   I think it's a great opportunity.   We were very frustrated, disappointed with the way we competed or played last game. 
Talk about your leadership, talk about everybody, the contribution we got across the board is what we were looking for.

Q.   Is that more what you wanted to see from Patrick Kane?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He had the puck early and a lot.   He's dangerous off the rush.   Took some shots through the screens.   Nice to see him score, as well. 

Q.   What is it going to take to close this out at home?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We want to make sure we're playing like we have in 1, 2 and 4.   Speed, everybody contributing.   Try to keep the pace, try to make them play defense. 
Thank you.
