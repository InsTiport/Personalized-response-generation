 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Quenneville.   
  
  Q. Talk about how your goaltender kept you in there, particularly end of regulation, pretty amazing save, gave you a shot.   
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: Yeah, I thought he played great. You know, should be commended on the game he played. Kept us in there. We weathered the storm in the first period. Gave us a chance to be in the game. You know, made some key saves throughout the game.   
 I thought Ozzie made some key saves, as well. He had a strong game. Two guys that never played for us, NHL playoffs. Him and Fras might have been our two best. But he certainly deserved better fate.   
  
  Q. Talk about what you saw on the game winner.   
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: No, you know, they made a nice play. Those end boards are more lively than any other building. Really jumped off the end boards. You know, some scrambles at both ends as the game progressed. Helm had a heck of a game. They got the break.   
 But those are the kind of goals you score, you know, in the latter stages of games, big goals in playoffs. We got hemmed in their end there, and then end shift. It was a tough one.   
  
  Q. Any solace at all in taking this team tooth and nail in all these games?   
 JOEL QUENNEVILLE: I think we should all be proud of the year we had. It was a great group to work with. These kids have been great all year long. They matured. They developed. But it was a really good working experience. We got to find out what playoff hockey is all about. You know, the best measuring stick, we went up against the best, and the lesson you can learn is that you don't just win the Cup and think you're the best team. You got to go prove it.  
 Here they are fighting again for the Cup. They should be commended again for how well they played. We should learn something from them.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.
