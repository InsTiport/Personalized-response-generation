THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Coach, with taking Vermette and Teravainen out, was anybody hurt? 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No, they're fine. 

Q.   Was there something with both of them that you weren't getting?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Well, we just wanted to get some fresh legs in there.   We felt that Steeger had never played over a long stretch in the last series, we wanted to get him back in there. 
You know, tough game the other day, travel.   We wanted to bring some new guys in. 

Q.   Did you get what you wanted out of that?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we had a good start with that.   We had a good first period.   Had the energy.   Our power play might have lost a little bit of momentum.   I think their second period they got it back in the middle of the second and obviously scored a big goal at the end.   We got a big one at the end of the first.   It was kind of comparable to the game we had last game.

Q.   Were you wary at all about breaking up the Kruger line with how well they played in the first two games?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They were fine.   You get behind, it's a different game.   I think they were playing fine till we got behind. 

Q.   Typically after wins you keep things as is.   What was different this time around?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We could have changed our lineup after the first game, after we lost the first game.   Those guys hadn't played.   We got them back together, got them some ice.   That's what we're looking at. 

Q.   On the second goal, was that defended the way you wanted?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It was kind of defended the way we wanted.   But, you know, had to get in the shooting lane. 

Q.   With the power play, we talked about it the last game, was it doubly frustrating tonight?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Obviously we had some success last game.   Put us in a spot to win the game.   Tonight we had several good opportunities, but didn't have the good looks we had last game. 

Q.   You hadn't played here in 18 days or something.   What makes it, at this stage in the playoffs, home ice advantage doesn't seem to matter?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We saw this year in the regular season and all season long, even the playoffs, teams play well on the road, look to check. 
Tough game back here after being out west with a late game.   You know, we look at the chances, we look at opportunities.   We had some decent looks.   Pretty even game, Games1, 2 and 3.   They got the timely goal. 

Q.   Bryan Bickell said he couldn't understand why second games you let off the throttle.   What do you chalk that up to?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We had some icings there.   They had some faceoff time.   You don't get the right matchup.   They got some momentum off it, as well. 
But that can happen any period.   We expect to have some shifts in our own end.   It's happened both ways for the first three games. 

Q.   Joel, what did you think of Nordstrom tonight?   I know it's early, but are you maybe leaning towards going back to him?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We're looking at everything.   We'll consider all our options.

Q.   Do you think fresher legs after that triple overtime game on Saturday will allow you to control pace better?   You couldn't do that tonight. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I would expect a faster pace.   The pace started real quick tonight.   It wasn't as fast or as quick as the first two games, for sure the second game. 
But, you know, there's reasons for that. 

Q.   Joel, with a four‑minute power play, is there a tendency to be, We got a lot of time here?   Did you see anything where they weren't aggressive enough?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   You got to get into it a little deeper there.   We didn't have zone time.   We didn't get them tired.   We're the ones getting tired because we had to keep breaking out.   So, you know, I think that was a stretch there we didn't get the momentum where we should have put a little bit more heat on them.   We had them taking penalties and we didn't make them pay. 
Thank you. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, coach.
