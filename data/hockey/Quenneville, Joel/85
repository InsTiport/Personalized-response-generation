THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What was the explanation the officials gave you for the disallowed goal in the first period?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He said his intention was to blow the whistle.   
   
 Q.   Seemed to be a little tilted ice there in the overtime.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   It's like the second period, I thought we lost the pace of the game on that end of the rink.   We had the perfect start to the game, then we stopped doing what made us successful.   
We stood around.   They countered.   
   
 Q.   Any injuries coming out of the game?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we're fine.   
   
 Q.   It seemed like the first power play had some traction.   Your evaluation of the power plays tonight?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Two good looks on the first one.   Dunks had a great chance.   Nick Leddy.   I thought that was our two nice setups.   We lost a little momentum on the next one or two.   
I just thought we lost the momentum in other areas.   
   
 Q.   Talk about Corey again.   His play elevated again in overtime.   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   He was great.   He kept us in there.   They had some great looks in overtime around the net.   Stands tall, finding that puck, gives us a chance.   
   
 Q.   How did you see the final turnover transpire and what kind of game do you think Bollig had?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought he was fine.   I thought he had two good games.   That line, didn't get them out there much in overtime.   Every time they were out there, they were a threat to score.   Had a lot of offensive zone time.   They got the one shift, around the wall, we didn't get there in time.   Bang, bang.   
   
 Q.   Why couldn't you create enough action in the second and third periods?   
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I thought we slowed ourselves down.   I don't think we got the puck behind them.   I think we were in front of them too much.   I think that played into their hands.   
   
 Q.   You obviously created so many chances in the first period, just to have the one goal, did you feel like you should have had more there?  
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   No.   Certainly getting two, maybe we left something out there.   Had everything right in that first part of the game.   Had some good looks, as well.   Did what we were looking to do.   
But, hey, it's a long game.   You know, we got to be better than that.   
Thank you.
