Tampa Bay   4
  Chicago - 3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Third period those back‑to‑back penalties, how critical were those at the time?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Tough timing.   I know we just got the big goal then we had to kill four minutes.   Maybe a little tired on the kill the latter part of it.   We did an outstanding job the first one, almost got through the second one. 

Q.   Breaking up Toews and Kane, I assume that was because of what Tampa Bay was holding them to for the first game and a half?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   They had some great looks there.   Had a couple really good quality chances in the first period, had some good stuff in the second.   They're dangerous. 
Just got a little more balance off it.   We scored right away.   Then we lost some momentum. 

Q.   What are they doing to keep your top guys at bay?   How important is it to get them going?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   I think we had some good looks, that line.   Johnny put Shawsy in almost on a breakaway.   Saader looks like he's in almost all alone.   They had some quality stuff. 
They'll generate stuff, too, going forward, whoever's on that line. 

Q.   What is your assessment of Crawford in this one tonight?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Just okay. 

Q.   Overall the mindset in a game you called must win.   They rose to the occasion.   What is the mindset going back to Game3?
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   We get to go home, get excited, play in our building.   I'm sure everybody will be loud and excited about us coming back. 
We were tied in the third period, had the right spot for tonight.   But didn't go our way. 
We'll be all right.   We should be excited about what happened at the end of the game. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach. 
COACH QUENNEVILLE:   Thank you.
