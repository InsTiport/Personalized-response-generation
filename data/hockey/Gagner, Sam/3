   PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Sam, why don't you come on up.   
 Why would the Buffalo Sabres be your favorite team.   
 SAM GAGNER:  I don't have a favorite team, per se.  I like the style of play that Buffalo has at this time.  And I enjoyed watching them play.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  I saw you at the Royal Junior.  It didn't go exactly the way you wanted it personally; team-wise it did.  How did you stay so focused and so competitive?   
 SAM GAGNER:  I think it started in Ottawa.  That was a mindset around our team.  Everyone was there for one reason and that was to win and nobody was really thinking about personal achievements and everybody was unselfish and I just got caught up in it.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Your dad played 15 years in the league.  Now he's your assistant coach in London.  What's that like.   
 SAM GAGNER:  It's awesome.  He knows so much about the game and he's been able to teach me so much over the years he knows me better than anybody.  I think it's been real beneficial for me.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  What team do you want to be drafted by?   
 SAM GAGNER:  I don't have a choice either way.  I think being drafted by Toronto would be awesome because that's where I'm from.  But other than that I think anywhere would be awesome, just to be drafted by an NHL team.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  There are a lot of hard-boiled newspaper people out here that followed Dale Hunter when he played and they know how tough a guy he is.  He's your coach in London.  Give us a dirty little Dale Hunter story.   
 SAM GAGNER:  He tends to be pretty low key around us.  So he's been awesome all year.  He's been able to teach me so much in such a short period of time.  And I owe a lot to him for this year, and I expect it to be a lot more fun next year as well.   
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Thank you very much, Sam.
