Q.  Rob Niedermayer, you're down 2-0, what does the team do not to panic?  How do you intensify?
 
ROB NIEDERMAYER:   I think we just have got to start throwing the puck and get more people in front of Brodeur.  That's the biggest thing.  We have to start getting a little more traffic in front of him. 
 
Q.  As you go back to the dressing room, do you assume it will be a composed dressing room?
 
ROB NIEDERMAYER:   Well, yeah.  We've got a lot of leaders in that room and we know what we have to do.  We have to start throwing pucks at the net and that's what we are going to do in the third. 
 
Q.  Final game, final period, do you make any adjustments? 
 
ADAM OATES:   Not really.  Obviously, the second period, has been our downfall.  Obviously, as always you have to manage the puck and get to spots where we need to get on them, and try to get one.  
 
Q.  Do you feel it slipping away?  How do you stay upbeat and positive? 
 
ADAM OATES:   Well, we've been in this position before.  We've got things to draw upon and obviously, it's the middle of the game and you're not thinking about that.  Obviously we are down and we have to think of a way to win the game.  That's what's on our minds.
