 Q. Brad, can you just take us through your goal?  
BRAD RICHARDS: I thought I'd go back towards (indiscernible) and thought he was going to keep it in and got lucky that we put it on net that much in the end. But got lucky that the team (indiscernible) and kind of had a little bit of trying to chip it past the goalie.   
Can't really rely on the goalie try to put it in, just kind of chip it towards the net. Get us in the position and I don't know if it hit his back or something. But we'll take those.  
   
 Q. Brad, you've got a lot of outdoor game experience. You've been through good moments for and against. Where did this one rank for you in getting the goal, winning the game with a minute left?  
BRAD RICHARDS: It was a special weekend. Before I was‑‑ just growing up, anytime I wanted to watch hockey, I wanted to watch Colorado or Detroit. There's so many great players.   
So to be part of this history of that rivalry, being around, seeing some of the guys yesterday and knowing they played. And just being‑‑ not just growing up, but it's a huge two points for our team and a great experience.   
It's a pretty neat, neat night with the way under the lights and the way it's presented. They're all special, though, especially the ones you win. And it's a great memory.  
   
 Q. Henrik, how is the feeling playing in (indiscernible) 50,000 and beating the biggest rival?  
HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Obviously it's a big weekend for our club. Yesterday with the game. It was a great show. It was fun to see all the old guys battling. And for us today we were excited to go out and play.   
And we worked and did a great job. Had a little issue yesterday. But today it was good. So obviously it was a big two points for us. (Indiscernible).  
   
 Q. Brad, how much did the wind and the vertical cotton affect you guys?  
BRAD RICHARDS: The cotton thing, looked like it was going to affect it, but it ended up didn't. Pretty much just looked like it was all going to come piling on the edge, but it ended up destroying so much, never even got today for a lot of it. But I probably‑‑ honest, I didn't get to ask the faster skaters how they felt it affected them. I had the same speed all night.  
   
 Q. How important was the first goal to get you guys going in the third period, and from the aesthetic point of view, his ability to score a goal like that?  
HENRIK ZETTERBERG: It was a big goal. It was a nice win. He's a special player. He doesn't need much to create chances and all that there and get it back in there.  
   
 Q. Brad, you now have a couple of night‑time outdoor games under your belt. Daytime ones as well. What's your preference?  
BRAD RICHARDS: I don't know. Probably get in trouble for saying one or the other. But I seem to like the night ones, when we were in New York, there's a street below, (indiscernible) here under the lights, just is a different feeling.   
But the ones in the afternoon, it's snowing and it felt pretty cool too. It's all good.   
When nothing happens weather‑wise, you just go out and play the game. That's what you're looking for. So I haven't been in ones where there are full blizzards. And tonight is very special.   
   
 Q. Henrik, you have a lot of fans who made it from Detroit to Colorado, and a lot of Colorado fans out there tonight. First question is: How do you feel that‑‑ there's so much dedication. And you hear a lot of the Red Wings fans trying to keep up the chant, despite the massive number of Avalanche fans. And how does it feel (indiscernible) in the first outdoor game ever?  
HENRIK ZETTERBERG: I think, first of all, our fans are special. We have a goal there, they're there. Obviously this weekend it's a big weekend for our club. And we saw that with all the fans, starting yesterday or even the day before we got‑‑ people were walking around. And that gets us excited.   
You see all them. But the history with these two clubs, and the game probably brought a lot of fans. And the excitement of winning this game was big. I think every point now is huge going into the season. I'm glad we got the two.   
   
 Q. Henrik, what did you think of Pavel Datsyuk getting a roughing penalty and going after‑‑  
HENRIK ZETTERBERG: I was changing. So I didn't see that. Pavel can throw a couple things around sometimes too. And obviously he's a strong guy, too. I don't know if he was the first one, but I think it was spread even.
