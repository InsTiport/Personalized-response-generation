 Q.  Not a bad way to start it off? 
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE:  I think we should be happy with this effort.  I think we were a little nervous in the beginning.  But we wanted to get a big win out of this game and we should be happy, and of course we need to focus on the second game now. 

 Q.  Obviously when you look at the first goal that went in, it was kind of an unlucky bounce for you guys.  How do you keep your confidence when it happens so quick? 
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE:  Bounces are part of the game.  You gotta deal with it right away and just move on.  And goals are going to happen.  As a goalie, when you give a goal, you have to focus on the next shot.  It was early in the game so we kept our head up.  We were able to score a big one after that. 

 Q.  You've seen them on tape.  What's the difference now seeing them in person? 
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE:  They're a very skilled team.  They skate really well, and we're going to have to play well if we want to win. 
 And we didn't expect anything less. 

 Q.  They did get a couple of power play goals, but you guys killed the big one, the five-on-three, and especially down the stretch the defense was great? 
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE:  Yeah, again we gotta be careful with the penalty.  Throughout the playoffs we've taken too many penalties, and again tonight. 
 So we cannot always blame the referee for that.  We have to look at ourselves in the mirror and see what we can do better. 

 Q.  What about the importance of the first game in the Finals? 
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE:  First games are always important.  I think that it's not the first team that wins the first game.  It's the first team that gets to four.  So now that we have the jitters away and we know what they're all about, we can really focus on our game and try to take it to them.
