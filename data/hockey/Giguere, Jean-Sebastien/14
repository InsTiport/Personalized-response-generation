Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: It's going to be interesting to see how we're going to respond.  This is a new challenge we haven't faced yet, and we'll see what we're all about.  At the end of tomorrow night's game, we're all going to be better players and be a better team.  We're going to go out there and try to win. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: We're going to go out there and do what we do.  We're not going to change anything about the game plan.  We're not going to change anything about what's been successful all year.  This is not a time to change.  We're going to go out there and work as hard as we can and hope for the best at the end. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: I'm confident that we can win tomorrow, and the team is very confident we can do the job when we have been doing the job all year.  And I think if we do what we do as hard as we can do it, we'll have a chance to win.  That's all we can ask at the end. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: What happened last night is all forgotten.  Really what happened last night is they got the win.  Now the series is up 3-2 for them.  Now we have to go out there the next game and try to win and play our game.  We don't care what the score was last night.  The only thing that happened is they got the win.  At the end, that's the most important thing, just getting the win.  We've got to play our game and try to get it. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: Well, I don't care.  For me my job is to make one save at a time.  It doesn't matter how they come.  There is no situation on the ice that I haven't faced in the past that I don't know how to face or make saves on.  Whatever  happens out there, I have to do my job.  Saying that, we all have to be better in our own zone and play better.  It's just about hard work and competing.  Probably yesterday we got outworked a little bit in our zone. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: The coach said do what we do.  That's it, if comes down to that.  If we play like we can play, we won't have any regrets.  All we can ask from each other, from ourselves and each other is tomorrow be your best and stick with the game plan, and whatever happens at the end happens.  Let's not have any regrets.
