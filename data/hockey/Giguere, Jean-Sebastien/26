Q.  You're going to the Stanley Cup Finals.  Is this the way you see it in your dreams?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: Yeah, I always imagined that and it's going to be a lot of fun for us. 
 
Q.  How does the dream end?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: You know, hopefully, with a win, but, you know, it doesn't matter, we're all going to be a better team after this.  
 
Q.  Three shutouts in the series and a tie as a record.  How do you feel about that?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: I feel the team did an unbelievable job in front of me.  I have got to give credit to all the guys in my team. 
 
Q.  How different was this series?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: Low scoring, obviously.  Similar type of team, and, you know, it was a great series, a great battle out there. 
 
Q.  You get a chance to rest.  How big of an advantage is that?
 
J.S. GIGUERE: It's going to be a big key.  We're going to use it as best we can.  It's our best weapon.
