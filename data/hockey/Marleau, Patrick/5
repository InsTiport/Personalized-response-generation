 Q. The way you handled the frustration on the ice towards the end of Game 2, the talk in the locker room afterwards, was that unusual for this team, or did you like it? 
 PATRICK MARLEAU: I think things happen that way. I think obviously late in the game, people get into it. It's on both sides, too. It's frustration on our part, but that you are getting into it as well. It's just one of those things. 
 Just talked about coming here, getting our game going, playing a lot better.
