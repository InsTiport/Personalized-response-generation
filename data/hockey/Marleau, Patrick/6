Blackhawks  Â– 4
  Sharks - 2

 PATRICK MARLEAU: It comes down to what we're doing as a line. We're getting the puck in deep, using our bodies, taking the puck to the net. It's hard for teams to defend against us. We probably didn't do enough of that tonight. When we do get it in there, we have our chances. I definitely like the next two games if it's going to be the same. 
 But, you know, we know we got an uphill battle right now. It's a good challenge for our club, great opportunity to come back.
