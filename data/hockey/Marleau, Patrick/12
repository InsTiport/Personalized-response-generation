I am excited so see what was going to happen.  I am glad I went second.

The agent is taking care of that though.

At training camp I guess we will be able to tell when that happens

My options are open and come training camp I will be able to tell what I will be doing for next year.

Not really.  I am kind of keeping my options open.

Just work on everything.  Every part of the game.  I think you can always get better on everything you can do.  So I just want to improve on everything.

I was kind of expecting it from  watching the drafts before, but I have eased into this kind of lifestyle, I guess, and it is great.

No, I haven't yet.  I have heard great things about it, though, so I am excited to go there

Hopefully.  I am leaving all those options open.  But I prefer center, yes.
