  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dwight King.   
   
 Q.   I know tomorrow Staples is going to be rocking.   Is it tough to keep your emotions in check?   
DWIGHT KING:   You definitely feed off the crowd.   There's a lot of energy out there.   Everybody will be amped up and playing hard.   
   
 Q.   When we see your captain get hit the way he did, what's the sense on the bench?  
DWIGHT KING:   It's not very good to see your top player at the moment get hit like that.   But it's good to see him get up and show no ill effects out of it.   
We ve obviously got to play physical again.   Tomorrow night's going to be the same.   
   
 Q.   Talk about his leadership skills.   
DWIGHT KING:   He leads by example, as is pretty obvious.   He's been a top player in playoffs.   He's out there and gives it his all.   When you see that, you want to follow up on it.  
   
 Q.   Whether it's last night or the St.Louis series, how much have you been able to use other team's lack of discipline to your favor?   
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah, I think our special teams in general have been really good.   Obviously our penalty kill has been great so far.   When teams take penalties, we seem to get timely goals on the power play.   It's helped us a lot.   
   
 Q.   You don't retaliate.   Discipline was impressive, especially last night.   
DWIGHT KING:   Nobody's happy when those plays happen, but discipline is a huge part of playoffs.   You get the opportunities like the five‑minute power plays we got, the couple goals we got out of it, that's what won the games.   
   
 Q.   Have you been surprised how much you've been able to get teams off their game or is that because of your style?   
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah, I think it's the style we play.   We try to impose our will a little bit, be physical, be hard on top players on the opposing team.   Over time, people get frustrated with that.   
   
 Q.   For you specifically, does the term 'beyond my wildest dreams' mean anything to you?  
DWIGHT KING:   It's been obviously great so far.   Just hope to keep it going tomorrow, keep the good luck going.  
   
 Q.   Given where you started this season to where you are now, could you imagine being here at this point?  
DWIGHT KING:   No.   But this is any kid's dream, being in this situation.   Having it all come true in this short amount of time, it's been great.  
   
 Q.   Do you get the butterflies?  
DWIGHT KING:   Once in a while before each round, you take it all in.   But once you get back to playing, you're in the mindset of just playing hockey.  
   
 Q.   How much are guys like Justin or Rob, guys who have been to this point before and beyond, how much have they helped you in terms of keeping things kind of focused?  
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah, there's guys who have been there before on our team, not just for myself, but for everybody else out there who got caught up in the moment a little bit, they're there to keep you grounded.   They obviously know we're not done yet.   We still got a little bit of work to do.   As long as we keep on the right path here, things will keep looking good.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
