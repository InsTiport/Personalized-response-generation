  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dwight King.   
   
 Q.   Why has this team been able to be so focused?   
DWIGHT KING:   I think we just kind of reset ourselves.   Obviously after big wins and big efforts, people come back to the rink, they enjoy it for the evening it was.   When they come back here, refocus, go to practice, touch on some issues that we needed to work on, carry it into our next games.   
It's been going pretty well.   Our top players have been playing great for us.   That's what you need, too.  
   
 Q.   Dustin talked about it the other day, you say you haven't played your best game yet, you haven't shown your best.   
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Is that fact?   Are you using it as motivation?  
DWIGHT KING:   That's definitely fact.   Obviously, if you watched last game, there were times when we were sloppy.   We're still working to get that full 60â€‘minute effort.   We're getting closer.   Working to get there eventually.   
We're going to focus upon Sunday, hopefully get a little closer, bring a better effort from the start.   
   
 Q.   What has the transition from the minors been like for you?  
DWIGHT KING:   Definitely taking it all in.   Obviously it's a very big city here and they're very passionate about their sports teams.   Good to see we're all in the playoffs.   It's a bonus.   
Obviously with us having success, it makes it that much better.   Kind of living the dream right now, soaking it all in.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
