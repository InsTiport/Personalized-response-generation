  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dwight King. 

Q.   Are you able to find that space from the half boards to the net like you did earlier or are they taking that away?
DWIGHT KING:   They're making adjustments.   Just a matter of work.   Obviously if you wear 'em down a little bit, move the puck to your teammates, you'll create a little bit more space out there.   That's what we got to do tonight.

Q.   How much urgency is there to get this thing done tonight?
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah, we would have loved to have it done already. 
Tonight we're going to come out a lot better team, a little hungrier.   They're going to come out the same, so it's going to be a challenge. 

Q.   Have you talked at all about trying to keep the puck away from Mike more? 
DWIGHT KING:   Yeah, Smith can handle the puck with the top goalies in the league.   We try to keep our dumps away from him, outâ€‘pressure him as much as we can.   He can make plays with it.   We definitely know he's capable.   We try to keep a mindful set when we're down with the pucks. 

Q.   You talked about the urgency of this team to finish it.   It seems to be in a comfortable place on the road. 
DWIGHT KING:   We didn't have a effort last game.   We watched a little bit of video, we know we have a lot to work on.   We're excited to get back on schedule here. 
On the road, at home, doesn't matter as long as we consistently play hard and work.   I think the end result comes on a little easier for us.

Q.   Is it difficult not to look ahead knowing the opportunity? 
DWIGHT KING:   I mean, you get grounded pretty quick when you lose one like the way we did.   I think everybody's just looking forward to this game and excited for it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks.
