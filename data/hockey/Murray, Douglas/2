   DOUGLAS MURRAY: It feels realistic because we do tend to get really hot. I mean, this year as well. As any other year, we are quite streaky. We have a lot of long winning streaks behind us. 
 You know, when things get loose, nothing's impossible. 

 Q. What have you learned about Chicago in this series? 
 DOUGLAS MURRAY: I don't think we really learned too many new things. They're a great team. They have all kinds of different types of players that you need, highly skilled. The one thing that maybe you might give them more credit for than you maybe did before, they're playing very mature for being a young team. 

 Q. What do you mean when you say you see that maturity? 
 DOUGLAS MURRAY: Oh, just patience in games, staying within their game plan.
