MIKE VERNON:  They are going to score their goals once in a while.  As long as we try to, you know, compete and battle with them and go from there, they got one on the power play and one on rush.


Q.  You were down in that other series two years ago.  I mean, their games needs a lot of confidence?

MIKE VERNON: Definitely, but I think a couple of years ago I think we have learned to -- I have learned that lesson from the Jersey Devils.  They beat us all over the ice on all areas of the ice.  And, it showed on the shot clock.  And, it showed in a lot of areas.  And, I think that a lot of us have that in the back of our minds.  There is no doubt about it, I think we have all learned from the Jersey Devils a couple of years ago.  We are just trying to play a very consistent brand of hockey.  And, try not to do anything too fancy, just go with four lines and 6 defense.
