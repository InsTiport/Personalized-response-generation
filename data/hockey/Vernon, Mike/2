MIKE VERNON:  I tell you, I am just happy for everybody, the city, all these players today.  It is just a terrific feeling.


Q.  Mike, you never gave Philly a stick.  I thought your team was mentally tight.  Pretty exciting moment?

MIKE VERNON:  There goes Scotty (Bowman) with the Cup.  Yeah, well, I think the fourth one is always the toughest. We knew that they weren't going to lay down.  We didn't come out with our best stuff in the first period, but we ended up even and we just kept battling after that.  We started to pick up our game and start believing in ourselves again, and we just got that train rolling and everybody jumped on and it just kept going.


Q.  Mike, remember the tour of Russia in 1989 after you had won it with Calgary, ever think you would play with five of their best sharing this?

MIKE VERNON:  I honestly don't want to go back to Moscow this September, but five phenomenal players.  They are unbelievable.  Everyone of them, Larionov.
