THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Antoine, you've only been here for a few months now.   At what point do you get the sense when this team is trailing in the third period that they always seem like they're going to make a push, a comeback?   
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   That's a good question.   I don't recall specific moment really.   With that being said, I played against them quite a bit knowing that there's a lot of pride in this room, a lot of character.   They're going to keep battling no matter what.   
Something nice to be on that side.   
   
 Q.   Antoine, just wanted to ask you about that last goal, particularly what you saw from Teuvo, what he's been able to do also.   
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   I think that was a great illustration on that goal with the way we try to play, try to establish our speed and moving our feet, especially in their end.   
I think on that play, it was great work.   Teuvo kept it working hard, create a turnover, and we got the puck in the slot.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
