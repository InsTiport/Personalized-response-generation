 Q.   How are you looking at the challenge ahead for you guys?  
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   It's clichÃ©, we say take one at a time.   That's the reality of it.   You don't want to look ahead too much.   Take this one coming up, make the best out of it.  
   
 Q.   Home‑ice advantage, the crowd is very friendly here.   They're 7‑0 on the road.   
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   We have to respect they can be good on the road.   It's about us.   We're aware of the situation we're facing.   It should be all on that.   
   
 Q.   What was the difference in getting that win on Sunday?   
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   Try to reproduce some of the areas we were better.   We still think we can be better than that.   Going to be harder for sure.   We have to keep improving, try to get some intensity we showed in different aspects of the game.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   He was really good.   He's been really good.   Since I've been here, he's been very solid, especially in the playoffs.   Very effective.   I know he was a big part of our win last night.   
   
 Q.   Being with your backs against the wall, 3‑0, did that almost become a calming influence?  
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   Yeah, I mean, I think on that, guys are handling that in different ways.   But whatever you can make the best out of the situation, we should do it.   
Some guys would be motivated facing elimination.   Some guys would be calmer because you have nothing to lose.   
I'm a positive guy.   Whatever you can take out of this, make you better, do it.  
   
 Q.   Do you think it will be a challenge to sustain that desperation?   
ANTOINE VERMETTE:   Yeah, I mean, there's nothing going to come easy this time of the year.   Yeah, every night is a challenge.   It's not going to be easy.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
