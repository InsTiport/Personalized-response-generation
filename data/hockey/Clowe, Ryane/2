   RYANE CLOWE: We've won six or seven in these playoffs. We beat Colorado, went on the road with a run. You can definitely get hot, get momentum on your side and roll with it. Chicago seems to be doing that now.   
 Like I said, we feel like the series is a lot closer. With a couple of breaks here and there, this series can be right back to where we need.   
  
  Q. Tough to keep a smile on your face right now or keep that outlook good?   
 RYANE CLOWE: Playoff time, we talked about not being a rollercoaster team. Win or lose, we stay even-keeled. Even when you win, you don't go around smiling, thinking you won anything. We're in a position now where there's no sense -- you don't want to be happy. You're not happy you're in this situation. But you don't want to be where you have your head down saying, We have done our best.   
 We have played well, but there's still areas we need to improve. More than anything, the effort has been there. You can't ask for much more than that.
