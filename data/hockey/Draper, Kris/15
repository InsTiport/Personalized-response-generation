KRIS DRAPER:  I think it kept coming at us.  They had some good shots.  Ozzie was making the first save; then they were there to get the rebound.  I think it was just sloppy play on our part.  We still got 20 minutes to go to make this hockey game.  That is what exactly we intend to do.


Q.  Do you have to pick up the pace here?

KRIS DRAPER:  We are a good hockey club when we are skating, making plays, and creating chances.  We got away from that; got into a little bit of penalty trouble; that kind of slows the momentum down going for lines, and, that is exactly what happened and Washington capitalized.
