Q.  Chris Draper, how impossible is McCarty going to be to live after that unbelievable goal?
 
KRIS DRAPER:  Yeah, it was great.  Max has been doing for us all year long, he scored huge goals for us in the Playoffs and now obviously tonight is icing on the cake.  It is good to see a guy like that get a big goal in a big game. Everyone loves him in the dressing room.  You can tell by the reaction when he scored. 
 

Q.  What are you feeling right now, one period away?
 
KRIS DRAPER:  That is what we have been going all along.  We have been  saying game at a time, period at a time. We have been breaking it down into little segments and that is what we are going to continue to do.  You can taste it, but, I mean, they are coming at is hard.  Verny has made huge saves. We just to keep going on we can't sit on what we have done so far 
 

Q.  The word desperation has been used before down to one period.  Is there another gear left in this team?
 
SHJON PODEIN: There has got to be if we are going to do something here.  I think we are working hard, but the bottom line is if we don't win tonight, that is it.  So we have got to get the win, no matter what it takes. 
 

Q.  You give encouragement when they come out of the locker room, the last one to leave there.  What emotion do you draw upon here?  Is it pride, anger, what is it?
 
SHJON PODEIN:  You got to draw from whatever you got left.  We need whatever we got left in the tank to break the ice, get a goal on this guy and get it going.  It's desperation like you said, we need to win, we need to win these 20 minutes.
