DALE HUNTER:  We had more scoring chances, more shots.  We came close to tieing it up two times.  We had not a very good first, kind of laid back and kind of let them take the game to us.  So, talked about it between periods and we came out and played hard that period. 
 

Q.  What a great period Osgood had.
 
DALE HUNTER:  Yeah, he made a great save on Bondra there. He is a big sniper and shooting pucks like that, you know, he is on his game.  We have got more screens on him maybe. 
 

Q.  18th season here for you; 11th here in Washington. It is unbelievable.  It is unbelievable that the Stanley Cup Finals is hosted by the Caps.
 
DALE HUNTER:  Yeah, it is.  It finally came here; been a long time coming, and deserving franchise to get it here.  So, hopefully, we can win it. 
 

Q.  This is starting to boil; looks like another classic finish?
 
KRIS DRAPER:  Yeah, sure is.  They played a great second period against us in both games and we came unscathed there, but they sure had a great period.  Ozzie came out with some huge saves after save.  We have got to regroup and come out hard for the third. 
 

Q.  You are a team that can do it both, play defensively or crank it up offensively.  After winning the last game with a lot of offense now in that last period, temptation to go that way?
 
KRIS DRAPER:  I think it was probably the most exciting game a lot of us ever played.  We are going to stick with the close checking defensive game.  That is how we have been successful.  That is why we are here.  That is what we have got to keep playing.
