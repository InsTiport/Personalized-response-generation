Q.  All year long this is what you played for.

KRIS DRAPER: Yeah, that's for sure.  You know, we do what we had to do.  And Game 6, obviously we went out and put together a solid performance and were able to prolong the series.  So now here we go, we are in a Game 7.  And, you know, the series has been unbelievable so far and I think that's what everyone is going to expect tomorrow night, you know, both teams going at one another.  Nobody sat back last night.  Both teams were attacking.  And it was another entertaining hockey game, so that's what we have to do.

Q.  Do you have to duplicate that Game 6 performance, or do you have to be that much better?

KRIS DRAPER: Well, I think you have to be that much better.  I mean we have been saying all along, every series you play you want to get stronger and better, and every game we want to get stronger and better.  So we know how well they play in Game 7s and how well they play after losses, so if they're going to respond with a great effort, we just want to keep building.  We've done some good things in this series, but when you play in a Game 7, anything can happen.  So, you know, we just got to come out.  We got to play a very disciplined hockey game.  And like I said, we got to keep building on what we did last game.
