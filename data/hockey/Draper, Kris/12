Q.  Kris, we talked before about how important it was to get off to a good start.  You guys were able to  do that.

KRIS DRAPER:  Yeah.  That's what we had to do.  This team came out flying and they did have a lot of confidence.  What we wanted to do was get the first goal and build from it, give ourselves a little breathing room and that's what we wanted to do tonight.


Q.  How different does it feel the second time around?  Are you looking at it very differently?

KRIS DRAPER:  You know what?  I'm just taking your advice about just sitting back and letting everything soak in, not getting caught up in everything.  Just sitting back and watching my teammates and wives and fiances and everything.  I mean, this is the ultimate moment to be a hockey player right now and I think the greatest moment was seeing Vladi out on the ice.
