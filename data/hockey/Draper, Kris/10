Q.  Kris Draper, who knows the wars between those these two teams, what did you get a sense of in the first?

KRIS DRAPER:  Well, I thought there was going to be a little bit of a feeling out process, but that didn't happen at all.  You know, we had a week to lay off, so, I think, under the circumstances, we're really happy with our start.  So, huge power play goal by Tomas Holmstrom that ties things up, so -- and we can see what they can do on that power play, so we've got to be a very, very disciplined hockey club.

Q.  It looked like you and Fedorov were buzzing and it was clicking there for a while.  Did you get that sense as well?

KRIS DRAPER:  Yeah, when Sergei's going, it's an  easy job for me to get him the puck as quick as possible, so we're just going to feed off him tonight.  It looks like he's jumping, jumping across.  He had some great opportunities, and I just wanted to get him the puck.

Q.  Kris, thanks very much and good luck to you.

KRIS DRAPER: Okay.
