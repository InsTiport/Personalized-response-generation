Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: The focus the whole game was a little bit different for us.  We usually play pretty well in this building.  Overtime was evidence of our three periods.  We played pretty forceful hockey and tried to put the puck on net and tried to get some traffic going.  Some things work out for us, some things don't.  In overtime, we really pressed hard offensively, and when the defense was coming in and supporting the forwards, it helps us tremendously. 
 
Q.  Your line was continuing to generate a lot of offense.
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: I thought we were playing well as far as getting chances, as far as cycling around the net and shooting the puck at the net.  We got a goal off that.  We could have had another one in overtime.  We just work hard I guess.  We try to support each other on cycling and definitely find a way to throw the puck at the net.  Tomas likes to be around the net and Luc is a good player on 1-on-1, and I knew that somewhere there would be loose pucks.  So I kept cycling between those two, and things were happening.
