Q.  You are considered the only natural goal scorer on this team.  Do you feel inside it's got to be you to get the goal?
 
JEFF O'NEILL: I don't think so.  We have got a lot of guys that have contributed in a positive way for our team.  Rod Brind'Amour came up with a big goal, but if it's me that  gets the winner, that would be great.  But I am sure somebody else could step up too. 
 
Q.  Everybody knows about the overtimes but so good one-goal games even in regulation.  Can you explain it?
 
JEFF O'NEILL: Just I think it is a situation we're comfortable being in.  We play a tight system and it's like we believe somebody can go out there and do something positive to help us win and hopefully the same goes for tonight.    
 
Q.  A lot of powerplay chances.  Anything you can do to generate some goals on this powerplay?
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: I think we're moving the puck pretty well.  Seems to me they are playing very high on defense and we don't have much good shots from the point, I guess.  I think we got to generate something down low, and if we change that, I think we'll be all set because we stretch them from two forwards, should be lots of room in the middle. 
 
Q.  You have been on your game.  Goals got to come eventually.
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: Got to keep digging man.
