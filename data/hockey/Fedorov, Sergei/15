SERGEI FEDOROV:  Play very well out there and keep our heads straight, make sure we understand ourselves.  Work as hard as we can.  And, do exactly what we talked about before the game, especially be sure we are playing and sticking with the game plan 
   
 
SERGEI FEDOROV:  I think no matter where you play, Stanley Cup Finals, home or on the road, it is still a quite amount of pressure on your shoulders.  So, I believe if we get back home, it doesn't mean we have to relax and just be cool about it.  We just maybe be more desperate because all those things can relax you a little bit and we tried to push those things away is what you try to. 
 

Q.  How does it feel being up 2 games to zip, though, in the Finals?
 
SERGEI FEDOROV:  Well, it is a good opportunity.  I think we played hard those two games and obviously it feels great.  But just like I said, we got to keep your mind straight and it is not over until it is over 'til four wins.
