Q. You were on the ice for the first Detroit goal.  What was your vantage point?
 
AARON WARD: We're familiar with what Holmer does in front of the net on the powerplay, shoves the goalie, causes some havoc.  He did that.  I think if I would have left him, we could have got a penalty basically there. He was backing in the whole way.  Tough one. 
 
Q. No laughing matter now, everybody was joking you might share some secrets of your former teammates.  Do you say anything to your teammates or coach?
 
AARON WARD: Yeah, actually I have a lot to share, eight odd years and I am familiar with what is going on here, so I know the tendencies.  Holmer drew that penalty, that's his game, you know; boxes and battles; when he gets an opportunity he's going to put himself in a position to get a penalty called against him.   
 
Q. Can you go over the goal, looks like just the traffic in front?
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: I was giving out to Steve from half boards, but he decided to shoot it and then I went to the net and Tomas did all the work.  He sort of bring two defensemen and him and then I got the rebound, it was empty net pretty much. 
 
Q. Nice to get it going after the long wait?
 
SERGEI FEDOROV: Yeah, it has been very hard out there but nice to get off with a good start. 
 
STEVE YZERMAN: Really playing a pressure game with experience.  It's tough, the ice is terrible right now.  It's tough to make good passes, but we're very aggressive and we have had a chance to watch this team intensely through the second and third round.  They are playing extremely well, and we really got to play our best hockey, build off the Colorado series to beat this team. 
 
Q. Steve, thanks, good luck with it.
