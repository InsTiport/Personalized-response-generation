THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  How are you preparing yourself for the atmosphere you're going to see tomorrow night?  
MATT MURRAY: Yeah, I think you don't try to ignore it.  Obviously it's going to be there.  At the end of the day, that doesn't really affect what I need to do out there.   
What happens outside the glass once the puck is dropped really should have no impact.  That's kind of how I try to keep my focus, is just to do my thing and try to do my job the best I can.   
 Q.  You've had to deal with some physicality already.  Do you expect them to ramp it up a little bit?  Are you prepared for that?  
MATT MURRAY: I don't know if I expect it or not.  They're going to do what they're going to do.  If I go by the first two games, I probably would expect it.  But I'm prepared for that.  Maybe get a call here or there, whatever it may be.   
But, yeah, I'm prepared for whatever they may throw at me in the crease.
