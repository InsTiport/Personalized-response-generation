THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Matt, some goalies don't like to have so many shot‑blockers in front of them all the time. Some goalies want to see the puck. That doesn't seem to be an option with your team. How have you had to deal with that defensive system that tries to smother so many shots?
MATT MURRAY: I think that's a huge part of their offense, is trying to get pucks through from the point with shots and tips. The more we can stop the puck from getting to our net front, I think the better chance we're going to have. 
From my standpoint, it's just a matter of trying to battle through the traffic. It's not always easy. There's no real exact recipe for it. You just try to compete through the screen and do whatever you can to find the puck. 

Q. Evgeni, what was working for you tonight? You looked to be more aggressive. 
EVGENI MALKIN: I'm not change my game lot. I mean, I want little bit more play with puck. My goal is like Phil give me empty net. It's not like great goal, but it's just go to net, you know, and stay close to net and try play around net. When I have puck, I'm try shoot. It's simple game tonight for me. 

Q. When did you see Phil breaking the first goal?
EVGENI MALKIN: I see he use his speed, you know, his line. I'm try give him just little bit forward. I know he's on puck always. I have good position because I look to back and I see Phil skate little bit behind me. It's just control puck and give him. 

Q. Evgeni, the power play, as a team, how good is it to finally get a power play goal in the series?
EVGENI MALKIN: Yeah, we not score for three games. Of course, it's simple: if you want win, you need use our power play. We not score first three games. But it's work tonight. 
Yeah, of course, it's easy when you score, feels so much better. It's just move puck, you know, and feel great. 

Q. Matt, you've played some games in half‑empty American Hockey League rinks. Now you're one win from lifting the Stanley Cup. How do you put your perspective on a night like this one?
MATT MURRAY: Yeah, that's a great question. I think it goes to show you, you can never predict what's going to happen. 
My mindset has been this whole time to stay in the moment, take things as they come, focus on being in the present and taking things one shot at a time. I think that's been working for me. 
Like I said from day one, I'm just trying to have fun through all this. It's been an absolute blast so far. I'm going to look to keep that same mindset going forward. 

Q. Geno, on the power play goal, when Sid won the draw, you went straight to the net. What made you go straight to the net right there?
EVGENI MALKIN: It's our power play, you know. I stay on board, and I go to forecheck if he lost. After, if he win, we try switch. 
I don't know, we not switch and it work. Maybe next game we play same. Usually we switch after faceoff. I don't know why I'm stay, but it's work. 

Q. Matt, your team has been able to give you the lead in each game this series. Does it leave you more at ease knowing you're able to play with the lead?
MATT MURRAY: Yeah, I think so. It's always important to try and get the first goal. I mean, it's always important to try and get the next one, too. We've been able to do that. 
But at the same time, my job's to stop the puck. Whether we're up, whether we're down, I try to keep the same mindset. 

Q. Matt, you weren't tested that much for the first two periods. What was your mindset like in the first two periods when you weren't getting any kind of action?
MATT MURRAY: Same thing. Just try to stay in the moment and just worry about the next shot. If you're not getting a lot of shots, you can't just sit there and overthink or do anything like that. You just worry about stopping the next one. It's not in your control. You're not choosing to have no work during the first two periods. 
It can be difficult. Like I said, you stay focused and worry about the next one. 
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.
