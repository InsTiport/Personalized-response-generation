Q.  Missed opportunity like that?

CHRIS SIMON:  I don't think so.  I think we had chances to score and we didn't score and like that play there, puck rolled and he was just trying to put it in the empty net and it went wide.  Sometimes things like that happen.  We can't get down.  We have to stay positive and go out and get ready for this third game because.  It is an important one.  We have got to put things in perspective and take it one game at a time.  We can't, you know, think that way.  We have got to make sure we go out and get the job done in the next game and don't have any breakouts or lapses out there.  They are a great hockey team and they capitalize on turnovers and we have got to make sure that we keep the puck on the outside and not chip it into the middle.


Q.  Is it any harder to lose a game that you are up 2 goals late than it is that you are getting blown out in?

CHRIS SIMON:  This time of the year, it is always tough when you lose.  We are here because we want to win.  We didn't go this far by wanting to lose or thinking it is tough to lose.  We go out with the will to win and we are not scared to lose.  We go out and give it our all and nobody expected to us come this far and, you know, we believe in ourselves and we just got to go home and get ready for this third game.
