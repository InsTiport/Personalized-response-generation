Q.  How important is it to see Dale maybe in his Final year go out and be successful?

CHRIS SIMON:  It is great for Dale because he is very well liked because he is like a father to a lot of us guys.  He is a leader on and off the ice and we are very happy for him.  But, I think we want to win even more because when you -- I think when you come this far and when you lose I don't think it would be any fun.  I lost in the juniors in the Finals and I know how it felt.  I have never lost in the NHL.  I have only been there once, but would it definitely be great for Dale.


Q.  Personally for you, you have developed so much as a player since you have been traded to Washington.  Talk about that.

CHRIS SIMON:  I came back from my shoulder injury and I was trying real hard out there and things weren't going well.  Obviously my timing wasn't there, but Dale just kept talking to me on the bench all the time and telling me not to worry about things, just go out and play and just try to play physical because obviously my size, my hands --


Q.  Your hands look pretty good there.

CHRIS SIMON:  Yeah, they are nice and soft.  They are not all cut up now.  Normally I could hardly close them at this time of the year.  No, but Dale has been a good influence on me.
