  Q.  Pahlsson line present any troubles to you guys?  What did they do differently that maybe caused some problems to you?   
 JASON SPEZZA:  They did a good checking.  I don't think it presents more problems than any other checking line.  We didn't have our sharpest night as a team, and because of that they got the win.   
  
  Q.  (Indiscernible) totally outshot?   
 JASON SPEZZA:  We didn't do good enough job getting pucks on them.  We have a few things we have to change in our game.  We just didn't seem like we had as much jump out there.   
  
  Q.  Was that as tough as it's been throughout the playoffs?   
 JASON SPEZZA:  A little bit.  It's not so much what they did, it's what we didn't do as a line, team.  We didn't have as much jump.  When you don't have jump and you're not hard on pucks, you don't get as many chances.   
  
  Q.  Did the lay off and the time factor into this?   
 JASON SPEZZA:  We'll obviously say the lay off is going to be a bit of a factor because we didn't feel good.  It's not easy adjusting with that many days off.  You don't expect it to be easy, but we could have won the hockey game regardless.  We didn't feel we played well.   
  
  Q.  How about the five-on-two?   
 JASON SPEZZA:  We had some chances.  I hit a post.  Saves, get up 3-1, we put ourselves in a good spot.
