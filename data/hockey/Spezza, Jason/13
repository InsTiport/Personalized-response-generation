Q.   Happy face this morning?
 
JASON SPEZZA:  Yeah, I always try to have a good time when I'm out there.  I think last night was great.  You know, I was kind of good for the night.  But now I'm trying to park it now and just move on.  We have a battle ahead of us.  There's a lot more hockey to go.  
 
Q.  Did you put more pressure on yourself because of that performance, that everybody's going to expect it in the second game?
 
JASON SPEZZA:  I don't think so.  I think even during the first game, I just wanted to go out and play my game, just relax and play with confidence.  I think I'm going to continue to do that.  I don't expect to, you know, do that every night.  But if I do, then that's great.  But, you know, you never know. 
 
Q.  Do you expect them to pay more attention to you tomorrow night?
 
JASON SPEZZA:  I don't know.  I'm sure they won't change their game play plan out there.  It works for them.  They're a great hockey team.  We've got to be ready.
