 Q.  Bryan said today moments ago that he thinks you're going to be skating, you're going to be the big factor for Saturday? 
 JASON SPEZZA:  Yeah, I know that I have to become an impact guy and I have to try and help get us out of this.  We're all in this together. 
 But obviously I have to be a catalyst.  When you're playing center and top line, a lot of responsibilities go to you to create plays. 

 Q.  Sometimes home ice, maybe in this case a change of scenery can be a good thing.  You guys have been talking about how fans may be important, kind of cheering you on? 
 JASON SPEZZA:  Support here has been great the whole time.  We love playing here at home.  Hopefully we can keep winning.  We've been winning quite a bit here.  We've just got to keep going. 

 Q.  Are you looking forward to the last change, it might help you? 
 JASON SPEZZA:  They're going to get their matchup if they want it.  They'll be adamant getting guys off the ice.  So it will help us a little bit.  But it's not the end of the world if we end up playing the check line.
