Q.  Can you express your reaction to being backed by somebody?

JASON SPEZZA: It's unbelievable joining up in Canada and getting the chance to play on the A team now.  And it's pretty special for my family.  It's close to home.  I'm really excited. 


Q.  Did you have any indication that this was going to happen?

JASON SPEZZA: No.  Really.  I heard rumblings last night and early on today, but it's so hard.  Anything can happen on draft day and it's amazing it happened this way and it's worked out well. 


Q.  Do you feel any added pressure playing for a Canadian team?

JASON SPEZZA: No.  I don't think so.  I'll just go out and play and try to have fun and getting a chance to see up in Canada, it's going to be unbelievable and I grew up on the home turf.  It'll be pretty awesome. 


Q.  Do you feel now that you've been drafted by a Canadian team that you can come in next year and help contribute right away?

JASON SPEZZA: I think so.  I've worked really hard this summer.  It's been my only goal throughout the year and the summer to try and play good next year.  And I think if I work hard I'll be able to do that.  And I'm confident in myself, I will contribute.


Q.  What about stepping in in place of the now departed Alexei Yashin.  What do you feel about trying to fill that void?

JASON SPEZZA: I'm trying to fill the void.  I'll go in there and ease my way in and try and do as much as I can.  I haven't had time to think about it.  I'm very excited.  It's pretty awesome.  I'm sure I'll sit down and think about it more later on.
