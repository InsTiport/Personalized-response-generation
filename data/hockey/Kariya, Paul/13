Q.  What does this mean to you, to have a game like this -- playing a game like this with these guys?

PAUL KARIYA:  It's great. It's such an honor  to be here, to play with all these great players. These are people I've idolized growing up. It's such a tremendous honor.


Q.  Was it what you were expecting?

PAUL KARIYA:   Yeah. This game was a little more intense. I played in the past when it was Eastern versus Western Conferences and I think this game is a lot more exciting and a lot more enjoyable.


Q.  You had a couple of real good chances. Were you beginning to wonder whether you were going to get one through there?

PAUL KARIYA:   We had some good chances and Mike did really well. We were trying to hold those guys; they had a lot of speed and they can handle the puck.  It's great to play with those guys. They both have a lot of speed and they can handle a puck. Mike did really well.


Q.  Was Gretzky the right choice for MVP?

PAUL KARIYA:   I thought he was the right choice. He was awesome today. It's amazing, he's been doing it for so many years and some of those passes, you just shake your head.


Q.  Can you imagine being his age and still playing among All-Stars?

PAUL KARIYA:   I'd like to. That would be  awesome. But, you know, he's so intelligent out there. He plays the game so well. He can play the game forever. It's unbelievable how well he sees the game and how he uses his teammates out there to produce offensive chances.
