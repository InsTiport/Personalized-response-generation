Q.  Can you put into words what you are feeling right now?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Well, big time disappointment, obviously, but I think when we look back and see what our team accomplished this year, it was definitely a great run  getting to the Stanley Cup Finals.  We didn't finish the job and little a little  disappointed about that. 
 
Q.  (Question about Giguere and the Conn Smythe)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Well deserved.  He was incredible, first Playoff run and can't talk enough about him.  We wouldn't be here without him. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Right now it's difficult.  It very disappointing, not coming through, I am sure we'll look back and be proud of what we accomplished.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Well, a defensive team like that is going to be better at home ice because they are getting the matchups that they want.  We did a good job at home.  We needed a win here, we didn't get it.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Well, we had some good chances in the offensive zone, especially in the second period, but we couldn't capitalize and we didn't get no shots through.  That was the story all through the series when we played here. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: Well deserved.  He was a rock for us.  Very well deserved.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
PAUL KARIYA: We made big strides as an organization and there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle there.  Starting at goal and Bryan did an unbelievable job this season and getting us to be a much improved team, obviously Mike did a great job by coaching us.  We will be back.
