Q.  (Inaudible)?

PAUL KARIYA: It's a very positive  -- well, the first two games, as a team we were horrible.  We didn't do anything out there.  We come home and get two wins.  Our fourth line wins us a game, and our third line wins us a game in the second game.  That's very positive.  The top two lines have to continue playing well defensively, and scoring chances and the goals will come.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

PAUL KARIYA: Well, we're here right now, and this is the game.  The first time we came here, we just weren't ready to play.  We didn't have the legs underneath us, and obviously we had some time off.  Now we're into the series.  Our legs are going.  We're moving the puck better and we're starting to play like we did throughout the playoffs when we were great on the road.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

PAUL KARIYA: Yeah, we just have to  -- we have to create more scoring chances, I think that's one of the things.  But we can't take any risks out there.  We have to be smart defensively, move the puck up the boards, take what they give us. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

PAUL KARIYA: Well, we played a very patient defensive game and we used our speed and puck skills offensively to create scoring chances.  We have had early success on the road that gave us a lot of confidence.
