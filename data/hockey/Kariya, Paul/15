Q.  Personally, who has been the biggest influence on your career so far?

PAUL KARIYA: That is a tough question.  I couldn't give you one person.


Q.  How about a combination of a couple?

PAUL KARIYA: I mean, all the coaches that -- everyone has been great.


Q.  Do you have any words for your hometown on the north shore of Vancouver, any message to kids?

PAUL KARIYA: I obviously would like to say hi to all my family and friends there.  I hope they enjoy the game.  I think in terms of how to get here, it is a lot of hard work and dedication to what we are doing. As long as you enjoy yourself and you enjoy doing what you are doing, and I think you evolve sooner or later, you get to a place like this.


Q.  When did you realize that you would be in the NHL?

PAUL KARIYA: Always a question mark in my mind because of my size or lack of strengths, whatever  they were saying.  But I think once I got to the University of Maine and I got drafted and I realized. I am at least going to get an opportunity to play Friday and show myself that I can play.
