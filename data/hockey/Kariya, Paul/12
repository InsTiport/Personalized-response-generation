Q.  An uncharacteristic start to the game.  There threatened to be a defensive struggle. There were no goals scored in the first five minutes. What do you think of that?

PAUL KARIYA:   I was talking to Shanahan and they're playing the left-wing lock out there.


Q.  This is not like the Olympics or World Championships, and you missed both last year. Do you raise your level of play for events like this?

PAUL KARIYA:   Of course, you want to win the games and it's fun. It's great to be playing with all these players in an event like this and you never know if this is going to be your last one.


Q.  How did the goal feel?

PAUL KARIYA:   It felt great.
