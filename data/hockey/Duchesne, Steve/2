Q.  You have played 15 years in this league, and this is the closest you have been to a Cup, but you don't feel close enough yet?

STEVE DUCHESNE: Actually, it's been 16 years in the league, so I am old.  But it's fun to be part of this, and it's exciting as hell.  It's hard to sleep, especially the day of the game, and so we have to keep going though.

Q.  You and Luc Robitaille were really on the jump in that first period of play.  Is this something that motivates you, that it's now late and you have a chance?

STEVE DUCHESNE: Well, obviously you're playing and you realize you don't have many more chances to go all the way.  So we're playing with a great boost, and it's very exciting.  But we have to control our emotions and hopefully walk away with the win.
