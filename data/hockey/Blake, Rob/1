  Q. How hard is it not to wear the emotions you have on your face?   
 ROB BLAKE: I mean, like I said, we're in this position for a reason. We'll accept that.   
 But, like I said, our focus will be on tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What do you need to do differently?   
 ROB BLAKE: I don't think we need to play much different than we did the last couple. There are some things we can bear down a little bit better on. We'd like to execute better on the power-play. As far as our level of competitiveness, being ready to play, we'll keep what we had yesterday.
