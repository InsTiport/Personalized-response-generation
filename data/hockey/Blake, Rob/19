GARY MEAGHER:  Questions for Rob?


Q.  How do you spell Brandy?

ROB BLAKE:  With a Y.


Q.  Does she have aris; don't think about scoring or assisting.  He said your play is going to dictate whether you win that award or not.  

ROB BLAKE:  You know, that was a key time where he really sat down and talked to me a little bit about his experiences winning a trophy and winning cups and things.


Q.  Rob, is it kind of surprising you're talking about making the All-Star Team.

ROB BLAKE:  Yeah.  I mean, but if you look at the year I had last year and the start of this year, I probably didn't deserve to be on that All-Star.  I think it was more of a wake-up call.  You want to  be put in that category, you want to be with those players all the time.  When you're not, you kind of realize that you better pick your game up and get to a different level to get back there.


Q.  Highlights of the season, besides the game in Toronto?

ROB BLAKE:  I think, obviously, we've been in the playoffs for five years.  That first playoff game on the road was in St. Louis.  Still, the feeling of being back and the excitement that surrounds it, it makes you realize you don't want to miss those playoffs again.  I think we have a young team and these guys are going to understand that for years to come.


Q.  Your wedding is in Los Angeles?

ROB BLAKE:  Yes.  Tony Granato and Nelson Emerson are my two best men.  Tony flew here with me to present that award.  We'll take off tomorrow.


Q.  Tony and who?

ROB BLAKE:  Nelson Emerson.
