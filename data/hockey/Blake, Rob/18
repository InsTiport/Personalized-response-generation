ROB BLAKE:  Wow.  First of all, I'd like to thank  or congratulate both Chris and Nick on two great years.  It was a lot of fun for all of us. 
 
These awards are a direct result of how well the team does.  Now in Los Angeles we have a dedication to win from the owners down the management, Dave Taylor, the coaches, and all the players.  Fortunately for me I played with great players in eight years and learned a lot of experience there. 
 
I'd like to thank my mother and father, who are with me tonight, for their support.  I'd like to thank my family and friends who are back in Los Angeles, and my fianc√©e, Brandy, who's in Los Angeles preparing for my wedding on Saturday.  Thank you.
