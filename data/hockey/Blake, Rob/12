Q.  Congratulations on the goal Turner, but what kind of game did the team play in the second period?  You couldn't extend?
 
TURNER STEVENSON:  Well, we had a good chance, a few powerplay chances.  Overall we are playing well.  A lot better effort than we put in the other night.  We have got one more to do. 
 

Q.  You and Bob Corkum have been switching on and off.  When a guy like yourself or Corkum gets the call what do you have  to do?
 
TURNER STEVENSON:  It's especially tough for him, he has not been in in almost a good month here   - come in, keep it simple, and he has played in the game long enough to know what his job and it is a big goal for us.   
 
Q.  What is the big difference that you were so dominant in Game 1 and the effort tonight? 
 
ROB BLAKE:   We have the mentality and each guy must have to step up  and play better.  We have to do that in the third.  
 

Q.  Can you explain to me the mental difference between the two games because you are so much better tonight?
 
BOBBY HOLIK:  We just realize what we had to do.  Sometimes when you are playing for a longer period of time you feel pretty good about yourself.  Once in a while you need a bit of a reminder that the effort comes first before the skills.  That's what we are doing tonight.  
 

Q.  How much are you playing with fire with your powerplays by giving them a lot of opportunities?
 
BOBBY HOLIK:  We are giving them too many powerplay opportunities and they are good.  We have to stay off taking the penalties and I think we will be okay.  
 

Q.  Third period, are you playing anymore defensive or are you headed right at them?
 
BOBBY HOLIK:  We have to stay right at them, Sakic and Hejduk have amazing skills and that's how we get into trouble.
