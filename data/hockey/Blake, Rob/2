  Q. It's been a civil series so far.   
 ROB BLAKE: Maybe that last five minutes showed a little bit of that. But that develops over the series. We can increase our intensity. We can play harder and more effectively, getting out of our zone a little more quickly, making sure things go the way we want them to.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding home ice.)   
 ROB BLAKE: Obviously we're going to go in there and try to do what they did to us. We'll worry about the game Friday night first.   
  
  Q. You're aware the rest of the outside world isn't betting on you now.   
 ROB BLAKE: No, that's for sure. We haven't been in this position. We were down one in Colorado. Now we're down two. Like I said, when you go into the weekend games here, you've got to concentrate on Friday night's game and take that one first.
