Q.  You guys didn't make as many shots.  You got outshot two to one there?

ROB BLAKE: Yeah, we didn't generate  -- we got to control the puck a little more, control the play.  I mean, that's the game they want to play and that's the game we need to play, and tonight they dominated that part of it.

Q.  Are you putting enough pressure or are they keeping you from putting enough pressure on Hasek, because 21 shots, you're going to have to get more than that on him?

ROB BLAKE: You're right, you're right, but I think it starts in our zone more so in control, not so much pressure on their guys, but coming up with extra speed with the puck.

Q.  Rob, when you guys went ahead with your goal and you guys got the double minor on Holmstrom, it seemed like you guys (inaudible).  Is that a back breaker not to score on that?

ROB BLAKE: It's tough.  You could put them behind the eight ball big time.  We had some chances out there, and on that power play that we did not finish, and obviously it cost us tonight.
