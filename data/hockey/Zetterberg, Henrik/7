  Q. That stuff at the end of the game, how much of that is frustration on their part or bad blood that's kind of going between the two teams?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, I think in the playoffs and finals like this, there is a lot of emotions, a lot of feelings. When you get scrums that's the way it is. It should be a lot of feelings, and you know, nothing more than that.   
  
  Q. Do you think the biggest difference after two games is the fact that you've capitalized on the mistakes that Pittsburgh's made and they really haven't done that against you yet?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, you know, we've been able to get more goals than them. I think both teams are giving the other teams odd-man rushes. I think especially for us the day after ten-minute marks every period, I think we kind of sat back a little bit, and we gave them a little more chances. They had a lot of chances. They created a lot. Ozzie played good again, and it saved us.  
  
  Q. When did you last time have a five minutes for fighting, and could you tell us something about what happened there with Malkin?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, I think that is first one. And what happened, I think Talbot went over and slashed Ozzie a little bit, and they got a scrum. And Malkin came around the net, and off it went.   
  
  Q. You've scored a goal in each game now directly off a face-off after an icing. Do you take face-offs to be that serious where you know when you win a lot of face-offs you're going to have obviously more opportunities to score goals?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, I think both teams are puck possession teams. And it makes it a lot easier if you start with the puck instead of you have to spend 20, 50 seconds to chase it.   
 Actually, I think they were better than us today in face-offs. In the first game I think we had the upper hand, but today they did a better job. I think they won most of them.   
  
  Q. Did Malkin surprise you? Are you guys anywhere close to playing at your best game in these first two games?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Well, I don't know if he surprised me. He came around the net and I saw him, so I don't think he surprised me there. Still I think we can play a lot better. I think if we minimize our mistakes, it will be -- I think it will help us. Because when they're getting odd-man rushes, they're getting a lot of them. We get a lot of speed. And they spend time in our end. And it's tiring when they keep the puck low. So, you know, if we just take care of the puck and try to play a little bit more in there and it will be better for us.
