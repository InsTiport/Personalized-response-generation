  Q. What was it like to have Pavel back, and why were you guys so much better on special teams tonight?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: Yeah, it was, you know, I think everyone was glad to see that Pavel was back. You know, he brought a lot of, you know, energy and on and off the ice. He looked good when he was skating. He had a really good game.   
 Yeah, special teams I think we wanted to shoot a little bit more. Get the second pucks. We did that. We spent some more time in their end, and eventually we got our goals.   
  
  Q. Pavel, was there any rust out there or did it feel like you had not missed any time? You looked pretty strong out there.   
 PAVEL DATSYUK: Yeah, especially what I play with Henrik, he helped me a lot. I feel good today. When I play more, I feel more better and more come back more shape.   
  
  Q. Did you think that Maxime Talbot is trying to go after that foot of yours?   
 PAVEL DATSYUK: I don't know. I have penalty, I'm happy we have penalty, five-on-three. That's what it is.   
  
  Q. There's a lot of talk after the two games in Pittsburgh that you were getting worn down chasing Crosby around. Pittsburgh players were saying it. Did you take that in at all? Did you use it as motivation?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: No, you don't. You try not to pay so much attention to it. The media try to get some things going. You just focus on your game.   
 You know, they're playing well. You know, you're playing out there. Of course you get tired end of the games. But yesterday we had a day off. We refocused, and we were ready to go today.   
  
  Q. Mike said he thought as the series went on you're only going to get stronger and stronger. Would you agree with that? Is that the kind of injury you feel the more ice time you get the more comfortable you're going to be? The better you're going to be?   
 PAVEL DATSYUK: Yeah, when I play more, I'm more comfortable. It's a little bit hard to start with the Final series when I miss a couple of games. But ready to play more, especially with Hank. Lots of confidence, I feel better and better.   
  
  Q. We've heard a number of people say you're not 100%, you're 85%, 50%, whatever. Can you assign a percentage to how healthy you are?   
 PAVEL DATSYUK: I don't have percentage. Maybe other people have percentage, but I don't have any percentage. How much I have, I try to play with this.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised you ended up with Pavel? Obviously, you played with him a lot in your career, but this year not as much. This morning it looked like Pavel might be with Valtteri and Marian, was this the plan all along and we didn't know about it?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: I got the hint a few days ago that we might end up together. You know, it felt good. It was fun to have him by my side again.   
 You know, he makes a lot of good plays. He holds on to the puck, and he creates a lot of room for his line mates. So it was fun to see him out there, and we're all glad he's back.   
  
  Q. Are you having to have the foot frozen before you play?   
 PAVEL DATSYUK: I don't know. I'm thinking it's a secret (laughing). Yeah, try to keep it secret.   
  
  Q. Were you guys able to identify anything of Marc-Andre Fleury after two games in Pittsburgh that may have helped you tonight? Did you find a chink in the armor or did the power plays kind of open things up for you and the flood gates opened?   
 HENRIK ZETTERBERG: I think we just wanted to keep shooting at him. Keep being in front. He's a good goalie. If you see the shot, he's most of the time going to make the save. You just have to be there for the second pucks and I think we did a better job today than we did in Pittsburgh.
