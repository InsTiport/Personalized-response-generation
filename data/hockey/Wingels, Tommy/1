THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

Q. Brent, did you guys do anything different on the power play tonight? Why is it so successful? 
BRENT BURNS: We talked about little things that they do, what we wanted to do. I don't think we changed much. We didn't score last game. We wanted to make a difference this game.
I think all year we've been good if we don't make a difference positively the game before, we can change it the next game. We were able to capitalize on a couple. 

Q. Brent, could you describe your two goals, how they developed, what you saw. 
BRENT BURNS: Two good plays on the boards by Coutch. Then Pav made a great play. Patty made a good one on the second one. 

Q. Call for the puck with Pavs?
BRENT BURNS: I always call for the puck, even when I'm not open (laughter). 

Q. What does the call sound like?
BRENT BURNS: I'm sure you can hear it up there (laughter). 

Q. Tommy, the importance of your line getting a goal? How important is it for the third and fourth line to chip in here and there?
TOMMY WINGELS: It's very important. We talk as a line and as a team, you know, how as a fourth line can we be effective. Maybe most nights it's creating energy. It's punishing the defensemen in the offensive zone. It's forechecking hard, winning battles, playing well defensively. 
That all being said, we have the confidence as a line that we can score. We can wear their D down. We can play in the offensive zone. Tonight I thought we did a great job of that. 
Yeah, the goal is great. Aside from that, I thought we followed it up with numerous shifts after that playing in their zone. As a line, you just got to gain confidence game after game and try to build on it. As a line, we're going to try to do that in Game3. 

Q. Brent, I'm curious, with your shot, is it like a picture or anything like that when you have confidence in it, you're more eager to go with it?
BRENT BURNS: Do I shoot more if I feel good? 

Q. Yeah. 
BRENT BURNS: No, I shoot. Can't pass, though.

Q. Brent and Tommy, do you forget ever that Martin Jones is a rookie doing all this for the first time? 
BRENT BURNS: I don't really think of him as a rookie, I guess. He's won a Cup. He's been through a lot. Won a gold medal last summer. I think he's shown that he can play in stressful situations. 
I mean, I know everybody's been talking about how calm he is. I think he's got experience. I don't really think of him as a rookie really. 
TOMMY WINGELS: Anyone who has followed his career knows he's won at every level. He was successful in junior. Playing against him in the American League, you certainly could never beat him. 
You can see the poise in his game. Seems like he never has an elevated heart rate. In the practice and games, he's always there making big saves. 
Yeah, maybe his experience shows he hasn't played too many games. As teammates and players, we certainly cannot tell that. 

Q. Brent, Hitch just said he says his team should feel fortunate to be 1‑1 here. Do you feel you've had the better play?
BRENT BURNS: I think we feel good with our group, the way we're playing. We've had that all year, I think, the confidence, rolling off four lines, six D, home and away. 
They're a great team. They play hard. Tough building to play in, so... 
It's the playoffs. You're going to play good teams. You're going to have battles back and forth. This series is no different. 

Q. Martin, when the Blues went on that four‑minute power play, what did you see your penalty killers doing effectively?
MARTIN JONES: Yeah, I thought we did a great job with the kill tonight. Obviously, don't want to make a habit of taking that many penalties in the third. 
We blocked shots. The shots we did give up were from areas of the ice that we're okay with. 

Q. Martin, as a goalie, do you feel at times you need to answer for certain things, whether it's a loss or a bad goal? Are there times when you feel even more strongly that you have to show something?
MARTIN JONES: I mean, I'm trying to stop the puck every night regardless. 
But obviously Game1, you don't like to lose on a goal like that. But I thought I played well other than that. I wasn't about to change anything. 
Yeah, really didn't change too much going into tonight. We just played well. We got the bounces tonight. 

Q. Martin, you faced Brent's shot in practice. Are there times when it's unstoppable?
MARTIN JONES: I don't know about 'unstoppable'. But it's good. 

Q. How about Wingels? 
MARTIN JONES: Wingels can shoot the puck, too, yeah. 
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
