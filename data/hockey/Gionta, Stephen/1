Devils   5
  Rangers   3

Q.   Can you detail how the winning goal took place right from the inception, to your putting it in, and when did you smell that this could be the thing?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Kovalchuk did a great job getting it on the forecheck there and being a good F‑1, like we talked about, and taking the body.   The puck was just sitting there and closed my eyes and threw it out to Cart.

Q.   Did you really close your eyes?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   No, I didn't close my eyes.   I just saw him coming down the middle, and I was hoping he was still alone when I put it out there.

Q.   When I spoke with Bryce in the locker room, he compared your attributes to your brother, Brian, how much of a compliment is that to you?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   It's a huge compliment.   He's been in this league for 10, 11 years now, and if I'm in the same comparison, the same, I'm happy.

Q.   Following up on that, several guys who have been in the Devils system who have had brothers play, whether it's yourself, Darcy Sajack, Jordan Parise, is there a sense when you get an opportunity to break through and do things like you're doing for the Devils in these Playoffs that you bring some of them with you, too?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Absolutely.   The organization has shown great loyalty, especially to family, and that's what they preach here in the organization and just have to get the opportunity.

Q.   You didn't have long to gel with that fourth line before the Playoffs started, one game or something like that.   Could you just talk about the chemistry and how you developed that and what you've done in the Playoffs?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   I spent a little time with Bernie in Albany there this year and played a few games with him.   Just as far as chemistry, just going out there, keeping it simple, getting the pucks in deep and getting on the forecheck and try to wear the other team down.

Q.   Can you just talk about the starts that you have throughout this series, and what sort of impact that's had for you guys?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   I think it's huge, especially for our confidence, to get out and have a good start, especially tonight, you know, electric building, I think that benefited us well.
And we held on for two and a half periods there and got the win.

Q.   After all you've been through to get to this spot, AHL stuff, being the smallest guy on the ice most of the time, what does it mean to you to have this kind of game and pretty much the biggest game of the series?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   I can't really explain it in words.   It's just fun to be a part of this right now and just trying to enjoy every moment.

Q.   How much do you realize what a Cinderella story this is?   How much has it sunk in?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Not a lot yet.   We're still going after our ultimate goal there, and we still have a lot of hockey left.

Q.   Do you allow yourself to think that you're one win away from going to the Cup Finals?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   I haven't really thought about that yet.   And you can't get too far ahead of yourself.   And it's a tough team over there, and you know they're going to come out flying.

Q.   What's it like to go against one of your best friends, Ryan Callahan?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   It's pretty exciting.   I had a chance to play against him when he was in Hartford his first year. 
It's something that we'll be able to look back when we're a little bit older and talk about.   I don't know if we'll do too much talking right now.

Q.   When you came up at the end of the season, did you know you'd be on the postseason roster, did you have any expectations of how that would all go?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   No, I didn't really have any expectations.   I'd been told I may be sticking around for the Playoffs and they were going to try to get me in for that last game against Ottawa, and luckily I did, and I got an opportunity to keep going.

Q.   Marty kind of laughingly said that he loved you had this moment because sometimes it's tough for the other brother, being compared, whatever, can you just describe what is your relationship like with your brother?   I know he was at the game the other night.   Has he been in touch with you a lot throughout the series?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Yeah, throughout the Playoffs we talked almost daily, whether it's just a text or call.   And we're pretty close‑knit family with both my brothers and my parents, and it's been great, they've shown great support.   It's just nice to have that.

Q.   You seem to be a better player in the NHL than the AHL.   Really.   I mean, your scoring goals, what's really happened? 
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Getting the bounces, I guess.   A lot of it is luck.   And the pucks just keep going my way right now.

Q.   How much did the American League actually prepare you for this?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   It prepares you, the second‑best league in the world.   Every young player, every draft pick that comes through there and spent some time there, and it's a tough league.
And it definitely prepared me well for this opportunity.   And that's how I got there.

Q.   Can you just talk about what it was like watching, maybe watching your brother go through Playoffs in the past, maybe watching Ryan go through Playoffs in the past, and when Brian won the Cup?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Yeah, definitely you realize just watching it, when Brian won it in'03, what a grind it actually is.   It's a whole new season once you get into the Playoffs. 
And anything can happen.   And it's definitely a grind and something that is exciting to be a part of.

Q.   Do you think there's something about being a relatively unknown quantity, whether it's yourself or Dwight King in LA or Chris Kreider for the Rangers that helps you to get these opportunities when you're out there in these Playoffs?
STEPHEN GIONTA:   Yeah, I think so.   The team's definitely keying in on the top players.   And if you make the most of the opportunity, anything can happen there.
