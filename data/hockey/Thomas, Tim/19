   PIERRE HOUDE: On behalf of the National Hockey League, we'd like to welcome you to this very special presentation. It is an honor for me to say hi to all of my colleagues and my friends, the people from the NHL, of course, the great superstars. It is a thrill for me to be part of that great weekend in my hometown Montreal.   
[SPEAKING FRENCH].  
 As you know, friends, the Gatorade Elimination Shootout will be the grand finale of the SuperSkills Competition tomorrow night at the Bell Centre, and in order to establish the sequence of which goaltender will face one or the other shooter in this special event, the NHL has decided to organize this very special draw session today. The four participating goaltenders are with us today.   
 Let me introduce, first of all, from the Minnesota North Stars, Nicklas Backstrom; from the Anaheim Ducks, Jean-Sebastien Giguere; from the Boston Bruins, Tim Thomas; and from the New York Rangers, Henrik Lundqvist.   
 Here's how it we will do it today. Each goaltender will draw one of the pucks here, and under each puck there is a name of one of the shooters that will participate in the event tomorrow.  
 One little restriction, though, one goaltender cannot face a teammate. That would apply to Jean-Sebastien Giguere in the case of Ryan Getzlaf and Scott Niedermayer, and that would apply also in the case of Tim Thomas, regarding Zdeno Chara, and Mark Savard.   
[ SPEAKING FRENCH]  
 PIERRE HOUDE: We ready? Excited? Okay. Jean-Sebastien Giguere will have the honor. Here is the first choice. Oh. Quite a challenge to start with. Joe Thornton.   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: Joe Thornton, yes.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Tim, just a clarification. This is not Sean Thornton; right? This is Joe Thornton.   
 All right. Tim Thomas, you're next to pick one puck.   
 TIM THOMAS: Ilya Kovalchuk.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Ilya Kovalchuk for Tim Thomas. Ilya Kovalchuk. Do we have some records of you, Timmy, against Ilya? Wow, not bad. One goal in three attempts.   
 TIM THOMAS: Yeah, but he turns you around so much, you almost hurt yourself every time.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Henrik, you're next in line.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Kovalchuk.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: It's not former Rangers Walter can a chuck. That's in another era, can a chuck for Henrik Lundqvist.   
 Now Nicklas Backstrom, you're up next.   
 NICKLAS BACKSTROM: Niedermayer.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Scott Niedermayer. So J.S., any advice for Nciklas?   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: Too bad it's not Rob, but --  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Okay, Scott Niedermayer. So the first round is completed. It's pretty well balanced so far.   
 J.S., Jean-Sebastien?   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: Dan Boyle. The Shark. Apparently I like the Sharks.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Another Shark, a new Shark this year having a great season, and a very skilled defenseman.   
 Tim.   
 TIM THOMAS: Streit. Mark Streit.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: We have your record against Mark. He's 0 for 1, so you're not bad so far, Tim.   
 Henrik, it's your turn now.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Oh. Big shooter. Chara.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: So one of the most powerful shooters in the Shootout Competition this year Zdeno Chara. You would know about that, Timmy.  
 TIM THOMAS: Yes, I hope he doesn't hit you. Hope he misses the net.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: All right, so second, we're going to complete the second round with Nicklas Backstrom. Patrick Marleau is the choice, second round for Nicklas Backstrom.   
 Just a quick explanation about tomorrow, this is the order for the first round. When a player misses scoring, he's out automatically. And then whoever stays will face goaltenders in a different sequence than the first round.   
 [SPEAKING FRENCH].  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Third round.   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: Iggy.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Jarome Iginla. Very accurate shooter, Jarome Iginla. Tim, you're next in line.   
 TIM THOMAS: Malkin. Evgeni Malkin.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Against him you are 1 for 2. You didn't know I had those records.   
 Henrik Lundqvist.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Whoa, Lecavalier.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Vincent Lecavalier in the third round, facing Henrik Lundqvist.   
 Nicklas? Danny Heatley. Nicklas Backstrom's opponent in the third round will be Dany Heatley. So far, so good, gentlemen.   
 Jean-Sebastien Giguere, his first opponent from the Eastern Conference, a great sharp shooter, Thomas Vanek from the Buffalo Sabres. Thomas Vanek.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Tim, you're up. Brian Campbell. That's not Colin Campbell, right? It's Brian Campbell, just to double check. Brian Campbell will face Tim Thomas in the fourth round.  
 Henrik, you're up.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: St. Louis.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Also from the Tampa Bay Lightning, against Henrik, Martin St. Louis.   
 Let me see if I have a record, against St. Louis, Henrik, you're 1 for 2, and it will be the first against Martin St. Louis.   
 Niklas? Mark Savard. Mark Savard will be facing Niklas Backstrom in the fourth round. Mark Savard having an outstanding season as so many individual players for the Boston Bruins.   
 We're beginning the fifth round. Stephane Robidas. Stephane Robidas will be facing Jean-Sebastien in the fifth round. It will be a first for you as well.   
 Tim, you're up.   
 TIM THOMAS: Staal.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: That's one of the six Staal brothers. It will be Eric Staal, of course. Eric Staal, a great shooter as well against Tim Thomas. And that will be a first now, Tim.   
 Henrik?   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Nash.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Rick Nash. The Blue Jackets of Columbus. You'll face Henrik Lundqvist in the fifth round.   
 Nicklas. Shea Webber, a very, very good young, uprising defenseman in the NHL, Shea Webber will be facing Nicklas Backstrom.   
 So, we have completed five rounds out of nine? Everything's going smoothly, guys. We're good. So let's start the sixth round.   
 From the Montreal Canadiens, Mike Komisarek. He will face J.S. in the sixth round in this Shootout Competition.   
 Tim, it's your turn.   
 TIM THOMAS: Jay Bouwmeester will face Tim Thomas in the sixth round. Jay Bouwmeester.   
 Rick Henrik, you're next.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Mr. Brown.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Dustin Brown. Dustin Brown will face Henrik Lundqvist in the sixth round, and we will complete the sixth round with Niklas's draw now. From the Chicago Blackhawks, Jonathan Toews. One of the two -- one of the starting members of the game, the All-Star Game on Sunday night as per the fans voting.   
 It is now time, we're getting into the final stretch, guys. It's now time to start the 7th round. From the Colorado Avalanche, Milan Hejduk, Milan Hejduk for Jean-Sebastien Giguere.   
 Tim, you're up.   
 Oh, I just heard Ahh! Can we boost Tim's microphone a little bit?   
 Alexander Ovechkin. Alex Ovechkin will be facing Tim Thomas. Well, let me see. I probably have it. Well, then again, it's not bad, Tim. You've beaten him twice out of three shots. So... you have the edge. The odds are in your favor.  
 TIM THOMAS: I don't think so.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: He doesn't think so, all right. Here we go with Henrik.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Carter.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Jeff Carter, the Flyers. There's a player you play six times a year against, and you probably know what he's capable of.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Not really.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Having a great season. Jeff Carter against whom you are batting for 1,000. He's 0 for 1 against you.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Perfect.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Now let's go to Nicklas. From the Montreal Canadiens, the man we call the artist, Alex Kovalev will face Nicklas in the seventh round.   
 Two more rounds to go. And Jean-Sebastien's turn. Oh, so Jean-Sebastien has picked Ryan Getzlaf as you can see.   
 So now I will ask you guys to turn around, and Catherine has to put the puck back and you don't have to look where it's going to be. We want you to play around a little bit. Here we go. A little trick. Here we go.   
 Okay. Jean-Sebastien, it's your turn again. Oh, Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks. Tim?   
 TIM THOMAS: Modano.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: From the Dallas Stars, Mike Modano. Henrik, you're up.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: The Canadien from the Montreal Canadiens, Andre Markov.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: You have beaten him once.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Great.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Nicklas, you're the last in the final to last round. Certainly one of the hardest shots in the League, Sheldon Souray from the Edmonton Oilers.   
 We are now entering the last round, and let me throw a little item here, very important.   
 Guys, listen, you will be allowed one trade after the last round. So there are no specific rules here. We just want you to behave properly. But you will be allowed one trade. Jean-Sebastien?   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Ryan Getzlaf again. Once again, the puck has to go back, and Catherine, you have to do a little swinging here. All right.   
 Okay. It has to be Getzlaf again, of course. All right. Any of the other three. Thomas Kaberle from the Toronto Maple Leafs. So now you know. All right, close your eyes.   
 Here we go. Okay. Tim, it's your turn.   
 TIM THOMAS: Here goes Ryan Getzlaf against Tim Thomas. Henrik, one of the last two?   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Don't.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Shane Doan from the Phoenix Coyotes. Shane Doan, the last pick for Henrik Lundqvist.   
 And now, Nicklas? Last but not least, from the New Jersey Devils, one of the young and best sharp shooters in the League, skillful player, Zach Parise.   
 So, here's the order, as randomly selected by the goaltenders, the four of them will participate in the Super Shootout, the Gatorade Shootout tomorrow.   
 Now, guys, I know it's a little public today. You will now be allowed one trade within the four of you.   
 I think we have the first trade to announce. I feel like Gary Bettman in the draft.   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: I'm going to get St. Louis.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: Martin St. Louis will move against Jean-Sebastien Giguere.   
 And Henrik, who do you choose?   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: It's a tough one.   
 JEAN-SEBASTIEN GIGUERE: You can take Iggy, he's nothing. (Laughing).   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: I faced Boyle a lot of times, I think.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: You want to see your records?   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Yeah, thank you.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: I'll give you a freebie here. It's not so bad. I mean, you've got some options there.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: Yeah.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: It's got to be from J.S.'s list, though.   
 HENRIK LUNDQVIST: I'll go with Robidas.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: So Stephane Robidas's going to move from J.S.'s list to Henrik. How about you two guys?   
 TIM THOMAS: We're working on one.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: No future consideration is allowed, guys. No cash. Well, that's your own problem, but not publicly, at least (smiling).   
 TIM THOMAS: I'll take Heatley, for Kovalchuk.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: I just heard no. I must admit that Timmy is all right. He's not trying to trade Ovechkin right off the bat, so.   
 TIM THOMAS: I'm trying to think if I ever faced Modano. Yeah, I've saved him once.   
 PIERRE HOUDE: I tell you what, general managers could take some lessons from what's going on here.   
 TIM THOMAS: All right.  
 PIERRE HOUDE: Is it going to be K against K? Kovalchuk for Kovalev.   
 This is a spectacular trade. Ilya Kovalchuk against Alex Kovalev. So Alex Kovalev moves to Timmy Thomas, and Timmy Thomas's opponent, and Ilya Kovalchuk going to Nicklas Backstrom.   
 All done? Thank you very much, guys. All the best for you. Have fun especially, and welcome once again to Montreal. Have fun tomorrow.
