 Q.  What happened when it looked like Malakhov clipped you in the neck, can you tell us what happened and how you're feeling now? 
 ROBERT ESCHE:  No, I was fine.  I just got a stick in the neck and, you know, got me pretty good in the beard, I've got the beard.  Just something like that, as a goalie, you always think of stuff like that, what happens.  I was just more concerned with that than anything else, but it was fun. 
 Q.  How big of a deal is it for you to come back to Philadelphia having won one on the road in the opening two? 
 ROBERT ESCHE:  We treat every game the same.  We've been well prepared all year long, and headed into tonight's game just like we did the first game. 
 Obviously, it was a little more important to head back with 1-1, but on the same hand, I think we were prepared in both games. 
 Q.  What were some of the major adjustments the team made in front of you tonight? 
 ROBERT ESCHE:  People that know me from Philadelphia know that I don't really talk about that.  I'm not a guy that talks that much on how we play the game and stuff like that.  I just kind of, you know, worry about what I've got to do.  Sorry. 
 Q.  Did it help you at all when you went up 1-0 after just two minutes? 
 ROBERT ESCHE:  Yeah, whenever you go up a goal early in the game, it's going to give everybody a lot of emotion and it definitely lifted us up pretty good today. 
 Q.  What do you think that meant to John LeClair to finally get a goal, since he's probably been pressing for a long time. 
 ROBERT ESCHE:  I've got to be honest, I don't think I could tell you one of our goal scorers today, I don't pay that much attention to it. 
 If Johny scored, I'm sure that's a big burden off his back.  But he's a professional.  You know, stuff like that doesn't get to the other guys, the older guys.
