  Q.  Did you sense you were going to end up third by what happened in the last couple days?   
 JACK JOHNSON:  No, I had a sense that I'd be somewhere around there, but I knew that it was all up to the teams.  It was out of my control.  I really had no idea what was going to happen.   
 I'm just happy it happened and happy to be a part of the Carolina Hurricanes organization.   
  Q.  Everyone knew who was going to go No. 1.  The big question was who was going to follow Sidney.  What was like for the group of you guys to kind of sit and watch everything going on all weekend and wonder where you were going to go in the draft?   
 JACK JOHNSON:  I mean, it was obviously -- it was a little bit stressful.  I was nervous.  But at the same time I was very excited and knew whatever was going to happen, it was going to be awesome.  I was going to be happy no matter what happened when I came out of here.   
  Q.  Can you talk about your friendship with Sidney.  I understand you worked out this morning.  What has it been like to go through this whole process with him?   
 JACK JOHNSON:  Yeah, we became friends in 10th grade at Shattuck-St. Mary's in Minnesota.  We hit it off right at try-outs, trying out for the same team.  We were the two sophomores on the team.  We've kept in touch ever since, talking once, twice a week.   
 We always work out together.  It was nice to have a friend here to kind of take your mind off things and just be a regular teenage kid here.   
  
 JACK JOHNSON:  Thank you.
