Q.  What's it like to play in the same line as Peter Forsberg?

MATS SUNDIN: It's fun. We don't play in the same line a lot, me and Peter. We haven't done it since we've been on the National team. It's fun. It's certainly something. It's certainly a lot easier to play hockey when you have a guy on your line like Peter.


Q.  (Inaudible: Commenting on the game.)

MATS SUNDIN: I think everybody that's playing at the moment like we are have been so fortunate. I think it's very easy to get back to the game and try to have a good attitude. And when you're out playing like this, you're not really representing yourself but you're representing the team that you're playing for and the National Hockey League. So I think you're trying to behave and be a good sport.
