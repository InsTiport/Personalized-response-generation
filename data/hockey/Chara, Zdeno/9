   FRANK BROWN: Questions for Zdeno.   
  
  Q. What's going through your mind when you're stepping into that second attempt there?   
 ZDENO CHARA: To shoot even harder than the first one. Simple as that.   
 I knew I would have to put another really hard shot, and basically I gave it all I had, and I'm just glad it worked out.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the Right to Play, how you got connected with that, and why it appeals to you? And how the charitable end of this competition, I understand you sort of challenged the rest of the guys, and the PA put in some money, and the League put in some money. Can you talk a bit about that, please?  
 ZDENO CHARA: Basically, I got involved like talking to my teammates Andy Ference, he's been involved with Right to Play the year before I joined the Right to Play. Simply by spreading the message.   
 I really liked the idea of coming to Africa, seeing the locations, how they are trying to help children and families. I really like to be involved, and I think it's just a great charity program, and I'm just being really happy to be part of it.   
 Today is a very special day. Hopefully we can spread this even further to the future. Again, I'm very, very thankful to all of the players, the hockey clubs, NHL, and NHLPA for donating money, and hopefully we can do this every year, every All-Star. You know, it's for a good cause, so thank you.   
  
  Q. Had you ever been clocked at that high before? I mean, that's quite an impressive shot. Had you ever gone that high before when you were clocked?   
 ZDENO CHARA: No. That's the highest I've ever shot it. I've been few times around 103, 104, 102.   
 You know, you always want to shoot the hardest shot, but always it's the All-Star record, so I'm very happy.
