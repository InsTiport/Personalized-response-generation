 Q. Joe did a good job of being physical and aggressive last night. Do you think the rest of the team can do a better job moving forward in the series? 
 DAN BOYLE: Yeah, I think so. I think you can always improve. We're down 2-0. Something needs to get better. I think it can start with physical play. 

 Q. A lot of people counting you guys out. Do you feed off that? 
 DAN BOYLE: Yeah. Obviously, I don't want to be in this position. But, you know, this is a good time for us to come together here, raise our middle finger in the air, you know, just do it together. It's going to take a lot of work. 

 Q. When a team is faced with a 2-0 deficit, is it sometimes good to get away? 
 DAN BOYLE: Yeah, it's good to be on the road sometimes. You eliminate some of the distractions you have at home. In this case, yeah, I think it's good for us to go, get out of here, try to get this series back on track here. 

 Q. Scott Nichol was saying maybe you need to put more of a hate on for those guys. 
 DAN BOYLE: Yeah. I mean, whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. I think we can all look at ourselves in the mirror and realize that what we're doing is not good enough. 
 I think whatever it takes for every individual to get better, you know, make an impact on the series. Past is the past. We have to live with what we're doing today. It hasn't been good enough. 

 Q. Anything about their high-end guys that have taken you by surprise? 
 DAN BOYLE: In particular, no. They're who we thought they were, and they're doing what they're supposed to do. We need to raise our game and have our top guys raise their games. Yeah, no, they're doing what they're supposed to do.
