   DAN BOYLE: Opened up USA Today and there was a quote saying we are not working hard enough. I don't think it's a work thing. We are working hard. I've seen the guys working hard. There's a difference between working hard and working smart. I think that's the difference the first two games.   
 We're working. We're working hard. Definitely I don't think that's the problem. There can always be improvement, of course. But working smart is a different thing. It's one thing to work, but if you're not getting it accomplished, you're just wasting time.   
 So it's execution, it's getting something accomplished every time you're on the ice. You don't have to be scoring goals, but getting something accomplished. That's more the message I wanted to relay after Game 2. It was taken out of context. I meant more the effort.   
  
  Q. It's been called a must-win game for the Blackhawks.   
 DAN BOYLE: We were in this position last series against Detroit. You don't want to give them a pulse. Their game plan is to go up 3-0 and finish this off. I think that's a good attitude they need to have. Ours is obviously to get ourselves back into this thing. We'll get that pulse and we'll grow from it, be a better team.   
  
  Q. Is it a good thing or bad thing that Nashville and Vancouver came in and won their first games?   
 DAN BOYLE: It means absolutely nothing, to be honest with you. It's another round, another series. It really doesn't matter what their home record is. We're aware of it. It really doesn't matter. We don't really care about that.
