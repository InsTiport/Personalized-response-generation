Blackhawks  Â– 4
  Sharks - 2

 DAN BOYLE: Both teams' shots were down. They scored. We didn't. They had some surges. They scored, we didn't. 
 Not good enough. 

 Q. Now on the road, down a couple games? 
 DAN BOYLE: Everybody thinks we're done. Nothing would make me happier to come back and disappoint everybody because everybody thinks were done. 
 I'm certainly not going to quit. I know the guys around here aren't going to quit. Playing the way we have hasn't been bad, but, again, it's not good enough. 

 Q. Maybe the result isn't good enough? 
 DAN BOYLE: I'm repeating myself. We're working hard, but we're not working hard enough. 
 Yeah, I don't know. I got to watch film. Obviously as a man, we got to look in the mirror. Pretty sure that we can -- we'll all see the game needs to be elevated. This is a very good hockey team.
