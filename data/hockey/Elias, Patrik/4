  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Patrik Elias. 

Q.   First period has been so key for you guys.   Hasn't dictated who has won, but do you expect them to come out even more of a push in the first period?
PATRIK ELIAS:   Probably.   Obviously they're going to be home, so they're going to get their energy going right from the getâ€‘go. 
For us it's just a matter of playing our game.   Our pace, our energy, we'll be okay. 

Q.   The emotions of your team, it's been such a key throughout the playoffs.   How have you been able to keep them intact throughout?
PATRIK ELIAS:   I think we have a bigger picture in mind obviously.   We all get frustrated, no question about it.   Like I said, our main goal is to win a hockey games, to win a series.   That's what we focus on. 
Sometimes we have to take punches, take whatever they throw at you to be successful. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
