THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
   
 Q. Joonas, you had had a really good opportunity early in the overtime period that you couldn't get to go. What did you see on the goal?   
JOONAS DONSKOI: Yeah, I think I have had a lot of scoring chances through the whole Finals. This was good time to get it in.   
   
 Q. Joel, how aware were you with the clock with regard to the power play?   
JOEL WARD: I just had a transition rush, three‑on‑two. Just going to hold on to it for a split second. Just kind of saw a lane, just buried the head and just took a flapper. Fortunate to go in.   
   
 Q. Joonas, Logan Couture said when you first got here, he Googled you, he saw some of your shootout goals. When did you feel this year you finally made it on this team and felt pretty comfortable?  
JOONAS DONSKOI: Well, I decided to stay in Finland a little bit longer than maybe usual. Kind of waited the right moment to come over. I had couple of good years last seasons and year before that, two championships. I kind of got the experience what you have to do to be professional hockey player 24/7, what you have to do to success.   
I kind of felt like this is the time to come over. Now I can give my best to try in the NHL.   
   
 Q. What does it mean to you, Joonas, to score that kind of goal in this moment?   
JOONAS DONSKOI: Pretty good. I think this was best game from myself. Created tonight from whole team. We had lot of scoring chances.   
Just felt great for the team.   
   
 Q. Joel, can you share with us, what was the conversation like in the room between the third period and overtime?  
JOEL WARD: We've always felt good. Group is always upbeat. Pretty chilled and relaxed. Just come out hard, play our game. We had some chances in the game. We built some confidence off that. Just keep going, keep going. Just keep believing in the process was the main thing.   
   
 Q. The Sharks are such a good shot‑blocking team. Pittsburgh had a huge edge in that statistic tonight. How difficult was it getting shots through? What can you do differently?  
JOEL WARD: I guess you probably got to talk to defense about that one.   
You know, that's a good sign. If you're playing the offensive zone, they're blocking shots, you're getting opportunities. Keep firing away.   
I think more so on the back‑end guys, maybe shoot around them. It's definitely a positive sign knowing we're getting those chances, forcing them to make blocks.   
   
 Q. Joel, you're developing a reputation for scoring clutch goals. What did your goal mean in the context of the game?  
JOEL WARD: It's always a good feeling to help contribute for your squad. Obviously you're in the moment and you're just wanting to score and help your team win. Just knowing here we're at the Stanley Cup Finals, you just want to help, hopefully continue on this process, build on the next game, try to contribute again. Try not to dwell or think about it too much.   
You know, it was good to win. Just looking to duplicate that next game.   
   
 Q. Joonas, your goal was very similar to the one scored off of Murray in the second round, over his shoulder. Is that something you saw on film, maybe when the puck is off angle, to shoot high? Is that something you kind of picked up?  
JOONAS DONSKOI: Yeah, I think we should shoot more. We're passing up good opportunities too much. We should get the puck to the net more. That's something we can do better.   
   
 Q. Joonas, you scored the biggest goal in the history of this franchise 20 minutes ago. Can you even think about that right now or do you have to just move on?  
JOONAS DONSKOI: Yeah, just got the first win in the Stanley Cup Finals. I don't think about that too much. Now we get going. We can still get better.   
Yeah, just bring at least same effort next game. Don't think of the results too much, just keep going.   
   
 Q. Joonas, did you ever score an overtime game‑winning goal in Finland in a playoff situation? What would have been your biggest goal before this one?  
JOONAS DONSKOI: I don't remember, to be honest. Last year I scored in Game 7, so maybe that. I don't remember.   
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
JOONAS DONSKOI: No (laughter).   
JOEL WARD: He scored against L.A., though. I think it was a winner. That was a big one.   
   
 Q. Joel, where does that penchant for scoring such big goals come from you? Where does that come from, that ability to deliver in the clutch come from?   
JOEL WARD: I don't know. I just visualize. I've watched other sports. I've watched other guys and always tried to emulate, listen to their quotes. I got one from Paul Pierce. I watched him in the playoffs the last couple seasons. People always knocked him down a little bit in the regular season, but in the playoffs he always stepped up.  
Just athletes like that that step up at different times, I try to pick up little things. I just visualize, think going out there and having fun. It's just fun. It's just fun (laughter). Just enjoying the moment. I think the atmosphere of the games and the crowds all that really speaks for itself.   
   
 Q. Why did you sign with San Jose last year when there were other teams after you?   
JOONAS DONSKOI: They were first team to show the interest in me, so that was big thing. Yeah, we think about it with my agent. I think Sharks is great organization, doing great work, lot of great guys, good leadership guys like Pav, Jumbo, Marleau, Wardo coming in.   
I thought might have room for a young guy like me, so that would be a great balance. But, yeah, great organization. I'm so happy that I picked Sharks.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
