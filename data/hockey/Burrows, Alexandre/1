  Q. Do you feel on some levels you're going in there as a very disliked team? Does that help this team?   
 ALEX BURROWS: Obviously, we probably are. But we really don't think about that too much. We're going to focus in the locker room to get ready for the game, ready to put the best foot forward on the ice.   
  
  Q. Talk about the embellishment situation, how difficult it is for you to get calls.   
 ALEX BURROWS: It doesn't matter. My focus is on the game. That's all.   
  
  Q. Can you afford to get caught up in some of the scrums? How important is it you stay away from that stuff?  
 ALEX BURROWS: It's huge. We're a team that likes to play whistle to whistle. We've said that before. We've been doing that all year.   
  
  Q. Is it hard not to take the bait sometimes, given the way they play?  
 ALEX BURROWS: No, not at this time of year. You have to focus on winning one game.
