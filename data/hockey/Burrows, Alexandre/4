   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Alexandre Burrows.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Obviously I think it's great for Winnipeg. A Canadian market. When I played there, six, seven years ago, passionate fans for the game. We used to have really good crowds there. I'm sure the fans are going to support the new NHL team. Obviously, the organization there is very strong for an NHL team with Mr. Chipman. Great for the organization. Going to do a tremendous job with the NHL team.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Obviously, my first few games were at the old Winnipeg Arena just before they shut it down. I remember the last game there against San Antonio. It was a white-out really. I remember the fans chanting, We want the Jets. I think that was my first week. Obviously, it was great. The fans were great. Obviously, once we moved to the MTS Centre, having 15,000 fans in the crowd for Game 1, it was a lot of fun.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Obviously, I thought the fans were unbelievable there. They were really passionate. They knew what it was all about to support an AHL team, and I'm sure an NHL team will have no support getting fans. Especially with that organization, like I said, starting with Mr. Chipman, they'll be in good shape.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: For sure. It was a nice arena. I remember it seated 15,000. I know it's smaller. Obviously, I would rather play in a rink that holds 15,000 and feels like there's 20,000 than being in a building like Atlanta where there's 20,000 seats, but there's barely 5,000 fans.   
 I think is a great move for the league and I'm looking forward to playing there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Obviously it took me a few months, I would say, when I first started to know them. Now it's pretty easy. Danny has a thinner face. Hank is bigger face, bigger forehead. Now I know them by the way they speak.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Not much, I think. Obviously maybe Henrik likes to crack maybe more jokes, will speak up a little bit more than Daniel. Not a whole lot. I think it's been like that all their life for them. Henrik has always been the captain, the one that spoke a little bit more. That's probably the difference.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Yeah, I'll do my fair share of homework. Normally when we play against goalies, I know most goalies in this league, the way they play, the way they like to approach a shooter.   
 With a guy like Thomas, you have to have a good match of getting shots through, try to beat him, at the same time look back door.   
 Can't always go back door on him because sometimes the defense is going to be there. You have to match and choose your spots at the right time, when you have to shoot pucks, hope for a rebound, or go back door and try to get a tap-in goal.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ALEXANDRE BURROWS: Yes and no. Obviously, there's good goaltenders that are big, going to take a lot of space in the net, that are more butterfly, come out of their crease or play in the blue. But his style, if there's a corner, you got to take a chance at it, try to go for it. At the same time he's such a good goalie, he's going to make some saves. Sometimes you have to give him some credit.
