  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Drew Doughty.   
   
 Q.   Drew, you finished off the Blues when you had a chance.   What's the difference in terms of focus in trying to finish it off?  
DREW DOUGHTY:   We're trying to focus the same way we did in those other games.   We need to come out there as if we're down a couple games in the series.   We know that they're going to play their best game.   We need our best game, too.   It's going to be the toughest one for us.   They're going to come out hard in the first five minutes, try to push us away.   We have to make sure it's our best game in the series.  
   
 Q.   What's it like trying not to think ahead?   
DREW DOUGHTY:   It's tough not to think ahead.   But at the same time, it's easy because, you know, all you're thinking about is that next game.   We know we still got a lot of work to do.   We're not even close to being there yet.   Going to the next game, we're so excited to hopefully finish it off in front of our home fans.   
   
 Q.   Drew, how much of your success is playing in the third period?   
DREW DOUGHTY:   It's been huge.   There's times we're up 2â€‘1, we got that third goal with 10 minutes left to kind of push the other team out.   At the same time instead of sitting back and just holding on to the lead, we're still pushing forward, still making those plays to get the puck in deep, get in hard on the forecheck.   That's why we're holding on to those leads.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
