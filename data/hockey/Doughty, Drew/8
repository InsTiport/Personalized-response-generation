THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jeff Carter and Drew Doughty. 

Q.   Jeff, what did you see on the game winner?   What were your thoughts immediately afterwards? 
JEFF CARTER:   Well, it was a great play by the D.   I think it was Marty to get it up quick.   Just tried to turn and get it to the net.   I tried to hit Penns' back door.   It kind of popped out to me. 
I had someone's stick in the lane there.   Just tried to get out of the way, get it on net. 

Q.   Jeff, you had some big ones in Philly.   Where would this one rank?
JEFF CARTER:   I think this is by far the biggest.   I think it's my first playoff overtime goal.   It's a huge one.   It's a big one for the team.   Gets us a two‑game lead here.   Gets us where we wanted to be coming in here.

Q.   Drew, when you were growing up, were there any particular highlights, goals, anything that you saw that really resonated with you that you remembered throughout your growing up?
DREW DOUGHTY:   That I scored? 

Q.   That anyone scored. 
DREW DOUGHTY:   No.   I actually remember Niedermayer when he played in New Jersey having a couple enders.   He was an unbelievable player here, everywhere he played.   I always wanted to emulate after him.   He always scored some highlight goals that I'll remember. 

Q.   Jeff, are you looking for the blocker on that one or just shooting to put it on the net? 
JEFF CARTER:   Just looking for anything really (laughter). 
Playoff hockey, you put it on the net as much as you can.   It's usually a cheesy goal.   But Penns did a great job of getting right in front of Marty there.   To be honest, I don't even know if he saw around Penns, or if he saw the shot. 

Q.   Drew, obviously it's a race to four.   Having said that, how important is it to stay levelheaded, not get carried away here?
DREW DOUGHTY:   I think we have to reset, refocus.   We have to go back to L.A. as if the series is just starting.   We have home‑ice advantage.   Have to take the first two at home. 
We're happy that we got the first two.   But going home on the plane tonight.   We're trying to forget about those games.   We're obviously going to learn what we did right and wrong.   But going back home, it's a whole new series.

Q.   Drew, can you talk about what happened on your goal. 
DREW DOUGHTY:   I just saw some ice in front of me.   Decided to skate with the puck.   I don't know who the D man was, but I tried to use him as a screen.   Marty has that quick glove.   I didn't even know it went in actually, but luckily, it did.

Q.   Dustin Penner said after the last round that the Kings are going to need a bigger bandwagon after winning the Western Conference Final.   How big is it going to have to be now?
JEFF CARTER:   I think it's grown by every game.   It's great to see.   It's fun for us.   Hopefully we can keep it going. 

Q.   Jeff, in the context of the last 12 months, the trade.   A moment like tonight make up for a lot of that aggravation?
JEFF CARTER:   Yeah, it's a pretty special moment, I think.   Obviously, anytime you get a chance to play in the finals, it's exciting.   But scoring an overtime goal Game2, put you up 2‑0, it's pretty special. 

Q.   Were there any lessons you learned from the Philadelphia series that you carry over to this series?
JEFF CARTER:   Being in Philly, we played against Marty a lot.   Played against the Devils.   I think for myself and Mike, we know a lot of their tendencies. 
I think they've kind of opened their game up a little more than what we usually were.   There's still some things you have to adjust to.   It definitely helps.

Q.   You are nice and humble.   It's almost as if you're underplaying the fact you scored two very artistic goals.   Do you regard them in that way? 
JEFF CARTER:   A goal is a goal to me no matter how it goes in, so... 
Dewey made a great play end‑to‑end.   Great shot.   Mine was lucky enough to find the back of the net with big Penns in front there. 

Q.   Drew, talk about the importance of making the Devils be in a deep hole. 
DREW DOUGHTY:   I don't think too much is going to change.   Obviously they might be on their heels a little bit.   I think going into L.A., they're going to come out hard.   They're playing desperate.   They know they have to win four out of five now.   They're going to be playing their best hockey. 
I think these first two games we haven't been at our best, so it's about time we pick up our socks and play our best hockey, too.

Q.   What about the atmosphere in L.A.? 
DREW DOUGHTY:   It's going to be nuts.   Every series, the rink is getting louder and louder.   People around the city have been enjoying the fan crew.   We can't wait to get in front of those home fans and hopefully get them a few wins.
