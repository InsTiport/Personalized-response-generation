Q.   (No microphone.)
DREW DOUGHTY:   Maybe your legs are tired after a game or something like that, but the next day is a new day.   Adrenaline kicks in.   Your heart doesn't get tired.   That's what we feed off of, is energy from that, just playing with the will to win. 

Q.   Team looking to cut down on chances against? 
DREW DOUGHTY:   We don't want that many chances against.   We're giving up way too many goals.   We don't give up goals like that. 
We're a team that plays very good defensive hockey.   When we're trading chances, like I said, against Chicago, we're not going to win that battle.   They have more goalâ€‘scorers and more talented I think offense as a whole.   We got to play our style of game in order to win.
