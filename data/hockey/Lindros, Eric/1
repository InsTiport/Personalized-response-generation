ERIC LINDROS:  It's always unfortunate when you have friends that are traded in the league, but we've acquired some with a lot of speed.  We've acquired someone who is a big, strong, powerful skater.  I look forward to it, look forward to playing with them.


Q.  (Inaudible)

ERIC LINDROS:  I don't know.  Maybe sometimes a change of scenery is what somebody needs.  Hopefully, there's lots more there.  See what you can accomplish.
