Q.  The change today, a lot of the writers interpreted that as a panic move.
 
ERIC LINDROS:  We have been doing it for the last three rounds.   We panic in each round?  I don't think we panic.  We are changing up goalies.  Big deal.  They are both very similar in style.  They are both competitive.  They both want to win.  But we can only start one. 
 

Q.  You had a very animated conversation with Terry Murray today, skated around.  Murray mentioned the conversation.  He said I sought some input from Eric.  What did you talk about? What was the input you got from him, what you gave him?
 
ERIC LINDROS:  Well, I think that is between Terry and I.  We were just talking about few changes that we might possibly make.  I was offering my opinion on some things and he was, you know, he was listening to them. 
 

Q.  A lot of lineup changes for tomorrow?
 
ERIC LINDROS:  Uh-huh. 
 

Q.  What do you make of these?  It seems like you are going away from trying to beat them with the physical size, to maybe not skate with them which is what Terry emphasized before the series that he wouldn't try to do?
 
ERIC LINDROS:  He wants to roll -- he wants to roll lines, 35, 40 second shifts and maybe look at a more balanced attack.  I don't -- you would have to talk to -- I don't --
