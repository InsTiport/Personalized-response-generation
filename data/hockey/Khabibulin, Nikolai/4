Q.  You stopped Gretzky's line a few times. Is that the epitome of the All-Star Game for you?
 
NIKOLAI KHABIBULIN:   I think goalies -- I think the All-Star Game, I think goalies take it more seriously than the players in defense because you don't want to get embarrassed. Like, I mean, you're supposed to take it -- you're supposed to think well, if they score, it's okay. You don't want to get six goals scored against you. 
 

Q.  We predicted that you would have a shutout. You almost did. You just kept one goal -- are you pretty happy with your performance?
 
NIKOLAI KHABIBULIN:   I think I'm pretty happy. I could have had a shutout, but it's okay. I had fun.
