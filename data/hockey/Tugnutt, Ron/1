Q.  Tell me about the thrill of it?

RON TUGNUTT:   This is something else. I'm kind of in awe of the whole situation. To be such a late call, the best players in the world. To sit in the same room as Wayne Gretzky.


Q.  You got the call to replace Curtis Joseph, who pulled his groin, Thursday night. When did you find out?

RON TUGNUTT:   After I chartered home from Boston I found out that Curtis got hurt. Curtis, if you're watching the game you're on my Christmas list. I'll take care of you.


Q.  Congratulations.

RON TUGNUTT:  Thank you, I survived it.
