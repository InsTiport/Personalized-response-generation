Q.  You said something to me just a moment ago, Scotty.  What was it?
 
COACH BOWMAN: Well, it's my last game as a coach.  I have been thinking about it.  I made up my mind on the Olympic break.  We got lucky, I had a little bit of a rest.  But I am so happy to go out now. 
 
Q.  People are so happy, yet they will be disappointed and miss you.  What will you think of in terms of this night, and where it might fit?  Where might it fit in, all these great victories, Scotty?
 
COACH BOWMAN: I have many people to thank, but the first person I have to thank is my wife, who stood beside me for the last 30-plus  years.  And I'd like to say a special thanks to Stan Paul because 46-some-odd years ago he gave me my first job in the National Hockey League in Ottawa, so thank you very much Sam.
