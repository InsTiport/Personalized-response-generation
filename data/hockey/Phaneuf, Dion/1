Q. Still maintaining a pretty good confidence level going into Game 5?
DION PHANEUF: Well, we're at where we're at, 2-2.  The way you look at the series is we expected it to be a tough, long series, as we've expected the other series that we played in.
Would we have liked to have had a better outcome last night?  For sure.  We're at where we're at.  Now we get on a plane, go down to Pittsburgh, have a better game there.  That's where our focus is at.
Q. Is the animosity growing a little bit as the games go along?
DION PHANEUF: I think you can see it's definitely growing.  It didn't take long in this series to seem to have the emotion level a little bit higher than our previous two series.
I didn't watch a ton of theirs.  I feel that the animosity level is getting a little bit higher, the competition.  It just comes down to competing.  You're playing the same guys over and over.  Every series, you're going to ask guys, they're probably going to give you a similar answer.  It just comes down to playing the same competition over and over.
It's a competitive game, an emotional game.  You can see there's physicality on both sides.  We're in a good series.
Q. When you get in that competitive mode, is that challenge against Crosby even tougher?
DION PHANEUF: Well, I think their skilled guys are very competitive guys.  They work hard.  They're hard on the puck.  They're bigger guys that are skilled.
Sid, he's a competitive guy that's got skill.  He likes to control the puck.  If you go to take the puck from him, he's going to want to keep the puck.
He's a competitive guy.  You saw it last night.  He played well.  We've got to continue to play their skilled guys hard, take their time, take their space, but compete against them.
Q. Anybody in particular you really dislike now (laughter)?
DION PHANEUF: I should get going, but...
