THE MODERATOR: We have Roman and Leon on the podium. Questions, please.   
   
 Q. For either Roman or Leon, Mrazek, you guys were able to get a lot of shots on him overall. Seems to have some good saves. There were some plays where maybe he wanted to have back. What was it like going up against him? What was he doing well? Roman, I know that he had that pretty crazy save on you.   
ROMAN JOSI: Yeah, he was playing really well. I thought especially in the second period we had a lot of shots, put a lot of pressure on them, had a couple good chances. Yeah, I thought he played well. Obviously made a great save on me there. Kind of had an open net, and he catched it with the glove.   
   
 Q. Leon, you scored a lot of goals in your young career so far, but international competition for Team Europe against the Czech Republic, where does this rank for you?  
LEON DRAISAITL: It's obviously pretty special. You know, at such a big hockey stage, it's always fun to score and help the team win.   
Again, I think we played a really strong team game again tonight. We just have to make sure we keep that going.   
   
 Q. Leon, can you just tell us what was going through your mind from the redline in when you had that chance?  
LEON DRAISAITL: I think a shootout or breakaway is always 50/50 kind of. You know, I just decided to take a shot and hope it goes in. You know, I got fortunate and it went in.   
   
 Q. Roman, talk a little bit about now, what the Czechs brought to you was a little bit more of a battle going into overtime. What do you think made you stand out and be able to come back and win the game?  
ROMAN JOSI: Well, I think we played a pretty good team game the whole 60 minutes. The Czechs, they're a good team. Like I said, I thought we played really well, especially in the second period, had a lot of chances, and got the lead, too.   
Yeah, they played well. They played well on their power play. Got a power play goal, too. But we just stayed with it, stayed calm, and obviously a nice goal for Leon.   
   
 Q. Just talk about Ralph a little bit. Looked like a drastically different game plan. Four‑on‑three, a reverse power play. Seems like he's adding different wrinkles and adding you more rather than having regular systems that would be employed against all teams.   
LEON DRAISAITL: Yeah, I think he brings that to the table obviously. You know, he has a lot of experience in international hockey. You know, there's a lot of things you can learn from international hockey. Even in Europe, you know, some teams might have different systems that might work in North America, as well.   
He kind of brings that creativity to the room. You know, obviously I think in the room we have the players that can put that out on the ice.   
   
 Q. Three days into this World Cup, what do you think Team Europe has done?   
ROMAN JOSI: Well, we won two games. But I think we really, really came together as a group. When we started at training camp, we knew it was going to be a challenge, having so many guys from different countries that never played together.   
Yeah, obviously didn't have our best games the first two. But then after that, I mean, after that first period, I think when we were down 5‑0 against North America, we really came together. We played the system well. We had a really good third pretournament game. We just carried that into the tournament. I thought we had two really good games so far.   
LEON DRAISAITL: Yeah, I think he said everything right. I don't really have anything to add, other than, like he said, you know, we really got together within the room. By now everyone kind of knows their role. That's really important in a team. I think, again, we just clicked as a team.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
