THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Adam. 

Q.   Adam, was there a defensive breakdown from your perspective on your goal?   What happened there? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   I think Clarky turned it over right away.   You saw it when he had it in the blueline.   I was hoping he was going to see me.   Made a great play across the ice.   Got off my skate pretty good.   Anyway, just had to get it to the net quick. 

Q.   You finally get a goal on Quick, they get it back really quick on the penalty.   Talk about the feeling after they scored. 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   It was nice to get the lead there.   It felt nice to have it.   It was short‑lived.   I didn't see the call.   It is what it is.   We stayed confident.   We knew it was coming down to the last five, ten minutes.   It felt whoever was going to get the next one was going to win the game. 
We just had to stick to our game plan and it paid off tonight.

Q.   How difficult was it to control that puck, the pass from Clarkson, given the quality of the ice that late in the game?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   It seemed to come off my skate pretty nice, right on the tape.   I knew it came all the across the ice.   I knew he was going to have to come a long way to make the save if I was going to get up short‑sided. 

Q.   Some guys go their whole careers not scoring a playoff goal.   You've got three.   What has this experience been like for a first‑year guy?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   It's fun.   This is where every kid dreams of playing one day.   We know it's going to be a tough ask to come back.   We'll take it one game at a time.   Marty played great, kept us in it.   The guys battled hard. 
There's no quit in the group in here.   We know we can do it.   We know we can put four together and come back. 

Q.   You do face still a tough task.   Only one team has been able to do this.   Do you feel this team has the ability to make history?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   For sure.   There's no questions.   There's no better time than now to do it.   Seems we waited to get that first one under our belts.   It was a hard‑fought game.   It was close from start to finish.   Coming down to the wire, it seemed whoever was going to get the next one with five or ten minutes to go was going to grab the win. 
We have to take it one game at a time.   That's the bottom line. 

Q.   How do you explain your penchant for scoring such big goals?   You scored the semifinal winner in overtime in the Memorial Cup.   How do you explain your ability to be able to deliver in those clutch situations?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   You know, everybody wants to be out there in those situations.   You want to be counted on by your teammates, your coaches.   It's nice that they have that trust in me to put me out there in those certain times of the game. 
I just play.   I'm not thinking about what's going to happen if I score, if I don't score.   I'm just a kid playing hockey, having some fun. 

Q.   Talk about the first goal you scored tonight.   It was a rebound, dirty goal.   Is there something different from Quick you saw tonight? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   Well, he played another great game.   Our D have been making those plays all playoff long.   A big reason we had success and why we're here. 
Sal came through again.   Showed some patience.   Came off his pad.   Patty was in the right spot.   It was a huge goal for us at the time. 

Q.   Was there a point where you stopped feeling like a rookie or do you still? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   No, I think it passed a while ago.   We're just a team in there.   We've been battling hard all year.   It's been a fun year.   It's not over yet.   The guys still got some fight in there.   We're looking forward to heading home for Game5. 

Q.   Adam, seemed like Marty played at a higher level tonight than the first three games.   Did you notice anything different about his net‑minding?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   No.   I think he's played great the whole series, the whole playoffs.   He's a huge reason why we're here.   He took us to overtime the first two games, gave us a chance to win those ones.   He kept us in it from start to finish.   He made some great plays, some great saves.   It's what we've come to expect from him.   He's a huge reason why we're here. 

Q.   Have you heard from Bogey or Warren or anybody throughout the playoffs, and in what way?
ADAM HENRIQUE:   A couple text messages.   It's always nice to hear from those guys.   Obviously they played in the league.   Warren has been here before and won.   You know, those guys are a big reason of why I'm here.   I can't thank those guys enough.   It's always nice to hear from those guys. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Adam.
