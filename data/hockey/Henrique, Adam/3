  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Ryan Carter and Adam Henrique. 

Q.   Adam, are 0‑3 holes impossible? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   No.   Good thing they got to win four.   Obviously, it's going to be tough, but we just got to take it one game at a time, try to get the first win under our belts tonight. 

Q.   Have you been in a 0‑3 situation before? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   I've been in one before in juniors.   I guess here is a little bigger stage.   But it's not impossible.   We know we can do it.   We know we have the group to do it. 

Q.   Adam, how do you make Jonathan Quick uncomfortable? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   I think we just got to keep getting pucks to the net, keep getting traffic in front of him, make it tough for him to see the puck.   Try to find a way to get an ugly one, find those rebounds, however it may be. 
We got to find a little extra push to get those first ones. 

Q.   Adam, he's played well, you haven't played as well in terms of scoring.   Is it a combination of that?   Is he getting too much credit?   Does some of it fall on you as a team? 
ADAM HENRIQUE:   I guess it's a combination.   Obviously, he's played well.   But we feel like we've played well, too.   We just got to execute our chances when we get them.   They don't come too often, so got to try to take advantage of it when we get one.
