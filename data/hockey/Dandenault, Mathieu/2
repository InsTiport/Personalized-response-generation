Q.  What's your take on "Stick-Gate"?

MATHIEU DANDENAULT: It would have been a five-on-three for them and you're playing for the Stanley Cup.  So everything goes, and, you know, you would rather make that call and win it.  But, you know, Dom knew right away, and he was ready, and he looks at his sticks pretty good.  So we felt pretty good about it as soon as they called it.  And Dom was shaking his head right away so we felt really good.

Q.  But does the fact that he asked for a stick for his son for Christmas, and that he was holding this out make it a little harder to swallow?

MATHIEU DANDENAULT: Well, that's, you know  -- you ask that question to Bob Hartley.  I mean, if it was  -- you know, maybe it doesn't matter.  Come playoff time, it was great.  Dom had his sticks ready and everybody did.  I mean, it's kind of a bogus call.  But what can you do?  We got the 4-on-4 out of it and we played well after that.
