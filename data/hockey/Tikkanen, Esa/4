Q.  You are going to see that open net for a while?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  Yeah, I had open net like 3, 4 seconds and I just -- next time I have to make sure that is in. 
 

Q.  Are you going to see this in your sleep tonight?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  No.  You know, I start to think about the Saturday game and bounce back and win the game Saturday. We are okay.  Lots of games left and get some confidence and we are looking forward. 
 

Q.  Can you remember a personal negative experience before?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  No, I don't think this is negative. This is just, you know, that is part of the game.  Too bad it happened today, but hopefully I can bounce back in Saturday and do better. 
 

Q.  As one of the guys that was brought in to stabilize this team and lead this team, what do you do now to try to make sure it goes a little differently when you get back down to Washington in Game 3?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  Next time I have open net, I put in that puck, I have to. 
 

Q.  With the other guys, anything?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  We don't have to change anything. Pucks never bounced my way, but hopefully Saturday turns around and they will bounce our way.
