Q.  A little fun at your expense today?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  Yes.  You know, quite a lot of jokes going around and it's fun, keeping guys loose and a couple of guys missed, so I can laugh.  That's part of the game right now.  Keep guys loose and have fun. 
 

Q.  Looks like you made it the first time, though?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  I made it.  It was great.  And, you know, that happens.  A couple of guys missed a wide open net -- without the goalie (laughter) -- so it's good.  Sometimes you have to practice those and we never practice.  But, just joke around and try it get it loose.  That's good. 
 

Q.  Do you sense this team is desperate?
 
ESA TIKKANEN:  No, I don't think so.  With everybody -- you know, if we lose the game, we're out. And I think guys are relaxed and that's a good sign right now.  Bottom line is, we have to win one game at a time and, you know, if that's going, the 7th game is going to be in Detroit.  We are looking right now one game at a time.
