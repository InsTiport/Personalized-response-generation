ESA TIKKANEN:  We never point anybody with the  fingers.  We think about it and it was 20 guys losing today.  But I have to give credit to every player today.  We believe it when we go into the first period and we tried to win the game, but it never happened today and I have to give every credit to Detroit.  They have a great team and they're Stanley Cup champs again and I think we learned something today.  Bottom line, I have to be proud of every player today and hopefully we'll continue next year.   
 It's different.  But, you know, like I say, I'm proud of this team.  Nobody believed we could go to the finals and everybody said, This team is dead ready, but we proved it and you're looking in the first three games -- first three games, they won the one-goal and today they won 4-1, but we never give up and we believe in ourselves and I have to be proud of every player in the dressing room today. 
 
Every time you're disappointed when you're losing.  Nobody likes to be unhappy.  But this team has never been in the Stanley Cup Finals; never win nothing.  This is the first time we won anything and we have to be proud of everybody.
