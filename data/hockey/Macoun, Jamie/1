Q.  Back with Jamie Macoun with the Wings, who's two-thirds of the way home: Thoughts on your progress after 40 minutes, Jamie.
 
JAMIE MACOUN:   We know this was going to be a tough game, and the first period we had some success after the first five minutes and really controlled the last three quarters of the period.  And, you know, we had some good bounces in the second.  Unfortunately a little off on my stick, but Larry Murphy came back on the powerplay and did a great play for me.  Right now, we're in control.  The key for us isn't to lay back too much or we're going to run into trouble. 
 

Q.  It's been a decade since that Stanley Cup for you in Calgary.  What's this experience been like for you as you get near it again?
 
JAMIE MACOUN:   Makes me appreciate how tough it is to win the Cup.  You know, you see some guys -- -- like Tikkanen on the other side who's won it five times or so -- and in '89 I thought I was on a team that was going to be around a while, a team like Detroit that has a lot of chances at the Cup: Unfortunately, things moved on.  It's been a great experience.  You start from the disappointment of getting traded to kind of a rebirth here, and I'm  really happy to be here.
