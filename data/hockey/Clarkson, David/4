  THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Dave Clarkson. 

Q.  (Question regarding adjustments.) 
DAVE CLARKSON:  Obviously you want to come out harder every day, every game that goes on.  We're going to come out and play our hockey.  We're not worried about what they do or anyone else.  We're going to come out and play the way we played all playoffs.  Let whatever happens happens. 
We're going to come out and play hard. 

Q.  First period has been key for you guys.  You have dominated the first period in every game.  Is that the goal again?
DAVE CLARKSON:  I think you always want to come out strong.  We've got to come right away, right when the puck drops. 
Going into that building, it's a tough building to go into, some of the guys they have.  We have to come out right from the drop of the puck and get ready to go. 
THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
