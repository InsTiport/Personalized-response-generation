  Q.  Can you just talk about what your expectations were and did you think you would end up with the Islanders, or where did you think you were going to end up?   
 KYLE OKPOSO:  I really didn't know.  I knew somewhere in the Top-10, and you know, I didn't really know what team was going to pick me.  No team really gave me any indication.  I wasn't really expecting much.   
  
  Q.  Ted, can you talk about why you decided he was the guy you guys wanted?   
 COACH TED NOLAN:  We didn't have a chance to scout Kyle, obviously.  You rely on your staff to report a lot of information.  And what we talked about the last couple of days was we needed size and skill and a learn element Kyle brings, a certain skill and talent, but a certain edge that all of the top players seem to play with.   
 So we're looking forward to watching Kyle develop the next couple of years and being an Islander.   
  
  Q.  Did you interview with the Islanders and how did that go?   
 KYLE OKPOSO:  Yeah, I did, I interviewed with them at the Combine.  I thought it went pretty well.  I thought most of my interviews went pretty well and this one went well, too.   
  
  Q.  You didn't have any feeling coming out of that that they might be more interested?   
 KYLE OKPOSO: I took a psych exam after the Combine actually before the draft and I thought I did well on that.  My advisor told me so.   
  
  Q.  I know you kind of debated what you were going to do last year, whether you were going to stay in Minnesota and play high school or play in the, how much did that year help you?   
 KYLE OKPOSO:  You know, it helped me a lot.  It was a big decision for me and my family.  I was already in Shattuck going to boarding school about to move a few more hours away from home.  It was a big decision for me.  I felt it was time to move on, time to play at that next level.
