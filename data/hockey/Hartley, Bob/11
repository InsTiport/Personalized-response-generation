Q.  Coach, in the locker room, Joe was just asked if he felt like this one got away.  And his answer was, We didn't deserve to win this one.  What happened on the shots and goals there?
 
COACH HARTLEY: I think it's pretty clear that we had no business to be in it.  It's pretty clear.  He gave us every chance possible in the book to go home with a victory that we didn't deserve, but the Red Wings outplayed us and outworked us, plain and simple. 
 
Q.  Did you feel like your team was tired tonight?  It looked like they ran out of gas.
 
COACH HARTLEY: Like, this is the worst excuse in the book.  We're traveling first class.  We were in Denver at 12:30 two days ago.  We have optional practices since the start of the playoffs.  I don't even want to hear until the rest of the playoffs the word fatigue.  This is for losers.  We didn't skate tonight.  We had scored the first goal and got a four minute power play where we could have gone back to the locker room with a 2-0 lead.  We did nothing with the power play.  They wanted the game, and for a reason, unfortunately, I can't explain to you guys.  We were not there tonight. 
 
Q.  Bob, you played with the lead a lot in this series, but you haven't had a two-goal lead yet.  How much did that factor in the results of the three games?
 
COACH HARTLEY: I just addressed it.  We had a golden opportunity to make them pay on Holmstrom's four minutes, but, that's where I feel that we missed like a great chance to go up two goals, and then like the second period, we spend the entire 20 minutes in our zone.  It's tough to score a goal from our own zone.
