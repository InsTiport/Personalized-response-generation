Q.  Bob, you've had trouble in the third period in these playoffs at certain times.  Is there anything you can pinpoint for that?
 
COACH HARTLEY: Well, like the other games don't count.  Our focus is on today's game and it's very simple.  Their execution was much better than ours in the third period like that first goal got the crowd going, got the Wings going, and I felt that the first two periods we skated very well.  We were very sharp and that quick goal kind of gave them lots of energy and they took advantage of it. 
 
Q.  Coach, do you feel like this game kind of got away because it seems like you carried the game for the first two periods?
 
COACH HARTLEY: The quick goal, like I just said, after this they were much better than us.  That's the kind of team that they have, and one quick goal, and basically, like, that cost us the game.  Have a good day everyone.
