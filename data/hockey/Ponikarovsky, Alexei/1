  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Alexei upon. 

Q.   How would you characterize the mood in the locker room right now?
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   I don't know.   We're looking at tomorrow's game, just a mustâ€‘win game, then we'll go from there. 
So far it's been pretty close games.   We're down in the series.   But I think everybody, they're staying positive.   We're going to give whatever we have tomorrow. 

Q.   Is that what it is for the Kings, lucky breaks? 
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   You know what, sometimes you wish you would have some breaks coming your way.   But sometimes you're trying hard to score the goals, it's just not going in there. 
You just have to continue to do what we were doing before. 

Q.   How do you generate offense? 
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   I think last game we played pretty well offensively.   We kept in the zone for long periods of time.   We just have to get more pucks in the net and get the rebounds. 

Q.   Are you making Quick look better than he is? 
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   You know, they blocking some shots.   We trying to get those shots through.   There is also something in the way always.   It's one of those things, you just have to continue to do it and eventually you're going to get a break and the puck's going to go in. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   He plays pretty well.   He covers the bottom of the net pretty well.   I think we have to be in his face a little bit more and get those shots through, get rebounds up high. 

Q.   Is he the best goalie you've faced in the playoffs so far?
ALEXEI PONIKAROVSKY:   We played in the series against the Rangers.   Lundqvist was playing pretty well, as well.   We got shut out twice in that series.   But we never got down on ourselves.   We just keep doing whatever we were doing before.   We got a few breaks and we won the series.
