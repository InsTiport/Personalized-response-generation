  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Would you describe this team as opportunistic?   Not many shots, but always seem to be hanging around. 
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Yes, certainly.   I think within the last game that we played, we told ourselves we couldn't get down, we couldn't get frustrated because we weren't leading 3‑0, we weren't leading 2‑0.   It was a close game right to the end. 
I think that's kind of what they've been doing.   They've been able to hang around in games and get goals from big players.   They have the capability of doing that. 
We need to keep pushing ahead, pushing forward, not get frustrated because we can't get a puck in the net.

Q.   Can that test a team's patience? 
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Yeah, I mean, certainly.   But they kind of play that way.   I guess they've been out‑shot most of the games they've played in.   That's the style they play.   They're going to give you stuff from the outside.   We need to try and attack the middle, try to penetrate the defense a little bit, get to Smith a little bit. 

Q.   Power play, can't seem to generate a goal.   Does that surprise you a little bit? 
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   I think so.   I think you should obviously try to be in every game, try to be a plus on the special teams against the other team.   Our penalty kill obviously has been pretty good.   I thought our power play gave us some decent chances, decent looks.   We hit a post.   Hopefully when we get that going, we'll get a lot better.
