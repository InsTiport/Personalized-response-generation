 Q.   Mr. Game 7 is Mr. Game1 tonight.   Take us through that goal.   
    JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Everything usually offensively starts in our zone.   Richards made a great play getting the puck out.   We screwed up a three‑on‑two royally.   Fortunately for us, one of their D men was following, I was sitting in front of the net with the puck, I was able to make a shot.   
   
 Q.   Justin, how much did you think about the deficit you overcame in Game 7?   
    JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Well, it certainly helps that we've done it time and time again.   
    I mean, it's a great result of the hockey game for us, definitely.   But we have a lot of things to clean up.   Certainly not our best game by any standards, especially ours.   
    But we were able to get it done.   That's the most important thing.   
   
 Q.   How do you explain the sluggish start tonight?  
    DREW DOUGHTY:   Yeah, that's not the way we want to start games.   Kind of got us off on the wrong foot, too.   Showed a lot of character to come back.   We're happy about that.   
    We're not happy about the start, but we're happy we showed the confidence to come back and win the game still.   
   
 Q.   Drew, what is the difference in your game between the regular season and post‑season that allows you to generate more offense?   Does Darryl take the reins off you?  
    DREW DOUGHTY:   No, Darryl lets me play no matter what the circumstances are.   Just lets me go out there and do my thing.   
    I try to do the same things in the regular season.   I try to jump in the offense, put points up.   Sometimes it just doesn't go that way.   
    Happy it is right now, I guess.   
   
 Q.   Drew, talk about the guy beside you, how uncanny it is he scores these types of goals over and over again.   
    DREW DOUGHTY:   I've said this many times.   Justin is the most underrated player on our team by a mile.   He doesn't get enough credit for what he does.   
    There's two guys on this team that I want to give the puck to, and that's him and Kopy.   When they have the puck, plays happen.   
    As a defenseman, you love to watch it.   That gives you opportunities to jump in offensively, too.   At the same time he works very, very hard at both ends of the ice, shows a lot of leadership.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the start.   Too many mistakes in your own zone and still pulled it out.   What does it say about a team that can continue to do this?  
    JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   I mean, we certainly don't want to make a habit out of this.   That is a world class team up there with world class offense.   There could have been a lot of storylines tonight.   They had a breakaway in the end of the third period that Quicky made a great save on, we wouldn't be sitting here right now.   
    A lot of things going awry during the game.   We certainly have to clean that up.   We certainly weren't ready for the speed of their wingers, I don't think.   
   
 Q.   Justin, what was the impact of Kyle Clifford's goal?  
    JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Huge.   Cliffy played a terrific game for us.   We get out of that period still down two goals, it certainly could have gone either way.   
    That's playoffs.   There's little things here or there, second efforts that result in goals that we're able to come back from deficits.   Making that 2‑1 gives us a little bit of a step towards getting it all the way back.   
   
 Q.   Drew, you alluded to your rough start.   Do you find you play better maybe a little angry?   Describe what you saw on your goal, as well.   
    DREW DOUGHTY:   Yeah, I think I do.   When I get angry, I kind of turn it on.   I try to throw my emotions in the right way.   Sometimes I don't.   
    Yeah, it's a bad turnover.   I wasn't happy with myself.   I didn't want to try to do too much to make up for it.   I had to be a better player than I was on that play.   
    He made a great pass to me on my goal.   Lot of room in front of me.   Luckily we squeezed one by Lundqvist.   
   
 Q.   I saw you were upset about that miss.   Also they didn't call embellishment.   They called one on you.   I don't want to get you in any trouble with the league.   What did you think of that, your own ability to control those emotions?  
    DREW DOUGHTY:   Yeah, I didn't really control my emotions too well at that point (smiling).   
    But, yeah, it's just part of the game.   Stuff happens by accident.   It was just heat of the moment.   In the Stanley Cup Playoffs, stuff like that's going to go down.   
   
 Q.   You and Justin, both sounds like you don't feel like the Kings played one of their better games, yet you get a game out of this Game1.   How important is that?  
    DREW DOUGHTY:   Well, we won.   I guess that's the best thing about it.   We have to definitely look over some of the things we did.   We didn't do a lot of things right.   Gave up opportunities.   Made Quicky make big saves.   
    We know they're a fast team, get breakaways easily.   We still allowed them to do that.   Our complete game plan was to not give them those opportunities.   
    Yeah, we got a lot to clean up.   But happy with the win.   Happy the guys never gave up and won the game in the end.   
   
 Q.   They talked about heavy legs.   
    DREW DOUGHTY:   I don't think it had anything to do with it.   I think everyone was prepared.   Everyone's legs were there.   Even though we played all those games, we're in the Stanley Cup Final.   You put that in the back of your head.   You don't pay attention to that, to your legs just being not there.   
    We have to look at ourselves personally in the mirror, be prepared for the next game.   You can only control what you yourself can do.   I think a lot of us would like to take that back.   
   
 Q.   What was said in the second intermission or what changes were made in regards to stifling their offensive attack in the third period?  
    JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   I think as the game progressed, we gradually got better.   
    Again, far too many odd‑man opportunities.   Quicky didn't have many saves in the third period, but he had some grade A ones.   
    Nothing needs to be said between periods.   You're in the Stanley Cup Finals.   You're going to get up for anything, have a lot of emotions.   We're able to channel them and put them out in a positive manner and ultimately get a win.
