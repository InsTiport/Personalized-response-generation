  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Justin Williams.   
   
 Q.   Justin, reflecting a few hours now past Game4, put last night's game into words as you saw it.   
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Elimination games, I don't know, the teams you play against are there for a reason.   It's not supposed to be a sweep all the time.   You're not supposed to win every game.   
That's when their character comes out, when their backs are against the wall.   They played a great game, battled hard.   We just didn't quite have enough.   
   
 Q.   If you look at the positives from the Kings' perspective last night on the ice, what are the things that come to mind that you liked?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   Well, what I liked is our power play moved around pretty good.   We had ample opportunities to score and get ourselves a lead.   We weren't able to do it.   The power play's going well.   
On the other side of it, I don't think we were as good as we could be in the neutral zone, defending the rush.   We're going to get better at those.   
   
 Q.   Finally, familiarity with the Prudential Center, a couple games under your belt there.   Does that help compared to the last time you got on the plane?  
JUSTIN WILLIAMS:   I don't think so.   I think we just play every road game the way we have throughout the season here, throughout the playoffs.   We just don't let any distractions bother us.   We go in, we play our game.   
We know the Prudential Center's going to be rocking, just like when we had to go back to Phoenix and play Game5, go back to Vancouver and play Game5.   The arena's are going to be rocking and we'll have to be ready for them.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
