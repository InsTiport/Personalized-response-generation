 Q. Justin, you were slotted a little bit higher than what they picked at. Any theories
on why you were picked at that spot?
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I mean, I knew I could be slotted higher, whatever. I'm just happy to
be in Philadelphia with the good organization. And I'm not disappointed at all to be
going, you know, in the later of the first round. So, you know, I'm just ecstatic right
now. 
 
Q. What do you think you can bring to the Flyers? Do you have any knowledge of what
they might need and so forth?
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: Well, you know, the Flyers are a very good team. You know, what I
bring to the team, I bring scoring to the team and, you know, leadership, and, you know,
good play-making, good offense. I'm a good two-way player. So I'm looking forward to this
summer. 
 
Q. What's your plan? Are you going to be back in Plymouth this year? What's your
outlook?
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I mean, I have one more year of junior eligibility left; but, you
know, my future's in the Flyers' hands right now, and I'm happy for that. And, you know,
I'll do whatever it takes to make it to the NHL. 
 
Q. How many interviews did you have with the Flyers? They said that there were several
people that they had multiple interviews.
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I think I only had one interview with Philadelphia. 
 
Q. What did they say to you? When they interviewed you, what did they say that they
felt you could bring to them?
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: Well, you know, they watched me throughout the year, and they knew I
was a good offensive player and I kept carrying my own end, too. They said they like the
way you play and we want you to score goals for our team. 
 
Q. Did they say you had to add about five inches or 50 pounds?
 
 JUSTIN WILLIAMS: I don't know about 50 pounds. Five, ten pounds, something around those
lines. That would be nice, yeah.
