Blackhawks  Â– 4
  Sharks - 2

 Q. What went wrong, in your opinion? 
 JOE THORNTON: Well, I didn't think we gave them too much, to be honest with you. I thought we played good defensive hockey. I don't know how many chances they got. 
 We were just not capitalizing on our chances. They are with theirs. We aren't with ours. 
 When you get to this point, everybody is going to have a good goaltender. I don't think we underestimated him. He's playing good. I don't think we're getting enough second chances we need to be getting. We have to improve on that a lot. 

 Q. Is it a challenge you like? 
 JOE THORNTON: Sometimes I'm against Johnny, sometimes I'm against Sharp. I'm not always against him. It's a battle all night. 
 I think we out-shot them again tonight? Did we? I don't know. We did. So we just have to capitalize when we get our chance, that's all.
