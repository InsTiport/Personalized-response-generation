  Q. What is your experience in this building, the way it is, even during the regular season?   
 JOE THORNTON: Good. I love playing in this building. It's pretty electric. 20,000 fans going crazy, it's a good building to play in. We've had some success here in the past. We're looking forward to that tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Dan Boyle, his approach, attitude.   
 JOE THORNTON: He's just easy. You know, yeah, just always relaxed. Doesn't seem to panic.   
  
  Q. Good influence on the room?   
 JOE THORNTON: Yeah, no. All the guys love being around him. Very contagious. He's just a light-spirited guy that all the guys like to be around.   
  
  Q. Whatever frustration or emotion you showed on the ice at the end of Game 2, and apparently in the locker room a little bit, is it a healthy thing getting the frustrations out at the moment?   
 JOE THORNTON: Yeah, you know, we know we can be better. We saw some this morning to show we can be better. You go through your ups and downs. But it was a good week. We addressed everything. We're ready for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Having a couple extra days to think about the game, looking at the video, are there areas you can be better?   
 JOE THORNTON: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about that?   
 JOE THORNTON: No (laughter). You'll see tomorrow night.
