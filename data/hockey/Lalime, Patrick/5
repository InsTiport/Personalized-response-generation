Q.  Do you guys need to play with a little more emotion in Game  4?

PATRICK LALIME:   Yeah, I think so.  No doubt that it's a desperate situation now.  We've got to come out and play our best game in the series, and whatever it takes, that's the way we've got to approach it.  I think everybody can give a little more and we'll need it. 

Q.  Did you think you would be in the Eastern Conference Finals and somebody would say you've got to come up with more passion ?

PATRICK LALIME:   There's so many factors.  You can get frustrated instead of getting pumped up and try to do the job and everything.  That's what we've got to do. It's not that we are not working hard.  Sometimes you have to work a little smarter to make plays happen. 

Q.  Is that something you guys talked about, just stepping up at this time of the year? 

PATRICK LALIME:   Well, of course, there's no better time to do it than now.  We are in a good thing so far and we want to keep it going and.

Q.  Do you feel a little down, not getting the offensive support?

PATRICK LALIME:   I wouldn't say that.  It's a team game and you're not going to win all the games.  You know, there's 25 guys.  We all want to win.  I'm sure everybody is doing their job, probably we'll get a little smarter about it.
