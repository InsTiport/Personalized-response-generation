Q. Going into New Jersey, is it the momentum with this team or is it a just a lot more confidence?
 
PATRICK LALIME:  I think it's going to be the same as we had last night.  I mean, you know, we had a great effort from the 25 guys.  Going in there, we know it's not going to be easy.  They have a good team.  They play well at home.  We're just going to play even a better game. 
 
Q.  Talk about special teams, will it come down to that again?
 
PATRICK LALIME:  Well, it was a big factor, you know, the last two games.  Of course in the playoffs, when you get a chance, it's a chance to get on board or prevent one, so it's a good play again.  
 
Q.  Did it matter to you last night allowing the one goal, like everybody questioned you the last game before that?
 
PATRICK LALIME:  Well, I mean, of course, you don't like when that stuff happens.  You know, but we're not perfect.  I'm human like everybody else.  It happens.  But it's the way you bounce back, I think.  I think we had a great effort last night.  That was part of it. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible) from your angle?
 
PATRICK LALIME:  I thought he stepped in pretty well.  You know, for being out for a while, just getting with the guys, he just came in and I think made a difference.
