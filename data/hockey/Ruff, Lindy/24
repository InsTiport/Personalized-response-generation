 Q.  I guess you can't say anything about your players.  You must be proud of your team, I think that they gave everything they had. 
 COACH LINDY RUFF:  You can hold your head up and feel good about the way you played, the way you battled, the way you faced adversity.  Those guys in the room are a special group that never used an excuse all year long.  Even tonight, gave it everything they absolutely had. 
 It's a special group in there. 
 Q.  When had you the lead what were you thinking when you took the lead at the end of the second period with a late goal? 
 COACH LINDY RUFF:  We just talked about playing our game.  It was unfortunate a little bit.  We had some moments in our end, they made a nice play.  It was a good goal, a good pass and a good goal.  I think it was Weight who scored the goal to tie it up.  It was a tough break on the puck to go over the glass. 
 But I also said the game probably will be decided by special teams, and at the end of the day, they got the job done. 
 Q.  Have you ever been around a team that had as much adversity in a playoff series? 
 COACH LINDY RUFF:  No, I don't think you can compare what we went through to -- even to win a couple of series and among the players that we lost, we had one defenseman on the ice that was with us tonight two years ago, that was actually playing for us. 
 I thought our defense did a pretty good job tonight overall.
