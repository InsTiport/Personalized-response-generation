  Q.  Can you give us your thoughts?   
 MIKE FISHER: It's disappointing, obviously.  No one likes to lose, but at the same time, we did get a lot accomplished this year.  And overall, we did a good job at the playoffs.  And we all battled really hard.  We played a really good team.  They played really well.  We're disappointed, but that's going to make (indiscernible) in this situation.   
  
  Q.  I guess you have to learn how to lose before you can win sometimes at this level like the Ducks have done?   
 MIKE FISHER: Yes.  They have been in the final a couple times, they played really well.  It's hard to win anything.  That's why it's so special.  And it's not fun going away without it.  But we're going to hang our heads high.  We battled all year; beat some great teams.   
 Obviously, thanks to all our fans that supported us along the way, it was a lot of fun.  No one likes to lose.   
  
  Q.  (Question off microphone)?   
 MIKE FISHER: They played really well.  They played better than us.  You gotta give them credit.  They played well.  They're a great team.   
  
  Q.  (Question off microphone)?   
 MIKE FISHER: It just seemed like it was meant for them to win it.  They just got the breaks tonight.  What do you do.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about the ride and the fans in Ottawa?   
 MIKE FISHER: The fans are awesome.  They supported us all year long, win or lose.  We had a great year.  Fans were unbelievable and we, obviously, owe a lot to them and appreciate all their support.  It's been fun for us and hopefully everyone enjoyed it, and we do all we can to win.
