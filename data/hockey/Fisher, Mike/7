 Q.  Does it feel good? 
 MIKE FISHER:  Yeah, we're excited to get home.  Our fans at the airport, obviously loyal supporters, and we're excited to get going at home and trying to turn the ship around. 

 Q.  Nobody comes back from 3-0.  You obviously know the importance of this game.  But what does that really mean coming back here, a bit of a comfort level? 
 MIKE FISHER:  Yeah, for sure.  We've played well here all playoffs and the fans are going to be rocking, and I think that's going to give us a boost.  And it's something that we definitely need. 
 And it was tough in their building.  They played hard and they played well in their own building and we just want to do the same. 

 Q.  (No microphone)? 
 MIKE FISHER:  Everyone has to create more and just continue to answer we would have done it.  We're going to try to do all we can.  There's not a whole lot of goals being scored either. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible) Buffalo series (indiscernible) was it something that can be corrected or something that you guys have seen or with the puck? 
 MIKE FISHER:  It's playoff hockey.  It's tough.  You gotta battle for your chances and opportunities and it's a whole team effort.  We all gotta make sure we're doing our jobs and not trying to do someone else's and if we all do that consistently, you know, we're a good enough team, we can pull some wins together here at home. 

 Q.  The indicator (indiscernible)? 
 MIKE FISHER:  No.  I mean, we may practice different lines tomorrow.  I don't know what's going to happen.  But it's obviously a possibility.
