Q.  Can you just talk a little bit about the excitement of today and you finally being picked, what went through your mind?

IGOR KNYAZEV: I am very excited.  I am very happy to be chosen by the Hurricanes and my dream has come true.


Q.  Is it in your plans to try and make the team next year or are you going to take a couple of years before you decide to come over to North America?

IGOR KNYAZEV: I believe I am not respected yet.  And I am going to take maybe one year to play with Russian team until I improve my knowledge.
