 Q. Jason, explain the intensity. Seems like the teams get into it real quick?
 
 JASON ARNOTT: It is exciting out there. Both teams are excited to play. On the first
goal we just did a little cycle. We kind of know where each other is. It just went from
Patty to Sykora over to me. Fortunately we got on the board, but they came back. Now it is
a 1-1, so it is zero-zero. The intensity is incredible out there. 
 
Q. Are your surprised how quick it got to that level?
 
 JASON ARNOTT: It is incredible. You certainly get tired out there shift to shift. The
fans are into it and everybody is into it so it is exciting to play.
