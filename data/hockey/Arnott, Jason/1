Q.  Status of whether you will be available or not in Game 6.

JASON ARNOTT: Won't know until game day.


Q.  Feel any better, any different?

JASON ARNOTT: Feel the same. 


Q.  Are you disappointed you feel the same?

JASON ARNOTT: After the play it's probably normal that I feel this way. 


Q.  Have you talked to the trainer about it or is it still --

JASON ARNOTT: No, I won't talk to him until probably game day. 


Q.  Actually you have a chance to win.   You'd like to be obviously on the ice when this Cup can be won.  Does that bear any significance on whether you are going to play or not?

JASON ARNOTT: Well, obviously I want to be there as much as everybody, but I have to consider my health first.  And that will be determined on game day whether I feel good or not good enough to play.


Q.  Will you skate tomorrow?

JASON ARNOTT: I am going to try, yes.


Q.  What is the frequency of you feeling nauseous?

JASON ARNOTT: I just don't feel good.  That's about it.  That's all I am going to say. 


Q.  Is it tough in your condition to sit in a loud arena?

JASON ARNOTT: Yeah, the hardest thing to do is to watch.  I am more nervous watching a game than you are for sure playing, so it was difficult to watch.


Q.  What about the noise though if you are getting headaches?

JASON ARNOTT: I was in the dressing room watching it so... 


Q.  Do you feel like your condition was making progress over the last 24 hours?

JASON ARNOTT: It is about the same right now, but that's to be expected.
