Q. What about the discipline of the players on the ice?  
 
JASON ARNOTT:  It was brought up and brought to everyone's attention.  It's tough because, you know, your emotions are going and things happen.  We've got to control that.  This is the times we can't take stupid penalties.  It's only a matter of time before they capitalize on it it.  
 
Q.  Do you feel fortunate you're the top line?  Your guys haven't got going yet.  You got scoring from other people last night and that's great. 
 
JASON ARNOTT:  That's what we need.  We're not going to win with just our line scoring or one line scoring, one guy scoring.  We need contributions from everybody and last night T and Corky chipped in great for us.  It's a big boost for us, lift for us.
