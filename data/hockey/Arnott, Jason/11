 Q. Quick start for you, then you finished strong. Were you pleased overall with the
first period?
 
 JASON ARNOTT: Yeah, I think so. I think we got to keep shooting the puck. I don't think
we got enough shots out there. We are a little nervous, but we are going strong. 
 
Q. I know you got popped there in Game 4. Was there ever any thought that you would not
play in this one?
 
 JASON ARNOTT: Never a thought. Would be in here no matter what. It's an exciting time.
We just have to keep going in the second. 
 
Q. Will you come out very strong?
 
 JASON ARNOTT: We got to keep going; got to keep coming after them strong and doing the
right things that Larry has been telling us. If we would do that, hopefully it will go our
way.
