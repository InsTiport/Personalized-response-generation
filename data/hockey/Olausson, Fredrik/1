Q.  Fred, I wonder what this wait is like, the time between the victory that you just recorded and the biggest game of this series arguably.
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Well, it's not that much about waiting, really.  I would say it goes pretty fast.  You play every second day.  You know, you're just trying to recuperate from the last game and get energized for the next one.  But the last game you played you think about it that night, and then you start to prepare for the next game. 
 
Q.  When?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Today. 
 
Q.  Today?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Yeah. 
 
Q.  So, you don't look at the clock every five minutes.  Is it time to go to the rink yet?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: No, no, no. 
 
Q.  Or is it like being in bed when you want five more minutes of sleep before you have to get up?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Probably tomorrow you're looking at the clock a little bit, but not today.  Most of us have families as well so we've got our day full with practice and spend all day with family, have dinner and that.
