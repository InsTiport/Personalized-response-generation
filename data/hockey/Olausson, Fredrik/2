Q.  Fredrik Olausson, can you tell me how long your thrill from your overtime goal lasted?  How long did it stay within you?  How long did you enjoy it?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Well, you kind of suck on one piece of sugar for one night.  That's a free translation from Swedish.  No, it goes over pretty fast.  You feel good about it, but you got to let go, and the games are coming so close together now that you can't really dwell on that. 
 
Q.  Compare the high after that game to the low I would speculate you're feeling after last night?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: There are two contrasts I guess.  Obviously you're in a different state of mind after the first game you talked about, but then again the playoffs you can't get too low or too high because that will get you into trouble. 
 
Q.  When you're approaching an elimination game, is it the time of most anxiety because you want it to start and you want to be able to do something about it, or is it the time of most peace because either you win or you go home, there is really no middle ground?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: Yeah, there is a sense of urgency, of course, but you can't let that affect your game in a negative way, having a little anxiety or being stressed out.  You've got to be focused.  I think we played a good series so far, and just more corrections that we need to make and just focussing.
