Q.  Fredrik, could you just described what happened on the game-winning goal?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: It was a fairly quick counter attack on our part.  I don't know if it was Dom or Nick that passed it on to Stevie.  I kind of, coming off the bench as well, jumped into the play.  I shot, and I don't think Patrick saw it when I shot it and it might have surprised him a little bit. 
 
Q.  Did the Avalanche seem a little flat tonight?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: No.  You know, I thought we played a good hockey game tonight, and Colorado is a team that you can never relax against.  They have such skilled players that if you give them too many chances, there is a good chance the puck will end up in your own net. 
 
Q.  There is a long layoff now until the next game.  Was it important to keep a mental state to get to this game?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: I would rather be up one than down one, but I'm sure Colorado is going to come out Saturday and play a heck of a hockey game, so we're going to have our hands full. 
 
Q.  When you were back playing in Sweden and weren't thinking of coming back to the NHL, could you imagine having scored a big goal for Detroit?
 
FREDRIK OLAUSSON: I didn't think about it back then at all.  I was grateful to get the opportunity to come to Detroit and play, and here I am after scoring an overtime goal.  And I'm very fortunate.
