  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Penner.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)   
DUSTIN PENNER:   His intensity is an intensity I haven't encountered yet from a coaching standpoint.   It's game time.   The way he talks makes it's way to the rest of the team, the way he talks, the way he teaches it, during practice, during the game.   
   
 Q.   We talk about stats and the records you're approaching.   Are you aware of those numbers, think about them?   
DUSTIN PENNER:   The media tends to bring them up quite a bit, try to make a story of it.   That's just icing on the cake.   I'll just concentrate on the cake.   That's a quote from Brownie (laughter).   
   
 Q.   When you face desperate teams, why have you had so much success?  
DUSTIN PENNER:   I think we have an underlying amount of desperation in us even though we haven't been down in series or games.   We know how tricky it can be, how one team can grab it, and they won't give it back to you.   We know how important each shift, each period of each game is.   
   
 Q.   Must be easy to get overconfident, take things for granted.   Where does that come from that this team doesn't let it seep into your games?  
DUSTIN PENNER:   Yeah, it boils back down to leadership and coaching.   We have a good filter.   We're able to talk to the media, be candid.   When the lights come on at the Staples Center, or whatever rink, we're ready to roll.   We just get more intense, more focused.
