THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Penner. 

Q.   Talk about how big a goal this was for you tonight. 
DUSTIN PENNER:   It's the biggest goal of my career thus far.   Hopefully there's a couple more waiting in the finals. 
I was at the right place at the right time. 

Q.   You persevered this year, picked it up.   What has been the turning point for you?
DUSTIN PENNER:   I guess when you're in a hole that no one can really dig you out of except for yourself.   I put that pressure and that stress on myself to get me out of where I was.   I had great support from teammates, family, friends, the organization as a whole. 

Q.   The success you're having this post‑season, can you compare this at all to the success you had when you were with Anaheim and won the Cup?   Is it similar at all to that? 
DUSTIN PENNER:   Definitely there are some similarities.   I'm in a different place mentally because I think, you know, the rookies on our team this year could attest to it, six or seven years when they're in my position, it's different.   When you're in your first year, you know, everything's new.   You don't really comprehend the situation in front of you. 
Now I think I have a better general overview of, you know, what it's like, how hard it is to get to where we are now. 

Q.   Can you talk about the goal and your emotions right after it. 
DUSTIN PENNER:   Elation.   You know, it was after that questionable play in the neutral zone.   We had a draw just off center on blue lines.   Richards, or Ricky as we call him, second or third effort.   Went back to Slava, Slava threw a bouncer off the boards.   I watched it hop a couple times, ended up I think it was Yandle's stick.   I retrieved it.   Threw it to Carts coming down the right side.   He threw it on the net.   Bounced down a few more times.   I just followed the bouncing puck until it was in a good enough position for me to shoot it. 

Q.   You said earlier it was addition by subtraction that you guys are now going to take over the headlines in L.A.   Talk about what this means now.   You will have the headlines.   What does that mean to this team?
DUSTIN PENNER:   We'll probably have to get a bigger bandwagon. 
It's great for the city, great for hockey especially in Southern California.   I think we have a pretty rabid fan base.   I think you'll see more of that now. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Dustin.
