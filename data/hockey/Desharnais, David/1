Q.   In terms of improvement, is it defensively? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   Yeah, of course, but they did at the same time.   Yeah, we need to be better defensively, but I like our compete level, and that's what's important.

Q.   Is there anything you can predict in this series?   You've had two 7‑goal leads, one each way, and two overtime games where you guys dominated.   Is there anything you can point to and say that's probably going to happen in Game 6? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   One team's going to win.

Q.   That's it? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   That's it.

Q.   Has it been a strange series that way with the games being up‑and‑down? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   It's the playoffs.   You cannot know what's going to happen.   If you watch the other series it's the same thing.   L.A. scored a lot of goals on Chicago.   That is something we don't expect.   That is part of the playoffs.

Q.   What do you think of Dustin Tokarski's composure being thrust into such a high‑pressure situation? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   Yeah, he's impressive.   He's great.   Gives us a chance to win every night, and that's what we're asking for.

Q.   Getting Brandon Prust back in the lineup for Game 6, what's that do for this team? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   Well, you know, we have a lot of depth.   It's great to have him back.   Everybody has stepped up when somebody was injured or something like that.   But Prust gives us a lot of energy and there for the brawl and all that kind of stuff.   He knows New York well.   He's played there, so it's great to have him back.

Q.   You had the two days early in the series.   Is it a bit of an advantage being out? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   No, there is no momentum in the playoffs.   You go out there.   We play New York now in New York, so they're going to come out hard.   We want to win that game to win the series, so we've just got to be ready.

Q.   Happy to get back at it tomorrow night? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   Yeah, whatever the schedule is, I guess we need to be ready.   If it's two days in between, we take that break, but we go right back at it tomorrow.   So we need to be ready.

Q.   What do you think caused the Rangers to lose their composure in various stages of the game last night? 
DAVID DESHARNAIS:   I don't think so.   I mean, at the end of the game they were kind of running around, but just that's the message they want to tell us, I guess, is that it's not going to be easy to go in there and win a game.
