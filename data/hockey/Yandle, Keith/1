 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   Yeah, I think right now we're able to capitalize on it.   But even before we were getting chances, but now finding ways to score, which at this point in the season it's not easy to do.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   I think against a team like this we know everyone has to be a key part and a big part of our offense.   To get chances everyone has to be able to make them play.   I think for me it's just using my legs and trying to get up in the play as much as possible.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   Yeah, I think so.   I think in this series I've felt probably at my best and most comfortable, and I kind of feel like it's coming together.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   Yeah, a lot more comfortable.   It's just you know the way guys play and finding your role.   So it was something that you knew it was going to take some time, and I feel good right now.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   I don't think so.   I think if you look at the lineup of this team, for me it's just finding a way to gel in and be a part of the team.   That's on and off the ice the guys have treated me great.   So to put that pressure on myself, if you look at what this team did even before I got here it was a special team.   For me it's just coming in and playing well and trying to help out.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   It was the second period of two games ago.   Stepan hit in the corner.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
KEITH YANDLE:   Game 3.
