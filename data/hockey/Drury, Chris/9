Q.  You had three guys out of the lineup.  Is that too much to ask?
 
CHRIS DRURY: I don't think so.  It's the playoffs.  That's why there are 23/24 guys on the roster, and guys got to step in.  No one was complaining for them when Bryan Willsie made an unbelievable play to win Game 5.  It really shouldn't be a factor. 
 
Q.  The road isn't such a bad thing for you guys.  Can you point out why this is?
 
CHRIS DRURY: I don't know why.  Maybe we just get up for it a little more.  Being on the road, we see it as a bigger challenge and hopefully we can continue it. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
CHRIS DRURY: I thought 1-0, we were all right.  2-0 was a different game for them.  They could sit back a little more.  Give them credit.  They did a good job shutting it down.
