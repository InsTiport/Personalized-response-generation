It is difficult to say year-wise, but I would like to make it as soon as possible.

I am very happy.  I cannot believe that I have been drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins.  I was actually hoping for the Penguins.

It wasn't really a reality for me. You just really liked Pittsburgh.  It has got some Czech players and I really like the team Pittsburgh.

I have never played with him, but I have watched him play for many years.  And, there have been many books and many articles written on him and what he went through while playing here with Pittsburgh.

I like to play hard and I like to play defensive forward.  That is a tough question.  I have no idea right now, but I would like to play here in North America, whether that be juniors or making the team.

I like to quicken my start and I would also like to harden my shot a bit when I shoot against the net.  I'd like to harden it a bit and make it tougher.  And I'd like to get a little stronger as well.

Absolutely not.  I am actually surprised I went this early.  I wasn't expecting anything really.  It is better not to expect anything and just be pleasantly surprised.

I can't wait to begin it.  I could screw up a couple of times, but I can't wait to start.
