Q.  Can you talk about your brother being in the NHL?  How you feel now being drafted into the NHL?  Your brother is over here and now you get to join him.  What is that going to be like?
 
MIKKO KOIVU: I am happy because I've been waiting for it a while like that.  But it hasn't happened yet so it's hard to say how it feels that we are both here, my brother is now playing and I'm playing.  So it's hard to say right now. 
 

Q.  Mikko, can you just talk about how much your brother has told you about the NHL and do you feel prepared?
 
MIKKO KOIVU: Of course we talk a lot on his games and like that, but we like to talk about normal life and stuff like that, so I know he's with the NHL and I talked to him a lot.  We talk to him a lot and his games, like that.  
 

Q.  Are you familiar with Antti Laaksonen, who plays for the Wild?
 
MIKKO KOIVU: I don't know him, but I have seen his play and his championships in Germany this year, but I don't know him.
