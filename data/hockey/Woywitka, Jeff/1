Q.  Hi, Jeff.  I know the Flyers had you ranked pretty high and they talked to you a lot, were you surprised at all when they pick you?
 
JEFF WOYWITKA: No, I knew.  I had a feeling I was maybe going to go there if I was still around.  So just went to the Flyers.  I'm pretty happy right now.  So I'm pretty thrilled. 
 

Q.  Jeff, how soon do you think you can be ready to play?  They have a pretty strong desire of having the puck move the defensemen in their line up at some point quicker?
 
JEFF WOYWITKA: I'm going to work hard this summer, get myself into top shape and go there and leave a good first impression and hopefully stick with them from there, you know.  You always want to go there and do well and impress them.  So maybe this year I'll be ready to play. 
 

Q.  Is that reality for a defenseman to play in the NHL?  Is it a reality for you for a defenseman to play at that age?
 
JEFF WOYWITKA: You gotta be cautious what you do your first year.  You don't want to step in too early if you're not ready.  That's for sure.  You just want to make sure you're in game shape and you're ready to make that step because it's a big step and you just gotta work hard to get there.
