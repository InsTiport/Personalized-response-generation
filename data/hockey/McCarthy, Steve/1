 Q. How much, if any, contact have you had with the Hawks before today?
 
 STEVE McCARTHY: I guess it was close to a month ago I flew down to Chicago, met with
all their scouts and the whole management. I was there for about three days. Other than
that, that was about it. 
 
Q. Did you know much about the organization? Did you have any players that you
followed?
 
 STEVE McCARTHY: I love watching Chelios play. It's too bad he's not there. That's
somebody I looked up to, somebody I would want to play like.  
 
Q. Maybe kind of describe your strengths and things you might need to work on in your
game. 
 
 STEVE McCARTHY: Offensive defenseman. I love to jump in the rush. I love leading the
rush. I want to quarterback power-play. That's something I want to do. I think every
aspect of my game has to get better. My decision making has to get better. Skating
forwards, backwards. Everything needs to improve to make it to the next level.
