SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: They are playing well. They like playing in this arena. Their record
goes to show that. We are just trying to do our things out there; trying to play our best.
Hopefully we can do that in the third.

Q. You put a premium on skating. Is this the best surface for you?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: We can skate. Maybe we are not going to be as fast as we are on
better ice, but we can still do that. We can still skate and try and get pressure on them
deep in their zone and continue skating. We might not be an as fast but we can try.

Q. You like the way the team is performing overall?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: We are working hard. That is a good sign. We had a good run on the
road. We want to keep that going and there is no sense of letting up now.
