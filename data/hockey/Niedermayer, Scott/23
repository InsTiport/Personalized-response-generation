Q.  (Inaudible.)

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: We still have a great opportunity here, best of 3 with home ice.  We'll regroup, get things going again, and I feel good about it.

Q.  Is there much to change?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: Probably  -- yeah, it would be nice to have won one of those in overtime.  Unfortunately, we didn't.  It's an evened-up series and best of 3.  We still have a great opportunity here.

Q.  Scott, any chance or concern that Giguere is back to sort of being the Giguere before you guys came in?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: Yeah, he's going to play well.  He's a good goalie.  We're  -- it's our job to find a way to beat him.  We've done that, and we've got to get back to doing some of the things we did in the first two games.

Q.  Talk about the change in momentum.

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: Well, we just have to be focused on the next game, and being at our best.  Obviously, they did what they wanted to do coming back here.  We did what we wanted in the first two in Jersey.  So the best of 3 now.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: Same thing we have done all along.  We've got to be ready to go and be sharp mentally, and physically be ready with a lot of energy. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER: Come in here and had two chances in overtime.  I thought we played much better this afternoon than the third game, but we didn't get the goal that we needed.
