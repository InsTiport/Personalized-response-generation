Q.   (inaudible) 

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER:  Absolutely.  (inaudible) I thought maybe we would have came out the same.  We did in the second game Who knows, we could be up 2-0, we'll see.  We could complete right from the opening phase up to the end of the game.  So it's tough, tough to complete for the whole time, so we had to make some adjustments.  Once we did that, we felt we had a good lock of on what was going on.  


Q.   Is it a good thing or bad thing you have other guys stepping up, the guys you depend on normally haven't (inaudible)?  

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER:  I think it's a good thing, means we're going to get better.  As long as there are guys stepping up finding ways to play the game, taking goals, who don't normally score goals, it's great.  Everybody is there to contribute.  Might be a little tough for the guys who normally score goals, more checking series, wide-up series like we had against Pittsburgh.  We have to find ways to score goals, power play.  We have to pay the price to score goals.  


Q.   How important is it to get back to your game after the first game? 

SCOTT NIEDERMAYER:  I said it before, I just can't really describe what we were doing in the doing the first game, after we made changes, things started to come out where I am.  Believe it or not, the end of the second and third, I felt that we were starting to take momentum out of the game.  Carried into the first game.  The first game, might have played well early.  We took some dumb penalties.  We kept plugging away.  At no point did we think we were out of the game when they were up one nothing, no point did we think we were out of the series when they're up one nothing.
