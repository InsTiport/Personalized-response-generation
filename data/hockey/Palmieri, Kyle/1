 Q. Are you sticking around a while? 
 KYLE PALMIERI: Yeah, I mean, right now I'm playing in I know I'm graduating from there but as far as professional hockey comes, when I feel like it's time and I'm ready to play, I'll make that jump.

 Q. What made you go to Notre Dame?
 KYLE PALMIERI: It's just a great school. It's a great team. All of the guys there, I mean, they are great guys, great group of guys. I think going in there, I mean, you expect like the Notre Dame tradition and you really feel it as an athlete there. It's really an exciting thing to be a part of.
 Coach Jackson has been there the last couple of years and really moved the program in a forward direction, and I can just see him keep on doing that and hopefully we'll be successful this year.

 Q. What are you hoping to work on in your game?
 KYLE PALMIERI: Just become more of a complete player and getting better every day is just something I think everybody works towards and hopefully over the next few years, I'll develop myself on and off the ice and try to make the NHL. 

 Q. What does about your style of play that made the Ducks draft you? 
 KYLE PALMIERI: I think it's just like a hard-working guy who brings a lot of energy to his game and I think that's one of the main things that I bring to the table; and try to bring a consistent effort and I think that's just something really, teams look at and really appreciate that consistent effort and try hard to out-work my opponents on the ice.
