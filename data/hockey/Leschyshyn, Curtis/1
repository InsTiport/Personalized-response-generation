Q.   Was the hurdle overcome last night in any way?

CURTIS LESCHYSHYN:  I wouldn't say that.  We were fairly confident.  I don't think that anyone was  -- I don't think anyone didn't believe that we could win.  So, you know, that's a major concern at this time when you're facing what we're facing, that guys might have some doubt.  But that's not the case with us.  You know, we believe we have got to this spot in the playoffs for a reason.  If we can continue to play the way we played last night, we'll be successful.
