Q.  (Inaudible-- Commenting on the game.)

THEOREN FLEURY: There were great scoring opportunities and there was a -- it was a very well-played game. We got off to an early lead. They're a pretty young team. I think they were nervous, some of those guys. Once they got their feet wet, they started to play a lot better. We played a lot better too.


Q.  I'm going to ask you about your uncertain future right now. Is this a tough thing to deal with?

THEOREN FLEURY:   Not at all, I think maybe at the beginning of the season, you know, when the rumors started. But, you know, I just got to resign myself to the fact that this is the way it was going to be the whole year and I guess the one thing that, you know, all of us guys can control is how we play on the  ice. And so far, you know, it's been a fun year.


Q.  (Inaudible -- Commenting on the North American style of play.)

THEOREN FLEURY:   Not really. I think everybody can hear those comments. It's not true. It's not necessarily true. I thought our team moved a lot better than their team. You know, on the breakouts. We had more odd-man rushes than they did and the defense played great. They stood up, you know, they took away the blue line and they had turnovers for the forwards.


Q.  How would you feel about Canada versus the World format next year?  Do you think it would be kind of neat?

THEOREN FLEURY:   Get a little bit pride back hockey-wise anyways. But we'll see. Hopefully we can go back to the Olympics in a couple years here, and, you know, reestablish what we lost.
