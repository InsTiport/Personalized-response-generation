THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Laviolette.
Q. Peter, who is your starting goaltender tonight?
PETER LAVIOLETTE: Next question.
Q. I'm not going to ask you about lineup changes, but is there any temptation as a coach, when you are down in a series, despite how well you have played, to tinker with the lineup at all?
PETER LAVIOLETTE: Next question.
Q. Is there one keynote message to the team tonight knowing you're back where you've had such great success?
PETER LAVIOLETTE: You have to keep it simple.  Just make sure that we focus on today, not worry about a big picture.  We got to win a game.  We're back in our building with our fans.
I said yesterday, I still stand by that, there's things we can do better on the ice.  We've done some good things, but we're behind in the series, so that can't be good enough.  There's some things we can do better.  We'll look to do that today.
We have gone over those things yesterday.  Keeping it simple today, focusing on what's been working for us.  Like I said, I think getting back in here, the energy is going to be really good in the building tonight.  We've been good here.  A lot of confidence.
Q. Just generally about Pekka, in your time here in Nashville, what have you noticed about him with regard to his ability to take on whatever adversity comes his way, bounce back?
PETER LAVIOLETTE: I mean, he's been the backbone of our team for three years.  Longer than that.  I've been here for three years, so that's all I can really speak to.  Whenever there's any adversity, Pekka has always faced it.
Had a terrific regular season.  Got us to this point through the regular season, comes into the playoffs, has had a terrific run.  There's a lot of confidence, not only with our team, but also with Pekka.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
PETER LAVIOLETTE: Thank you, guys.
