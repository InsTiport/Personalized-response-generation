 Q. You've been really good about when you have playing near perfect road games. Will it be the same tonight? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: We don't talk about lineups and injuries and those sorts of things, but it was a good road game. I'll agree with that. 

 Q. Let's try a different way. 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Okay. 

 Q. Is there any reason for you to look to change anything tonight that you're displeased with? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I think you can always be better. There are things that you can do better. Defensively we're tight. I thought our attack could still be a little bit better. But I was pleased with the performance the other night in Game 4. 

 Q. I don't know how much you've seen from Montreal in the games in which they've faced elimination, but what has impressed you? Obviously, they've been in that situation five times, and each time that they've bounced right back and they've won it. 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: They're a team that I really feel like we're going to have to play hard tonight. We're really going to have to compete. Our compete level may have to be the best in this game tonight that it's been all Series. We're going to have to make sure that we're willing to battle them for pucks and space and positioning, as hard as they're going to battle to keep their chances alive. I really feel like that's a key point tonight. 

 Q. What has impressed you most about your team during this run? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I feel like we're a resilient group ourselves. Our back has been up against the wall once or twice. We continually push back, so, I guess resiliency. Thank you.
