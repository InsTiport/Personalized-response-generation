 Q. You get a power play in overtime and then the other team scores a shorthanded goal, is that a little bit being like in the twilight zone? 
 COACH PETER LAVIOLETTE:  Certainly not what we were hoping for when you get a power play.  The power play had been so effective all night and it's an opportunity to win a hockey game and it didn't happen. 

 Q.  Can you just talk about the mood of your guys right now? 
 COACH PETER LAVIOLETTE:  I mean, I am sure they are pretty upset.  Everybody is upset obviously, but you know, we'll wake up tomorrow, go back to work.  I don't expect anybody in there is in a terrific mood, so. 
 It's one game.  We'll get up tomorrow, go back to work.  Go back to Edmonton.. 

 Q.  Talk about how things settled in after that wild first period, turned into quite a defensive game. 
 COACH PETER LAVIOLETTE:  Yeah, the first period, I mean, wasn't really typical of the series the way it had gone.  They scored 16 seconds in, we came back to tie it up.  Scored late.  After that it settled more into a defensive game. 
 It was just a tough goal to end the period I think, then we battled back in the second, got it even and couldn't find the next one. 

 Q.  You had a couple of guys go down and then come back, pretty courageous efforts on their part.  As the series goes along both teams were trying to get pretty banged up? 
 COACH PETER LAVIOLETTE:  It's extra month and a half to two months of hockey and it's at the highest level, so guys are getting banged around and but you are right, shows a lot of guts to come back.
