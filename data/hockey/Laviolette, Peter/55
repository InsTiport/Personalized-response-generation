 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach? 

 Q. Peter, all Playoffs long you've been sheltering your five and six defensemen, for the most part. What happened on that one face-off in your end that resulted in a goal? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: You know, we had an opportunity to get it out, it seemed. We mishandled the breakout pass at one side, and it ended up staying in. They made a play to the high slot. They got it at the net. It looked to me we tried to clear that rebound, and I don't know if it bounced over our stick. It seemed like we had coverage and positioning. We just didn't tie it. We didn't get that puck up there -- out of there, and we didn't tie it pup.

 Q. Why didn't you change your D when you had a chance? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: First we have to trust in all of our defensemen out there. We look to keep them away from certain people when we can. But there's -- like I said, our coverage was there. We had man on man. 

 Q. Danny Briere said he thought first two periods you guys played way too conservative and admitted it was probably the result of what happened in Game 1. Did you feel that way and why do you think it fell into that? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I'm not sure what he meant from the a result of Game 1. 

 Q. Not enough fore-checking. It may have been a result of Game 1. Not enough fore-checking, not enough skating. 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: The first period I thought they came out strong. I thought they held the edge in physical play in the first -- in the first period. It seemed like the second period started to even out. Scoring chances evened out. Shots were I think a little bit in our favor. 
 Their first period was stronger. You're right. We like to come out stronger than that. We sat back a little bit too much. I think their game influenced it a little bit. 

 Q. Coach, I know there are many moments in a hockey game. Was there a turning point in your view, a point where maybe the game hinged? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I'm not sure I understand the question. Turning point how? 

 Q. Just whether it was a moment of -- a momentum switch, something like that, the go-ahead goal, second goal late in the period on the short side. Any moment when you felt the momentum changing in the third when you had so many chances at the end? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I don't know if the momentum changed when they scored the second goal. It certainly was a big goal at the time. If anything, that should swing the momentum in their favor. 
 But I don't know, we seemed to dominate the third period. So I'm not sure I completely understand the question. I'm sorry. 

 Q. Peter, how did you feel about Danny Carcillo's game tonight? And was it your plan to move Carcillo and Gagne around, or was that an in-game kind of adjustment? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: We made that adjustment in-game. I thought Danny did a good job. He skated, he forechecked, he made some hits. I thought he brought some energy. 

 Q. Coach, they've beaten you two completely different ways now, each by a goal. Do you have to guard so frustration doesn't get in the way of preparation for Game 3? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: We need to -- I think we could have started a little bit better tonight. I'm not sure we should be frustrated. I don't think they -- we didn't get -- I don't think we got outplayed. I think when you're at the end of the night you're going to look at it again, probably outshot him, outchanced him a little bit and didn't get the results we were looking for. 
 I thought their goaltender played extremely well in the third period. We had more than enough looks to tie up that game and opportunities to get out of it. It didn't happen. We have to go home and take a look at some things and come back. We have to win our home game.

 Q. Peter, how much was the ice a factor, the puck really seemed to be bouncing a lot, especially the first two periods. 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I didn't notice it that much. I didn't hear them complaining that much. If it's bouncing, it's bouncing both ways.

 Q. Coach, it seemed that Oskars Bartulis had a pretty solid game. What's your evaluation of his performance tonight? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I thought he did a good job. In general, I think our team -- we could have handled the puck a little bit better this that first period. We need to make plays. 
 Again, their game influenced that, I think, at times. Their fore-check was strong. Their physical play was strong. But I thought Oskars came in and did a good job. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Thank you.
