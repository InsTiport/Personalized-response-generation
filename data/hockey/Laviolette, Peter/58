  Q. Coach, on that winning goal, several seconds before the score, it looked like the puck hit Kopecky when he was still sitting on the edge of the bench. Did you think it should have been whistled down at that point?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: If a puck hits player on the bench, it's supposed to be whistled down. Well, that's neither here nor there right now. They scored.   
  
  Q. Coach, I don't imagine anybody envisioned a 6-5 game in the opening game of the playoffs. What's your assessment of what happened?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Our assessment was we were a little bit just too loose in front of our net, and we left too many point blank opportunities, at times we had men there. They caught a nice bounce on the breakaway goal. And it was tough to handle it. It bounced over our stick and he caught some speed on it.   
 We've got to be a little bit better defensively than we were. It wasn't a lot of chances. It was probably a dozen chances for them. But some of them were point blank. We have to tighten it up right in front of our goal.   
  
  Q. Thoughts on Boucher's performance tonight?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I thought Bouch came in off the bench. He looked good in practice, and he did a good job.   
  
  Q. What are the positives you can take out of this?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: You know, you lose a game, the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals. It's hard to sit here and thumb through the positives right now. We'll take look at it tonight, and tomorrow and we'll be ready to go.   
  
  Q. Peter, some of your players said that the switch in the goalie, was that a reflection on the way Leighton was playing, but a wake-up call to the team? Can you go into that?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Everybody has got to be better. We win as team and we lose as a team. Tonight we lost as a team. We have to be better if we're going to win as a team.
