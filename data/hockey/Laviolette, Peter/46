Blackhawks  Â– 7
  Flyers - 4

 JAMEY HORAN: First question? 

 Q. Peter, Ville Leino said in there the problem in the first period, he said, wasn't that we weren't ready, we were over ready. We were just so nervous out there. How did you see it? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: It was clearly something. I guess if it was nerves, it was nerves. But we got outworked pretty good. We got out battled. They were quicker to loose pucks. Quicker on the forecheck. I thought we were okay.
 We survived probably the first six or seven minutes and they didn't score. I thought that was the worst of it. Then things settled down for quite some time. Then they capitalized on some opportunities. 

 Q. Peter, were you disappointed in not seeing a call there at the end on the high stick on Danny? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Yeah, I was. It's a penalty, possibly a major. 

 Q. Peter, pulling your goaltender, was it just to get the team going? An indictment on how Leighton played, or just to jump start the team? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: We weren't very good in the first period. 

 Q. Will you go with Leighton again for Game 6, or are you still working on that decision? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I wouldn't -- I don't have an answer for that. 

 Q. Can you talk about Chris Pronger's game. He was minus 5. Was that an indication of how he played? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Our team needs to be better, the whole group, I believe, needs to be better. When we're successful, we do it as team. When we lose and we have a night that's tougher, we do it as a team. The minus 5's, are they all his fault? No. 

 Q. Peter, as bad as tonight might have been for your team, how much does the resiliency you guys showed in the first three rounds in the playoffs help you in Game 6 since they've been in tough spots before? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: It's one thing I've learned along the way about the playoffs is, one game is only one game. There's usually not a carry-over effect from game to game. You know, this is just one page of the story. Tonight it was their page. A couple of days off here, go back to our building where we have had a lot of success. We'll look to win a hockey game and force 7. 

 Q. Peter, did you get away from anything on the PK that made it so effective earlier in the series? 
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Everything seemed just a little bit off tonight. They had a bit more jump than we did. They were moving the puck a little bit crisper. 
 Thank you.
