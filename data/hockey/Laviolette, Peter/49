 JAMEY HORAN: Coach Laviolette is on his way.   
  
  Q. Coach, on the Hartnell penalty in the third period, what was the clarification? What did the referee tell you with a misconduct, unsportsmanlike. What was the exact penalty?  
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: For banging our stick on the boards. Everybody was warned beforehand. They just made good on what they said they were going to do. Quick work tonight.   
  
  Q. Peter, you said that you expected Mike and Jeff -- you saw it coming, they were going to have a big game, breakout game. Do you kind of get, after this game, they did what you kind of thought they were going to do?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I thought they played a really good hockey game. You know, everybody wants to contribute. Like I said, Jeff had 12 attempts at the net. He's getting close to busting it open, I think. He's a skill player. I thought Mike played a great game tonight. He had 10 or 11 attempts at net. He was physical. He really skated hard. That line got going.   
  
  Q. Peter, what's been the big difference between the two games here in Philadelphia and the ones in Chicago?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: For us, I don't think anything. I said when we left there again it wasn't just -- I wasn't just talking. I thought we could have won both games. I like our game. I like what we're doing. In saying that, they probably thought they could have won Game 3. It's going back and forth quick both ways. Guys are really competing out there.   
 But nothing changed for us. Our game hasn't changed. Just the score changed.   
  
  Q. Tim is not here to ask the negative question --  
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Are you allowed two questions?   
  
  Q. I'm taking place of Tim for now. Did you think you guys got a little too complacent once you got the lead at 4-1, that kind of let Chicago back in?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Not really. I thought we were playing really well before that. We were playing defense. There wasn't a lot of going on. They got penalty. Then a 5 on 3 goal. That's when things buckled up.   
 The last one, I didn't look at good. I'm not sure what happened. I know they threw something at net. They had a lot of guys going at the net, and next thing you knew it was in the net. We settled down after that. They had one good quality chance after that. We settled down pretty good. Right before that I thought we were playing okay. I was fine with the way we were going at 4-1.   
  
  Q. Did you see anything in the regular season that would make you expect that Ville Leino would have a postseason like this or any signs at the time?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Ville has gotten his best opportunity here in the Playoffs. We lost Gagne, and we lost Carter for a bit. We needed others to step up. Danny Briere moved back to the middle. Ville Leino got an opportunity to come into the lineup, and he's been terrific. He makes plays. He scores big goals. He's having a lot of fun doing it. So this is the best opportunity that he's gotten, I think, maybe ever in his NHL career, with the Wings; and certainly with us in the regular season, the opportunity wasn't as great as it is right now. He's seizing the moment.   
  
  Q. Coach, it seems like they are taking a lot of penalties, retaliation penalties. It seems like you're getting under their skin. Have you noticed anymore tonight? What does it say about the players and coaching staff to draw those penalties?  
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: It doesn't say much about the coaching staff. The players, it shows discipline. The players are the ones getting whacked around. Not to retaliate, we certainly talk about it as a group. Where we're at in the season and how far we are down with the Playoffs, discipline I think plays a really big factor in hockey games.   
 Our guys we want to be physical. I think their game plan changed a little bit. They inserted Ladd. They inserted Boynton. They started being aggressive in the neutral zone. They started pinching down the wall. I think their system changed a little bit. I think there's opportunities there we can exploit if they're going to play that way. It caught us off guard a little bit that they were that aggressive. We'll be ready for that next time.   
  
  Q. Coach, you switched up Dan Carcillo and James Van Riemsdyk. Why did you make that change? What did you think of James' performance tonight?   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: I thought James played a good game. I'm trying to keep everybody in it here. We got pieces -- there's no -- I think James to get back in there and take a couple of games off, it was good for him. I'm sure Danny will be itching to get back in there as well.   
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you, coach.   
 COACH LAVIOLETTE: Thank you.
