 Q.   What did you say to the guys at intermission?   How unlikely was that ending given what just happened?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't know how unlikely it was.   I said, It's our turn.   Don't be upset and hang your heads.   Get angry.   Get just really mad that we sort of pissed it away a little bit.   Just come back and play the way you did in the first period.   Things will work out.   
They got lucky, so...   
   
 Q.   Did you feel at all that the game got to Freddie a little bit?   It was an uncharacteristic performance.   
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, you know what, he's played so many good games in a row, and he's bailed us out so often.   You know, he had an unfortunate couple of goals against him today.   
Freddie will be the first one to tell you he should have had them.   But it was time that we bailed him out.   He'll be back to his normal, regular, great self in two days.   
It was good to see if he had a bad game, we were able to help him out a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Coach, played a lot of hockey here in this series.   Do you think there's some fatigue showing that maybe accounts for some of the changes in the momentum during the game tonight?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't think it counts for the momentum changes.   I mean, if anything, it counts for some sloppy play.   That's what fatigue will do to you.   
When your body starts to get tired, your head goes a little bit.   That's what fatigue will do to you.   Both these teams are running on a lot of emotion right now.   It will be interesting next game.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, the Blackhawks seem like they're just a tough team to put away.   What are you going to have to do the next game?   What has made it so difficult?   
COACH BOUDREAU:   First of all, they're a great team.   You just don't go out there and say, Hey, we're going to win because we're good, too.   
Putting them away, you got to play your butt off for 60 minutes.   I mean, we played our butts off for the first 20, whereas I was a little worried, I thought we outplayed them so bad and it should have been four or five.   Then I kept thinking of the Nashville game, Game1, how they came back after a 3‑0 lead, kept telling the guys to keep their foot on the gas.   
Once they get that first one, I thought we resettled the ship a little bit, then they got the one at the end of the second.   That made our hearts pound a little bit harder for the rest of the third.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you got the ship settled also in the middle of the third?   
COACH BOUDREAU:   Before that we had a great checking shift where we didn't give them anything.   A lot of times the momentum swings go from shift to shift.   Then we came back and Sami makes a great play to Patty.   Next thing you know we got a 4‑2 lead.   
We were talking on the bench that you can't let up now because this team never quits.   They don't.   That's why they've won two Stanley Cups.   
   
 Q.   You've seen a hard forecheck from the Ducks.   Could you give us your thoughts on the club's success or lack of success, how they're doing penetrating the low slot?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, they're blocking out pretty well.   They might not be the biggest defense in the league, but they sure know how to play.   They know how to position.   They're really good in front of the net.   We're having a hard time getting there.   
   
 Q.   The decision to move Beleskey back up paid obviously off.   What made you decide to move him back up?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I had a thought that I can't really say why I did it.   But, you know, I moved Palmieri back to his regular line, too, at the beginning of the third.   It had nothing to do with whether Jiri or Tomas were playing good or bad.   It was more to settle everything down and get familiarity with everybody.   
   
 Q.   What would you say the most important factors are moving into Game 6?   What do you want your guys to keep in mind?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Are you reading a book while you're doing this (smiling)?   
   
 Q.   No.   
COACH BOUDREAU:   The most factors in Game 6 is get some rest.   I don't think there's any surprises that either team is going to throw at us.   Just go out there and play.   Hopefully everybody on both teams are on the top of their game, you have a great game, see who wins.   
   
 Q.   Coach, how many other ways can you come up with a different way to describe resiliency this season?   It continues to be another story all the time.   What does this do for the overall confidence that no matter what happens, you guys can find a way?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, I mean, again, I've said it a hundred times, it's the belief.   We keep talking about it.   The belief that it can happen.   I mean, both teams are tremendously resilient.   We score three goals, whatever, last game, and Chicago comes right back and ties it up, ends up winning it.   They score two goals in the last minute to tie it up.   We have the wherewithal to dig deep and come back in overtime.   
Both teams, it's just a battle between two good teams.   Whoever's left standing, we'll see what happens.   
   
 Q.   How happy are you with Tomas Fleischmann today?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   You know what, I thought he was okay.   I thought he was really good in the first period.   I mean, when he has the puck, you know he's going to make the right play because he's a very skilled and smart hockey player.   That's why I put him in there.   
Thank you.
