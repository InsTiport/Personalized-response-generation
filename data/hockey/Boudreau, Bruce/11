    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, three goals in 37 seconds there.   What was going through your mind during that?  
    COACH BOUDREAU:   Don't take your foot off the gas, keep going.   I mean, we've done that all year.   So, I mean, it's a never‑give‑up type of attitude.   
    Unfortunately we couldn't hold the lead.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, are we seeing two great teams just throwing haymakers at each other here?   Is something developing here even though you came out on the losing side tonight?  
    COACH BOUDREAU:   If you look at all four games, you know, they've been all tremendous hockey games.   One has to lose, one has to win.   Usually when one of the teams makes a mistake, a good team capitalizes on it.   That's what happened.   
    We had our chances again to win it, but it didn't happen.   So we'll just regroup.   Now it's a two‑out‑of‑three.   Let's go after it.   
   
 Q.   Some of the guys in the room said they still feel like they have some control over things here.   What is the best way you process?  
    COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't really understand that, sorry.   
   
 Q.   In the sense of another tough overtime loss like this, moving beyond that, heading home.   
    COACH BOUDREAU:   Yeah, I'm going to watch the game again.   But let's worry about next game.   
    It happened.   Let's put that one behind us now.   Sure, we're ticked off and everything else.   But we got a game in two days.   If you dwell on it, you're going to dwell on it to the fact you're down 3‑2.   
    You just got to get angry and go after it.   We know these are two good teams and the games are going to be close.   We just got to be the one that comes out on top.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, what did you see with the Beauchemin and the referee?  
    COACH BOUDREAU:   It was in position.   Beauch tried to turn.   He fell over the ref.   That leads to the shorthanded goal.   
    Thank you.
