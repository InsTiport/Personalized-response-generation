THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What were you thinking about in that dressing room about, It's on me to shut these guys down and win this thing?  
FREDERIK ANDERSEN:   I think every team is going to come down hard in the third, if they're down by one, which they did.   I think we did a good job of just battling with them, get it out, yeah, save as many icings as we wanted.   
Pretty disciplined when we get the one penalty.   We did a good job on the kill.   
   
 Q.   Frederik, if you could talk about taking the lead again in this series and bouncing back from it.   Tough loss the other night.   
FREDERIK ANDERSEN:   It's great to see how we responded as a group in that way, which is the best way to do it in the playoffs.   You got to get ready for the next game.   
   
 Q.   What did you see out of your penalty killers tonight?   What made you so effective there?  
FREDERIK ANDERSEN:   Yeah, we just sharpened up on the PK.   We weren't satisfied with what we did the last game.   That was huge for this group coming off a tough loss where we gave up two goals on the PK.   We wanted to be better today.   
   
 Q.   27 blocked shots compared to Chicago's nine.   What did you see going on out there?  
FREDERIK ANDERSEN:   Of course, we have a great team that is willing to sacrifice themselves like that.   It's awesome to have a group of guys like that in front of you.   That helps me out a lot.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, you said this morning you needed a crystal ball to figure out how this team was going to respond from Game2.   What did you see tonight and what did this win tell you about what this team is about?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, I think it told me what I know, is that they're a great character team.   This was a character win.   
I thought a very good checking game for us, road game.   I think, I mean, they're going to get some chances.   There's no way you can stop them from getting chances.   But I thought we limited their chances on the road.   
For a tired group, it was a really good game for us.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, your six on defense there, played every game.   Have they been under‑sold throughout this?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   As a group, I think they have been.   You don't hear too much about them.   Maybe it's because where we play, for the most part.   But they've been solid.   They've been the same partners almost the whole year, or at least since the trade deadline.   They've gotten to know each other pretty well and communicate pretty well out there together.   
   
 Q.   When the playoffs started, Frederik Andersen was your guy in your mind.   The rest of the hockey world was going to see him and see how he weathered.   He's fantastic.   Has he been better than you thought he might be?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   We've seen him all 82 games.   We've seen him play at the top of his game.   When he's at the top of his game, he's like he's been in all the playoffs.   
We knew he had that capability.   He does put a calmness about the group when we're not playing well or we're having a rough shift.   He seems to know when to hold the puck, when we need a faceoff, when to keep it going.   
That's the sign of a guy that's young but has experience underneath him.   Like I said, I think last year's playoffs helped him immensely.   
   
 Q.   The production of Simon has continually elevated since you got him.   What did you see from him tonight both on the power play and the goal?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I think the calmness.   I mean, playing your off‑side is tough enough.   But the calmness of not just getting the puck and throwing it away, getting on the backhand, just throwing it off the glass.   
He's a big, strong guy, so he can protect the puck really well.   That's a real positive thing.   I mean, his goal was a great one‑timer.   He doesn't get a chance to one‑time the puck too often from his position.   It was a great goal and a great shot.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, when you look at your penalty kill, what do you see when it's going well?   What do you identify?   
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, A, you win faceoffs.   B, when you get puck possession, it goes down 200 feet.   C, you block shots.   
When everything's going well, Trent puts a great game plan together for the penalty killers, so they know how to play.   It's just executing the game plan.   When they execute the game plan, it works.   
Your best penalty killer, you heard it for years and years, is your goaltender.   When all else fails, they make a great play, your goalie makes a great save, he makes the penalty killing look pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Coming off that Game2 marathon, did you see any heavy legs from your group?   Did they mention anything like that?   What does tonight say about perseverance?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Nobody mentioned anything 'cause they all want to play, so they're not going to say whether they're tired or not.   I didn't think the pace was quite as fast as the games that were in Anaheim.   You can attribute that to close checking, time and space, a lot of things.   
The will on this team, I've said all year from day one, you could see it in training camp, you could see it in the pre‑season games.   You guys would talk to me and say there's a different aura about this group.   We haven't won anything, but there is a resiliency that's as good as most.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, Chicago took out Teravainen and Vermette.   Was that a surprise?   Did that affect anything strategically?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   It didn't really affect strategically.   They got great depth, too.   They can move guys in and out of the lineup and not miss a beat.   Tonight was one of those nights.   But it didn't really have a lot of effect on our game plan.   
Thank you.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.
