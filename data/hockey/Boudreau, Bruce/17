  Triple Overtime
Chicago  Â– 3
  Anaheim - 2

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Bruce, do you come away from that game feeling like guys had a bunch of opportunities there to end it in each of the overtimes?
COACH BOUDREAU:   Yeah, I think both teams had numerous.   I haven't counted them up yet, but both teams had numerous chances to win it. 
You know, we had chances to win it.   We didn't win it.   They took advantage of their chance. 

Q.   What do you think happened on the winner there? 
COACH BOUDREAU:   They got all three of their goals the same way:   going to the net.   That's what they do well.   They went to the net, they hit them.   I think obviously before it crossed the line, he got his stick on it to put it in. 
You know, what can you say?   I mean, we had the puck on our stick quite a few times.   We had enough posts and everything else. 
Sometimes, you know, it just goes in the other team's favor. 

Q.   You talked about your team needing to elevate its play.   If you look at the stretch in the second period, would you agree you probably did?   Is that as good a stretch as you've had in the series so far?
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, in the series, yeah.   We had our good points and bad points, just like they did.   I thought the last 10 minutes of the second period was our best part of the game. 
After they took the first two goals, they didn't score for another five periods.   I thought we played pretty well. 
But, you know, those things happen.   That's hockey.   It's back to the drawing board for Thursday. 

Q.   What about the goaltending from both goaltenders?
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, it was one of those games where at some point you didn't think anybody was going to score, you know, with the way the goalies were playing, the opportunities that were had and being missed. 
But, you know, at the same time you knew somebody was going to score at some point. 
Thank you.
