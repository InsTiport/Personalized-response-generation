THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   As someone who has seen a number of Game 7s in your career, what makes them special?   Anything about any one of them that stands out?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I think the finality of it is what stands out.   I mean, one group is going to go home and one group's going to go play for the Stanley Cup.   
There's really not a lot you can leave on the table.   There's no plane for tomorrow, or any of those clichÃ©s you want to use.   
   
 Q.   Ryan talked about after the game how he felt he was terrible, thought it carried over to some of the other guys.   Talk about Ryan tonight.   
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, I mean, I don't think it was one of his better games.   At the same time, there's more than one guy on our team.   I mean, it's great that he wants to shoulder the blame.   But I think there's blame, if you want to use that word, to go around.   
One thing when he plays bad one night, he usually plays good the next.   
   
 Q.   Was there anything you saw, any common theme, to their three‑goal stretch in the second?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   We lost our composure for the first time I thought in the playoffs.   They scored the one goal.   It was like, Aah, what's going on?   We started scrambling all over.   They got the momentum.   
We lost our composure.   That was the theme that I saw.   
   
 Q.   What can you learn from last year's Game 7 to this year?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't know yet.   We haven't played Game 7 yet.   
   
 Q.   How are you approaching it?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't know.   We'll talk about it.   We'll go over tapes.   But, I mean, I think last year's Game 7, we were just a bunch of Nervous Nellis.   Hopefully that happened in Game 6 and won't carry over to Game 7.  
   
 Q.   When you're talking about losing your composure, this team has been so good about turning the page.   Does going home help you do that a lot easier?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, you know, I'd always rather play Game 7 at home than be on the road.   Sometimes we haven't had the success that we'd like to do that.   If you asked me 10 out of 10 times, I definitely prefer the home game than the road game.  
   
 Q.   Is tonight just discouraging?   Is that the right word, given what you wanted to do, how badly you wanted to finish it?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Yeah, it's always discouraging.   But that's a pretty good team on the other end there.   Unfortunately you have to play three periods of hockey.   I thought we only played two.   I thought the first period was a pretty good period, and the third period was a good period.   The one in between wasn't so good.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of Freddie's performance, especially after the way Game5 ended?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   I thought he played good.   He kept us in the game.   It's 3‑0.   He makes a remarkable save to keep us in the game.   The next thing you know, it's 3‑2.   That's what good goalies do.   
The ones that beat him, no fault of his own.   I thought he played good.   
   
 Q.   Start of the second period, Keith took a big hit from Kesler.   Talk about the player that Keith showed himself to be in that stretch.   
COACH BOUDREAU:   I don't want to talk about Chicago.   I want to talk about our team.   Keith is a good player.   What do you want?   
   
 Q.   Your greatest confidence going into this Game 7, how do you feel about this matchup?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   Well, it's one game for the Stanley Cup.   I'm excited about it.   I mean, I'd rather have done it in six.   I think when you sit down and think that you've got one chance to go play for the Stanley Cup, and it's one game in your home building, with your fans, I got to believe that both teams are going to play their best game of the series.   
   
 Q.   Bruce, did tonight show why you guys have to slow them down in the neutral zone?  
COACH BOUDREAU:   We can't let them skate from blueline to blueline on skate.   We did on two of their three goals.   I thought we controlled it pretty good for most of the series going in so far.   
But it got away from us there in the second period.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, coach.   
COACH BOUDREAU:   Thank you.
