 Q.   Did you feel you took the crowd out of it a little bit, or what was the sense of the crowd and the energy?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   I thought the energy was fabulous.   I can't even talk now because players couldn't hear me five feet from me when you're trying to tell them who is up or screaming on the ice.   So I thought the energy stayed pretty well near the end.   I think then they sort of settled down a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Would you want to do it again?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   If the outcomes the same.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone).  
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   No, we can't.   But Hiller was so good tonight.   I think halfway through the third I said it doesn't matter.   They're not going to beat him.   Like I've said that on the other side so many times that we're just not going to beat this guy tonight, and I just had the feeling that no matter how many good looks they had in the last ten minutes, they weren't going to‑‑ they were going to miss the puck.   It was his Karma, like he was on.  
   
 Q.   Was it the penalty stop shot or what?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   Well, I think it had a little bit to do that he came out and said he wasn't focused and he got pulled the other night.   I think that made him really wanting to play this game on a big stage.   You know, I watched him warm‑up.   He was catching pucks that he was really sharp.   And I think he made a couple saves early, and then the penalty shot sort of cemented the fact that he was on his game.  
   
 Q.   Bruce, what are you going to remember most about this game?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   Well, we won.   I mean, I remember the atmosphere, you know, 54,000 people, and where we were, you just look at pretty well everybody where the main portion of the crowd and when people say Californians are laid back, I thought they were pretty into it tonight.  
   
 Q.   What did you tell the players after the game?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   Take tomorrow off and get ready for a lot of video on Monday because we made a lot of mistakes.   But it's an emotional game.   We came up really emotional as well as the Kings.   But once that adrenaline starts to leave your body, you get exhausted.   The other team took over, and that's what they did.   But, again, Jonas was there to save the day.  
   
 Q.   Why did you decide on the suit instead of your stylish varsity jacket for tonight's game?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   I don't know.   I look bad in anything, so it doesn't really matter.   
   
 Q.   The lead on the Kings now is pretty significant.   How comfortable are you about that gap?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   Well, as far as the gap goes, I still think you're going to have to go through Los Angeles if you want to win the division.   I don't care what the record is or if they've been in a slump.   They had 50 shots, 40 shots, and 36 shots on us in the three games.   Every game is a battle.   
So I think come playoff time whether they were in 8th, they won the Cup and ended up in 8th.   So I don't think positioning is really going to matter with them whether we're 19 or 39 points ahead of them.   It's going to be just a battle.  
   
 Q.   Bruce, you've been involved in one of these outdoor games before.   How did this atmosphere and everything that went on tonight compare to when you were with the Caps and you played in Pittsburgh?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   The difference was the weather was great.   I mean, it was a pouring rain thing, so I don't think the crowd was‑‑ they were loud at the beginning, but I think after while they were just so wet.   They were watching and they were glad they were there, but it wasn't like tonight where the conditions were perfect.   The ice was really good.   Dan Craig did a marvelous job.   You get a chance to sort of move around and coach.   
Like back then when it was raining I was standing like this shivering, so it was a little bit different.  
   
 Q.   What would you say are one or two key variables to the equation and success of the Ducks so far this season?   
BRUCE BOUDREAU:   Well, timely goals, timely goaltending, a great desire of character to pay the price to be successful.   Even tonight.   That comes when you're blocking shots and everything.   We're seeing guys limping off the ice and not wanting to miss a shift.   I think it's true character.   I know other teams have it and that, but I know we have it in spades.   I think it's something that keeps us going is the desire to be successful.   I mean, those guys really want to win.
