 Q.  How does it feel overall to be relieved knowing where you're going, and can you describe the feeling sitting there going through one, two, three, four picks? 
 PHIL KESSEL:  I'm really excited right now.  It's tough sitting through those picks, but they are all great guys and great players.  I'm just great excited about the team that picked me. 

 Q.  How does it feel to be compared to a skater like Pat LaFontaine, everyone says you're a great skater, how does that make you feel? 
 PHIL KESSEL:  It's unbelievable when you get compared to anyone who has played in the NHL and who has a reputation like he has.  I'm not the player he is, so maybe I can try and prove it. 

 Q.  In your conversations with Boston, did they give you any indication, we need you now, we might need you in a year, we want you to go back, do you have any feel for that right now? 
 PHIL KESSEL:  No, I don't have any feel for that right now, but they grilled me pretty me hard in the interview. 

 Q.  How happy are you to go to an American team, and specifically the Bruins? 
 PHIL KESSEL:  I'm so happy, me and a bunch of my buddies go out to school in Boston, so it should be a fun time out there. 

 Q.  Were you like upset at all that you didn't go higher than five, and do you feel like you have anything to prove to the four teams that passed you up? 
 PHIL KESSEL:  I wasn't that upset.  I think you have something to prove now that I got drafted fifth, but hopefully I'll go out and show that maybe I should have gotten draft picked higher.
