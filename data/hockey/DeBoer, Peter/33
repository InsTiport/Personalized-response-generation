THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

Q. Pete, throughout the year it seems you guys have had success maintaining leads in the third period. What is it about this team that just seems so calm in those situations and you can close out the wins?
COACH DeBOER: I think there's a trust there. I think the guys trust. We know how we want to play with the lead. There's a trust with our goaltender that he's going to make big saves, and he did when we needed him to. 
We got a lot of veterans there, guys that have been in both situations before and really play with a lot of composure. 

Q. What was the biggest difference between Game1 and Game2?
COACH DeBOER: I think we just played that game for longer periods. I was happy with the second and parts of the third in Game1. I thought we brought our good game to the rink tonight for longer periods. 
Getting the first goal was big. I knew our power play would bounce back. It always has all year. But, you know, I liked our five‑on‑five game. We got contributions from everyone. 
Had a lot of questions in the last day about how much deeper St.Louis is than our forward group. I think our forward group answered that question tonight. 

Q. How is Thornton? He went in the room for treatment. Is he okay?
COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I think he's going to be fine. 

Q. Brent Burns has many assets. Where does his shot rank among all those assets?
COACH DeBOER: Wow, best I've ever seen. I think just how he can get it off from every angle, how he can get it to the net off balance, in bad spots. He finds a way to get it there. 
If it's in the right spot, it's going in. That's a great weapon for us. 

Q. Do you even remember at this point that you're goalie is a rookie and he's never done this before? 
COACH DeBOER: No. You know, I mean, I think because of the way he handles himself, the composure he shows up at the rink with every day, I don't think of him like that. 
I don't think any of our guys do. I think everybody's confidence level in both our goalies is very high. They've earned that. 

Q. Pete, you mentioned the penalty kill tonight. Dialed in, quick shifts, and Jones with 12 saves on the penalty kill. 
COACH DeBOER: Yeah, we took some minors tonight that aren't normal for us. I think six we had to kill off. That's too high for us. But, you know, our special teams were good. Our five‑on‑five was good. Our goalie was good. 
We played the type of hockey you need to play this time of year to win. 

Q. You said before Game1 that depth would be the story of the series. How pleasing was it to get your fourth line rolling right away and get that early goal?
COACH DeBOER: Yeah, pleasing, big goal. But that's been our story all year. We're not sitting here without those contributions from those guys, the ability to roll six defensemen every night so we don't tire people out. That's what our team's built on. 

Q. Along the lines of depth, I tried to count how many guys you used on the four‑minute kill. I got to like 12 or 13. Do you know how many?
COACH DeBOER: I don't know. We wanted to roll them over quickly. I think every time we were clearing, we were getting a change. We used at least eight forwards and probably four or five defensemen. 
Thanks.
