  THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.   
   
 Q. Pete, how do you plan on using Matt Nieto and how can his game help counter what Pittsburgh is bringing?  
COACH DeBOER: We haven't decided on line combinations yet. We'll get to that by game time. But he brings us speed. A big part of our team all year. When he went down, we had some great contributions from guys to fill that hole. But he brings some things that are unique to his skill set that we think can help us.   
   
 Q. I think you said yesterday your guys are pretty much the same on all your lines. You said in the past, your best guys have to be your best guys. Do you think your best guys need to be better tonight?  
COACH DeBOER: I think our whole team needs to be better, all those guys included. They know that.   
I think as a coach, you get to this point, really throughout the playoffs, you want to put your best game out there and see if it's good enough. So far it has been. I think as a group, we didn't do that last game. We want to make sure we throw that at them tonight.  
Thank you.
