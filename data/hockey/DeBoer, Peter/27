THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

Q. Hitch just sat there and talked about how their team got to their game tonight. What happened on your side? How did they take it away from you?
COACH DeBOER: I don't know. You know, I don't know how much they took it away from us. We've been consistently good for a while. We didn't execute tonight. We got burnt. We got what we deserved because of our execution. Short memory. We'll move on to the next game. 
We've had one or two of these games throughout the playoffs and we've always responded the right way. 

Q. How much does a game like this, one team more desperate than the other, or was it a team making adjustments to what they'd seen?
COACH DeBOER: You know what, I don't know. I think when you get to this point, sure, there's some desperation level. I'm not going to say they were more desperate.
I talked about this during the Nashville series and even the L.A. series. When you're up, it's a fine line, that emotional engagement between, you know, facing going down 3‑1 or being up in a series. 
It's tough to manufacture that edge. That's on our group to manufacture that edge. I'm sure going forward here we'll have that. 

Q. Pete, your team came out in the third period with a lot more energy and aggression. Did you say anything or was that a desperate team trying to get back on track?
COACH DeBOER: Well, we finally started to play a little bit. Obviously they sat back a little bit with the lead. I think it's a combination of both. 
We got what we deserved tonight. Again, like I said, we've had some nights like this in the playoffs. We've responded the right way after it. We've got a real honest group. They know where their game's at, what's good enough, what isn't. We'll get it fixed. 

Q. Did they change anything on their forecheck tonight that they were able to be more effective?
COACH DeBOER: I'm sure Hitch will tell you he made all kinds of great adjustments, and every one of them worked tonight. Hats off to him. 
Thanks.
