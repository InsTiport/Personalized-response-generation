THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach DeBoer. 

Q.   On the winning goal, was it a matter of being a little too aggressive in the offensive zone and getting caught up‑ice on it? 
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, we made a little bit of a bad read.   There were a couple decisions there. 
But we're playing to win the game.   I don't make any apologies for that.   You know, we made a mistake; they capitalized. 

Q.   Did you feel like that game was a little bit of a feeling‑out process for both teams?
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I think we're going to have to find another level.   I feel we have another level.   I thought we came out a little tentative, as was expected for a Stanley Cup Final game.   I thought we got better as the game went on.   That's a team you've got to play 60 minutes against. 
The good news is we started in the same hole against Philly, we started in the same hole against the Rangers.   We responded to the situation in the right way the last two rounds, and I expect the same. 

Q.   With Zach, didn't seem like he got going till the second half of the second period, third period.   Was that something they were doing or? 
COACH DeBOER:   It was a combination.   They were good.   They were off for a while.   We knew they'd be good.   I thought we were a little tentative early.   Once we got comfortable, I thought we started to play better. 
We've got to be better than we were tonight. 

Q.   You talk about finding another level.   Early in the third period, was that the level that you have to get to?
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, well, we pushed in some spurts tonight, like you said.   That was one of them.   There was a few of those, but not enough to have success against that team. 

Q.   You said you were very pleased with the way your team responded in the last two series. 
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah. 

Q.   What was key?   What do you feel is essential to you doing the same thing in this series?
COACH DeBOER:   I think our group has a pretty good‑‑ does a pretty good job of self‑analyzing, you know, looking at the game and realizing, you know, both individually and collectively where we have to get better. 
We have two days to do that.   We'll be better on Saturday night. 

Q.   The chances you had at 1‑1, is that encouraging you had those chances? 
COACH DeBOER:   You know, it would have been nice to get a bounce.   But, you know, I don't believe we deserved to win tonight.   That's the bottom line.   That's what happened. 
If we had have won, we would have been sneaking one out, so... 
Thank you. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
