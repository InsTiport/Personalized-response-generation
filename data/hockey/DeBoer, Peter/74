Q.   What might you hope this week if everything comes true? 
COACH DeBOER:   Obviously, we didn't score a goal last game, so offense shuffling guys around has been something we've done all year.   Definitely not married to those combinations, and I'm not even sure we're going to start with those combinations.   It's just how we decided to skate this morning. 

Q.   Is there a chance that Harrold will be back in the lineup tonight? 
COACH DeBOER:   There's a chance.   We're going to look at some different things there too.   Obviously we have the luxury of some depth on defense here, and we've got guys that bring different strengths to the table.   So he's an option.

Q.   Did you like the way that Larsson played Game 1? 
COACH DeBOER:   I really liked how Larsson's played since he's gone back in.   So if we do move Larsson out, it's not a reflection on how he played; it's just getting a different type element in there.
