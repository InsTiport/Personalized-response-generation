 Q.   Coach, how was the experience today, and talk about the overall production?   
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I think I speak on behalf of everybody on our side, other than the outcome, it was one of the best hockey experiences I think any of us have had from yesterday through today.   So other than the outcome, it was fantastic.  
   
 Q.   It seemed like teams started off pretty fast, but after the snow came it seemed like for some reason things just ‑‑?  
COACH DeBOER:   I'd like to blame it on the snow.   That would give me a reason why.   We did come out ready to play.   I thought we had a really good first period, and I think we fell into a little bit of a trap because it was five goals scored in the first.   We started to open it up a little bit in the second looking for another three goals in the second period, and that's not our game.   They made us pay.   Tonight was one of those nights where the shot went in, hit something, went in.   We had one of those games a week ago or less than a week ago against St. Louis where we had seven, and everything we put on the net went in.   One of those nights that you have to move on.  
   
 Q.   What was the decision on pulling Marty, short of the rough period for him with the bad breaks and things?   
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, some bad breaks.   We didn't help him out much.   At that point I had a conversation with him and we both agreed, and it was actually his comment, that how about give Schneids the experience of a period in this environment.   It wasn't working for him or our group the way it was.   So I give him credit for that.   It made sense too.  
   
 Q.   Did you let up?   
COACH DeBOER:   Did we let up?   No, we didn't let up.   I think they got the second goal.   A little bit of a flukey goal.   I think what happened was we fell into the trap that this was going to be a 7‑6 game and we were going to have to get seven goals to win.   We're not that type of team.   We start opening it up and trading chances like that and not a lot of good happens.  
   
 Q.   I just wanted to talk about the ice a little bit?   
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, everything was great.   I'm not going to complain about anything.   You're not going to get perfect conditions when you stick a rink in the middle of a baseball stadium in February or late January, but I thought the entire event, from the ice to the production to the environment to the crowd, was outstanding.  
   
 Q.   Does the outcome of the game ruin the experience?   
COACH DeBOER:   I don't think it ruins the experience.   It was the only negative, obviously.   It leaves a little bit of a bad taste, obviously.   We know how important the points are.   But it doesn't negate the entire experience.  
   
 Q.   Up until now you've gotten some of your key guys back in the lineup in the last few games.   Just your thoughts on Patrik and his play today, Elias getting the start today and getting the flow and the team gelling a little bit?   Obviously a bad outcome today, but your thoughts finally having a good roster going in with the whole team?   
COACH DeBOER:   I think we like where we're at, minus today we've been playing some good hockey.   It's key we stay healthy down the stretch.   We've got a fairly good schedule that we think we can take advantage of, and we've just got to get the job done.   
So as disappointing as today is, this isn't the time of year you can feel sorry for yourself.   You've got to pick yourself up.   We've got another big game Tuesday.  
   
 Q.   Will going on the road help reduce some of the sting today?   
COACH DeBOER:   I don't think so.   We just, like I said, we've just got to get ready for the next game.   It was a great experience, other than not getting the two points.   I think we've got a veteran group enough that we can't drag the results around with us for a week, and I don't think we will.
