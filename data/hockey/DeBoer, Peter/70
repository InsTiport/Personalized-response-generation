 Q.   Coach, one of the stories of the game was the power play. What went wrong with the power play?   Was it too much passing, the downfall of it?  
COACH DeBOER:   I don't know.   I think their goalie, you know, was the difference.   We generated some opportunities, some zone time, moved the puck around well.  
I thought we created some real good looks on it.   When their goalie's on like that, your goaltender is your best penalty killer, and I think that was the case tonight.  
   
 Q.   Not so much passing?  
COACH DeBOER:   I'm sure there's a lot of little things we can fix, but that's the difference.  
   
 Q.   Zach didn't talk to the media tonight.   As captain, does that concern you?  
COACH DeBOER:   I don't know anything about that.   But if he did, he's got good reason.   I don't have anything to say about that.   Do you have a question about the game?   
   
 Q.   Follow‑up, is he getting frustrated so far in the series?  
COACH DeBOER:   No, I don't think so.  
   
 Q.   How much did they hurt you guys with the first couple of shifts in the third period before they scored, and then that leads to the penalty, too?  
COACH DeBOER:   Momentum shifts.   When you lose a game like this, where we out chance and out play the other team for long stretches, easy to look at it under a microscope and say, oh, boy, they played two great shifts here and that was the difference in the game.   
We strung together six or seven great shifts.   We didn't capitalize on it.   That's the story of the game.   So, you know, we had opportunities.   If we find a way to score one in the first two periods, it's a different game.   We didn't.  
Can't feel sorry for yourself, you've got to move on.  
   
 Q.   Through the first two periods, anything you would change other than not scoring a goal?  
COACH DeBOER:   Scoring a goal.   Listen, I mean, two break‑aways, two‑on‑ones, we've got to find a way to score a goal.  
   
 Q.   Did you see the hit on Volchenkov by Prust and your thoughts on that?  
COACH DeBOER:   I did.   Yeah, headhunting.   Plain and simple.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like on any other night this could have been a 2‑point night for Kovalchuk, and if he gives you that kind of effort going forward, do you believe that he'll get going again?  
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, we've had nights like this before.   We're not the first team that Lundqvist has done this to.   
So you have to battle through.   It's a little frustrating.   We created chances.   We carried the play.   We did a lot of good things.   Gotta stick with it.   
   
 Q.   They've been able to generate offense from their defensemen all series long.   Is there an adjustment you have to make to kind of clamp down on them?  
COACH DeBOER:   Adjustment, we gave up 20 shots.   Maybe five scoring chances the whole night.   Again, the tendency when you lose a game like this is to microscope everything to death.   
We played a real good hockey game.   We lost.   We gotta find a way to score a goal.  
   
 Q.   What are the chances we'll see Tallinder and Josefson in the next game?  
COACH DeBOER:   I don't know.   We'll see how they practice tomorrow.   They've only had one practice.  
   
 Q. Do you need to get more traffic in front of the net, get some deflections?  
COACH DeBOER:   We had quality chances.   Forget the tips.   We had break‑aways and two‑on‑ones.   We've got to score a goal.
