THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.   
   
 Q. Going into the third, Joe Pavelski, Joe Thornton, Patrick Marleau, Logan Couture had combined for one shot on goal. I'm just wondering, are you worried there's a sense of being wide‑eyed right now against a team that has a lot of experience and Stanley Cup winning players on it?  
COACH DeBOER: Those guys don't have experience? Next question.   
   
 Q. Do you feel like you're testing Matt Murray enough or is it more of the Penguins limiting what you're able to do?  
COACH DeBOER: You know what, I thought we were better tonight than in Game1. Got to find a way to score some five‑on‑five goals. We only got one in each game.   
It's close to the best hockey out there. I think we hit two posts tonight, we hit a crossbar. We've got to find a way. There's not a lot of room out there. We've got to find a way to battle through and create a little bit more space.   
   
 Q. A couple defensive breakdowns in the first period, one costing. Where can you go there to shore up that part of your game?  
COACH DeBOER: Defensively? I mean, everyone is going to make mistakes. They made mistakes on the goal we scored.   
The problem is, if you're not scoring, every mistake you make potentially costs you the game. You can't put those things under a microscope this time of year.   
You have two teams that are playing really tight hockey. One mistake changes the game. You're not going to play mistake‑free.   
Like I said, I liked us across the board a lot better in Game1. A little puck luck, we win that game. We didn't. We had Nashville up 2‑0, they came back and pushed us to seven. They held serve at home, we got to do the same thing.   
   
 Q. You switched up the lines a little bit in the third period. Did you like what you saw from the second and third lines after that change?  
COACH DeBOER: We got a little spark. The second line got us the goal, the Braun goal. We needed to change something up. We weren't generating enough after two five‑on‑five. I liked our third period. We got a few more looks. We found a way to score a goal.   
I think over the third and the overtime we out‑shot them. So some good things happened. But we've got to build on that and find a way to create a little bit more.   
   
 Q. Can you comment on Martin Jones' play.   
COACH DeBOER: He's been outstanding, as has their guy. Game1 was decided in the last two minutes. Tonight is an overtime game. I think we'll hold off on the funeral. We have a lot of hockey left to play.   
   
 Q. The third period has been your best period throughout the playoffs. I want to be careful how I ask this question. Do you think maybe the players are just waiting for the third period? Why can't you do the same in the first two periods?  
COACH DeBOER: Nobody's waiting. The other team wants to play, too. They're very good. They're a good team. They're at home. They have their home crowd. We're playing a team that wants to win as badly as we do and is a very good team.   
There's going to be ebbs and flows. They're going to take it over for some periods. We're going to take it over for some periods. I thought we were better tonight. But we have to find a way to create some more five‑on‑five offense.   
They're not taking penalties, so we've got to find a way to do this five‑on‑five or push them into taking some more penalties.   
   
 Q. On the breakout, how much of it is what they're doing and what you're not doing? How challenging is that making it for you to generate offense?  
COACH DeBOER: In the breakouts? Again, you know, they're putting pressure on us, like we're putting pressure on them. I don't know the specifics of it.   
The way you guys make it sound, we never got out of our own end the whole night.   
This was a game that went back and forth. They're at home. They carried the play for parts. We carried it for parts. We've got to go back home now and get back in the series.   
Thanks.
