THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Is the difference in this game in your mind the five‑on‑three? 
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I mean, sure.   We need to get the first goal out, absolutely.   We had some power play opportunities there.   We need to score one. 
Credit to them.   You know, their goalie made some big saves early.   We couldn't get one. 

Q.   Did you think the whistle should have blown on the first goal?
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I mean, you know, again, that's a momentum‑changing call at the time.   I hope he's right.   That's an awful big call if you're wrong. 
I mean, my opinion on it, as soon as you lose sight of the puck, you know, the whistle's supposed to go.   Even if you don't get it to your mouth, your intent is to blow it when you lose sight.   Should be dead puck, so... 
I'd like to hear an explanation for it.   I didn't get that opportunity. 

Q.   Were you disappointed in the response?   Came out, played pretty well after blowing the five‑on‑three? 
COACH DeBOER:   No, I'm not disappointed in our team.   We played right to the final buzzer.   I don't care what the scoreboard said.   We battled right to the buzzer, and we'll do the same on Wednesday night. 

Q.   Do you need more from the guys that got you here offensively, the guys that have scored for you all year long aren't scoring here.   Has that got to change to get back in this thing? 
COACH DeBOER:   Well, I think that's pretty obvious.   Of course, we need more goals.   Is that a question or a statement?   Are you giving me your opinion on what's going wrong? 
Next question. 

Q.   Could you sense your guys getting frustrated as the power plays weren't scoring?   Were they not getting better in the power play as time went on?
COACH DeBOER:   I don't know about better.   We created some real good chances early.   He made some saves. 
The frustrating part is you're creating some quality chances, you're getting some quality shots, and they're not going in. 
Again, you have to handle that frustration the right way. 

Q.   Parise and Kovalchuk have been pretty matter of fact saying they need to score and yet they haven't.   Is that a function of what Elias is doing, Quick, or are those guys struggling a bit?
COACH DeBOER:   You have to give their goalie and their team some credit.   You know, he's made some saves.   We put up the same number of chances against Philly, the Rangers, we're getting some goals.   We're not this series. 
That's a credit to them.   It's not that our guys aren't trying or not doing enough.   They're shutting the door.   We've got to find a way. 
Thanks.
