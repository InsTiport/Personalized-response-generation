THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach DeBoer.   
   
 Q.   Looked like you did everything you could do to possibly win the game.   Was that particularly hard to swallow?   
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, it's tough.   But, you know, you can't feel sorry for yourself.   We played a much better game.   I knew we would respond.   We did in the right way.   
You know, came up one goal short.   
   
 Q.   From your vantage point, what happened on the winning goal?  
COACH DeBOER:   You know what, I don't know.   We had five guys collapsed around the net.   They found a way to get a puck through.   
   
 Q.   Even though you were controlling most of the first 40 minutes, getting a lot of shots.   You put Parise, Kovalchuk and Zajac on the line.   What did you like about that line?   
COACH DeBOER:   We decided the end of two periods to shuffle some lines.   It wasn't necessarily to put those three together.   That was part of it.   But we mixed up and got Elias, Zubrus and Henrique together.   I like how they played.   It was just a shot in the arm to try to find a goal.   We haven't scored enough, obviously.   
   
 Q.   The one line you kept together was the fourth line.   Seems like they did everything to jump‑start you.   
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, they scored the goal for us in the third.   They did their part.   They have the entire playoff.   We just have to keep getting efforts like that from them.   
   
 Q.   It seems like you had a lot more deflections from shots from the point, guys that were up in the slot.   Was that one of the adjustments you were looking for?  
COACH DeBOER:   That's something we've been trying to do the entire playoff.   We just played a much better game tonight.   We spent more time in their end of the ice, got more shots through to the net, got more points shot.   
It wasn't an adjustment.   That's our game.   We just executed better tonight than we did Game1.   
Thank you.
