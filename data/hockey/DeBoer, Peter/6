  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
   
 Q. You are 1‑0 in elimination games in the post‑season. What was your biggest takeaway from Nashville that you can use tonight?  
COACH DeBOER: Just our response. I think anytime you get in a situation when your back's against the wall, you always wonder what the response of your group is going to be. That for me said a lot about our group.   
I expect the same thing here tonight.   
   
 Q. Pete, when you're looking for a turning point in a game or a series, can it be something as simple as a single hit or shift or a goal, or is that storybook?  
COACH DeBOER: No, definitely I think it can. I think definitely a goal. I mean, we talked about scoring first. If we don't, we can't just back the bus up and head home.   
We want to play with a lead and put them in a position where they're playing from behind. We haven't done that yet. So that's the goal.   
I think absolutely it can.   
   
 Q. Status of Hertl for tonight?  
COACH DeBOER: Day‑to‑day (laughter). Out tonight.   
   
 Q. I'm sure there is pressure that exists in the locker room, whether they want to think about it or not. What is the message to handle that pressure?  
COACH DeBOER: I think our group's whole motivation is to make all you guys get back on a plane and go back to San Jose again. That's everybody's goal. I know it's mine (laughter).   
Actually, the pressure gets lifted in situations like this a little bit. We know the spot we're in. We know what everybody is saying. We just got to go out there and play our best game. I know we'll do that.   
Thank you.
