THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach DeBoer.   
   
 Q.   I'll ask you about the team and the season you had, how you feel about them right now.   
COACH DeBOER:   I'm proud of our group.   You know, you put some men together and you play 110 games I think we played, on the ice every day, I couldn't be prouder of them as a group.   
   
 Q.   This game turns on the penalty in the first period.   You weren't very happy about it.   Do you have any comment?  
COACH DeBOER:   You know what, tonight's about L.A. and letting them celebrate.   If you want to ask me about that in about a week, I'll give you my honest opinion on it.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel bad for Steve Bernier?  
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah.   You know, it's a bad spot for him to be in.   Everybody knows Bernie's heart's in the right place.   He's not at fault.
