THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.

Q. Pete, what is not working for you guys on the power play in this series, other than not getting a whole lot of chances?
COACH DeBOER: I don't know. That wasn't the difference in the game tonight so... 
You know, I think special teams battle has been fairly even in the series. I don't think that's been the deciding factor either way for either team. 

Q. What adjustment will you implement for Game5?
COACH DeBOER: There's no quit in our group. We've been the best road team in the league. We're going to show up and try to get this back here for Game 6. Until you win four, this isn't over. 
We've been chasing the game the whole series by not scoring first. That takes you out of your four‑line rhythm. It affects all parts of your game. We've been on the other end of that in the playoffs where we've jumped out to the lead on some teams and made them change their game. 
That's the biggest thing we have to fix. We have to find a way to get on the board earlier in the game instead of chasing it all night. 

Q. Being a front‑runner for most of the playoffs, not being able to do it here, how much of a grind mentally do you think it is to constantly chase?
COACH DeBOER: Yeah, it's tough. Again, I think when you have the lead, you can play differently. You feel a lot more comfortable getting in a four‑line rhythm, putting your guys out there, trusting them. There's not that pressure that we have to create a scoring chance or score a goal. We can just manage the game, put our time in. 
I think they've done a good job of that because they've had the lead, and we haven't put ourselves in that situation yet. We've got to find an answer for that. 
I don't know what it is. Again, it hasn't been an issue until this series. But it's been a big issue these three games. 

Q. Pavelski getting five shots tonight, do you sense any frustration?
COACH DeBOER: Sure, there's frustration. I thought those guys played hard. I thought there was goals out there. I thought we had a chance to score, you know, at least a couple tonight. We had some really good looks. Their goalie made some saves, we didn't finish. 
I thought, especially in the third, but even parts of the second, even early in the first, we had some good looks. Probably some of the most quality scoring chances we created. 
We did some good stuff defensively, too. We didn't allow them to get as many pucks to the net. They had some quality chances when we had to open it up a little bit. 
We're doing some good things. Just I think, like I said, we can't chase the game. That's probably the biggest thing. 

Q. The penalty on Melker that led to the goal, looked like the guy kind of flopped. How did you see it?
COACH DeBOER: Well, probably the same way you did. 

Q. There's a report that Hertl is done for the year. Update us on his status. 
COACH DeBOER: His status is day‑to‑day. Whoever that reporter is isn't in our room, isn't with our doctors, isn't part of our group. I'm giving you what I've got. He's day‑to‑day. 
Thank you.
