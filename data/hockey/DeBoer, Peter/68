Devils   4
  Rangers   1

Q.   Could you explain how you guys won the war tonight, and specifically the shake‑up and how it all worked out?
COACH DeBOER:   Well, I think you know our guys responded with a big effort.   I thought right from the drop of the puck, we executed our game plan and played on our toes, and they pushed back in the second period and we turned the puck over a few too many times. 
They almost grabbed some momentum there.   But I thought obviously the goal, the power play goal in the third period was a big one.

Q.   What about Josefson?
COACH DeBOER:   I thought Josefson coming in gave us some real good minutes, and the Parise line did a really great job.   And it was a positives tonight, and that was the kind of effort we needed across the board.

Q.   You know Marty can take pucks to the chest, but what was it like seeing him take a punch to the chest and how has that escalated?
COACH DeBOER:   You don't like to see that.   He's a key guy for us.   Two teams battle it out.   He's a big boy.   He can take care of himself.

Q.   When you and John were jawing at each other, is that something you'd rather not see happen, or did you feel like you needed to say something to him?
COACH DeBOER:   This isn't about John and I.   This is about the guys on the ice.   So I don't have anything to say about that.

Q.   You said yesterday you didn't need to worry about Zach Parise, that you had no concerns.   Is this what you would imagine from him in this kind of stage and what you want from him?
COACH DeBOER:   Your best players have to be your best players.   I know it's cliche, but it's critical this time of year.   And I knew he would respond.   I knew it was a matter of time.   He was playing well.   He was getting opportunities.   I think took so long, probably on me because I didn't find the right mix for him as early as I probably should have.
But I thought he some really good chemistry tonight with those guys.

Q.   Can them going after Marty, considering how respected he is in that locker room, be even more fuel for you guys?
COACH DeBOER:   There's enough fuel.   We're trying to win a series and get to the Stanley Cup.   We don't need any extra fuel. 

Q.   In terms of the intensity, did you get the feeling that the Rangers were looking for a fight, Bickel in particular?   Right down to the end of the game he was going after Carter.   And your comment on the way the Rangers were, in my mind, looking for a fight. 
COACH DeBOER:   I don't have a comment on that.   You have two competitive teams.   There's a lot at stake.   Battling to the buzzer.   That's how I saw it.

Q.   Especially after the way you got shut out the other day, how vital was it to get that goal and in the form of the way the goal was that you went right after Lundqvist and you got one through his legs?
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I thought we put some pressure on early, and it looked like it was going to be more of the same from the night before.   We had some quality chances early.   Couldn't get one by him.   But obviously the first one was a big one.   Kind of lifted a weight off us, and I thought we played a little bit looser and a little bit freer from then on.
