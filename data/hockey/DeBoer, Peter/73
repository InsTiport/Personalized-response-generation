 Q.   Coach, in Game 1, you didn't score first.   And you didn't come behind.   Tonight you scored first and you came from behind.   What were you guys doing specifically to enable, to overcome it?  
COACH DeBOER:   I don't know anything specifically.   Just our overall game was much better.   I thought we established our forecheck right off the bat in the first period and we're creating zone time and chances.   I think in the second a couple of the penalties took us out of it and they regained some momentum with couple of power play goals.  
But we felt that if we could play five‑on‑five and stick with it, that we were going to get rewarded, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) wider shots.   Were you getting pucks to the net better tonight?  
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I think that was absolutely a result of us.   I talked last game about our execution.   Yeah, they did a good job blocking shots.   They're a good shot‑blocking team.   But part of it is on us to execute.   And tonight our execution was much better.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about that whole shift that led to Carter's goal there.   You were down 2‑1 with a pretty big time between goals.   
COACH DeBOER:   Yes, your fourth line gets out there and crashes and bangs and creates some momentum and scores a big goal for us.   It's been the story of the Playoffs we've had somebody different every night.   
David Clarkson comes off at Game 1 I think he was real average to outstanding tonight and scored a big goal for us.   And our team has a resiliency to it.   And we usually respond in the right way.  
   
 Q.   What similarity do you see between the way that the team came back in the Philadelphia series and the way you came back tonight?  
COACH DeBOER:   Pretty similar Game 2s, I think we got down 1‑0, and every time we've been pushed with our backs up against the wall in different series through the Playoffs, we've come out swinging.   And I thought it was a great team effort and we just gotta build on it.  
   
 Q.   It just seemed like you played with a little more patience tonight on the ice.   Seemed to be a little bit more deliberate with the passes?  
COACH DeBOER:   Like I said, our execution was better.   I don't know whether it was the layoff, gotta give them some credit for Game 1 and how they played, and I talked about our execution at the end of Game 1 that we needed to be better at it.   And we were tonight in all three zones.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about Brodeur's game tonight.   He made some really sensational saves.   
COACH DeBOER:   Key saves at key times.   You're on your heels.   It's third period, they're given a push.   I thought the third period was his best, and that's when you need him to be his best.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) in the other series you mentioned your situation, how do you feel about where you are now 1‑1?  
COACH DeBOER:   Well, you know we have to take care of business at home.   It's a tough building to win in.   And it's nice to get a split.   But there's a lot of hockey left.   And glad to be going home for two.  
   
 Q.   Coach, you made a key change on defense, concerning how you played a key point, a key partof the ‑ what was your thinking in putting him and how well do you think he played?  
COACH DeBOER:   We have the luxury of seven defensemen.   Peter Harrold was part of our run of six in a row at the end of the season and through the first round of the Playoffs and through part of the Philly series, too, until we put Larsson in.   
We knew he could play.   He brings a little different dimension than Larsson, has a little more poise with the puck, a little more dash and flash to his game.   
And so it was a tough decision because Larsson was playing exceptional.   He was outstanding for a 19‑year‑old, and the minutes he gave us.   And we wouldn't be here without him, the big goal he scored in the Philly series.   
That's playoff hockey, different contributions from different guys, and I'm sure we'll see Larsson again soon.  
   
 Q.   (Question off microphone)?  
COACH DeBOER:   Yeah, I have.   I coached Junior for 15 years.   I've seen just about everything in rinks.  
   
 Q.   I don't think he got an assist, but Zidlicky started that key play, do you remember that one, and led to the tying goal?  
COACH DeBOER:   There were so many key plays, Zid was good.   It was just a great effort by us.   You'll have to refresh my memory.   
   
 Q.   Let me rephrase.   You want to stay out of the penalty box.   How do you avoid that?   Tonight it seemed like there was some real borderline things that you couldn't avoid.   How do you avoid them?   
COACH DeBOER:   I think you answered your own question.   We were trying to play hard, trying to play between the whistles.   Some of the calls leave you scratching your head a little bit.   But you have to play through that.   Everybody gets them this time of year.
