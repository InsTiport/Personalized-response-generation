Q.   What's it like playing a hockey game out there? 
JONAS HILLER:   Yeah, it was a really special experience.   I think I had more time to enjoy it last night.   Once you're in the game, you're more focused on the game than stopping the puck.   But, yeah, sure, after intermissions and key breaks, you are able to get the whole picture, and it was pretty unbelievable.   It was just, for sure an unbelievable experience.

Q.   Weather pattern shots on goal, you played out of your mind.   Take us through the night and how you saw the puck? 
JONAS HILLER:   Yeah, I was really happy the way I played the last game, and I want to make sure I'm ready tonight and it wasn't too tough with the whole thing and everything.   There was a big buzz, and I was super excited to play and get a chance to play in front of such a big crowd. 
Yeah, I got in the game early, got quite a few shots, and then I think we did a really good job, our guys did a really good job blocking out, and I was able to see most of the shots.   Did a good job with the rebounds.   I think it was a really tough game to play for both sides because the puck seemed to bounce a lot.   It didn't get like too many nice plays.   So it was kind of like everything was at the net.   And we had to find a way to keep the puck out.

Q.   Jonas, in a game like this, depth perception and sight lines, no one is more affected by that than a goaltender.   How well were you able to see the puck tonight? 
JONAS HILLER:   It didn't bother me actually too much.   I thought it was going to be a thing, but the lighting was similar to playing indoors.   I guess mainly because it's after sunset, so you don't have to worry about the sun and getting the glare from the sun.   I think on the ice I normally run that according to the lines and where my blue paint is and the crease.
So that is still the same in every rink.   So that didn't really bother me.   So you feel it's a little different, but it was nothing that threw me off.

Q.   Jonas, you have Kopitar coming in on the penalty shot, and it didn't even look like you had to move that much.   What did you read on that penalty shot? 
JONAS HILLER:   Yeah, it seemed like he wanted to go first on the breakaway.   He tried to go backhand and lost the puck a little bit.   It kind of felt like he wanted to shoot.   I was glad that it was a great shot and I was able to stop it.

Q.   Separation is such a big thing for you before the game.   You had 50,000 fans going crazy, KISS was playing.   How did you keep your head straight with everything else that was going on at the beginning of the game? 
JONAS HILLER:   Well, at the end, I think the whole team came in to win two points.   I think that was the main focus.   It's really if you can control those things if you're winning than losing.   I think everybody was well prepared.   I think we definitely had a good start.   Getting two goals definitely helped our confidence.   I think out there you kind of focus on the game.   You kind of try to not see anything around you really.   It wasn't too tough.   It was more like you're sitting around and going around and walking around. 
So it wasn't like your regular game‑day routine.   It was a little different, but I'm glad it didn't affect me too much.

Q.   How is this game different from an indoor game? 
JONAS HILLER:   Well, the crowds are a little bigger.   I think it was definitely not the prettiest game.   Like passing was pretty tough.   Just the puck seemed to bounce.   I think they did a really good job with the ice, but it was tough especially later in the period.   Normally there was a lot of snow on it.   The puck seemed to be a little slow, which I think threw the players off a little bit. 
But, yeah, I think it was warmer than a regular game.   The humidity you could feel.   But finding a way to keep well‑hydrated and I was able to go all 60 minutes on a good pace.

Q.   What will you remember most about this night playing at Dodger Stadium?   Will it be your playing?   What will it be?
JONAS HILLER:   Yeah, I mean, it's probably the whole thing.   It started last night with having to practice and being able to see the whole facility and being more focused on the game.   So you kind of like get this feel for like all those memories, it's tough to pick something out.   It's definitely way easier and way better to think back if you know you played well.   Your team played well, and you got away with a win.
