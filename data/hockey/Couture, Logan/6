   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Logan. 

 Q. Did you go out last night, hit all the hotspots? 
 LOGAN COUTURE: I did (laughter). 
 No, I didn't leave my hotel after dinner. We got to Vancouver, we saw some fans. They're proud here. Try and stay in as much as possible. 

 Q. Can you talk about how much you think playing seven games against the Red Wings took out of this team? 
 LOGAN COUTURE: I don't know. I mean, I think it helped us. It was a grind. The series was back and forth. We battled every night. They went through a seven-game series exactly as we did.
 I don't think we'll be tired or anything like that. I think we're ready to go. 

 Q. Who were you going up against primarily in the Detroit series? 
 LOGAN COUTURE: In Detroit it was Datsyuk, and in San Jose it was Zetterberg. 

 Q. Talk about what it was like trying to limit those two individuals? 
 LOGAN COUTURE: I think Pavel Datsyuk is the best player in the NHL, best player in the world. He does everything well. It was a challenge. Learned a lot from it. 
 If I play against the Sedins or Kesler tonight, it's going to be a challenge. I'll be ready for it.

 Q. Probably the Sedins. 
 LOGAN COUTURE: I'm not sure. You'll have to ask the coaches about the matchups. 
 Whoever I'm matched up against there, I'm just going to focus on them. That's what I did last series. If it's against Kesler or Sedins, I'll just play against them.

 Q. Could you feel your confidence during the course of the series, playing against world-caliber centers like that?
 LOGAN COUTURE: I think my confidence has grown from last year in the playoffs and into these playoffs. I've become more comfortable in this league. Almost 30 playoff games now. 
 I think I'm a confident person. As I get more comfortable, I become more confident.
