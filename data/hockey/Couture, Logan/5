  LOGAN COUTURE: I built the confidence up. Whoever I'm with on the ice, I feel confident. You look at the last series, there was a time when I was with (indiscernible), there were times I was with Clowe and Heater. Last year and this year with the success, definitely helps the confidence. 

 Q. Across the stat sheet last night you looked pretty good. Are you happy with your personal play? 
 LOGAN COUTURE: I mean, no, not really. We lost. That's the first thing I care about is how our team does. We didn't play well. There's four teams left and we didn't play like one of the best four teams in the league. 
 You can put out any excuses, but it was definitely us that lost that game. They didn't really do anything out of the ordinary. It's one we didn't play well. 

 Q. Is hanging on to third-period leads become more of an issue than you guys would like?
 LOGAN COUTURE: I don't think so. Someone said it last night, that we've blown a couple of third-period leads. I hadn't even thought of that until that was said. 
 I mean, I don't even think we changed the style of play. We just turned pucks over. We looked at some video this morning. We had so many turnovers in the third period. Can't do that against that type of team. They're too good.
