Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MIKE GARTNER: Once again, it doesn't really bother me much to not get recognized.  I kind of think it is kind of nice.


Q.  You have got family in Toronto, you come home -- (INAUDIBLE.)

MIKE GARTNER: I have said over the last year that I never feel cheated.  Those would never be my words.  But I am disappointed that I wasn't part of that, you know, surely, and I look back on that and thought maybe it could have been, but I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and that I am exactly where I am supposed to be exactly the right time that I am supposed to be there.  So, I have no regrets that way.


Q.  Was it difficult watching it?

MIKE GARTNER: Very.


Q.  What did you do, did you curse at them?  Did you hope they'd lose?

MIKE GARTNER: No.  None of that.  I just watched as an impartial observer. 


Q.  As a player who has, I guess, you would epitomize longevity along with some others.  What does it take for you and a Mark Messier to play at a level that you are playing at especially a Mess, being and All Star and winning another Cup, what does it take, is it an aberration; can other players aspire to the same thing?

MIKE GARTNER: Well, other players have done it in the past, and they have plowed the way for guys like us.  I don't think it is such an unusual thing with certain individuals.  I think the main thing that it does take -- it takes the love of the game.  You can't play there long if you don't enjoy hockey.
