ALEX TANGUAY: This is team game, we are down 2-1.  We have the chance to go in the powerplay early in the second hopefully week tie this thing up. 
 

Q.  What about the whole mood of the crowd, seemed like you were down half that first goal by the Devils then you were able to pick it up after the play by Bourque?
 
ALEX TANGUAY: Yeah, we were able to pick it up.    You can't allow that to happen against a team like New Jersey and that's what happened.  They got a couple of 2 on 1s and guys like Mogilny and Elias they are going to score every time they have those chances. 
 

Q.  Only 12 shots in Game No. 4.  Do you have to be less patient now, shoot the puck more?
 
ALEX TANGUAY: I think we have to get the puck to him and we have to make sure we get some traffic.  He is a  great goaltender, if you don't create any traffic, send the puck to him, we are not going to score.
