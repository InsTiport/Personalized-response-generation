Q.  Can you believe the intensity level of this matchup.

ALEX TANGUAY: The intensity is there.  We expected that, you know.  We know they're hungry for a Cup win, and we're hungry as well, so we just have to make sure that we get a good third period, you know.  We struggled in the first couple rounds and the third period in Game 1 against them, so we'll have to make sure we bear down on our chances and make sure we get that win.

Q.  Your line has clicked with Joe Sakic and Milan Hejduk.  I know you didn't have Hejduk from the beginning of the playoffs.  How important is it to have him back in the mix?

ALEX TANGUAY: It's nice.  He's a great player.  He's a world-class player.  He's played great hockey for us, and it's always great to play with a guy with as much skill as him.
