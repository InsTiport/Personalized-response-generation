   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Keith Ballard. 

 Q. (Question regarding Rome.) 
 KEITH BALLARD: It's obviously a tough situation for him today, it's a tough one to go through. We have to make sure as a team we pick up the slack and everybody contributes. 

 Q. Is there accountability on both sides in plays like that? 
 KEITH BALLARD: Yup, absolutely. You never like seeing a guy lying there on a stretcher. Only people on the ice understand how fast it is, the decision-making process, how fast it is when you're making a play. That's only multiplied when you get into the Stanley Cup final. That kind of situation, it's a fast game. 
 As a team, we don't agree with the suspension.
