Q.  R. J., Were you at all disappointed that you didn't last until Pittsburgh's pick and forced them to make a tough decision?

R.J. UMBERGER: No.  I'm happy to go to Vancouver and I'm just thrilled it happened today and I've been waiting all my life for this moment.  So it's been a great day so far.


Q.  I'm asking for Pittsburgh, even though I'm from here, but do you feel that you would like to sign and get into camp or is there a chance that you'll go back to college?

R.J. UMBERGER: I think there's a good chance right now I'll go back to school for just a year and I'll see how the year goes and I'll take it year by year and make a decision after next season.


Q.  Being from Pittsburgh, do you think it says something about the expansion of new hockey and so forth that 15, 20 years ago a kid from Pittsburgh could never have been a first round pick?  Do you think it says something about the expansion of new hockey and what kind of player it's developing now?

R.J. UMBERGER: It's great to see.  There's some kids out there from Pittsburgh and the development is great right now.  They have a great junior program right now so things are on the uprise for Pittsburgh.
