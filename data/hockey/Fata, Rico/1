RICO FATA:   It looks good.  I match, that's what it is.  That's for sure.  I guess it is fate, you know.  I got a black tie on and black pants and everything.  I'm just ecstatic right now.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   I was actually kind of surprised.  I really didn't know what to expect coming into the draft.  I was going into the draft with confidence.  I had a pretty good season this year with London.  I've heard some great things about the City of Calgary and the Calgary Flames, so you know, I'm on cloud nine right now.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   A lot of times we can follow the Canadian teams.  We get a lot of late night games on Friday night when we watch Calgary or Vancouver, so I'm always there and I'm always watching, so.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   I don't know.  I think in the past I think, you know, they strung out a little bit, but I think every team goes through that, you know, within a couple two or three years.  But anyway if I can help the franchise and help the club, then I will do it.


Q.  Do you think your fans -- (INAUDIBLE)?

RICO FATA:   I don't know.  That's basically that's up to the management.  That's up to the team.  You know if I work real hard this summer and have a pretty good training camp, maybe they would like to keep me, but if not, I guess I will be back a junior.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   I love it.  I think it is great.  It matches my pants and my tie.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   We had central scouting testing in Toronto and I had an interview, and I had an opportunity to have an interview with Calgary.  And I thought the interview went really well.  I didn't have any idea what was going to happen.  I don't know if anybody had an idea what was going to happen, everybody was keeping quiet and wondering what was going to happen, too.  So I don't know, I was really surprised.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

RICO FATA:   I think so.  When I played for the Grey Hounds when I was 15, I knew from that point that I wanted to be drafted in National Hockey League and now this day came so.  I have an opportunity to play for the Calgary Flames so I feel great right now.
