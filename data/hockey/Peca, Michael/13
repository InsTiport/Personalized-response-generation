Q. Michael, after getting the series even, it is now best of 3. Is this kind of what
you expected from this series?

MICHAEL PECA: Absolutely. The two teams match up really close. Both teams have a
similar style. Everything we expected. Tonight we expect a real emotional game on both
sides.

Q. When you think of about what happened in Buffalo after Game 3 and the way the team
responded, what do you think helps you get over all the gloom and doom there for a couple
of days?

MICHAEL PECA: Well, we are not a team that sits around feeling sorry for ourselves. We
realize the errors we made, the lack of intensity that was there at times and all it is is
you correct it. You make yourself aware of it and come out with a better effort. That is
all we have had to do.

Q. How happy with were you to see Dixon Ward get that goal the other night?

MICHAEL PECA: Nice to see. It has been a case where our line has been playing 5-on-5
(inaudible) -- it was a fortunate break and one we capitalized on.

Q. One of the things we talked about to with the guys from the 1975 Sabres today was
that if they can give one piece of the advice it would be to try to savor being here. Have
you had a chance at all of doing that?

MICHAEL PECA: You try to. But it is tough at times. I think when you are at the rink,
everything is all hockey and you are focused on the task at hand. But when you get away
from it, you spend some time with family and friends and that is when you get to enjoy it.
But, you know, it is kind of a Catch-22 - away from the rink you try and forget about the
game and try and get myself ready as well. But it is fun.

Q. If it wasn't for the U.S. Open what would get you through these long days?

MICHAEL PECA: I don't know, longer naps, I guess. But it is good.
