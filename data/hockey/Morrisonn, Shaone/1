Q.  Can you just talk a little bit about being drafted by Boston and all the history with them being one of the original six clubs.  I would imagine that's a little bit more of an honor than maybe one of the other teams.
 
SHAONE MORRISONN: Yeah.  It's a dream come true.  Ever since I was growing up it was my favorite team.  I idolized Cam he's from my area.  I'm just happy to be there.  It's a great organization, great history and I'm looking forward to getting there. 
 

Q.  Would you say that your game is very much like Cam's?
 
SHAONE MORRISONN: Well, he was a forward, but you know, I try to like do the things he did and he was a rough player.  But I'm mostly skating and speed, using my sprints and setting up plays offensive and be solid defensively.
