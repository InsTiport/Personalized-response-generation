 Q.   What can you guys do better defensively after giving up five goals in each of the last two games?   
JASON GARRISON:   I think there are probably a few things that we can do better defensively.   I think we've got to obviously limit their scoring chances.   They seem to have been getting a couple breaks on the rush, and they're using their speed.   So I think we can start from there and clean things up kind of in the neutral zone and not give those chances up.  
   
 Q.   What are you expecting out of Bishop after two games where he lost five goals each?   
JASON GARRISON:   Yeah, I think he's probably not happy about that, and I don't think any of his teammates are really, so collectively as a team we've got to make sure that doesn't happen.   You can't win in the playoffs very much letting those kind of goals up.  
   
 Q.   (No Microphone) the back and forth, scoring chance here, scoring chance there.   Is that an area where you guys are happy?   
JASON GARRISON:   No, I mean, I think we've always said from day one that we've got to take care of our net.   Sometimes you can get away from that and concentrate more on the offense, but I don't think we want to play kind of back‑and‑forth hockey.   That's not really our game plan, but it seems to have been like that the last couple games.   So we've just got to make sure that we look at that and look where we're kind of giving them their chances and kind of try to do something to resolve that.
