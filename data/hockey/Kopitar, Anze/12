  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ANZE KOPITAR:   No.   I mean, we have to focus.   That's the big part of it.   You have to play within the whistles, just go shift by shift, make sure you have to do everything to prepare yourself first, then go from there.
