  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ANZE KOPITAR:   We all know what's at stake.   It's just a matter of getting focused, what you got to do at that moment.   Right now it's getting ready for tomorrow.   Tomorrow is getting ready for the game.   During the game, you got to play the shifts.   We'll see the outcome in two, three hours.   We'll go from there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ANZE KOPITAR:   That's what you got to do in playoffs.   You know, once you get caught looking ahead, or back, you can get caught and just start daydreaming.   That's obviously not very good. 

Q.   For guys like you that haven't gone through this, is it surprising, or is it a byâ€‘product of some of the guys that have been through it?
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah, having some experience in this room, obviously I don't have it myself, not a whole lot of guys have it, but having some guys that have been there, they've been to these types of situations.   I mean, it helps a lot. 
You know, you talk to them once in a while.   But then, you know, I guess you kind of catch yourself doing the same thing.   After that you just do whatever's working for you. 

Q.   Have you thought about what the rink is going to be like tomorrow? 
ANZE KOPITAR:   I think it's going to be pretty good.   Not that it hasn't been in the past, too.   I think the loudest I heard Staples Center was the Game4 against St.Louis.   Those last couple minutes were pretty electric.   Even two days ago it was pretty fun. 
I don't doubt it's not going to be any different tomorrow. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.
