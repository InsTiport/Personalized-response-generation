  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ANZE KOPITAR:   You have to take the opportunity when it comes to you, hit the net, make the goalie work.   There's some small details to it.   But, again, it's going to take 20 guys.   We're going to have to put together a solid row.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you're victims of your own success this season, expectations being so high?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   We know what our expectations are.   We're sitting in a pretty good position right now.   A loss is a loss.   You have to put it past you, look ahead, get ready for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you have to nail this down because you don't want to put pressure on yourself going back to L.A.?   
ANZE KOPITAR:   We wanted to nail it two days ago.   Nothing has changed.   The focus and the concentration is still there.   Obviously you want to finish it off as quickly as you can.   Sometimes it doesn't go according to plan.   
We're just going to have to grind it out tomorrow.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
