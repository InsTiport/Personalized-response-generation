  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar.   
   
 Q.   Mindset heading into Jersey on this road trip?   Kind of the mindset of any other playoff game the club has had so far?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah.   We feel comfortable on the road.   It's unfortunate we couldn't close it last night.   But we'll try to do it on Saturday.  
   
 Q.   Now that the series is getting to the fiveâ€‘game margin, the teams know each other as well as they're going to know each other.   At this point you know each other pretty well.   
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah, I mean, we know their strengths, we know their weaknesses.   I'm sure they're doing the same.   
It's going to be interesting game, a game of inches.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Anze.
