  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ANZE KOPITAR:   I don't know.   I think our penalty killing was pretty good throughout the year, too.   You know, I guess we took it to another level in the playoffs.   
But that's what I got to do.   I mean, we wouldn't probably win as many games as we did if our PK wasn't as good.   We got to continue doing that.   
   
 Q.   It seemed like Mike Smith's puck handling had a little more effect on the game the other night than it did in the first few.   Anything you have to do differently to keep it away from him?   
ANZE KOPITAR:   Except for keeping it away from him, nothing too much (laughter).   
   
 Q.   How do you keep it away from the goalie?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Well, either you fire really hard or you make sure the puck doesn't get into a trapezoid area.   
   
 Q.   Looking at those shots the other night, thinking about it for a couple days, 36 shots sounds like a lot.   Were they dangerous shots?   I don't remember there being very many rebounds.   
ANZE KOPITAR:   Some of them were.   Some of them were from the outside.   Sometimes even the outside shot seems harmless, but can be pretty dangerous.   The chances, second and third chances off that shot are the most important.   
We got to make sure we keep making them work and get some guys in front of them.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
