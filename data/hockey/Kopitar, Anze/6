  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Feel like you can change the momentum of the series if you get that one win tonight?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah, for sure.   It's one at a time.   We've done it before.   Now we got to do it again.   
   
 Q.   What is the biggest worry heading into tonight?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Biggest worry?   
   
 Q.   Worry, concern.   
ANZE KOPITAR:   I mean, we're not looking for concerns or anything.   It's a game that we got to win.   We're going to make sure we have a good start and play consistent for 60 minutes.   
   
 Q.   So many guys talk about it's important to play your game.   What is that right now at this point in the playoffs?   
ANZE KOPITAR:   You got to be physical.   Got to be strong on the puck.   Eliminate turnovers.   That's what's gave us success in the past.   That's what's going to give us success going forward.   
   
 Q.   How much extra pressure does it have with the injuries as a center?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Not a whole lot more.   I mean, probably got to take a few more faceoffs.   But that's about it.   
You know, we have a natural centerman in Jeff stepping in.   It's not that big of a deal.   Do we miss Mike?   Of course.   But we feel like we have pretty good depth down the middle.  
   
 Q.   What about Quick, expecting a big rebound?  
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah, he's done it before.   We have all the confidence in him that he can do it again.
