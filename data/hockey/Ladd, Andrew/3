  Q. How do you feel about having to debut in a defeat like that?  
 ANDREW LADD: It's tough. Obviously we didn't do a lot of little things, especially defensively in the first period. We got behind the eight ball. They are a good team. It's tough to battle back.   
  
  Q. Talk about coming back and playing -- making your debut.   
 ANDREW LADD: It was fun. Obviously, it was tough watching. Especially at this point of the season. It was nice to get back in there.   
  
  Q. (Question off Microphone).  
 ANDREW LADD: I think that's part of my game. I don't think I'm trying to add that. It's always been there. That's what I do. I'm trying to play the same way. Keep things going.   
  
  Q. Pretty tough. You mounted a bit of a comeback. It's pretty difficult on the road?   
 ANDREW LADD: Yeah, it was 4-3. I thought we had lots of chances to tie it up. We will be looking to have that kind of pressure right off the top in Game 5. Like I said, tighten up a little better defensively.   
  
  Q. Talk about your movement to the top of the line. That seemed to work.   
 ANDREW LADD: Yeah, obviously Buff, good player. Three big bodies tough to handle. We get all three guys going perform a little bit of chaos.   
  
  Q. Best of three. How do you do from it here?   
 ANDREW LADD: They won their home games, we won our home games. It's our turn to go home and come up with our best effort.   
  
  Q. Can you talk positive about that third period?   
 ANDREW LADD: I think so. It was obviously our best period tonight. Maybe our best period of the Series. I don't think offense was the problem. Defense, giving away too much.   
  
  Q. Frustrated being in the box in the first minute?   
 ANDREW LADD: I got a little overaggressive right off the top. Got me in the game. Did a good job killing it off. It's just the way it started.   
  
  Q. You guys haven't lost two in a row in quite some time. What do you have to do to shake it off?   
 ANDREW LADD: It's a good wake-up call. It's not going to be easy. This team has done well when coming back from adversity and having -- being in a tough situation. We're confident we can play the right way next game and get back to where we want to be.   
  
  Q. Line changes late. Was that a needed shakeup?   
 ANDREW LADD: What's that?   
  
  Q. Shifting people around, was that a wake-up call?   
 ANDREW LADD: I think Joel does that. He's done that throughout the whole season. Obviously down 4-1. Switch things up and try to get different guys in different situations. It seemed to help.   
  
  Q. Unlike the other Series, home-ice advantage didn't to help. Now you have it. Is it going to pay off getting the home ice advantage?   
 ANDREW LADD: Sure. That's what you work for in the regular season.   
 It definitely comes in handy in the Playoffs. I know firsthand, we were in Carolina and it came in very handy to be at home. Especially in Game 7. So we're looking forward to getting back to Chicago and having the crud on our side.   
  
  Q. Health-wise, were you cleared today? Were you cleared a couple of days ago?   
 ANDREW LADD: The last couple of days I felt good. I felt like I was progressing very well. I'm good to go.   
  
  Q. What was your impression of the Flyers?   
 ANDREW LADD: They are a very deep team. They've lot of great players. A lot of speed. I have had the opportunity to watch the first three. I think I got to know what they're like.   
  
  Q. Is there another hunger level or compete level the team has to have, dig deeper you're going to find to come out with this?   
 ANDREW LADD: I think we saw that in the third. Hopefully we can bring that to the next game. That's the level we need to play at, the level we need to compete at.
