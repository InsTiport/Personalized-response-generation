  SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   Good evening, everyone.   I'd like to welcome you to our conference call featuring some of the award winners we have announced in the past hour. 
We'll start things off with the winner of the Ted Lindsay Award, Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby. 
We'll open it up right away for questions for Sidney. 

Q.   Your thoughts on winning the award?   Were you surprised missing as much time as you did at the end of the regular season?
SIDNEY CROSBY:   I don't know.   I think it was something that I knew I was nominated, knew I had a chance.   Yeah, I guess you never know until you get the word. 
It was nice.   That's not something that you're thinking about during the season.   But to be recognized by the guys that you play against, I think it's obviously a compliment.   Happy with the regular season.   Felt like it was pretty good, for the most part. 

Q.   I don't know if you get to see much of Jonathan Huberdeau, but what did you think of him when you did see him?
SIDNEY CROSBY:   When we played against Florida? 

Q.   Yes. 
SIDNEY CROSBY:   I think he's a great player.   He's a great young player.   He's got a lot of skill.   He seemed to adjust pretty quickly.   To get thrown in there with as many games as we had to play in a short period of time, maybe that might have helped. 
But he certainly had a terrific year. 

Q.   You mentioned about this being an award that the players vote for.   Could you talk about what it means just to have an award like that.   The other thing would be, in hindsight, do you feel like you reached the level where you were playing before the Winter Classic, when everything was going right for you and the Penguins?
SIDNEY CROSBY:   Yeah, no, certainly to be recognized by the guys you compete against night in, night out, that's a compliment.   To know that's the way they see you as a player, to have that much respect for your season, what you did, I think that means a lot.   I think any player would tell you that. 
I think it's special we have this award.   I think it's an honor for anyone who's able to win it. 
As for the regular season, yeah, I feel like I was able to get to that level for the most part.   I missed a lot of time prior to the season.   To be able to get in that many games so quickly probably helped me, especially with the lockout.   I was well‑rested. 
I was definitely excited to get back out there and felt like I got to the level that I wanted to. 

Q.   Getting awards like any individual honor, especially this one, in terms of how you feel that will affect how people view you long‑term compared to championships.   Also, the guy that won it the year before was Evgeni Malkin.   Signed to a big deal.   Your thoughts on that, too.
SIDNEY CROSBY:   What was the first question? 

Q.   The long‑term view, how history will judge players? 
SIDNEY COSBY:   I think it will be by championships.   I think winning always defines players.   I think that's not the only thing.   I think there's a lot of things that do that.   But ultimately winning, that's something that players are measured by, how their teams do. 
Awards and things like that are nice, it's an honor to win them.   Guys play to win, they don't play for awards.   I think ultimately that's kind of how I see it. 
As for signing Geno, I'm very happy.   Very excited he's going to be part of our team for a long time.   Ray was able to do that pretty quickly.   Just really excited and really happy that it's done and that we're going to be playing together for a long time. 

Q.   How do you feel about winning this award and not winning the Hart Trophy?   Does that bother you at all that you have one and not the other or does that not matter?
SIDNEY COSBY:   You know what, like I said, I don't think you play throughout the season with awards in mind, to be honest.   I don't.   That's not how I measure my season.   But to be recognized by this one, to be recognized by the players, it certainly means a lot. 
For the Hart, it's one of those things when you're in the mix, you're that close, it's something you'd love to win since you're close, you're in the mix, it's something that is not an automatic thing every year. 
I had a pretty good year this year.   I don't think I would do anything differently.   I feel I had the best year I possibly could.   It didn't work out the way I wanted.   I'm not going to get too upset over the fact I didn't win it.   I was in the mix.   Alex had a great second half there, ended up getting hurt and missing some time there. 
That's how it works sometimes. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   Sidney, thank you very much for your time and congratulations on winning the Ted Lindsay Award. 
SIDNEY COSBY:   Thank you. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   I believe we are now joined by the 2013 Rookie of the Year, the Calder Trophy winner, Jonathan Huberdeau of the Florida Panthers. 
We'll open it up for questions. 

Q.   Jonathan, any surprise at winning this?   You had a great year, but some other guys did as well.   Your thoughts on bringing this back to Florida. 
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   For sure, it was a surprise.   I didn't know I was going to win it.   There's two other guys.   It was a lot of good rookies this year.   Brendan Gallagher had a good season, and Saad, too.   It's still going for him. 
I wasn't expecting anything and I'm glad that I won it. 

Q.   You were put in some great situations with the Panthers, playing a lot of minutes.   How much did that help you out this year?
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   Yeah, for sure it helped me, more ice time than I was expecting to have, with all the injury we had.   I think I was playing in a different role.   I think that for sure, yeah, that helped me a lot in the Calder. 

Q.   Do you have room in the Mustang for this award, put the top down?
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   Yeah, for sure, in the backseat (laughter). 

Q.   We really didn't know about your injury until after the season.   First of all, how are you doing?   How is the rehab going?   At what point in the season did that begin to bother you? 
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   I think the rehab is going pretty well.   I think I'm ahead of the process.   That's what I wanted to do.   I'm just taking my time, doing the rehab properly. 
We didn't know all year.   We knew a little bit that it was bothering me, but at the end we check it out more.   They said that was the best decision, to get surgery now.   I'm young, the rehab would be easier now than later. 

Q.   You're saying it kind of bothered you pretty early in the season? 
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   Well, yeah.   But I was able to play my full game.   I was 100%. 

Q.   What are you doing to prepare for next season?   They talk about you trying to get stronger. 
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   For now I'm just focusing on my hip, and after the six weeks after the surgery, you're starting more to focus on your upper body and everything else.   Try to put weight on your legs and stuff. 
After six weeks, I'm going to start to work for next year. 

Q.   Are you going to stick around Chicago and watch the game?
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   Yeah, for sure, I'm going to watch it tonight. 

Q.   Do you think the shortened season helped you at all, being a rookie, not having to think too much?
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   For sure, like you said, you play a lot of game.   You don't have to think when you play every other day.   You don't think about anything. 
He wasn't thinking about the Calder all year.   I was just playing my game.   At the end I got the trophy.   So it's been good. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   That's all the questions we have today for Jonathan.   Congratulations. 
JONATHAN HUBERDEAU:   Thanks. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   We have Norris Trophy winner P.K. Subban.   Thanks for joining us.   We'll open it up for questions. 

Q.   Do you see a correlation between your improved numbers and the work that you've put into managing risks on the ice and channel maybe your energy better this year? 
P.K. SUBBAN:   Well, I think that every year you grow as a player both on and off the ice.   I don't think anybody's debating that. 
I think as an organization, as a group, as a team, we improved this year.   When you improve, everybody benefits.   I think I'm just benefitting from our team's success this year. 

Q.   You're still pretty young.   Do you see yourself exercising a form of leadership eventually that would be along the same lines of the leadership you've shown in your own family, for example?
P.K. SUBBAN:   Well, of course.   I think being a fan of the MontrÃ©al Canadiens, growing up a Habs fan, I've appreciated the jersey, the logo, what it stands for.   To be a leader for this organization would be something I've only dreamt about.   I think I take pride in that. 
Obviously, with time in the league comes maturity.   I think I've grown a lot over the past three years and I'm going to continue to grow.   I didn't think I would have made such a personal accomplishment at this point, but on the same token, it's all the more reason for me to continue to get better, be a leader, develop both as a player and a person. 

Q.   You won this award over some very good defensemen.   What do you think enabled you to distinguish yourself from the others?
P.K. SUBBAN:   I think, you know what, we all play for different teams, we all play different styles.   I think every player's different in their own way.   Both Kris Letang and Ryan Suter were both deserving of the award.   You could make the argument there were other defensemen in the league that could have been up for the award this year.   I feel very privileged and honored to have won it. 
A lot of this credit needs to go to my teammates.   I think these types of awards, you have to give a lot of credit to your teammates because at the end of the day those are the guys that are helping you, playing with you on the ice. 
I owe them a lot, especially coming into the season late.   My teammates were amazing for me.   We've been great all year.   I owe them a lot of credit. 

Q.   What do you think about the Norris lately, about it becoming more of an offensive award maybe than it was in the past, that points seem to be a measuring stick for it?   Is that something you like or focus on as a defenseman? 
P.K. SUBBAN:   I wouldn't agree with that.   I think when you look at a defenseman like Nick Lidstrom who has won the awards many times, not every year he was leading the league in scoring for defensemen.   It's not always given to the top‑scoring defenseman. 
At the end of the day, I'm happy I'm not one of the guys that has to vote on who to pick, there's so many great defensemen to pick from. 
At the end of the day I think it's a privilege and an honor to win the award.   At the end of the day you don't win to win the Norris Trophy, you play to win the Stanley Cup.   If that comes along with it, you count your blessings, enjoy the moment, then go back to work when you get the chance. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   Thank you very much for your time.   Congratulations, again. 
P.K. SUBBAN:   Thanks a lot. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   Our final guest on this call is Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky.   There is a translator with him.   At this time we'd love to open it up for questions for Sergei. 

Q.   You were traded by a team that didn't think you were a number one goaltender.   A lot of people were not sure that things were going to work out in Columbus.   They weren't sure if it was smart.   How sweet is this moment for you to not only prove that obviously you can play in this league, but be the best goaltender in this league for an entire season? 
SERGEI BOBROVSKY:   (Through translation.)   When I was traded to Columbus, I didn't think of what people said or people think.   The most important thing for me was to concentrate how I can help this team, what can I do better, how could I prepare myself to make this team even better.   That was my main focus. 

Q.   Do you feel like you can still become yet a better goaltender?   Is this as good as you could ever play or is there still room for personal improvement? 
SERGEI BOBROVSKY:   (Through translation.)   Without question, there is still a lot more work to be done.   This is not my final stage.   I can be better and I'm going to be better. 

Q.   Where do you stand contractually?   How close do you feel like you are to getting a new contract?   How much does this evening, not just the Vezina Trophy, but finishing as high as you did in the Hart Trophy, how does this help your argument, your and your agent's position? 
SERGEI BOBROVSKY:   (Through translation.)   At this moment I would like to enjoy myself winning this prestigious award.   I'm not even thinking about contracts.   I'm sure it will all work out itself. 
Right now is the moment to celebrate, and later we will sit down with my agent and think about our next steps. 

Q.   Is there any chance you would leave for Russia to play in the KHL? 
SERGEI BOBROVSKY:   (Through translation.)   We'll see. 

Q.   Wondering if you were surprised how quickly things came together for you in Columbus after the trade? 
SERGEI BOBROVSKY:   (Through translation.)   My main focus, as I said earlier, was to come there and play every game and concentrate on every single game.   I wanted to win every game I played. 
I didn't think about how fast or how slow it was happening for me.   It's a very difficult question.   But you can see it goes by so fast already. 
SCHUYLER BAEHMAN:   Thank you very much, Sergei.   And thanks, everyone, for joining us.   Congratulations to everyone.
