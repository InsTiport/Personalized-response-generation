  TOMAS VOKOUN:   It's been pretty hard lately, but like I said, all around we're players, so...

Q.   Is there someone in this room who you guys count on to speak up in a situation that might be serious like this? 
TOMAS VOKOUN:   You know, we already, I think, said everything we need to say after the game yesterday.   I think we all understand where we are, and more importantly, not as much we were down 2â€‘0, it's how we play.   If we want to have any chance, we've got to change that and approach the game a little bit differently than we have been.

Q.   I don't know if you heard Dan after the game yesterday, asked him about the goaltending and he said he can't really put any of those three goals on you.   How do you evaluate your performance?
TOMAS VOKOUN:   Well, I'm a goalie, so you're there to make a difference.   I wouldn't say they were bad goals, but I didn't make the stops and didn't make the difference.   I don't think you can always say, well, they were good goals.   Just like the players, we have some guys who are here to finish and score goals, and if they don't, then even they get chances it's not good enough.   So for me it was a matter of letting three goals in but it was a matter of not letting the team capture momentum, make the big save at the start of the game when we needed it.
