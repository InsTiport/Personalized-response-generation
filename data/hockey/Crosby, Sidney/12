Team Canada  4
  Team Europe ‑ 1

Q. Going into this game, you knew you were going to be in the semifinals, were there any specific things you and your lineup wanted to work on going in?
SIDNEY CROSBY: I don't think anything specific. I think just getting better, making sure we execute well, trying to get some momentum. Obviously getting first. I think that we just wanted to make sure that we played a good game and gave ourselves a chance to win. 

Q. I know you're more about how you guys are going to play, but your opposition is either going to be Ove and the Russians or Connor McDavid and Team North America. Can you just talk a little bit about both those teams and the challenges they present? 
SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, just highly skilled, fast teams that don't need a lot of room and time to create plays. I think on the defensive side of things, we're going to have to make sure that we're ready for whoever we face. I think that being said, I think we need to make sure we control the puck in their end, and I don't think our game plan changes that way. But I think we know at this point that whoever we play, we'd better be ready to move our feet.

Q. Can you just describe the run that this team has been on? I think this is 13 straight wins in international play going back to Vancouver. You guys have found a way to do it on nights that you might not have a lot to play for or also might not have your best. 
SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, I mean, I don't really look at it as a whole like that. Everyone likes numbers, and I think, yeah, like you said, in order to do that, you need to find different ways to win, and whether it's goaltending or special teams or someone different stepping up and getting a big goal, I think that the depth that we have has allowed us to have success. 
I think everybody collectively as a group when you play for Team Canada understands that their role may change, minutes may change, but ultimately it's just about winning, and I think that everyone understands that. I think right away that helps. That goes a long way.

Q. What do you think about a possible fight with Team Russia, and Evgeni Malkin, do you like this possibility?
SIDNEY CROSBY: I mean, it's a big rivalry. It's been there for a long time. I think everyone, players included, get excited for a possible matchup with Canada‑Russia. At this point, like I said, we know whoever we play, it's going to be a big challenge, and it's going to be a highly skilled and talented team that we play. Yeah, I think we know that, but I guess everyone kind of has their own opinion as far as who they'd like to see match up. 

Q. It seems like this run has really coincided with you joining the team, Toews, Weber, the whole leadership group. As far as Toews, he had two goals tonight. What's his role been in this run that you've been on, and what's the importance of him to this team in general?
SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, I think if you look at the whole lineup, I mean, guys are either captains or assistants on their own team. They understand what they need to do in order to win. Guys have won previously. I think he's won three Stanley Cups, gold medals. I think he knows what it takes to win, and he shows up every night. And I think that's the case for a lot of guys. But he has that ability and that knack to step up in big games, and he's been able to do that for a long time. 

Q. How close are you to where you want to be for these three games? Are you right there or is there still more work you need?
SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, I think we feel like we can improve. I don't think it's anything specific. I think it's just probably just consistency in every area, just making sure that we're sharp, that we make the plays we need to make. There's always going to be momentum swings in games, and I think we've done a pretty good job when we don't necessarily have it, we've been able to get it back fairly quickly. 
Yeah, I think there's always things you can clean up, managing the puck, defensively in your own end, making sure that you're tight there and not giving up chances. But for the most part, I think it's just consistency in every area.
