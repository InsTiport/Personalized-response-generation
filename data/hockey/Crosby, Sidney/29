 GARY MEAGHER: Questions for Sidney and Marc-Andre. 

 Q. Just yesterday you were talking about Game 6 last year and that one puck that snuck underneath you. Today you had two or three in the crease that didn't go in and you made the huge save on Cleary on the breakaway. How do you feel about this Game 6 as opposed to last year, given some of that history? 
 MARC-ANDRE FLEURY: I don't know. It's a great feeling that we've won that one. You know, last year was tough, you know, to lose it and to see the other team have the Cup. Now that we're still alive, we have a chance at it to go to Game 7, it's awesome. 

 Q. I think both broadcasts ruled in the shot. So I have to ask you about it. I see you got a big kiss on the cheek on the way into the rink tonight, I don't know if it was mom or somebody was there with you. Was that a little bit of lady luck on your shoulder? 
 MARC-ANDRE FLEURY: Yeah, that was my mom. You know, my parents have been here for a while trying to support me like they did all my career since I'm a young kid. And to have them here with me at this point. It's pretty cool. 

 Q. For the second straight year the Stanley Cup was out of its box, and you guys made them put it back in. How satisfying is it knowing that the next time it comes out of there you actually have a chance to touch it? 
 SIDNEY CROSBY: It's an unbelievable opportunity. You know, we weren't thinking about last year at all. But, you know, we found a way to survive, that's what we had to do tonight. And now it's anyone's game. And, you know, it's going to be a great challenge. They play great at home but we've got to battle and find a way to pull it off. 

 Q. Both of you, how many times have you played a Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final in your backyard and just sort of the emotion growing up and living that game Friday night? 
 SIDNEY CROSBY: Probably hundreds of times. Like every kid growing up, you play street hockey, you play in the outdoor rinks, you always dream of that opportunity. I've watched Game 7 on TV, and you dream of making it to the NHL, but that's always something that sticks out is playing for the Cup in Game 7. So like I said, we've got an amazing opportunity here.
 MARC-ANDRE FLEURY: Yeah, I don't know, it's a great opportunity. Since I'm young I've been dreaming about making a save on a breakaway for the Cup. So to have a chance like this to get that thing, it's awesome. 

 Q. Can you just take us through the moment when Danny Cleary's breaking in on you? What's going through your mind and what you're thinking at that point in the game? 
 MARC-ANDRE FLEURY: You know, I knew that could be a turning point if I could make the save. At first I was kind of thinking about forechecking, but I tried to be patient and wait for him to make the first move, and I got a piece of it. 

 Q. Can you take us through the process of the last 48 hours or so coming back off a game where you give up five goals? And just gearing yourself up for this game a little bit? 
 MARC-ANDRE FLEURY: You know, I think I've learned throughout my years that it doesn't matter how many goals you give up in a game. I think it's a matter if you lose, you lose. So it doesn't matter if I give one or five. So I try to forget about it. Put it in the back, and next day come to the rink with a smile on, try to be positive and confident for tonight's game. 

 Q. You just said a little earlier that you had to find a way to survive to get to Game 7. You kind of survived tonight on the backs of some of your more role players, you know, Petr Sykora lost a shot early, Matt Cooke had a strong game, guys like that, it must really be a boost when you see guys like that coming to the forefront and actually stepping into the spotlight? 
 SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, we rely on each other, and teams don't get to this point without each guy stepping out and stepping up in their own way. Time after time I think our team has proven that we're a true team, and everyone's contributing. Tight games like this there's not going to be a lot of chances, but when there is, you know, you rely on the guy next to you to execute.
 It's not going to be the same guy every night, but that's why we've had success. We lean on each other, and in a big game like this, TK, Staalsy, they've come up with some big goals, and those role players so to speak, they get big plays, and we've depended on them all season long. 

 Q. There's not been a lot of momentum between games, and you would have taken this win no matter what. Could you talk about it as it relates to Game 7 in light of the quality of the win? The discipline being better, the approach being better, the third period, the shots on goal the first two periods being down and so forth? Just the quality of what it might mean going into 7? 
 SIDNEY CROSBY: It was tight. And that's what you expect every game in the playoffs. You know, we don't expect Game 7 to be any different. It's going to be a game of execution. You know, I think it's important just to take that lesson, you know. Both teams were patient, but also worked hard and battled for their opportunities. 
 But when it's tight like it is, you've got to be responsible and wait for your chances. Then, like I said, it just comes down to execution. So we'll take that lesson from this game. 

 Q. About Dan Cleary's breakaway, what are you thinking as you're seeing Cleary break toward the net there? 
 SIDNEY CROSBY: Well, you don't like seeing their team have a breakaway like that. But you know what, I think myself, like a lot of guys, we expected Flowers to stop it the way he was playing tonight. You know, he saved us many times, but we have all the confidence in the world. So not going to say I like seeing it. But I had all the confidence in the world that he was going to make that stop.
