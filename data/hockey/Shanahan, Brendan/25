BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Finally did it.  All of those stupid cliches we were saying for the last two months we can now say we did it.


Q.  What's the sweetest moment of this whole process?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  The sweetest moment is the countdown; made it a little interesting in the end.  But the last two seconds, watching Steve throw his stick in the air, throwing your own stuff in the air.  It was over.  What a release.


Q.  What does it feel like to actually  skate around with the Cup?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  It's a lifelong dream accomplished.  Now you want to do it again.


Q.  Did that last period feel like it might never end?  You're looking up at the scoreboard and saying, Please, please, get it over with?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:   Yeah, a little bit, but we were trying as much as we can to still generate chances.  You know, we always knew that even though we weren't attacking, we were defending.  So we thought the best defense would be to spend the time in their end.


Q.  Brendan, when you think about this, your whole life, does it live up to what you think or does it exceed it?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  It exceeds it.  It exceeds it.  I'll tell you what, five minutes before a warm-up, we were doing movie trivia.


Q.  Who won?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  They couldn't stump me tonight either.  Tootsie.


Q.  Let me ask you, is this what you thought it was going to be?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  It's unbelievable.  What a feeling.  It's everything you expected and more and it's still happening because it's a experience you share with the city all summer long.


Q.  You told me a couple of weeks ago when this started that there was going to be a goofball, you were going to go wild after you win this thing.  So what's on top for tonight?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Who knows?  Play it by by ear.  It already started off pretty goofy.


Q.  I asked Darren did you come out a little tentative tonight.  Did you feel a little like --

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  The first ten minutes we were nervous, but then we got back into our game, a big momentum for buildup; first, close out the first period with a goal and then Darren McCarty.  Stevie Yzerman scored the career highlight-film goal, and turned out to be the winner.


Q.  Great.  Congratulations.

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Thank you.


Q.  You got your Cup?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Yes, yes.
