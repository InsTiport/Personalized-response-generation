Q.  (INAUDIBLE) Draper, the overtime goal (inaudible) --
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  When you are on this team, you really don't.  There is a lot of guys throwing the puck to the net.  We just say let's keep throwing it to the net.  I am sure Mrs. Draper had Draper.  (LAUGHTER) 
 

Q.  Is this an indication of what you guys can do (inaudible) --
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  I think it was more just -- you look at the way we played in the third period, there was a lot of determination (inaudible) guys blocking you and guys with sticks on you, it was a very determined effort.  I recall Sergei three or four times just barreling down the wing and cutting into the net and Stevey as well.  They are a great hockey them and they have got warriors.  To get this far -- you don't get this far without warriors, big strong guys, we have to match that.  Nobody has questioned the character and heart of our team, I don't think you can question theirs as well.
