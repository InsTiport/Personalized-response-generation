Q.  Do teams seem to play a little bit more conservatively for a Game 7?

BRENDAN SHANAHAN: Well, you know, Game 7, both teams have their back against the wall.  Last game, we had our back against the wall.  I wouldn't really say that we played conservatively.  We played desperate hockey.

Q.  But the teams come out and try to feel each other out?  I mean, you guys know each other so well at this point, but it seems it's more low scoring than usual.

BRENDAN SHANAHAN: Well, I think the checking and the goaltending in the series has been  great.

Q.  Do you have to be on guard about fearing making a mistake?  You can't play like that, but it's hard not to probably.

BRENDAN SHANAHAN: You can't play afraid.  You have to go out and just play.  We went out and played last game.  We weren't playing every shot thinking of the consequences of a mistake.  You just have to play your game.  And again, I mean, we know it's a Game 7.  We know what it's about.  We know where the winner gets to go.  But as a professional, you prepare yourself however you think you're going to respond best.  Fear is really not an issue.
