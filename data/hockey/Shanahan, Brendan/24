BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Obviously they are a great team and they are going to challenge you.  Got to have discipline and we got away from that a little bit this period.  We really are not happy with our period.  We need to have a much better third. 
 

Q.  Do you feel like the team should be doing better?
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Well, I think we have to be on our toes more.  I think it has been a bad habit of ours to get on our heals when we have gotten a lead.  We have always played our best forcing the other team.  Even if the other guy has got his head up and has the puck, you have got to rush him in making a pass.  Sometimes you won't make the best pass if your feet are moving.  And, we have got to start doing that. 
 

Q.  Your production is down after the last series.  To be reading into that; is it fair to say you are hurting?
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  Well, I think in the Playoffs everybody plays hard and I don't think it is anything new, but I feel like I can contribute.  I have had my chances.  It is a matter of getting them in.  And there is no time in the Playoffs to take a week off or to give yourself some rest, so, I am just happy to be playing and happy that we are winning.
