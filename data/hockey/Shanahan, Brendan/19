BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  You know, I want to respect his privacy, but it's just too juicy not to bring it up.  He told me just before the Playoffs he was eying a cottage.  I asked him to scout it for me and he said that it was Conn Smythe's old cottage -- and this is right before the Playoffs started -- and then during the Playoffs he said he bought it and I just thought, wouldn't that be good?  I don't want anybody driving by his cottage and taking pictures or anything like that. 
 

Q.  How was Vladi on the ice?
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  That was one of the greatest moments I've ever had on -- as an athlete. Not too often does a moment in hockey transcend sports, but that was one of them.  That's a greater victory than winning the Stanley Cup. 
 

Q.  You didn't lose focus the whole year.  How does that feel, two repeats, Brendan?
 
BRENDAN SHANAHAN:  We just treat it like a marathon.  We were in it for the long haul.  What really helped us is we were able to step up with different heroes in every game and every series and it was a grind, but we outlast a lot of teams because of our depth.
