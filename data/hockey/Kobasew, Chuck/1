Q.  How does it feel to be going to a Western Canadian team being from the west?
 
CHUCK KOBASEW: It's just a great experience.  I grew up watching the teams from the west and I just feel fortunate enough to be picked by a team out west.  It is unbelievable. 
 

Q.  How much do you know of the Flames' situation and did you have any sense that they were looking at you?
 
CHUCK KOBASEW: I wasn't really sure coming in.  I just knew it was a wide range, I could have gone and I'm just very happy and lucky to be picked by the Flames. 
 

Q.  Just talk about what's going through your mind.  Did you anticipate this day coming for a long time because you really don't know what it's going to feel like waiting for your name to be called?  What was it like leading up to it and finally hearing your name?
 
CHUCK KOBASEW: Last couple of months it's been a lot of fun meeting the people involved in the hockey world and the last couple of days it starts to get to your nerves.  But now that it's over, it's just a great feeling and I'm very excited.
