 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the two players. 

 Q. Marian, can you talk about your game today? I know you've been frustrated not scoring. You set up both of Troy's goals. That obviously turned out to be important. 
 MARIAN HOSSA: I know in our line we got the right end of the charts. They are both great shooters. Somebody has to push the puck. 
 So Troy was in a great position. He just kept getting open, and I tried to find him because he was in a better position and he made the two great shots. 

 Q. Marian, on a night when a lot of guys seem to get caught up in the moment and not play the way they normally do, you did play your normal game. Do you think it's the experience you have that allowed to you do that? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: Probably there's a little bit maybe true about it. Because we were being in this kind of games. And you went through it. So you keep your composure, keep your game and don't try to run around and try be somebody else. So I tried to play the same way. I'm just glad we won. 

 Q. Just for both of you guys, this is certainly not the Game 1 people expected. What was it like to play in a game like that? And what was happening that was -- it seemed to be getting so crazy at times? From both of you? 
 TROY BROUWER: It was a little nerve-wracking, that's for sure. Some of the guys in the Series, it's their first time in the Finals. Nerves might have had a little to do with it. It's a real emotional game. 
 Lot of back and forth, a lot of up and down. You just try and stay composed, stay with it and stick to the game plan. 

 Q. This one is for both of you. A lot of tension paid to Bolland's line and takes line going into this Series. Not that you were playing poorly, but were you hoping for a night like this for your line to break out? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: Definitely we were getting a lot of chances. For whatever reason the puck doesn't go in for our line, and we tried to stay patient. Tonight was one of those nights we made those chances again. This time the puck was in. That's how we have to play in the Series. Because we know we have to help the team offensively too. 

 Q. Troy, Stanley Cup Finals, two goals, two biggest goals of your life. Just talk about this game for yourself. 
 TROY BROUWER: For me, I want wanted to be ready. Our lines, like Marian says, the line has been playing well, but not been able to finish off our chances. 
 So for us we wanted to go out. We wanted to be a dangerous line every time on the ice. I wanted to have a good game and really get some confidence for the Series. 

 Q. Troy, you guys didn't get a power-play tonight. You still managed to win Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Is that a good momentum builder going forward you guys don't get a man advantage and win the hockey game? 
 TROY BROUWER: It definitely gives us confidence knowing we can score 5 on 5. And we had one short-handed scorer tonight, great effort by Bolly. The power-plays will come. We're not a team completely based on our power-play, even though we do have a very skilled team and a great power-play. As long as the goals are coming from wherever the goals are coming, we're okay. 

 Q. Troy, do you find tonight with Hossa, and sometimes when Kane does the same thing, all eyes are kind of on him and you're able to find an open spot because of that? 
 TROY BROUWER: Yes, Hoss is obviously a great player in this league, and everybody knows it. He has been for a long time. 
 So the other team is going to key on him a little bit more, someone like me. That gives me an opportunity to get open, and he's so good with his puck possession and vision that as long as you get open like in the first goal he fended off two or three guys in the corner, brought it to the front and was able to make a great back-hand pass to me. With him you just kind of got to let him do his thing and get open, and he'll find you. 

 Q. Marian, your previous experience coming, how great is it to get this win and to play well in it going forward for you and for the team? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: The first game is always huge because you want to get the momentum going in the big games like this. And you know, huge win. There is Game 2 again. We'll have to focus on that game. It's all about momentum in the Finals. When you grab the momentum, that's what is huge. 

 Q. Marian, in a game like this where it's back and forth, how do you get self-control and slow things down? And was that control a factor at all in the third period where the team seemed to be a bit better? 
 MARIAN HOSSA: I think we have to be much better because we had too many turnovers tonight. And against teams like this, they got lots of fire power. I believe if you play better defensively we're going to help our goalie. Our goalie is going to help us, and we're overall it's going to be a better performance. Tonight we take the win. But I don't think we played well defensively. 

 Q. Both for Troy and Marian, several of the Flyers already saying because of the fire power that you guys can throw at them, they feel like they need to tone it down a little bit if Game 2. Do you feel like you guys could just keep it up at this pace, or would you like to maybe tone it down defensively too? 
 TROY BROUWER: We're a team that likes to play fast-paced game. I don't think takes much of a mystery. They have a great transition game, and they're able to move the puck up the ice. They caught us a couple of times sleeping on changes. A little lax on our coverage. 
 For us, I don't know if we want to slow the game down at all. We just want to be able to play our game and just be able to do what makes us successful.
