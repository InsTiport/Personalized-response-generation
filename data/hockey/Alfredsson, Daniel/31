Q.   Were you surprised at how well (inaudible) games in the last six weeks?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  A tough situation to be in.  Nothing to lose.  All he had to do was go in there and give it his best, and he did.  He played really good, really smart.  We're dangerous offensively a lot of times.  He played a great game for us.

Q.  Just a comment on finally getting a goal, 1 for 21 now. 

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  It's a big goal, you know, sealing the game for us.  He's great on the power play, even when he played for us earlier in the year, he was a big part of our power-play.  Hopefully we can continue using him and get better. 

Q.  Is he putting more pressure on himself because of that performance, he needs to do it all over the next game?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  You want to go out there and do your best.  He's the kind of guy that takes it as it comes.  He knows he can't do more than his best.  He knows the system we play.  I think he'll be just fine.
