Q.  Talked to you a couple years ago.  You're getting to be a regular face here.

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  It's amazing.  I mean, always excited.  Great honor to be here.  It's a great weekend.  I was very happy when I was selected to the team.


Q.  You look every year like you're coming back and know more what's going on.

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I just want to go out there and have fun.  There's so many good players.  Make some nice plays and have a good time.


Q.  How do you like this format?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I think it's going to be more competitive than usual.  I like the format of North America.  I think it's going to be a good game.


Q.  What are the guys saying about this in the dressing room?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  They definitely want to win. I -- you won't see a lot of hitting, anything like that.  We want to put on a good show, but at the same time both teams really want to win.  International year for hockey, playing games in Tokyo, North America against Europe, now the Olympics.  It's a good setup, I think.


Q.  I'm sure the Olympics are one thing you wouldn't pass up.  The World Championships, if a team doesn't make the playoffs, are the players being overburdened with all these extra tournaments?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I don't think so.  It's very tough, of course, at the Olympics.  You play a lot tighter schedule.  You have time to regroup, a lot of minor injuries become more of a problem, maybe then you're a bit tired. Otherwise, during the regular season, it's not a big problem.


Q.  Why is Sweden going to win the Gold Medal in Nagano?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I don't know.  We're going to go out there.  You can't tell what team is going to win. There's five, six Dream Teams out there.  They're all going to fight for it.


Q.  How is Sweden different?

DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  We have a great team.  We have great skill.  The key is going to be goaltending.  Thomas is going to have to play great for us.
