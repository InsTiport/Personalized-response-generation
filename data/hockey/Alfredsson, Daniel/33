Q.  What did you think you need to do offensively?
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:   We're playing not bad, but I think to get our offense going, we need to skate a little bit more and work a little harder. 
 
Q.  Do you feel there's not enough passion or whatever to fight through those checks? 
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:   No, I don't think that's the problem at all.  We did create some chances.  Chances have been pretty even throughout the game.  I think you have to make the most out of it when you get the chances. 
 
Q.  Why did it look like there was not the passion and desire early in the game last night? 
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:   You're not going to get a lot of room out there.  I think the way the game is played, it might look really slow sometimes because they come out with five guys and we play pretty good defensively, too.  There's not going to be a lot of room, and you're not going to see, maybe the way we skated against the Islanders some games and against Philadelphia.  This is a totally different team and you have to stay really patient.  Scoring the first goal is really, really important.
