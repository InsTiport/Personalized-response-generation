Q.  What's the mindset of this club?  You have to feel good, but no false sense of security going into Game 7?
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  No, I mean, it's still the same situation as the last two games:  if we don't win, the season's over.  We're going to have to play the same way, same desperation, if not even more.  
 
Q.  How good do you think the Devils are based on last night? 
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I think with the expanse, the club, they're going to be a very dangerous team.  They know how to win, there's no question about it.  If we're not at our best, I mean, we won't win. 
 
Q.  What kind of game do you want to play, style-wise?
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  Whatever it takes to win.  I mean, you got to make things that you think are successful.  You got to make sure you don't give them too many odd-men rushes.  You know, we got saved by Patrick last night and we got to play smarter.  
 
Q.  How good do you guys feel right now?
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  Feel good.  But, I mean, today is definitely a relax day and tomorrow it's back to work.  There's no way around it, I mean, if we don't win tomorrow, I mean, Game  5  and 6 doesn't mean anything.  I mean, we're going to have a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of desperation.  You know, we're going to have to play our best. 
 
Q.  Pat Burns says the pressure is on Ottawa now.  Do you agree with that?
 
DANIEL ALFREDSSON:  I don't really care about pressure.  I don't think neither team could say has more pressure than the other.  I mean, it's a do or die situation for both teams.  Both teams are going to come out and play probably another great game.  You know, yesterday's game was one of the hardest and one of the best games I probably ever played.  I don't expect anything less tomorrow.
