 Q.  Will bouncing back from that situation be any harder or any more difficult bouncing back than what you've bounced back from this year?  
MARC METHOT: Maybe.  We're playing against a very good hockey team, but you've got to believe you can do it.  We've won games.  We know that we can do it, and I think that there's no exception or difference tomorrow.  It's another game where you've got to go and stick to your game plan, and we need everybody on board.  That's something that we addressed today.  It will be a fun little challenge.   
 Q.  Marc, what can a short practice, a rare practice do?  
MARC METHOT: I mean, I think it's just -- it's a good way to have everyone come into the rink today and kind of wipe everything clean.  We had a good little chat, like I had said earlier, before practice, and you go out there and just get a little sweat and kind of free your mind and just work on a couple little things that maybe we could improve on and go from there.   
I don't know what the schedule is tomorrow, but I know that skating today certainly helps when you've got a good group out there, and I think we did.
