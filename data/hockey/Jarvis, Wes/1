No, New York flew me down and they were talking to me and, you know, I was pretty thrilled to be picked by them.  It's a great organization to be picked from.  I'm just really happy with it.

I think mostly Scott Stevens.  I think he's the all-around defenseman.  I try to pattern my play around him mostly.  I look a at a lot of other players and I look at their strong points, and I just try to put that into my game. 

I think my skating, my aggressiveness, my checking, good puck handler.  I think I'm a team player first.

A little bit, you know -- you know, I thought I might have gone a bit higher.  But I guess I'll make up for it by getting drafted by such a good team.  I'm really pleased.

Yeah, I think so.

Thanks very much.
