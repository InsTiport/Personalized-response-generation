  Q. Did anybody say anything in that moment to you?   
 RYAN NUGENT-HOPKINS: I don't think even if they did, I don't think I could even remember right now.  
  
  Q. You talked yesterday a little bit about the possibility of going back for another year at Junior. Now that you know it's the Oilers, have they talked to you at all about their thoughts in that regard?   
 RYAN NUGENT-HOPKINS: Not really. But I mean from what I've heard, Steve's in no rush to get me playing. But if I do go back to Junior, I won't be disappointed at all. It will be a great opportunity for us, Red Deer, as a team to hopefully to get to the Memorial Cup.   
 Personally it will be a good year of development for me too, but my goal now is to make the Oilers right now.  
  
  Q. You're in with a group of guys that are all coming up at the same time. Can you just speak to the excitement about being part of something that seems like it's building pretty well?   
 RYAN NUGENT-HOPKINS: Yeah, definitely it's going to be great. I'm definitely going to be able to relate to all the young guys in the system already. So just joining a group like that is very exciting for me. I just can't wait to get started.  
  
  Q. The World Juniors are going to be in Edmonton in Calgary. I know the NHL's dream, but on the same token won't it kind of be neat considering where you're located?   
 RYAN NUGENT-HOPKINS: Yeah, definitely, if I didn't make the Oilers, hopefully I can make the World Junior squad, and that will be a great opportunity for me as well.
