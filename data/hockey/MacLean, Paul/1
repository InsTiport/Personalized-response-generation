 Q.   Coach, the lead hasn't been a strong point for you this year.   What did you think?   They pushed hard.   You had a one goal lead you made it stand up.   
PAUL MacLEAN:   I thought we survived, I guess, is the right word for it.   I thought the game, we moved the puck good, I thought in the second we got a little bit ‑‑ or the third, I'm sorry, that you're talking about, we got a little bit cautious and played maybe a little bit being scared not to lose instead of being scared of not winning.   I think that's one thing we talked about afterwards is we've got to play to win and not play not to lose.  
   
 Q.   The perfect way to start this big week for you guys, four games here on the road in what is dwindling in the season?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   Well, we know we need to win games.   You need to win to get in.   Our first game out wasn't very good, but this one here I thought we gave a good account of ourselves after getting down by two to come back and get it tied after the first.   I thought the second period we had was possibly one of the better ones we've had a in a long time and made a big difference.  
   
 Q.   How about that contribution from Clarke MacArthur who comes in struggling but makes big plays to get this team back in the game when they're down?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   Well, he's part of the why did we sign Clarke?   We knew he was a player that played 400 games in the league.   We didn't have a lot of those guys.   And that's what they did.   They know how to play on a big stage.   They know what it takes to get ready to play.   I thought tonight he was very influential in the game for the whole game.   I mean, getting the first goal to get us to 2‑1.   As the game went on, I thought his line with Turris and Condra were very effective in keeping the momentum going our way.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of the way Anderson played after giving up the two goals?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   We thought Andy was fine.   He was fine.   I thought he was solid for us.   He made saves.   Some of the hard ones he made look easy.   Again, another player that provides leadership for our group.  
   
 Q.   Can you speak to Cody Ceci's game, and the maturity and resilience coming off a tough game against Detroit?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   It's great to be young.   They have short memories.   I thought Cody again, a young player that's going to have ups and downs, and you're going to have to be patient with the downs and encourage the ups to be there.   And I thought today after a tougher outing against Detroit, he came here tonight and he was determined to be a player, and I thought he kept the game simple and didn't try to do too much.   
But he used his ability to skate both defensively and offensively and obviously jumping up and joining the big play.   He only gets winning goals, so we'd like to see him get a few more.  
   
 Q.   What was the atmosphere like in there?   People will talk about the fact that the roof was closed, but do you think that affected it at all?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   Well, not from our point of view.   We thought it was a great atmosphere.   The venue was very well put together.   I thought the ice held up.   The only guy saying the ice was bad was the coach because he wanted to not turn over the puck.   I thought the ice held up very well, so it's a good job to Daniel Craig and his staff and to the NHL for putting on a great ‑‑ we were very proud to be a part of it, and obviously when you win a game like this, it's a big thing for our organization and our group, and I think we all really enjoyed it.  
   
 Q.   I'm leery to point this out, but you won an afternoon game?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   Yeah, but it's a three‑hour time change so it started at 4:00 o'clock.   I'm with you.   We did win an afternoon game.  
   
 Q.   You've got the big week coming up, a good win today.   You came back from the deficit and hold the lead in the third.   Can you use this as a springboard?   You're within two points of the playoff spot.   Can you use this now to build the rest of the trip in the last 20‑whatever games you have?   
PAUL MacLEAN:   Well, we have to keep winning.   If you want to get in, you have to win.   We have to get ready for the next game.   We really enjoyed this one, as much as we didn't like this one at home.   We have to turn around tomorrow and go to Edmonton and get ready to play another difficult opponent.   We go day‑by‑day, game‑by‑game.   We still think we're going to like where we are after 82 games.
