Q. It was an aggressive first period of play; more so than Game 1?

DERIAN HATCHER: Yeah, I'd say so. I think both teams in Game 1 were laying off a little
bit feeling each other out. But tonight we came right after one another.

Q. What about the speeds of their team looks like they were pressing you in the
offensive zone?

DERIAN HATCHER: Well, they are a quick team, but we played quick teams before. If we
stick with our system we should be all right.

Q. Their goalie wanders a great deal. I mean, you drew a penalty because of that;
Skrudland did. But is that something you can't allow?

DERIAN HATCHER: Well, I mean he wanders so much guys are trying to get the puck and
stuff, I didn't even see the penalty, but it is tough for the guys for get to out of the
way all the time. I know for a fact Dominik is one one to take the odd dive here and
there, but like I said, I didn't see it all. 


RHETT WARRENER: I thought we came out pretty strong in the second. We got a good start;
got one on. Took a couple of penalties and I think that gave them a bit of a lift back and
they got one late. We are just going to go in regroup and come out in the third.

Q. Physical game is that to your liking?

RHETT WARRENER: I think so. I think that is our style of game. I think they are an
older team and if we can get in on them and get some hits, maybe slow them down a little
bit more, and tire them out, it would be to our advantage.
