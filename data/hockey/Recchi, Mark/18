MARK RECCHI:  Slow out of the gates.  We didn't want to get down like that, but we bounced right back.  You know, guys on the bench, you could sense they wanted to get going.  You know, we did.  We ended up coming back and winning.  You know, it was nice.


Q.  Did you talk at all between periods about playing harder?

MARK RECCHI:  Coming up to the third period, we just wanted to make sure we got the win.  We had 20 minutes to get the win.  You know, we wanted to step it up a notch, you know, make sure that we the win for North America.


Q.  (Inaudible)

MARK RECCHI:  I think the guys always do in the late period.  No matter who you are, you want to win a hockey game.  You don't like to lose.  I think the guys really wanted to win this one.
