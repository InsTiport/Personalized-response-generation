Q.  Talk about their speed.
 
CHRIS THERIEN:  We got a fast team as well.  We came out.  We got going too.  I think they are a definitely quick team and -- but we are a fast team too. 
 

Q.  How about the odd-man rushes that they seem to be getting?  What is happening in the neutral zone to give them that opportunity?
 
CHRIS THERIEN:  They are getting just some stuff in the neutral zone.  Just got to keep either the defensemen back or the third forward high.  So, that is a must, you know, we have been doing that all year and it is just -- it is too important a time to be giving them 2 on 1s or 3 on 2s or any odd-man rush.  We have got to adjust to it. 
 

Q.  Talk about your play
 
CHRIS THERIEN:  We played a lot better tonight.  Came out we had some good energy there, getting the puck deep.  Just a couple of bad breaks.  The puck went in the net for them.  We have just got to go into Game 3.  We have got to come out and win this game. 
 

Q.  (INAUDIBLE)
 
CHRIS THERIEN:  Obviously, we have got to keep our heads up and the next game is Game 3 in Detroit, so we have got to go out and play a real good road game. 
 

Q.  How tough is it to come back now?
 
CHRIS THERIEN:  Well, we have been battling in the Playoffs, it is focusing on getting the third goal back, made some good saves, but we have been resilient; got through the Playoffs.
