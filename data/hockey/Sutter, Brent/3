  Q. Want to ask you, with all you've seen in your career, great teams you've played on on the Island and now coming here, where does Marty stack up for guys you've coached, played against, how do you put his career in perspective?  
 COACH SUTTER: Well, I think it's simple. I think a record like this speaks for itself. He's got the most wins of all time by any goaltender that's ever played the game. So it speaks for itself.   
 I have played on some very, very good hockey teams that have won Stanley Cups and just some real good teams. As far as goaltender is concerned being around Marty for the last year and three-quarters, whatever it's been, you can understand why he's accomplished what he's accomplished.   
 And also understand why the organization's accomplished what they've accomplished here as far as success. It goes hand in hand. You need great goaltending to have success. You need very good teams to play on to have success.  
  
  Q. What is it like to be a part of this night?  
 COACH SUTTER: Well, it's special, obviously. There's so much emotion in the building again tonight, this obviously being a home game and having the tremendous support that the fans give this hockey team and to see the way it was here tonight, and obviously everyone was aware of what was going on. And as the game was winding down, it was last minute, over a minute, seemed like it took forever.   
 But it's a special night. There's no question about it. And to be part of it is pretty neat.   
  
  Q. (Off microphone)  
 COACH SUTTER: I don't want to get into comparing goaltenders both very good goaltenders in their own right.
