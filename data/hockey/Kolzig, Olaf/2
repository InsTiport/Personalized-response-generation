Q.  First of all, I want to ask you about the atmosphere at practice today.  Here it is you guys are down 0-3 getting ready to play in Game 4 and you guys are having a ball out there.  What does that say about the way this team prepares and how loose you guys are right now?

OLAF KOLZIG:  We haven't changed anything. You know, it's been the key to our success all playoffs long and we seem to be relaxed at pressure sometimes and this is definitely a pressure time and you can only play your best when you're relaxed and having fun.  If we were up tight right now, we would be getting on everybody's nerves and guys would be snapping at everybody and that's definitely not the right attitude you want to have going into maybe the last game of the year.  I mean, there's a -- this is a desperation time for us and we've got to go in there with an open mind and play some good hockey.  It would be one thing if we got blown out every game.  It would be a totally different story.  But we feel we could easily be up in this series and it was for some circumstances, bad goal, unlucky call here, unlucky call there.
