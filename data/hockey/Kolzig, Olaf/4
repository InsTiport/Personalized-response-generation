OLAF KOLZIG:  I thought we played a great second period.  We forgot to do what we did in the second period in the third period.  They were getting a little bit too much respect in the third period and they were able to put a couple by us.


Q.  To be up 4-2 late in third period, is that demoralizing?

OLAF KOLZIG:  Obviously, it is tough.  Even going into overtime we were so confident, a game like that, same thing happened to us, Game 2 against Buffalo, we got refocused, went out, and won the game.  But, I think they came out hard in the overtime and created the chances and they were hungry for the win.  We have got to think about it.  Think about the mistakes we made again and get it out of our system tonight.  Get back to work tomorrow and get out there at home.  I have no idea who scored the winning goal; Draper?  I had no idea where he was coming.  I think our defensemen tried to clear the puck, hit the ref or the linesman, stayed down and at that point made the past right across and I tried to make the splits coming across and just couldn't get there.  We have been in this situation before.  We have the lead in the third period and teams really pressed us and we were able to battle through it. But, I mean, give them credit, they have got a lot of offense over there and they came at us hard in the third period and like I said, we have got to respect their ability, but not respect them.  Like I said, we gave them a little bit too much respect tonight.
