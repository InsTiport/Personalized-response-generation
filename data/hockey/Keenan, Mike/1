   DAVID KEON: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm David Keon of the National Hockey League's public relations department, and I'd like to welcome you to today's call. Our first guest is Calgary Flames' head coach Mike Keenan. Thanks to Mike for taking the time today to answer your questions, and thanks to Peter Hanlon of the Flames' public relations staff for arranging the call. 
 As we approach the trade deadline of 3:00 p.m. eastern next Wednesday, March 4th, Mike will be entering his 18th trade in the NHL as a head coach or GM. His Calgary Flames have posted a record of 35-18-6 for 76 points, good for first place in the Northwest Division and the third seed in the Western Conference. Earlier this month, Mike recorded his 658th career win at Los Angeles, which vaulted him past Pat Quinn to fourth place on the all-time coaching wins list. 
 Thanks again to Mike for taking the time today to join us and answer your questions. We'll open it up now.
