Q. Kirk Muller nearly scored a goal in four consecutive Stanley Cup Final games. It hit
the post. Tell me about that second period. How do you guys get some more offense, more
shots on goal in the third?

KIRK MULLER: We got to keep penetrating, getting it in deep. We have got to keep
moving, moving the puck. They are a good team. They play well defensively. They come at
you us as well. We are on the road here; we have got to stay patient. They want teams to
open up. We can't do that. So we have got to have confidence in our game plan.
