Q.  Are you looking forward to playing this year or?

TIM GLEASON: Oh, definitely this year.  I think I'm ready.  I'm fully ready and I think I'm just lacking experience and I'm very excited about it. 


Q.  With your teammate obviously?

TIM GLEASON: Yeah.  That's very exciting just to know someone, that's kind of nice and I'm very lucky for that and Jason is a very good player and we'll see what happens. 


Q.  Were you expecting to get picked by the Senators; they gave up three draft picks?

TIM GLEASON: I wasn't sure.


Q.  Does that flatter you?

TIM GLEASON: Oh, for sure.  Just being picked for the NHL Draft is an honor and I'm very excited about what we might do and see what happens.
