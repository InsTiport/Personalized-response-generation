  Hurricanes - 4

 Q. Talk about the way they were tonight? How much tougher is Pittsburgh to beat when Sid and Geno are playing the way they were tonight? 
 TIM GLEASON: Well, I think every time they scored, they had momentum. We came back two or three times to tie it up. They kept going and going with that momentum. 
 So I think it has to do with the building. It's a small building, and they grabbed all the motivation they could get and they ran with it. 
 It's our opportunity now. We have home ice now, and we've got to win those games.
 DENNIS SEIDENBERG: I thought I would just let Timmy go. He would have a better angle on the other side. That's the only thing I could do. It was a great shot. 

 Q. When those two, Sid and Geno are playing the way they are, how tough is this Pittsburgh team to stop? 
 DENNIS SEIDENBERG: It's all about our game. If we don't give them time and space, we're fine. In the first game we don't get too many chances. But today we gave them too many little things and too many openings to create stuff. 

 Q. You took the lead going into the first, and you guys scored. It seems like all the things usually that happens when you guys win this game, it happens. Did you have that feeling on the bench? 
 DENNIS SEIDENBERG: We did. I mean, we like tight games. We don't have a problem playing those tight games. But again, today, we had too many breakdowns. Defensively, we just didn't play tight enough, and that was the reason.

 Q. Malkin is just a handful today? 
 PATRICK EAVES: Yeah, he played well. I like the way we responded to the goals early on. You know, I thought we played pretty well. But there's room for improvement. 
 We'll regroup and play back at home.

 Q. Can you turn this thing around? 
 PATRICK EAVES: Yeah. We've just got to get back to playing our game. Simple, quick and fast. And I think we'll be all right. So, yeah. Just like I said, we'll be good when we get back home. 

 Q. Did you feel like everything was turning in your favor here? 
 PATRICK EAVES: Obviously. I mean, we're comfortable in games that are tight. We've been playing this for five months now, tight games. 
 Yeah, when we tied it up, we felt we got some good things going there. Then they got two quick ones. That's just the way it goes, but it's over and done with.
