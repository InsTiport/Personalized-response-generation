 Q.  What are you feeling? 
 DOUG WEIGHT:  Guys in there, and the organization has a tremendous belief in each other and the sacrifice we had for each other. 
 It's a wonderful place.  I knew we were going going to have a great game, playing a great team in Edmonton.  It was a great hockey game. 

 Q.  Led the team in scoring for 7.  Would you have picked Edmonton? 
 DOUG WEIGHT:  I want success for them.  It's a hard question.  It's awful tough for me to go back there and playing against the guys that I know.
