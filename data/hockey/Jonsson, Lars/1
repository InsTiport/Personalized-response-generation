 Q. Lars, did you expect to go to Boston? How do you feel about it?
 
 LARS JONSSON: I spoke to them -- I didn't expect to go so high. It feels good. 
 
Q. Where did you expect to go? Did you expect to go first round? It's surprising to us
as well.
 
 LARS JONSSON: I was expecting to go first round, but late first round. This was way
higher. 
 
Q. How do you feel now that you've been drafted?
 
 LARS JONSSON: I have to say it's one of the biggest and proudest moments of my whole
career. It's a big moment for me.
