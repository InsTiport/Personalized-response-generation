Q. Vinny, looked like it wasn't your night tonight. 
VINNY PROSPAL: Well, I mean, after really sitting here after such a game, such a score, but the first ten minutes didn't look that bad. I believe we were ready to play. But after the first goal, it almost seems like we stopped playing and started making bad plays, and they filled our net. 

Q. Vinny, when you look at how Sidney Crosby, Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron line clicked, is there a way to defend them or maybe what you saw from that trio tonight and why they're so hard to contain? 
VINNY PROSPAL: Well, I wasn't really going to comment on the players on the other team. That's not my job. But obviously you look at the score sheet, and the first three goals come from that line, so they must have done something really good. 
But on the other hand, we should worry about what our players did that led to these three goals in the first period. Okay, the first one goes in, back‑door play from behind the goal line, but second one we lose the face‑off in the D zone, gets to the point, quick shot, tipped. And third goal is just a bad turnover with half a second left. It's a tough way to finish the period. 

Q. After a loss this lopsided, what do you tell your troops? What kind of positives, if any, can you take away and what do you say to them?
VINNY PROSPAL: Well, I mean, the tournament is just starting. Sure, it's the first game, it's 6‑0, it's obviously not ideal. But hopefully the sun will come up tomorrow, and we'll get to have a practice. We'll get ready for our next game, which is going to be really, really important, and we just have to regroup. I mean, there's really no rocket science in that. We just have to show up and practice the right way and get ready for the next game. 
The best thing is we don't have to sit here for three or four days. We get to play in a couple days, and I believe we play the early game. We just hop on the ice, and we're going to be ready to compete because I believe Team Europe, they came up with a huge win today.
