THE MODERATOR: We are joined by assistant coach Vinny Prospal. 
Questions. 

Q. What went with the decision to start Mrazek in this game? Seemed like he had a pretty wild game between the glove save, the penalty shot and the breakaways. How do you evaluate his performance? 
VINNY PROSPAL: I thought he was really good. He gave us a chance to win. 
Why we went with him is because he didn't ‑‑ it's not like Neuvirth played bad for us in the first game. He was by far our best player in the first game. Just felt had a hunch that Petr could give us the opportunity to win this game, and that's what we did. 

Q. Did you feel like you played more like you wanted to tonight as far as your structure and things like that?
VINNY PROSPAL: At times, yes. I believe we had a lot more to give, especially the first half of the game. You know, if you look at the game as a whole, I think our best shift was right after they scored their first goal. A little bit disappointed in that first half. 
Afterwards, you know, we were always behind the eight ball. That's not what we wanted. 

Q. You guys have given up a lot of shots this tournament. Why do you think you guys are kind of giving up that many shots? Not obviously a lot of time to correct it. How can you get better at that and why do you think it's happening?
VINNY PROSPAL: Obviously you play against good teams, right? I mean, you play against high‑skill teams that are here to create offense. 
Don't want to sit here and talk bad about our team. You know, that's just the way we played. Obviously would like to keep it a little bit lower. But, you know, again, our goalies gave us a chance to win, and we were in the game today at least. 

Q. I wanted to ask you about the emotion of the game going into overtime. Seems like you had a chance coming back from behind. Now, how is the team feeling, as the tournament is over for you guys?
VINNY PROSPAL: We knew we had to win the game. It's a simple math. You know, all of our players knew that. 
The emotion on the bench was great in the second half of the game. I believe we were starting the overtime to, you know‑‑ we showed up here to play to win. Simple as that. Obviously now the feeling is pretty down in our locker room. 
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.
