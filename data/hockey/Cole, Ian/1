 Q.  Would your assessment be it wasn't that you guys were horrible last night, just execution was a little sluggish?  
IAN COLE: Yeah, I don't think that we were as good as we can be, but I don't think we were terrible.  Like you said, I don't think we were great either.  I think it's somewhere in between there.  I think there's another level we can get to as far as execution goes and getting pucks through.  They block a lot of shots.  So be able to get more chances, I think, will help us.   
 Q.  From a defenseman's standpoint, when you have the puck against these guys, how different is it as opposed to how Washington and Columbus is so aggressive?  Is it almost like a different game?  
IAN COLE: A lot more time, that's for sure.  I don't know about a different game because they do sometimes come hard, too hard every once in a while, if they read that, if they're in.  But it's something that, on a whole, they seem to be a little bit less physical and maybe aggressive as a Columbus or a Washington.  But they're a unique challenge.  They're a different challenge.  Something that we need to adjust to.  I thought we did a good job coming out of our end last night.  But adjust to it for sure.   
 Q.  Is there something that maybe you guys could take from what Ron did on the goal, just kind of dumping and chasing almost, maybe simplifying it even to that point?  
IAN COLE: Yeah, I actually did the same thing a couple times, twice in the second and once in the first.  So, yeah, I think that's -- and they do tend to back up.  There is more space to skate through.  And trying to find that open ice, which usually tends to be behind them.
