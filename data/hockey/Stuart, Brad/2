Q.  Did it take you by surprise?
 
BRAD STUART:  I talked to them quite a bit before the draft more than any other team.  I wasn't totally surprised.  But I can't say that I wasn't at all surprised because I kind of was. 
 

Q.  Have they told you, Brad, if they expect you to play next year?  Have you even gotten to those discussions yet?
 
BRAD STUART:  Hasn't gotten to that yet.  I am sure it will be mostly up to me whether or not I stay, how good of a training camp I have and how well I perform, so I think it will be pretty much up to me unless they are set on sending me back which I am not sure yet. 
 

Q.  (inaudible)
 
BRAD STUART:  There is always the chance.  They wouldn't say that I would stay for sure because they can't really say something like that until they see me in camp.  I am just going to go to camp and see what happens.
