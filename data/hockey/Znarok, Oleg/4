 Q. What did you think of Bobrovsky's performance, and are you ready to name a goalie for tomorrow?   
OLEG ZNAROK: He played well. We'll decide on that. We'll work on that.   
   
 Q. Just curious about your opinion on the final goal that was disallowed, and what did you think? Did you think it was a good call, or did you think it was a legal goal?   
OLEG ZNAROK: I haven't watched the videos yet and the repeats. And I trust the referees, but we will definitely look at it.   
   
 Q. Talk about the second goal; Ovechkin was pretty mad that they did not count that score.   
OLEG ZNAROK: We will look at the video again, and if it is something that we would like to work on, we will let them know if it is true, if it is the case.  
   
 Q. Until late in the game, the Russians didn't generate too many chances; what will they need to do to generate more offense? And do you feel like the team is still searching for its chemistry?   
OLEG ZNAROK: We definitely had all the chances and opportunities. We just haven't had a chance to score. Again, we think there is chemistry in the team. We believe in that, and we see that there is chemistry. We just didn't have enough chances to score.   
   
 Q. What do you think about the defense of the Russian team?   
OLEG ZNAROK: I'm pretty confident in them. We had a couple of mistakes. One of the mistakes was a kill‑off penalty, and during the kill‑off penalty in the second, when the center forward and the wings, left wing were not having the right positions.  
   
 Q. Why do you rely so much on Nikita Zaitsev on the blue line? What does he do for your defense?   
OLEG ZNAROK: You mean on the blue line‑‑ we've got that question already previously. It just happens naturally, and again, that's the defensive coach's decision.   
   
 Q. Talk about the Swedish goalie, Henrik Lundqvist, didn't play this time. Taking that into consideration, did the Russian team and coaches change some strategies?   
OLEG ZNAROK: During the exhibition games, we watched him, and again, our main goal was to score as much as we can and try to shoot as much as we can.
