Q. What did you say to your players after the first period, because you played so well in the second period? 
OLEG ZNAROK: That's between us, among our teammates. 

Q. Did you have any hesitation in going back to Bobrovsky on consecutive days, or did you know all along that you wanted to play him again tonight? 
OLEG ZNAROK: We did not hesitate. We did not hesitate, and we were always sure with Bobrovsky. Again, we trust him. That was the strategy. That was the plan. 

Q. Coach, how did you feel about Kuznetsov's performance and the emotional lift that he might have given the team? 
OLEG ZNAROK: We actually got two emotional pairs today, and one of them is Markov‑Anisimov, and we tried to keep them down and keep them cool, and everything worked out finally. 

Q. Your next game is against Finland. Russia has had some difficult games against Finland in the last years, so how do you stop the Finnish team now? 
OLEG ZNAROK: We are getting ready for this game. It's a very important match for us. 

Q. In the third period, did you think you sat back too much or was that them taking the game to you and what they were doing that was giving you trouble? 
OLEG ZNAROK: We definitely told the guys to play the attacking line more, but a little bit we haven't had that much success on that. 

Q. How much of a lift did Namestnikov's goal in that second period give you guys, and what's your impression of him as a player? 
OLEG ZNAROK: Yeah, he scored at the right time, definitely. That was the right time to score and the right time for the game.
