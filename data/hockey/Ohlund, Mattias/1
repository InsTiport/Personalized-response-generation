Q.  Mattias Ohlund of the Vancouver Canucks playing in his first All-Star Game. First let's get your reaction to the hiring of a new coach and what it means to the club?
 
MATTIAS OHLUND:  Well, first of all, it's kind of depressing, but I think the guys did what they think is best for the team. And as a player you can't be too concerned with who's coaching, just go out there every game and do your best. 
 

Q.  How about your first All-Star Game and the experience it's afforded you so far?
 
MATTIAS OHLUND:  It's a great experience. So many great players, so many big names. It's just a big honor to be here and hopefully this is not my last All-Star game. I'm really happy to be here and I'm enjoying it. 
 

Q.  Congratulations on your appearance. Good luck the rest of the way?
 
MATTIAS OHLUND:   Thank you.
