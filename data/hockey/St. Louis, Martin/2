 Q.   How is it being back here during the playoffs vs the regular season?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: Yeah, coming back here regular season, it was definitely a tough thing, I think, just being here for so long, but I think we're well past that now. You know, I mean, Tampa's always going to be a special place for me and my family, but I'm coming here as a New York Ranger and trying to get through this Conference Final and get to the Stanley Cup Final.  
   
 Q.   What Â’s the most important thing going into the next game?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: I think, you know, first period is a big period. You're trying to get through the first shift, get in the battle, you know, you talk about you need a good start. We need a good start, and we've got to play disciplined, and that's what we're looking to do.  
   
 Q.   How do you get more goals and increase scoring?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: We always want to score more as a team, but there are probably a lot of teams that would trade places right now with where we are. It's about winning games. We've found a way to win games and be in position where we're three wins away from the Stanley Cup Final.  Do we want to score more goals? Absolutely. We're playing good teams. It's easier said than done, but we've got to find a way. There is no doubt we've got to score more goals.  
   
 Q.   Do you guys feel confident if you play five-on-five, you have more control?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: Yeah, I definitely like our game five-on-five, there is no doubt. You know, I don't think it's a team that you're going to trade chances. I don't think there is any team you want to go trade chances.  Our focus is five-on-five, and as important as special teams are, we've got to do the job on them. But five-on-five game is one of the strongest parts of our game. We'd like to stay out of the box, and like to capitalize when we get power plays. You want to get perfection, but that's not going to happen. You've got to fight through the game. You've got to kill the penalties when you get them. You've got to utilize your power play when you have them. It's tough to play a perfect game.  
   
 Q.   Is it unique being in a position where the guys on the other side talk so highly of you and how you helped mold them?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: You know, it's probably the only time that I say I have a lot of friends on the other side. I've never really had that before. And I guess you accumulate friends when you're somewhere for so long, and it's not just the players. Yeah, that is unique, but when the puck drops, people play hockey. I don't think that I have some friends on the other side; I'm trying to help my team win.  
   
 Q.   With a game like last night what do you? Do you forget it?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: You correct your mistake and you move on. You talk about your mistake, you address the issues that need to be addressed, but you move on and go play. You can't dwell on the negative. You have to just get ready for the next one, and that's what we're looking to do.  
   
 Q.   How do you stay positive through the frustration?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS: I mean, you're one goal, one bounce, one shot from feeling good about yourself, I guess. I know as a player, when you have the swagger, any offensive guys, any guys that put up good numbers in this league, they've done it at a time when they've got a lot of swagger. So when you score goals, yeah, you have a lot of swagger, and that really helps your game. It helps your teammates around you. So I'm trying every game to go get that swagger. Not just individually, but as a team, you've got to play with swagger.
