 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   No, I mean, we know, I think in general, what works, what doesn't, what gets us in trouble, what doesn't get us in trouble.   As the series goes you try to work your way through that.   But every game is a new game.   The stuff that might work in Game 3 might not work in Game 4, and it comes down to making good reads sometimes and look sharper at other times in games.   Depending on how you're reading the rush or reading the play.   Do you pull back or do you jump in a lot.   You really have to be aware of everything that's going on the ice and making the best move you can.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   Yeah, I mean, yeah.   Yeah, I mean, if you want to score the game.   You're trying to help your team win no matter what.   Of course, when you score, you definitely gain confidence from it and you're I'm hoping that I can play with a lot more confidence from that.   But at the end of the day you're trying to win games.   Some games are just opportunities for you to score, some games there isn't.   You're trying to make the best of it when there is.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   I mean, when you go a long stretch and you lose that confidence a little bit, yeah, I mean, the game is not as clear, especially when you have the puck, you're pressing.   But the one place it can't affect it is away from the puck.   Mentally that can't affect your game.   But there is no doubt it does affect your game.   You go a long time on the offensive side with us making plays or shooting the puck.   You know the pressing part comes in, and that's clear, for sure.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   Yeah, I mean, I felt yesterday, yeah, we did play with some swagger, and you want to keep that.   I think swagger comes and goes.   As a player, as a team, it does, and you have to fight to get it back when you don't have it.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   Yeah.   Yeah, I mean, power play is about five guys doing what they're supposed to do, and sometimes it's just feeding off one another, and we're doing a really good job of that.   Sometimes it's winning more face‑offs or you're very efficient where you don't have to go back all the time and waste some energy and puck retrieval.   There are so many things that come into play for a good power play.   
The five guys on the ice are very important, and they all have a role to play.   We're all interchangeable sometimes.   Sometimes we're not in the right spot or the spot that you're supposed to be, but we feed off one another, and we're doing a good job of that.   At the end of the day, it's getting pucks towards the net, and getting second and third opportunities.  
   
 Q.   (No Audio)?  
MARTIN ST. LOUIS:   Yeah, I mean, I know we scored ten goals in the last two games.   Like I said yesterday, we're 1‑1.   It's not just about scoring goals.   It's playing the game.   I think we've done a good job having a good pulse on how we're actually playing.   Whether it was scoring goals or not scoring goals, and I think that helped us this year get to where we are.   Really have an honest opinion of how we're actually playing.
