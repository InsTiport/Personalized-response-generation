   JAMEY HORAN:  Questions for Coach Babcock. 

 Q.  Did you feel like Anaheim kind of weathered your best shots there in the second and third periods? 
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Well, you know, I thought it was one of those games, I thought we did a lot of good things, but I thought we shot ourselves in the foot a little bit.  We had a turnover for the first goal.  We had too many men on the ice.  Not even like in a pressure situation.  Cost us a goal. 
 We had a good five-on-three in the first period.  We had a real good opportunity, Giguere was outstanding.  But I thought - I think it was the first period.  The one in the third period, I don't think we did much with.  They got a power play goal right away.  To me, we had our opportunity.  They didn't make good on it.  They good on theirs.  They had a couple seeing-eye pucks tonight.  Found their way in. 

 Q.  How did you think Anaheim responded without Pronger out there?  Was it a gutsy effort by them? 
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Sure, sure.  Any time you miss players, you got to play. 
 But, you know, I said this yesterday, and I said it again this morning:  you know the team's going to play.  You're not playing against Chris Pronger, you're playing against the Ducks.  Just like when we lost our people, significant people for us, you just keep playing.  That's what you do.  That's what good teams do.  So there's no surprise in that. 
 JAMEY HORAN:  Thanks, Coach. 
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Thanks.
