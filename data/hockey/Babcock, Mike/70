   JAMEY HORAN:  Questions for Coach Babcock.   
  
  Q.  You scored a lot on special teams, but they were better at even strength.  Was this a bit tighter game than the last one even?   
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Well, it was probably a more even game.  I thought they were better than us at the start of the game.  I thought we got playing and it was pretty even.   
 I still thought five-on-five they spent more time below the hash marks in our zone than we spent in their zone.   
  
  Q.  If you can just talk about how dispiriting it is to get goals scored on you video reviews like that?   
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Well, we know before you do usually (smiling).  You know, it wasn't any surprise.  Dom told us it was in on the first one.  The second one, we thought it wasn't 'cause we thought our goalie got pushed in.  But that's the beauty of the video replay, is they get to be right.   
  
  Q.  Is that one of the things that makes Anaheim dangerous, you got to keep an eye on Niedermayer?   
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Yeah, I mean, there's no question that Niedermayer's, you know, all over the ice.  He's kind of like a rover.  He's a real good skater.  That makes him, you know, dangerous from the back end.   
 Beauchemin and Pronger can really shoot it.   
 JAMEY HORAN:  Thanks, Coach.   
 COACH MIKE BABCOCK:  Travel safe.
