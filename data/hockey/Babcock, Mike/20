 GARY MEAGHER: Questions for Coach Babcock.   
  
  Q. You had a couple of chances tonight that didn't go in. Was that the difference in your game, the Zetterberg post?   
 COACH BABCOCK: Those things happen. I thought they were better than us, though, at the start of the game, probably, for the first almost 32 minutes. They won more races and more battles, had more play, were on top of us more, and they kept us to the outside. I thought we started to build some momentum at the end of the second period, and then obviously we had a good third period.   
  
  Q. Was it your intention going in to play Zetterberg and Datsyuk together a bit more than you had?   
 COACH BABCOCK: You mean, I played them together all night. What do you mean?   
  
  Q. No, than the previous game?   
 COACH BABCOCK: No, my intention was to do kind of just what I did. The previous game we had played them together. We played them together again tonight. I asked Pav a number of times during the game how he was doing. And just to check on him. I didn't think their minutes got up early. Every time in this building our minutes and their minutes haven't added up.   
 But tonight, they were close. We were at 7 minutes after the first period. And I thought that was real important for our team not to have our guys too high, too early.   
  
  Q. Talk about Chris Osgood and what he meant to your team tonight. And a little about his mental make-up. What allows him to be that good in these big games?   
 COACH BABCOCK: I thought he was real good early. He had to be. In the end, probably Fleury ends up being a bit of a story for them with the way it went in the third period. But both goaltenders gave their team a chance.   
 We went into the third period tonight, we were down 1-0, and you're set up pretty nice for on the road for Game 6. In large part because of your goaltending, just because like I said, I thought they were quicker to pucks and that in the first 30 minutes of the game.
