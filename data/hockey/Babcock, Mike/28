Pittsburgh  Â– 4

 Q. Bruce Orpik said that Zetterberg looked tired chasing Crosby around. Can you just speak to that a little bit. And is there something to change up in Game 5 against that match-up? 
 COACH BABCOCK: We didn't change against Crosby. They had last change. We didn't try to get it one time. I wouldn't say that was the case. They tried to play Crosby more against Filppula. But I didn't think Z and the Mule had as much jump tonight: Actually I didn't mind our team until we gave up the shorthanded goal, and they had a little more energy than us. We had a little push in the third, but not much. 

 Q. Can you talk coming in about your concern in four or six nights or the back-to-backs to start the series. The defense turned the puck over a lot tonight. A lot. I'm just wondering if you think that fact showed itself tonight?
 COACH BABCOCK: Really did. Well, we turned the puck over a lot. I thought they were on us right away early. And I thought we weathered that. We came back, we're up 2-1, and we're playing really well. I thought our power play, we talked about our penalty kill. I thought our power play sucked the life out of us tonight. 
 The shorthanded goal, and nothing happened on it. And they got energy, and they were on top of us. Then we turned the puck over, I would say in the next five minutes. I mean, enough for a whole game, and two of them really critical. Obviously, that ended up costing us. So, you know, sometimes we can read too much into the energy level just because when one team gets going, they usually have more energy than the other team. And I thought that's what happened. Tonight they had more energy than us. I thought our guys with the most energy was Helm. Helm's line was their best line.

 Q. Mike, that shorthanded goal, do you have any concerns about that's the type of goal that could change the complexion of the series or swing the momentum in their direction? 
 COACH BABCOCK: Well, I always have a concern any goal can swing the momentum. You never know what shift or what play or anything can turn the momentum one way or the other in your favor. Obviously, we had the game going pretty good. The crowd was pretty quiet. We were playing all right. Then our power plays, like I said, hurt us for sure, and sucked the life out of us. 

 Q. Did you notice any lack of composure on your team when the tide turned and you got down a goal or two? And I'm talking, there is some suggestion in the Pen's room that they heard some of your guys chirping at each other, and the composure wasn't there that that they normally see?
 COACH BABCOCK: I don't know that anybody was chirping at each other, but I don't think we were have I composed. I don't think anyone would argue that whatsoever. I thought they were on top of us. We were turning pucks over, and helping them. 

 Q. How did the decision on Datsyuk get made? Was it made long before game time? 
 COACH BABCOCK: Well, I got a text from Pete. I texted Pete about 3:00 o'clock, he's our athletic therapist, and to see what the scoop was. And he just told me at that time he didn't think Pav would be going. He's still went for warm-up though. Pavel was pushing it to try to go. But Pete gave me the head's up. 

 Q. Does the Anaheim series, is that a good measuring stick now? They were the one team that pushed you the most so far in these playoffs and you were 2-2 with them. Is there some lessons there? 
 COACH BABCOCK: We've been 2-2 over the years here quite a bit. Whether it be with Calgary, Nashville, whether it be in the Anaheim series. You know, everyone talks about momentum, but I'm a big believer that momentum is, you know, as good as the next day start kind of thing. Just get out there and get playing again and go from there. 
 We need to get rested. We skated yesterday, because that's what we wanted to do. We thought it was a good idea to flush. We're obviously not doing that tomorrow because it didn't work. And that's how scientific that decision is being made. And then we'll get back to getting prepared for the next game. And obviously, just like tonight's game was huge, the next game's absolutely huge for us.
