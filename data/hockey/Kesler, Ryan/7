   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Ryan Kesler. 

 Q. How does this compare with the gold medal final in terms of what you've talked about, this process, 82 games, and how this is a different stage? Can you compare them? 
 RYAN KESLER: It's tough, you know, we played 82 games before we got in the playoffs, the Olympics were two weeks and it seemed to go by in the blink of an eye. The game itself, you know, has some similarities, but it's tough to compare the two. 

 Q. Can you enjoy the moment? They were talking about trying to enjoy the day, but obviously you're nervous, but just soaking it in? 
 RYAN KESLER: It's all about enjoying the day. Every day you don't wake up playin' for the Cup, Game 7. You know, it's awesome.
