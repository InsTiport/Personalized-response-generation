 Q. I just wonder about your feeling about going to Ottawa, to the Senators. Do you know
much about the Senators? 
 
 INTERPRETER: He's very happy. He knows the team. He saw some games during the playoffs,
even in Czech Republic. He knows players just from the TV. He's very happy.  
 
Q. I just want to know what type of player you are? What is your style, your makeup? 
 
 INTERPRETER: Well, he likes to score goals. Fortunately, he's a good skater. He can
move puck very well. He would like to play full team. 
 
Q. When do you anticipate playing in Ottawa, next year or the year after?
 
 INTERPRETER: He thinks probably a year later.
