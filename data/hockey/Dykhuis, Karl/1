KARL DYKHUIS:  I mean, we've given them a couple of turnovers tonight and that is costly at the blue lines.  We have got to get the puck deep and use our size and speed to get the fore-check going.  Tonight we turned the puck over too much.


Q.  Is that the difference.  The turnovers?

KARL DYKHUIS:  Well, it is certainly a big difference.  You don't give those.  You don't give those odd-man rushes.  We might win those games.


Q.  How does tonight's game feel compared to Game 1?

KARL DYKHUIS:  I didn't play Game 1.  But they come on strong and I think we are ready.  We played better than the first game, but still not good enough.  We are going to have to do a few changes, work on their game plan a little more, just execute better.  We have a great game plan, just need to execute better.  Again, keep the puck deep, and use our size to fore-check and avoid those turnovers.


Q.  Talk about the easy goals.

KARL DYKHUIS:  At this point of the year you want to do -- what you want to do is give up really hard goals.  You don't want to give up the easy goals.  That is hard on the team and it makes it too easy for them.  We definitely have to stop that.
