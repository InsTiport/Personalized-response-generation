Q.  Were you still wondering while you were waiting?

RYAN SUTER: I was still wondering.  I was kind of getting anxious, I guess, being all those guys were up there.  I was definitely wondering (laughs). 

Q.  What was it like for you to get that hometown reaction?

RYAN SUTER: I was something I haven't experienced yet and just  -- it was awesome.  It was great. 

Q.  You have had a chance to spend this whole week in the town that could be your next home what do you think of it?

RYAN SUTER: It's a neat town.  Big town but a small town.  Everyone is great, great people and just treated everyone with respect, I guess. 

Q.  You are going to school in the fall.  You got drafted in the summer.  How do you get ready for  two big steps in your life?

RYAN SUTER: I don't know.  I have been working out with the team in Wisconsin there and starting to get in with the team, the players there, I guess, working with them and hanging out with them and stuff.  It shouldn't be that big of a thing, I don't think. 

Q.  Do you think there's any more pressure on you because of your last name and family connection to the League?

RYAN SUTER: Everyone seems to think so, but I don't at all.  I am just going out there having fun and they don't put any pressure on me at all.

Q.  Reading your bio here it says the strongest center with a mean streak.  What does that mean?

RYAN SUTER: I am a competitor.  I like to battle and if I need to be mean, I will try it.
