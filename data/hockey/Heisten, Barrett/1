 Q. Been quite a year for you, NCAA title, now this. Your thoughts on it.
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: It's been a great learning experience for me to win -- first year to
win a national championship. I hope to come back next year and repeat.  
 
Q. Plan on going back to Maine?
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: Yes, I am.  
 
Q. Can you just describe your game a little bit. It's been described as a banger and a
crasher. Can you talk about your game a little bit?
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: I play both ends of the ice. I like to play offense as well as
defense. I like to muck it up in the corners, play in front of the net. If I don't hit,
I'm not really playing my game. 
 
Q. Can you elaborate on your offensive game? After Christmas, you sort of picked up a
bit.
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: It was a confidence thing. I wasn't scoring, I was digging myself into
a hole, getting mad at myself. When I finally scored in the World Juniors, all my
confidence came back and I was on a roll. 
 
Q. Your feelings about going at No. 20, going to Buffalo, that organization?
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: I was surprised. I was just sitting there waiting. University of
Maine, "Oh, my God." It's a great organization. I'm glad to be here.  
 
Q. Definitely going back to school?
 
 BARRETT HEISTEN: Yeah.
