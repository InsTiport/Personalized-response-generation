Q. Mike, you hadn't lost a game in the Playoffs with a lead going into the third. How
shocking was what happened tonight and why do you think it happened?

MIKE MODANO: We really don't know really happened. I think we felt like we played a
great 40 minutes; put ourselves in a great position to win the game. Again I think it is
things that we are doing that are hurting ourselves in the end. Our decisions with and
without the puck, you know, getting caught on the odd pinches here and there; allowing too
many outnumbered situations, obviously that shorthander was a real breaker, but just
missing checks here and there -- and just little things that have eventually ended up in
our net. It is unfortunate that we all felt that we played a great 40 minutes to let it
slip by.

Q. You guys have been down before and bounced back pretty easily. How much tougher is
it now with the extra day off and also facing elimination for the next two days?

MIKE MODANO: Take the extra and kind of take a step back and relax; get rejuvenated.
Mentally, physically kind of get geared up for hopefully a real hard push Thursday night
in Jersey. Now our backs up against the wall again. We have usually responded in the past.
It is possible, it's been done before and now it is just more or less focus our
concentration on Thursday.
