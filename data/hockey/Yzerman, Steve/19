STEVE YZERMAN:  I think we feel comfortable -- I know -- it is a tight game.  They scored.  We don't overreact and we are able to stay focused and comfortable and not really fall apart.  Then I think guys -- we have got a few guys that are able to make some really good individual efforts, as you saw in Sergei's goal.  We are able to be -- able to remain composed in difficult situations. 
 

Q.  You set an early tone in the game with that rush toward the net.
 
STEVE YZERMAN:  I just got a step on Tikkanen, I think and was able to -- as I cut the net -- we really got lucky because the puck, I think Kolzig, as he was getting up, he kind of -- it went off his foot and just laid there and open net for Holmer.  But obviously was a good start, but it was just not much of a play; just kind of got a step on the guy and tried go to the net. 
 

Q.  Can you sort of break it down, early is one thing for scoring, but 35 seconds.  What are the benefits?
 
STEVE YZERMAN:  For the most part we got to have a good start of the game.  It really didn't so much take the crowd out of it, but we had a good start.  Unfortunately we couldn't follow that up with a second goal.  But it got us, you know, we were able to kind of get rolling.  We played a pretty solid first period and just helped, you get off to a good start and you feel good about things.
