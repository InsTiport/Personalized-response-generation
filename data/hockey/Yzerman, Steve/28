Q.  Steve, you talked with Mike Vernon.  There was a lot of confusion towards the end of the period.  What was going on there?
 
STEVE YZERMAN:  That is a good question.  I really don't know what he was screaming about.  I think he was just trying to get a bit of a delay, create more confusion than necessary. 
 

Q.  Power play has been a problem for you guys.  You score the power play goal, put you up 2 nothing.  What happened after that?
 
STEVE YZERMAN:  Well, nothing really.  We got a couple of penalties.  Pretty decent calls, I guess.  I thought there could have been a call or two the other way before the second one, but, nonetheless, they got a good power play and big guys that stand from in front of the net.  We have got to do a better job at killing the penalties obviously.  Both goals are very similar, just great shots at the net and deflections, got to limit the power plays against and kills the one we do get. 
 

Q.Dramatic shift of momentum, did you just feel something click in?
 
JOHN LECLAIR:  Well, we knew we had some chances in the power play.  We just get it to the net.  It definitely helped us out, getting those two goals late, we started in a little hole.  We are right back in it.  We feel good about ourselves. 
 

Q.  Are you doing anything different that is working in this series right now?
 
JOHN LECLAIR:  I think the big thing right now we are getting the puck to the net and we are getting a little bit of a better job on getting on their "D" right now on the fore-check.
