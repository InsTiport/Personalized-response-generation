Q.  (Inaudible) in the Vancouver series, how do you approach this game?
 
STEVE YZERMAN: The same way, the same way.  You know, these two games are very important, and we come in here looking to worry about Game 4 when it comes, but we would like to worry about Game 3 and start well in the game.  The idea of coming in and playing very well right off the bat and getting into the game quickly, and getting the first goal isn't necessarily a very big deal.  But playing well early is.  And we would like to do that.  Looking forward to doing that.
