Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
STEVE YZERMAN: Before there was any score, we had more power plays.  I don't know how many minutes we had on the power plays.  But we got one goal anyways, and it's a much different game.   
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
STEVE YZERMAN: The first two periods we played really well.  You know, they scored right off the bat in the third, and that really energized them and they started to carry the play from then on.  But, in general, I thought we played a good game. 
 
Q.  Would it be fair to say Patrick kept them in the game early?
 
STEVE YZERMAN: He made some good saves.  I don't know that we dominated that much to say the goalie held them in, but he did make some good saves.  But the ineffectiveness of our power play is what really hurt us.
