 KIRK MALTBY: Yeah, it's all the same. Obviously, we've been on the other end of it a lot. To be on this end of it, to come this far, and not be able to finish it off, especially here at home, you know, just get one goal relatively late, and just, you know, that's why you have to get off to a good start. You can't rely on your star players. You've got to have a whole group out there. You can't rely on the power play. You've got to go out and just assume they're going to get that goal or get us going. 
 You know, we just ran out of time. And that's all I can say.

 Q. As a group you were a little bit tentative to start? 
 KIRK MALTBY: No, I think we got off to a decent start. And then the dreaded second period, I think maybe it was -- not that we played poorly, but two mistakes ends up being two goals. Obviously, that's the end of it there. Nothing against --

 Q. It seemed like forced errors though? 
 KIRK MALTBY: Well, I'd be lying if I told you how Talbot got the puck on the first one. The second one we just kind of didn't get the puck and keep it in deep. They get a two-on-one, and made a big shot. And you see Crosby, and Malkin and guys like that. And we were talking about it this morning. The guys that you least expect end up stepping up and making the big plays. You know, they made good shots.

 Q. You guys had five goals in Game 5, and just one goal in each of the last two games. Why did they give you so many problems? 
 KIRK MALTBY: I mean, they're playing hard. They're a good team. They're not here by accident, obviously. We had some, not from lack of opportunities in the first and third period, but unfortunately when you're down a couple of goals, and I think the last two games we played great in the third period. The clock's your enemy. You run out of time and hit the post. You hit the post there, and there's flashbacks of last year. 
 I know we had a last-second opportunity there. And I'm not sure there's any time left on the clock for an opportunity. 
 So, no excuses, they worked their butts off as hard as we did. And tonight they just scored more than we did. 

 Q. Fleury got stronger as he went? 
 KIRK MALTBY: He made big saves tonight. They have two seconds left. They're probably the two biggest saves of the game, obviously. You know, I don't know. He stopped the puck when he had to. Ozzie for us he gave us a chance to win. He played great, and we had the opportunity and, like I said, you know, as good as your power play can be, or, you know, you can't just rely on things like that. You have to play five-on-five, and score five-on-five and get opportunities. 
 We had a few tonight in the third, we had lots of chances. But Fleury made some great saves. We hit a post to crossfire or whatever, and we ran out of time.
