Q.  (On stopping Forsberg and Sakic.)

KIRK MALTBY: Well, you're never going to stop them.  It's proven time and time again.  Players like that are going to get their points.  It's just a matter of trying to slow them down and being aware of where they are on the ice, and don't give them too many opportunities, and Hejduk and Drury, they have a lot of weapons.  We know we have to play well defensively.  We did tonight and we just have to continue for the rest of the series.  

Q.  It wasn't a highlight goal, but you'll take them any way you can get them?

KIRK MALTBY: Exactly, when we go in the hole the first two periods, we didn't think we were going to get one forever, and that's what you've got to do, get the puck to the net, and anything can happen.  They have had some goals that were sharp angles go off a stick or skate, and we were just trying to do the same thing.  We were just glad to win it.
