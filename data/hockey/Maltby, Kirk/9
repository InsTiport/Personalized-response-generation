KIRK MALTBY:  5 on 3s all night, Stevey killed out or was out and helped killing every single one that we had against us every game this year.  I mean, the Playoffs is especially where we need them.  He is the biggest leader we got on this team. 
 

Q.  Talk about the lack of injuries.
 
KIRK MALTBY:  I wouldn't say we haven't had any injuries, but I mean serious ones to miss games, we have been fortunate.  But, I mean, guys, it is Playoff hockey, they got to play through bumps and bruises, cuts, whatnot, I mean, we had our share of those.  But fortunately, we haven't had anything seriously to sideline anyone. 
 

Q.  I know I asked you a little bit about this before, I think.  When did you start feeling your whole game together? Could you ever predict that you would be scoring 5 goals doing all this?
 
KIRK MALTBY:  Well, I mean, not really.  I mean if, you look at the offense I put out the last few years, it is just -- I mean, I think near the end of the year, me Chris and Joey, we kind of start gelling together.  We were getting 2, 3, 4 chances a game offensively, but just weren't able to finish. It just seems like the scoring touch kind of came into the Playoffs with us.  Those chances were still there.  We caught some breaks. 
 

Q.  Did you start focusing more?  Did the puck start feeling better and bigger?
 
KIRK MALTBY:  Definitely didn't look bigger.  When you got guys like Grant Fuhr and Guy Hebert and especially a guy like Patrick Roy that we are playing against, not too -- there is it not too much net there to see.  We caught some good breaks, definitely that way.  But, I mean, we work hard and I think we created some of them for ourselves too.
