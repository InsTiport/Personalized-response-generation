Q.  Your life is working out, cover of Sports Illustrated, the position that you are in.  Looks like you are on your way to another Stanley Cup Final win.
 
KIRK MALTBY:  It has been a lot of work, a lot of fun.  But, we still got one more period to go.  We have got good control, hope to continue that and have something to carry over in the next game. 
 

Q.  Tell me you haven't thought about the being four periods away now from having your name on the Stanley Cup?
 
KIRK MALTBY:  Well, I think definitely it is in the back of your mind, but you can't get too ahead of yourself. This team, I mean, they have been great all year.  They are here for a reason.  Like I said, we are going to take care of this one first and then concentrate on the next one 
 

Q.  Less than one week ago it was a dream to be in the Finals.  Here now, the longest of odds.  How much did you expect this from the Red Wings?  Does it surprise you how well they are playing?
 
TRENT KLATT:  We watched the series against Colorado. They are a great team themselves.  They just dominated them totally.  We knew they were a great team and, you know, we have to try and get back on track and start trying to do something here.  Try to go back for this third period to set up what is going to happen in the next game, to get some momentum for the next one, got to try and do something, keep getting shots, keep fore-checking; hoping to get a bounce or two and see if we can set a tone for Game 4.
