 Q. Can you tell us your overall impression of being picked by Minnesota? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, it was a fantastic feeling to be picked by Minnesota in Minnesota. It's a great feeling.

 Q. Did you talk to them? 
 JONAS BRODIN: No, first time.

 Q. What do you think? 
 JONAS BRODIN: I like it. My hometown is like a thousand people, so it's a big difference.

 Q. Did you have an idea that the Wild wanted you? Did you have an interview at the combine when you went up there, or no?
 JONAS BRODIN: It's hard to say. I talked with many teams and I think they had the same questions. 
 I had no idea. I'm really happy.

 Q. What was that like, did you feel like (Indiscernible)?
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I liked it. They showed me around the locker room and the arena. I like it very much. They have a really good organization, so I like it.

 Q. What kind of player are you? 
 JONAS BRODIN: I'm a mobile two-way defender with good skating and good in both zones.

 Q. Not a lot of points. You like to pass, mainly? Are you more of a passer than a shooter? 
 JONAS BRODIN: I don't know. When I was younger I didn't do very much points. But when I came up to the A-team (Indiscernible). But I can do points. I like it, so...

 Q. You like a shutdown defenseman mainly or more stay at home, or do you like to bring the puck? 
 JONAS BRODIN: I like to bring the puck and follow the rush to the offense. That's my play.

 Q. We don't have a lot of Swedes. We don't have any Swedes but we've got about ten Fins, are you worried about that? 
 JONAS BRODIN: No (laughing).

 Q. How tough is it to get ice time when you're your age? 
 JONAS BRODIN: It's tough. But this season there were very many injured on defense so I got much play time. It was good for my development to play much in the Swedish league.

 Q. What's it like to have four Swedish players go in the Top 10 in the draft? What's that mean for Swedish hockey? 
 JONAS BRODIN: It's really cool. They have really good players: Adam Larsson, Landeskog, Mika Zibanejad. And I know those guys; they're really good guys. It's very good for Sweden.

 Q. Jonas, how much time have you spent in the States? Have you been here before? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I was in the World Juniors last year and for two years ago I was under 17. Yeah, this is my third time in the USA.

 Q. Do you understand the Scandinavian-Swedish connection between this area in Minnesota and Sweden? Maybe it will make the adjustment for you a little easier? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I heard there are many Swedes in this town, so that's good.

 Q. Have you been to IKEA? We've got one?
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah (laughing).

 Q. What is your plan? Do you think you'll be in the National Hockey League next year? Are you hoping to do that? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, it's hard to say how the season will go, but I need to be stronger and I'm going to work at it I hope one year -- one or two years.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 JONAS BRODIN: I don't feel any different in the Swedish league, but I'm -- I don't know. 

 Q. Is there an NHL player you model your game after? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I think it's Lidstrom. I think we have the same play, and play easy and he's in the right place and everything. 

 Q. How does it make you feel to know that you're in a place where the coach is known for developing young talent? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, that's really good.

 Q. Jonas, tell me about your family. Did your father play hockey? 
 JONAS BRODIN: No, my father played soccer when I was younger, and my mom doesn't do sports.

 Q. Do you have brothers and sisters? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I have one brother and one sister.

 Q. Do they play sports? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, my brother played in the third league in Sweden, maybe. And my sister played soccer.

 Q. Is he younger than you? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Older.

 Q. So you're the best hockey player in the family? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah.

 Q. Have you been skating since you were like a little tiny kid? 
 JONAS BRODIN: Yeah, I have a rink 15 minutes away from my house. I played with my friends every day when I was younger there, so...
