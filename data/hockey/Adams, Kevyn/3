KEVYN ADAMS: Tight game.  Going in the third, it's going to be a battle.  These games are all battles now, and when you are hoping to get the break or the opportunity to put one home, and then you got to give yourself a chance.  And we're doing that right now.

Q.  There were a lot of complaints about the ice in games 1 and 2 in Detroit.  Is the ice hurting game tonight?

KEVYN ADAMS: I don't think so.  I think walking in the rink it felt chillier than it's been all year.  Obviously keeping it a little colder; I think guys like me, grinders like me, want it like that, I have no problems with it.
