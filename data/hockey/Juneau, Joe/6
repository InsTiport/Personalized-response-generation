JOE JUNEAU:  They won last year.  Obviously they have all these big names on their team and I think any team that would face the Red Wings in the Final would be the underdog, so I am not surprised and I am not thinking about it at all. 
 

Q.  What exactly do you guys have to do to be successful against a team like that?
 
JOE JUNEAU:  I think it would be keep believing in each other and keep playing for each other and stuff like that.  I think that is what it comes down to.  We are playing with a lot of confidence.  We just have to stick to our game plan.
