Q.  First period against the Wings in the Final down by 2; how did you find it?
 
JOE JUNEAU:  They scored twice on a couple of bad plays and I thought we started pretty good.  And, as soon as really when they got the first goal, we start panicking and, you know, breakouts are awful and we start giving the puck away.  So we got to talk about it and regroup, that is all. 
 

Q.  Ultimately, what is the kind of game you want to play against this very deep team?
 
JOE JUNEAU:  Just the same way we played against the other teams.  You don't want to worry about them too much and play our game.  We have a lot of talent.  We just got to believe in each other a little bit more than what we did in the last ten minutes.
