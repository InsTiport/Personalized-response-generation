JOE JUNEAU:  We lost Game 1 against Buffalo and we came back and played three very good games in a row. 
 

Q.  Tell me about the chances that you had late in the game.  Seemed like you had a couple of real good ones.  I am not sure who it -- it McCarty that made the play on you --
 
JOE JUNEAU:  He dove and pulled the puck away from me as I made my move and had the goalie beat, so, you have to give him credit to make a very good defensive play. 
 

Q.  The fact that you guys had a lot of -- not a lot, but some really good chances come into that third period, is that one of the positives that you can take out of that game going into Game 2?
 
JOE JUNEAU:  Yeah, I think we definitely played much better after we scored our goal and in the third we definitely had the advantage. 
 

Q.  What was it about that few minutes there in the first period that allowed Detroit to get those first two goals and grab that 2-nothing lead?
 
JOE JUNEAU:  Well, I thought it was two goals that we actually kind of gave them.  At some point there was miss-coverage and the other was kind of a 3 on 2 -- a puck that kind of got away from us in the neutral zone and turned into a 3 on 2.  So, obviously, it is a situation you want to get away from.  That is why I said we kind of gave those two goals away.
