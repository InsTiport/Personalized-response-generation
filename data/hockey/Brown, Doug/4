DOUG BROWN:  There is plenty of motivation strictly to win and also we have had a lot of motivation just to prove we are still a solid team.  We miss Vlady and because of not having Vladimir here we have all had to play a little better now all season long to compete.  And in some ways it has made us a stronger team.  Last year there was an awful lot of stress from media and the fans because we had -- Detroit hadn't won in so long, so it was a burden, a weight that maybe we were carrying around that it was unjust, but it was still there and this year we don't have that burden.  We just have to concentrate on trying to win and now there is a little more high expectations, but so be it.  We have gotten used to playing under some pressure situations here.
