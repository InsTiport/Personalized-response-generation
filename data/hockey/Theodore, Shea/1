THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. Talk about winning both games in Vegas, putting yourself in position to close out the series in Game 5 in Winnipeg.
SHEA THEODORE: Feel good.  Definitely a better feeling than coming here with a 2-2 series.  The mood is light in the locker room right now.  It's fun to be around.
Q. What is it like for you to still have Gerard calling your number late into a game, huge implications at stake?
SHEA THEODORE: Yeah, I think it adds to the confidence.  Knowing that you're going right back out every shift no matter what happens, it's big for a confidence boost, like said.  It's really good to have.
Q. Game 1, they bombarded you right out of the start in their building, here in Winnipeg.  How do you make sure that doesn't happen?  How do you continue the starts you've had knowing their crowd and their team are going to be in complete desperation mode?
SHEA THEODORE: Obviously they're going to be a desperate team.  After getting our feet wet in Game 1, I felt like we felt more comfortable.  Playing in this building before, we're going to be a little bit more comfortable with the fans, how loud it is in there.
We just have to really keep things simple to start.
Q. It seems like the whole world is crashing down, they're pouring everything at you.  Marc-Andre Fleury is making jokes, having fun on the ice.  How reassuring or comforting is that for any player?
SHEA THEODORE: It's big.  Just to have him joking around, the most intensive moments, I think it calms everyone down just to see how relaxed he is out there.  He's not worried about a single thing.  That definitely eases the mindset.
