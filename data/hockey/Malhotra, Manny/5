Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   A little bit.  There is always possibility.  At the central testing this weekend we have an interview with New York and it went pretty well.  Every time it has its idea.  The draft is a funny thing.  Anybody can be slated anywhere so nothing can really be of a surprise on draft day.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Yeah, it is a great hockey team, obviously, with the history that it possesses, as well as the players that they have there.  For example, Wayne Gretzky with all the accomplishment he's done in the league, I think it would be a great opportunity to learn things from the veteran players that they have there.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Absolutely.  I think, you know, through a hard year of training this summer, I'm definitely going to be looking to fight as as hard as I can for a spot next year.  A year or two more years of junior is not a shame.  It is not too many 18-year-olds who make it in the league, so I will continue to fight as hard as I can for a spot.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I'm a pretty laid-back guy.  I like to joke around a lot, hang out with my friends.  Away from the ice I continue to be as active as possible, playing volleyball or soccer.  Basketball, I'm really sported in that sense, so I really try to keep busy as much as possible.


Q.  You had a (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   It didn't really matter to me where I went.  It is a great honor for me to be taken by New York, and I don't think it would be a shame to go anywhere in the draft.  I came in today with an open-mind knowing that anything could happen.  I think it was a good opportunity for me.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Well, obviously when I started playing hockey it was always a dream, you know, to be in the NHL just, like the big guys on TV.  I think I really tried to go competitive and make it to this level when I was minor banter, in my banter years.  I realized how close perhaps the NHL was with that junior being very close to that.  I think in those years I really defend my game plan a little bit and the style that I play today is really what got me here, I think.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think my overall game I want to  work on obviously a little more emphasis on the finisher on the net and my thinking process whether or not to shoot or pass, but, in general, I want to work on my overall game. Everyone says it is a step faster and a little bit quicker up there so I think I have to work harder to get there.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think that's a combination of our system we placed this year.  For the most part centers were designated to play high, not zone, and play defensive role in covering for the defense men but through the year I think I adapted to that a little bitter and through the play offense and picking my spots I was able to create a little more offense.  So with maturity and understanding a little more about the game I will be able to understand my spot a little bit better.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think that's where I really pride myself.  I try to take more responsibility in those games.  I enjoy being in those situations in an one nothing hockey game or one one hockey game with a minute left being out on the ice.  I really pride myself on taking more responsibility and doing as good a job as possible.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think I always wanted to be a leader and I always try to be in those situations, so I enjoy working with a lot of people in various situations.  So I never really tried to take a back seat to anybody but I always learn from everyone possible and I think that's one of my keys is that I'm able to take in things and reiterate them a little bit later on in my own style.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I never really tried to pattern myself after anybody.  He was a physical player.  He's used his size, his advantage and used that.  More of a Shanahan type player.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   He's been a real support for me that, obviously, he knows a lot of people around the league and he knows whatÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s this business is about.  He's basically a voice of reason in settling us down and letting us know what is out there.


Q.  How did it come --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I was with a different agency at the time.  I was with one agent and he wasn't too happy there.  He kind of got away and signed up with Bobby Orr.  So it was kind of like I was with another agent at first and signed on with them together.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Pardon me. 


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   That was about two years ago for us.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Well, obviously, there is a lot of adrenaline pumping in analyzing each situation as to what the outcome may be and where life may take you in a few years. So I kind of -- there is thought process going on as to what my future could be and where I might be living in the next few years.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.) In law --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   There is obviously the hockey background that it possesses the history there.  But I just had an opportunity to have a conference back with Madison Square Garden and was a few thousand fans there and I already liked the sounds there.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Well, I've never lived in a big city like that, but I look forward to going out there and seeing what the town is actually about.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Not the Madison Square Garden area, but I have been in the general area.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Well, I was in minor hockey tournaments when I went there, so.  Pardon me?


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Not really.  That's the thing. When I was younger it was basically the hockey tournament and stayed in the hotel.  I never really had a chance to experience life in New York.


Q.  Are you looking forward to getting on the late night as a junior to --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think perhaps it will give me an opportunity to use my speed a little bit more.  With the new rules being implied in the NHL with less crushing and grabbing, I think that will be a benefit to everybody.


Q.  Are you looking forward to -- do you think you will get much chance to play (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I really haven't given it much thought.  You know, I thought about it a few minutes ago and just being around him would be a great thing.  The things he would be able to teach would be just a great honor for me.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Not really.  There was a lot of speculation as to what teams and the trade rumors going around.  So every team really kept their cards close to the chest and kept tight lipped about every situation.


Q.  What about the --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   India, yes. 


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I don't know.  Confusion, broken telephone I guess.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.) In law --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Pardon me?


Q.  Do you --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Not as yet.  Perhaps something in math and sciences or kinesiology.  I haven't really decided.


Q.  Are you going to study or are you going to leave for summer or --

MANNY MALHOTRA:   I think perhaps.  Obviously the NHL is a big step and if I have a fortune the playing there next year, which, you know, is a possibility, I think I would like to feel out and see what the league is about before I'm trying to do anything above my head and trying to get into anything else.  Right now I'm just planning on starting the University.  Whatever will happen will be for the best isn't (INAUDIBLE.)  Not as yet.  I thought to take two more OSCs, which is a prerequisite to the Ontario.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

MANNY MALHOTRA:   Perhaps sciences, math, chemistry.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   My mother's name is Leech; she's from Quebec.  My father's name is Shaty.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

MANNY MALHOTRA:   India.  Pardon me?  It was great, you know.  Just as I slowly think about the history of that that team possesses, it kind of gets you in the end.  The players obviously have something to teach younger players so I'm looking forward to it.  He is ready for a one on one in the back now.
