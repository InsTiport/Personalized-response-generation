 Q. How long do you think it's going to take you to make it to the National Hockey League? What kind of schedule are you on?

 Q. How much did it help you this year being so young to play professionally in Finland and already be on the pro team? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: Of course now I know what's it to be a professional. Of course I think it has been a big help for me. We have a really good team in Finland, so it was pretty easy to get there. It was fun to play there. 

 Q. How did you guys do this year? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: We lost in the first round in the playoffs. 

 Q. Who is your favorite Finnish hockey player?
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: I really don't have one. But of course when I was younger there was like Teemu Salami, and Saku Koivu, of course, those big players in Finland. But right now I don't have one big idol.

 Q. When did you decide you wanted to be a pro hockey player? How young were you when you first had that dream? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: Well, this was a tough first season for me in the professional league. It was fun to jump from Juniors to the professional. That's my dream to play professional hockey. That's what I want to do.

 Q. Did you start skating when you were 4 or 5 years old? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: Oh, the first time was when I was 2 years old. That's when I started to play.

 Q. How good is he? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: Oh, he's okay, let's say that.

 Q. Do you guys, would it be a dream the Koivu brothers, Ruutu brothers? Could there be the Granlund brothers? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: Oh, hard to say. I have played with him. The last under 18 tournaments we played together some games, and it's great to play with him. He's a pretty smart player, so it's easy to play with him. 
 Of course, it's hard to say now, but it would be nice, maybe. 

 Q. You're 5' 10"; is that correct? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: I am.

 Q. Is that big enough to play center in the National Hockey League, or are you still growing? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: I think that's enough. I mean, it will be appropriate for me. I have always been one of the smallest guys on the team, and it's not a problem. I try to do things, and it's not a problem to be a little bit smaller than everybody else.

 Q. How many games did you miss this year? 
 MIKAEL GRANLUND: 15.
