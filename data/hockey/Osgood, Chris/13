Q.  It may sound corny but champs they say do find a way to win.  I think it was a good example of it tonight?
 
CHRIS OSGOOD:  We haven't had to come from behind in a while now actually.  Third period we were really playing really solid.  Even when they scored made it 4-2, I was pretty confident.  We knew we would come back.  It was a difference in just to talk about it and say it on the bench than to do it.  We have done it before, so we really don't have to say anything confident with him and confident in each other.  We played a solid game.
