  MODERATOR:   Questions for Trevor Lewis.   
   
 Q.   You have a chance to look back on last night's game, what comes to mind?  
TREVOR LEWIS:   Oh, I think we definitely had our chances to win the game, but we knew they were going to come out hard.   They did a good job at that.   
We got to refocus and prepare for Game5.   
   
 Q.   Martin Brodeur, future Hall of Fame goalie.   Looked like he was on his game last night.   
TREVOR LEWIS:   Yeah, he played really well.   He stopped a few breakaways.   We hit a couple posts.   But he's a great goalie.   We know he's going to do that.   
   
 Q.   Again, confidence remains high, as it should, up 3â€‘1?  
TREVOR LEWIS:   Yeah.   I mean, we know the fourth game is going to be the hardest.   It's the Stanley Cup Finals here.   It's pretty tough to sweep.   We got to make sure we're prepared and get ready for Game5.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Trevor.
