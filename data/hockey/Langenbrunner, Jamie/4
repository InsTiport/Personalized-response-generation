JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: A few unfortunate things happened to us, but it's part of hockey, and I like our character there battling it back and sticking with it.  It just wasn't meant for us to be tonight.  I guess the best thing we can do is try to forget about it and get focused for the next one.  That one is going to be big. 
 
Q.  As a teammate or opponent, have you ever seen Brodeur have a night like this one?
 
JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: He made some big saves too.  Obviously, it was an unfortunate one there, but he made some big saves too.  He's carried us all playoffs.  I'm sure he will be back even better in the next game.  That's part of hockey sometimes.  Those things happen. 
 
Q.  You guys did battle back after that weird goal to at least send it to overtime.
 
JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: We take that and the fact that we didn't play that well and gave up some pretty weird goals, like you said, and we still pushed it to overtime.  We knew it wasn't going to be easy, and now we've got to win Game 4.
