Q.  Jamie, how tough is this one to take?

JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: It's always disappointing.  We had a chance to score a goal and win a hockey game.  Obviously, I'm disappointed.

Q.  The home team has won every game in this series.  Now it's back in your turf.

JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER:  Hopefully that will continue.  It was a tough loss for us, we get two days to regroup.  And we've got to put our best effort in the series in game 5
