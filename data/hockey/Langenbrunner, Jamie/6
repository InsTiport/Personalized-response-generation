Q. Great third period by you guys offensively.

JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: Yeah, it was tough watching it. But I think things are going well
for us. Got the momentum a little bit there; got some good chances. Hopefully, we'll find
another lucky bounce like last night and go in.

Q. What's it like in the room? How tough to watch this thing?

JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: It's pretty quiet, pretty tense in there. You know, you got the
lights off, and kind of in your own little world, and just watching the game. And everyone
is a little nervous and a little tense.

Q. Who's got the game winner tonight?

JAMIE LANGENBRUNNER: I've picked Dave Manson every game so far in the OT's. He's going
to come through for me tonight.
