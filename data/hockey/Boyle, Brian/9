  BRIAN BOYLE:   It's been huge for us.   I think he does a lot of grunt work.   He does a lot of heavy lifting.   And he's been hitting it really hard.   He's really done it the right way, I think.   Not a dirty player by any means.   He's done a lot for us.   He stands up to guys a lot bigger than him and heavier than him.   And we played a lot the last couple of years together.   It's been a lot of fun.

Q.   Not the type of guy to go hit (indiscernible)?
BRIAN BOYLE:   No.

Q.   Do you take offense to that characterization?   I'll just throw it out there (indiscernible). 
BRIAN BOYLE:   (Indiscernible). 

Q.   Coach said you take a lot of pride when you get hit hard, you jump up, you don't try to sell it to the refs.   Is that true?   Is that something that you have pointed out saying that's what we want to do, we don't want to try to dive or sell things?
BRIAN BOYLE:   I don't think‑ I mean, we're going to get hit hard, especially during the Playoffs.   You don't want to‑ when a guy hits you, you don't want to fall, you don't want to budge.   And if you do, you get up and here's the puck.   The next time you try to go through him. 
That's how we play.   I think that's for the most part how hockey's played.

Q.   You guys stressing the opportunity that you have here to really grab this series by the throat rather than kind of allow them to tie this thing back up?
BRIAN BOYLE:   Yeah.   I think it's a good opportunity for us.   I think we feel we can elevate our play a little bit.   I mean, they are probably going to do the same.   And especially through the first half of the game maybe in Game 3 we relied a lot on Hank.   And he's been great for us.   That's what he's there for. 
But we want to dictate play a little more, maybe have the puck a little bit more.
