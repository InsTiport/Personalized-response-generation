  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Brian Boyle. 

Q.   This is the third straight series you play Game5 tied 2â€‘2.   Any benefits of having gone through this a couple times already. 
BRIAN BOYLE:   I don't know.   I think maybe.   But each series presents a new challenge, a different team.   We've been in different situations all year.   I think we've been a resilient team. 
We have confidence as a group. 

Q.   Does home ice become a bigger factor as the series progresses?
BRIAN BOYLE:   Yeah, it can be to our advantage, if we take advantage of it.

Q.   Coming off a tough loss, is there a comfort coming home knowing you're going to have a lot of people behind you?
BRIAN BOYLE:   Yeah.   We need to feed off that and use it to our advantage with our start, like I talked about before.   I think that's going to be important. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
