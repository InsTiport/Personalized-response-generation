Q.  How familiar are you with the NHL?  I know your brother plays for the Devils.  Did that cause you to follow it a lot more?  And what do you know about San Jose?  Do you follow the NHL closely?  I think that your brother played a little bit for the Devils and how much do you know about San Jose?
 
MARCEL GOC: I don't know much about San Jose, but I played with Marco Sturm in the World Championship in Germany.  He told me a little bit that it's good to play there, but that's it.  
 

Q.  Did your brother give you a lot of advice coming into this year?
 
MARCEL GOC: For the draft?  
 

Q.  Yeah.
 
MARCEL GOC: He told me to be not nervous, just relax and have fun.  
 

Q.  Were you able to do that?  I mean it's easy to say not be nervous, but I imagine you were very nervous.
 
MARCEL GOC: I was a little bit nervous, yeah.
