GARY MEAGHER:  Questions for Sergei?


Q.  That was pretty emotional, when you said, "This one's for you, Dad."  Do you have a special bond with your father?

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  Yeah.  He's the one who brought me to hockey, actually.  He was following my career.  He was the one who has helped me the most during all these years.  So I think that he deserves to be as much as I am.


Q.  What did you learn playing on the Boston Bruins?

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  Probably how to play defensive and offensive at the same time.  Our team is probably not offensive, but we're doing everything, offensive, defensive.  I want to learn the most I can.


Q.  Sergei, who did you grow up idolizing?  Who's your hero?

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  My hero is Sergei Makarov.  He's the one who I always tried to look up to.  I was watching him a lot.


Q.  Have you ever met him?  Has he ever spoken to you about playing in the NHL and winning the Calder and all those sorts of things? 

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  No, I never talked to him about that.  I think I met him once, shook his hand.  That's about it.


Q.  When the season started, you were on everyone's list to perhaps get this trophy.  Do you feel you sort of came out of nowhere to win this?

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  I guess so.  I didn't really expect myself to be here in the beginning of the season.  I also didn't expect to be in it at all.  So it's it's really a surprise for me and I guess for everyone.


Q.  How much has your experience playing for the Vipers helped you make the transition?

SERGEI SAMSONOV:  It helped me a lot.  I think that's probably one of my smartest decisions, to come over and play one year in the professional league before I enter to the draft and play for national.
