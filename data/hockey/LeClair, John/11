Q.  (INAUDIBLE.) 
 
JOHN LeCLAIR: Skills competition, I don't think you got to be too intense for that.  There will be a lot of free time where we can chat and do things like that. 
 

Q.  What do you think your chances are in the competition?
 
JOHN LeCLAIR: Not too good.  I am hoping I hit the net, and that is about it. 
 

Q.  John, what is it like to come back to Boston; your first All-Star game?
 
JOHN LeCLAIR: It is nice.  Like I said, there is a lot of family in the area.  It is nice my first All-Star game can be in a location to have your family there. 
 

Q.  Growing up in Vermont, did you ever think NHL first; All-Star second?
 
JOHN LeCLAIR: Neither one was ever in my mind.  Looking back, it is something I feel great about because I never really imagined being a professional. 
 

Q.  How much fun is it playing with these guys? 
 
JOHN LeCLAIR: It is great.  It is a big part of the reason why I am here playing with the guys I play with.
