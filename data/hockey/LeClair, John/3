JOHN LeCLAIR:  He's a tremendous talent.  The guy's fast.  He can handle the puck and score.  You know, could be a good addition.


Q.  Do you think he complements what you guys have?

JOHN LeCLAIR:  I think he's going to be a great fit.  I think our team as far as size and that kind of thing, to add a different dimension like that can give us a different look on a different line.  It could be very valuable.


Q.  Is one way of looking at it that you replace a --

JOHN LeCLAIR:  That's not a bad way of looking at it.  You know, when we had Howard, you know, he is about as quick as he is right now.  I think he adds a little bit more in that area.


Q.  (Inaudible)

JOHN LeCLAIR:  I would hope for better tonight. You know, it's a tough thing.  We go out in the cold and tough.  It's tough to get a good gauge.  Tonight I guess, not overextending.  It's tough to  go out there and cold and not have any practice runs and stuff.  I guess it's just a fun time for the fans, and for us to compete, it's a fun thing.  Try to keep it that way.


Q.  (Inaudible)

JOHN LeCLAIR:  I wasn't really looking forward to too much.  You know, it was fun, once I got doing it.  I was a little nervous:  hope not to fall in a corner and end up crashing into the boards or something.  But it's fun once you get going.
