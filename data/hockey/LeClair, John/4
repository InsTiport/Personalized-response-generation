Q.  Larry Murphy, people are talking about the tremendous series you have had so far; playing against the Legion of Doom, can you talk about that?

LARRY MURPHY:  Well, it has been a handful, especially tonight, they have really come out with a lot of fire, and we have managed to hang on to this point.  We got a big goal there at the end of the period.  Yeah, this is definitely their best game to date and we have got to respond.


Q.  I guess you would say, personally, for you the trade from Toronto is working out?

LARRY MURPHY:  Yeah, I mean, it was a great opportunity to play in the Playoffs.  Obviously, we weren't going there with Toronto.  I wouldn't have predicted this.  I knew the team had a good shot.  I was just happy to get into the Playoffs.  It worked out pretty well to this point.


Q.  I am in the runway with John LeClair.  You always hear about a late goal in a period.  How disheartening is a goal late like that for you?

JOHN LeCLAIR:  Yeah, it is something that you want to really work against, but we played a lot better than we had in the first periods in the past.  So, we got to stay positive. We got a lot to look forward to.  We still got two periods and we got plenty of time to catch up.


Q.  Looked like much a more furious attack, is that the best you have had in the first period?

JOHN LeCLAIR:  I think that is one of our better first periods we had.  That is what we really needed.  We are getting better results from it.  We kept the shots down.  They had three power plays.  That is why they had so many shots.  Far and far, we kept their shots down which is what we wanted to do.
