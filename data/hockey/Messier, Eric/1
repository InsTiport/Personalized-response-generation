Q.  25 blocked shots in the playoffs so far.  Tell us about the first two periods.

ERIC MESSIER: First period we scored the first goal, and that's important.  It's important to score the first goal, to get the momentum.  The game is a bit more open now, and I think it's exciting for the fans.  And it's exciting for the players too.

Q.  Hinote and Keane and a couple of other guys stood up in the dressing room the other day and had something to say.  What was it?

ERIC MESSIER: To play better, because we are kind of struggling in Game 3 in Denver when they won in overtime.  And in the first two periods of Game 4, we didn't play that good.  They talked to us a lot between the second and third period and then we became more focused.  And we showed that when we're ready that we are tough to beat.
