  Q. If you can just talk about your game and what you need to work on and what you might work on this summer?  
 TIM ERIXON: Well, I'm working on getting more explosive with my skating I think and getting a really fast in my first strides (ph), and I think my strengths are probably my hockey sense, and I like to join some rushes and play a two-way game.  
  
  Q. What about those one-on-one battles, is that something you'll work on?  
 TIM ERIXON: Yeah, for sure I think I'm still developing getting stronger and bigger, and yeah, I'm working on it.  
  
  Q. What about the offensive part of your game? Do you think you'll have one that emerges?   
 TIM ERIXON: Well, yeah, for sure, I would like to join some rushes.   
 Like I told you, I like to play a two-way game and play offensively and play as many power plays as possible, yeah.  
  
  Q. How much are you looking forward to being a teammate with Michael Cammalleri now that you are on the same NHL team?  
 TIM ERIXON: For sure, he's a great guy and a great player, and I think the Flames, it's a great organization with great players, and yeah, just thrilled about it.
