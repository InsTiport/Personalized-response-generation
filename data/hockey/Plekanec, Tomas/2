Q.   Did you hear about Derek Stepan s jaw?   Apparently it's broken, and he's in the hospital getting surgery now. 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   Yeah, you don't want to see guys getting hurt.   It's part of hockey, and with Price, the same thing happened to us.   It's unfortunate.   You don't want to see that, but it happens.

Q.   Getting a good amount of emotion in the series now, maybe not to the Boston effect yet, but getting up there. 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   It's Conference Finals, so you've got to expect that something's going to happen.   Those are big games.

Q.   Did you stay alive last night with that overtime? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   I tried.   I tried.   No, it was obviously good for us.   We know we didn't play our best, but at the end of the day it's the same win as for them in the Game 1, 7‑2 or whatever.   So we take that, and we know we have to play better.

Q.   How did you feel about the play of your line specifically before the overtime goal went in the net? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   Like I said, we know we can play better.   You know, every game you have to be at your best.   You get ups and downs in the playoffs and that's what happened to us the last couple games.   But we won the game as a team, and that's what the most important thing is.

Q.   Do you have to encourage Chucky to shoot more?
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   Yeah, I've been telling him all season long.   No, he's a young kid.   He's a good guy.   He can make a lot of plays.   He can pass the puck anywhere you ask him to.   Obviously, shooting the puck, it's not just him, but all of us should do it more.   That's one of the things we've got to get better at that in this series for sure.

Q.   How important is it for him to get a critical goal, a big goal a couple of games after being out for six weeks? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   It's huge.   It's huge, like I said, being a 2‑1 series or a 3‑0, it's a huge swing.   We take that.   We take that and we've got to be better next game.

Q.   For Alex in particular though? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   Like I said, he came back strong, and he played a good couple games and he'll be even better.   He's going to get game time kind of things.   He's a good player for us.

Q.   In your mind and in the minds of hockey players, when Brandon Prust isn't penalized for that hit, is that the situation that happened with Dorsett and Chris, essentially that is that something that has to happen because he wasn't penalized for the hit? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   I don't know.   Those things happen, and you usually expect some kind of answer from the other team when those kind of things happen.   It goes both ways.   Like I said, when Pricey did that thing, and that's part of hockey, you have type of players for that, and Prusty, and Dorsett and Carcillo are one of those, so that's different.

Q.   Does it make it a difference when he wins the fight? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   I'm sorry? 

Q.   Vigneault said he was unhappy that Prust hit Stepan like that after he said Kreider's hit was accidentally on purpose.   Does it sound like Alain's perhaps (Indiscernible)? 
TOMAS PLEKANEC:   I don't know.   Prusty finishes the checks and it's an unfortunate thing to do (Indiscernible).   He plays only once on the ice, so it's hard for me to judge whether it was good or bad.   But Prusty, like I said, he's the one that has to finish every check and every player who is against him on the ice should expect that from him.
