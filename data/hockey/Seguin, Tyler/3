   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tyler Seguin. 

 Q. (Question being in the lineup.) 
 TYLER SEGUIN: I'm taking advantage of all opportunities I've been given. Don't want to go back to the feeling of almost waiting for an injury for you to get a chance to play. That's not the emotional state I want to be in. I'm trying to stay away from that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TYLER SEGUIN: No, that's a lie. I don't know why he'd say that. I think I do a better beard than Marshy. 

 Q. Talk about getting off to a good start. 
 TYLER SEGUIN: I think everyone feels better today. Myself, a lot of guys had their first experience in the Stanley Cup finals. Should be a different story for all of us. 

 Q. Do you feel you're in a must-win situation?
 TYLER SEGUIN: I think you can look at every game as a must-win. You can say Game 2 is a big one, you can say Game 4 is a big one. Every game is a chance to win. That's what we want. 

 Q. Does it make you feel better if you get the 1-1 split going back to Boston? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: Yes. Taking a game is something we want to do. Going back with a split is definitely the goal right now.
