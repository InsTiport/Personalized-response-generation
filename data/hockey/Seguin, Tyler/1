   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chris. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TYLER SEGUIN: It's going to take more than it did last time. We have to do things different than last time. We have to go out and finish strong. 

 Q. Which Luongo shows up tonight?
 TYLER SEGUIN: That's up to him.

 Q. With the home thing there, is there anything you guys try to envision being at home? Bring Rene Rancourt along?
 TYLER SEGUIN: I think especially going into a game like this, you've got to zone out everything. Just worry about what's going on on the ice. 
 If we hear boos, obviously we're doing something right and that's our focus.

 Q. I guess you won't have a chance, but during this run, do you have time to think about where you were last year at this time, in your first year being in a run like this? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: It's very cool. Definitely you can dream of and look forward to and now that it's happening. I don't want to sit back too much, or I might miss the opportunity.

 Q. What do you think this will do for you going forward, playing in Game 7 finals? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: Definitely helps your experience. It helped me out just being a young guy and definitely will help out my career going forward.

 Q. Have you heard from Tyler Hall at all? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: No.

 Q. Nervous at all? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: I don't feel nervous right now, no. I think I know what I need to do. Our team knows what we need to do and we need to do it.

 Q. How important is a good, early start putting pressure on Luongo? 
 TYLER SEGUIN: I think both teams will come out bangin'. Obviously we want to match their intensity, so that's our mind-set going in and what we want to accomplish.
