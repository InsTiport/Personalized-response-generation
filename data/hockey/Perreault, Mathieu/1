THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
 Q.  Based on what you were able to do in the last couple games of the Nashville series, how much confidence does that give you?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Great confidence.  We had success on the road in the playoffs.  We like where our game is at right now.  We're excited for this game coming up.   
 Q.  What has your team done well on the road lately?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: I'm not sure.  We keep it pretty simple.  We bring our A game somehow on the road.  We work hard.  We get on their D.  I think tomorrow that's going to be the plan.   
 Q.  What do you anticipate playing here?  The crowd, the atmosphere?  What are you expecting tomorrow night?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Yeah, same thing.  It's the Conference Finals.  You expect all the buildings to be loud, excited for the game.  That's what we're going to expect tomorrow.   
 Q.  Whenever you've had the series get tied, you've responded with a win the next game.  You've never had to chase a series.  Does that add some extra urgency to tomorrow's game?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Yeah, sure.  I mean, it's a huge game.  Like you said, we bounced back after every loss we've had so far in the playoffs.  No different for us tomorrow.  Just a huge game, so we have to bring all our best.   
 Q.  What did you learn about Vegas last night?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: They're relentless.  We knew they weren't going to just fold in the net.  They battled hard.  That's what we expected from them.  We got ourselves a series.   
 Q.  What are some of the challenges their D presents?  They are an under-the-radar group.  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: I don't think they're an under-the-radar group.  They have a strong D corps.  They play you hard.  They can skate.  They are playing a great system.  They got a great goalie.  They play well in their own end.   
 Q.  Do you think they're similar to Nashville in that sense?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Yeah, definitely.  They don't give you a whole lot of space.  They get on you.  They got some speed.  It's very similar.   
 Q.  Have the games felt similar, as well?  Numbers are close.  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Yeah, and the games feel the same on the ice.  It's that time of the year.  The best teams that are remaining in the league are fighting for the Stanley Cup.  There's not going to be a whole lot of space out there.  We don't expect that to change at all.   
 Q.  Throughout the season there's been talk that teams come here, party the night before.  What do you anticipate tonight?  Early bedtime?  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: Yes, definitely.  Everybody is going to bed early.  We're going to bed early tonight for sure.   
 Q.  You talk about blocking things out in Winnipeg.  The crowd and hoopla in Vegas...  
MATHIEU PERREAULT: This is a nice city.  You guys walked around, you see what it's like.  But at this time of the year, it's all business.  We're here to win a Stanley Cup this year.  Everybody's buying into that.  Doesn't matter if we play in whatever city, everybody is going to get ready.
