Blackhawks  1
  Wild - 6

Q. Jason, what can you say about your play, I guess, the last four games? You looked like a reborn player out there?
JASON POMINVILLE: Yeah, I think our line's been obviously playing with confidence. I think at one point I was trying to ‑‑ just thinking too much and not going out there and playing. And I just said go out there and play and have fun and that's what we've been doing. 
Obviously we've been able to get on the score sheet, which helps your confidence, and I mean confidence is a big part of the game. When you get it a lot of good things can happen. When you don't, you go through tougher stretches. And we're feeling it right now and as a team it's good.

Q. Ryan, what is it about ‑‑ you guys bring your kids to the press conference. Winning, I'm sure, helps. But what is it about this event that just makes it have this vibe?
RYAN SUTER: Family atmosphere, it felt like, out there. A lot of kids with hockey jerseys on. And I know Brooks was really looking forward to coming and cheering us on.
And to get the win is definitely a bonus.

Q. Jason, seems like not just you but also Vanek has really kind of started playing a bit better as well. Is it too much reading into, I guess, Torchetti and what he's done for you guys, or is there something to that with both of you?
JASON POMINVILLE: Well, I think as a team we went through a tough stretch. It's tough when you're scoring one or two goals to get on the score sheet and feel good about your game. 
But I think Torch has definitely stepped in and kind of gave us freedom to make more plays offensively and came in with new ideas and created a spark for our team. You've seen it with a lot of guys getting on the score sheet, and it's been fun.

Q. Ryan, the past eight days, what's that been like? It was only eight days ago, that Boston game, and then what have the past eight days been like?
RYAN SUTER: It's been a roller coaster for sure from losing to Boston to Yeosy getting let go, to Torch coming in and us winning three on the road and then coming home and having this big stage. It's been quite the roller coaster. I like where we're at right now.

Q. Jay, when you say freedom, what do you mean by kind of new freedom? And also it seems like you're closer to the net now especially on the power play. Is that an adjustment that's brought‑‑
JASON POMINVILLE: I've played in different positions this year, positions that, to be honest with you, I've never really played. I mean I started the year net front and then was half wall for a little while and now I'm back to defense where I've pretty much played since I've been pro. So he's also come up with some new ideas to create more offense, which has helped us. And it's kind of given us the green light to make plays offensively, whether you're behind the net in the 0 zone, you can make plays as long as you come back and defend. 
I think overall as a team we're a team that defends hard and just go out there and make plays. Even though you're 200feet from your net, you should have time to get back and recover from it.

Q. Ryan, if you look at the score sheet from today you see a lot of Haula, a lot of Vanek‑‑ a lot of Reilly. As tough as it was for a Badger when you're playing here, do you have to get the puck to the Gophers?
RYAN SUTER: I think so. It was fun seeing those guys score. Obviously it's fun seeing anybody on our team score. So they were loving it. I think Haulsy was really loving it after the game.
But it's good to see those guys have fun here back where it all started for them.
JASON POMINVILLE: For not putting the puck into the net.
RYAN SUTER: He didn't even shoot the puck and he gets the star. What's going on? (Laughter).

Q. Last eight days were talked about. After all the pomp and circumstance, you guys have a home game coming up this week. How happy are you guys to get back to the normal schedule and what do you think it's going to be like going back into the X?
RYAN SUTER: We're really excited to be home. We need to build this thing and get this thing going again at home. We've had a lot of success on the road. And we're used to having success at home. So I think for us just kind of hit the reset button at home and come out and play the way that we have been playing.

Q. Ryan, the last few days have probably been pretty emotional with the family skate the outdoor skate, family in town and whatnot. The Blackhawks have been involved in these so many times. Can you imagine going through this that many times that they've been going through it?
RYAN SUTER: We had a great time. It would be nice if we could do it every year because the kids love it, our families love it. You get a lot of family members in to enjoy it with you. 
So I don't think they're wishing they weren't in it every year. So for us to be a part of it, hopefully we can be a part of more of these, because it is the ultimate experience for your family. 

Q. Jason, you'll never be able to play in front of 50,000 too often. Describe what it's like, you're up several goals. It's a party atmosphere; it's loud. What is it like to be on the ice or the on the bench for that?
JASON POMINVILLE: It's pretty awesome. You're caught in awe and you're looking around and enjoying the moment. Like Ryan said, the whole experience has been awesome. I was fortunate to play in one about eight years ago. Obviously the kids weren't around then. So it was a family skate. 
And everything like that that surrounds it is awesome. And then you go out and there's fireworks. The plane. Everything's just great. So it's a treat to be able to play in one of these. They never get old. I enjoy watching them when we're not playing in them. It's obviously a lot of fun to play in them.

Q. Similar question, once you guys get that lead, was there any point in the lead you reflect, maybe take a step back and think, bring up some memories as a child growing up in Minnesota, all that kind of stuff, did it come to fruition?
RYAN SUTER: I was trying to soak it all up. Standing on the blue line for the National Anthem and trying to look around and take it all in. TV timeouts, you're definitely looking up into the crowd. 
It's something that I'll never forget. And it was just awesome. It was such a fun atmosphere and the ice was in great shape. And the league did a really good job with taking care of us. And it was just a lot of fun to be a part of.
