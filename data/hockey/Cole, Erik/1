  Q.  Erik, how special was it for you to have played in the last two games and not just have to sit in the suit and watch   
 ERIK COLE:  I kind of waved back and forth just how much -- how much I actually was a part of it, having not played in a game.  I have been to the Finals before and I know how tough it is to get here, and so I know what the guys were going through and how hard they had to work and how hard they had to battle to keep playing.   
 I am thankful that they played long enough to give me an opportunity to come back.   
  
  Q.  Erik, second game back.  One word that can describe your play tonight is physical.  Did you just put it all on the line for the Cup there?   
 ERIK COLE:  I don't think that -- I felt a lot better tonight than I did on Saturday night, and whether it was the two straight days of travelling leading up to Game 6 or what, but I wanted to do everything I could and work as hard as I could and finish every hit that I could to try and just make it tough on them.   
 And these other guys have been scoring big goals and getting it done on the power play, and they did it again tonight.
