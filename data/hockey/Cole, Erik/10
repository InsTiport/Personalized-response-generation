JEFF O'NEILL:   We try to play our system and keep it simple.  We are not a fancy team. We just try to forecheck hard and work the puck in the corners and use our cycles to our advantage.   
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
JEFF O'NEILL: That's the idea here.  We didn't come this way to be average or not succeed.  We came here to try and win this thing. 
 
Q.  What is it going to take for the rest of your line to get going again?
 
ERIK COLE: Nothing different.  We are going to do the same thing as we did in every series.  We are going to try to work hard and try to get pucks to the net and hopefully get some good bounces and see what happens. 
 
Q.  The fact that you guys are here, yet there's such a lack of respect for your team.  Is that starting to tick you guys off a bit?
 
ERIK COLE: Not really.  It's been that way all year.  When are playing like Ron Francis and you are as overlooked as he is in it's not really a surprise, there's a lot of people that would be surprised with us now because we have been so overlooked.  But we are obviously enjoying the moment and we are not going to let what other people say depict how we play. 
 
Q.  When was it as a team that you guys started feeling confident in the Playoffs?
 
ERIK COLE: We're not a team that went through the regular season and all of a sudden.
