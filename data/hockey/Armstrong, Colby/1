Q.  Colby, Pittsburgh, what are your thoughts about going there, playing for Mario Lemieux and with Mario Lemieux?

COLBY ARMSTRONG: When I went to the interview part of this draft thing, I had a short little interview with him.  I didn't expect this, but I am very, very excited that they did incredible in the Playoffs and obviously Mario Lemieux and Straka and players like that, I'm pretty excited.


Q.  Colby, you're referred to as a power forward.  Is that a little strong description of it, your style?

COLBY ARMSTRONG: Well, I don't know.  Maybe I'll be a power forward in a couple of years, but I mean I got a couple more years to grow and get better and stronger.  And I'm always improving every year, so I'm looking forward to going to camp and seeing what is in front of me. 


Q.  Pittsburgh is obviously a highly-skilled team.  Do you see yourself fitting into that or are you more projecting down the road more of a gritty-type player?

COLBY ARMSTRONG: I think I got a little bit of skill, not as much as some of those other guys, but I think I can fit in there and play with highly-skilled players.  I did for the last couple of years, so I think I can fit in and fit the role of playing a highly-skilled guy pretty well.  So we'll see what happens.  I'm looking forward to it.


Q.  Did you have an indication from your meetings with Pittsburgh that they were real interested in you and might take you?

COLBY ARMSTRONG: No.  I had no clue at all.  I mean it was real short.  It was like six minutes long and we just sat there and just talked a little bit and wasn't even really about hockey that much.  So this is pretty out of the blue, but it's pretty exciting.  I'm very happy.
