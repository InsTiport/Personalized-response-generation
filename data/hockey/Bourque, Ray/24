RAY BOURQUE:  We worked hard.  It was nice to come out with the win.


Q.  (inaudible)

RAY BOURQUE:  I thought it was real competitive.  I thought it was a good game.  As a player, I think I enjoyed it.  I thought it was better than some of the All-Star Games I've played in.  You know, I thought off the bat at the beginning of the game, didn't really know how to go out there and approach it, play hard or what, in terms of physically.  Once we got down 3-0, we kind of got going and got into it.  Few hits up there.  A lot of good plays, a lot of good hockey.
