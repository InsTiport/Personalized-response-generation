Q.  Of all the games you and Gretzky played, all the All-Star Games, it almost looks like they can't hold it without either of you two.
 
RAY BOURQUE:  It was just -- it was fun tonight seeing the way Wayne went out and -- same old guy, you know. And it's great to see a 37, 38-year-old, 20-year vet go out and play like that. He's got a love for the game; he's got a passion. We approach the game in the same way and he just put on another show. I'll remember this game, because, you know, it was just great to see him out there. He's so excited. 
 

Q.  You look at the second period, you guys both scored those two quick goals. Can you say hey, old guys can do this, too, we fit in here?
 
RAY BOURQUE:  I think they know that. Whenever you pick up a goal in these kinds of games, it's a bonus. Being here is an honor and a privilege. When you're able to score a goal or you're part of the game, it's a bonus. It's fun to be part of the score. 
 

Q.  How proud are you to have been in as many for  as long as you've been doing it at this level?
 
RAY BOURQUE:  It's great. I have a great time doing it. I have a blast. And, you know, I mean it's -- yeah, sometimes you shake your head and you say wow, it's been a while, and it's still going. You're going to ride the wave until it comes down. And, hopefully, you know, when that time comes, I'll be walking out before it happens.
