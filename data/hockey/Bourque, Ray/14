Q.  Adam, there vowed purpose was to get to the net.  Were they doing that more than the first?
 
ADAM FOOTE:  Yeah, they did.  They were skating, they got a great opportunity.  They got a 5 on 3 and they got a goal at the end of that.  We just got to keep coming and I felt we put a lot of pressure on them the first ten minutes. 
 

Q.  Game No. 1, your ice time was down.  Do you expect to play more?
 
ADAM FOOTE:  All depends on the game if it's close.  Maybe towards the end we will play more, but that doesn't matter right now.  All we have got to do is get back to the first ten minutes.  We knew it was going to be tighter.  We can't lose our composure and got to be ready for period two.    
 
Q.  How did the momentum turn? 
 
RAY BOURQUE:   We got off to a good start   - the start we were looking for.  We had a couple of powerplays, scored a big powerplay goal, but that team doesn't quit.  They scored a big goal shorthand and right after that we had to kill two penalties and it kind of switched the momentum around and now we are going out on a powerplay and hopefully we can score a big goal.  
 

Q.  You are so focused all the time.  For a minute have you been able to enjoy the Stanley Cup Finals?
 
RAY BOURQUE:   I am enjoying every second of it.  I am having fun with it.  For me it is where I want to be.  I am not holding anything back.  
 
Q.  Walk me through the goal.
 
BOB CORKUM:  They dumped it hard around the boards, got by the first forechecker.  It got by the first "D".  I got the shot off quick through his 5-hole, thank god it went in.  
 

Q.  You were like rockets on those skates during that shot.
 
BOB CORKUM:  That's what happens when you don't play every game, you have a lot left in the tank.
