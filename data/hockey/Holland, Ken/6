Q.  What kind of role is there for him that that would fill him, given who he is and how he works, what else is --
 
KEN HOLLAND:  Yeah.  That's why Scott -- whenever, you know, down the road, he decided that he's had enough of the coaching.  It's going to be up to Scotty to decide how much time he wants to devote to hockey, how much time he wants to to devote to his family.  Certainly, when you're in this business for as long as he's been in this business, you do have to make some sacrifices and -- the sacrifices are -- we all do -- is the time away from your family.  Scotty has to decide how much -- what he wants to do.  Does he want to go on an around-the-world cruise?  I don't know. That's up to Scotty.  From my end of things, like I said, I fully expect that he will he be back next year. 
 

Q.  Some people get to the end and they don't have a love for it in the end, but you don't see that with him.
 
KEN HOLLAND:  Nobody has a greater passion and an energy level that Scotty -- I mean, it's night after night after night watching hockey games.  If we're not  playing, he's got the dish going from 730 in the east to 1:30 from the western games.  I mean, he's talking to people.  His energy level, passion is second to none and that's why he is who he is and why he's had the success that he's had.
