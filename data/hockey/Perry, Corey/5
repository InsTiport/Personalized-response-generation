 HART MEMORIAL TROPHY  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: It was pretty special but I wouldn't be here without my teammates and I said that before. They're what got me here.   
  
  Q. Looked like you got choked up there?  
 COREY PERRY: You didn't know what to expect coming in and all of the sudden you hear your name and it's -- it surprised me and, you know, I have to give credit to my teammates, I got a lot of family and friends here so it's special.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Not -- I mean it's always in the back of your mind but you're not putting pressure on yourself, either.   
 To be here and take everything is, it's been a fun time and it's one of those things you don't know what to expect. Nobody knows.   
  
  Q. Did you ever see yourself playing at this level -- (Away from mic.)  
 COREY PERRY: You go out and try to do the same things that got you here and try to do the same things day in, day out and see where it takes you. It's kind of -- it's got me to where I want to be and hopefully there is more to come.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: You always want to build on the year before and I think it's a steady increase and hopefully it keeps increasing. You don't want to take a step backwards, you want to keep moving forward and that's what I'm trying to do.   
  
  Q. Do you have more focus and -- (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: I don't know, we match-up -- our line matches up against the other team's soft line so we go back and forth. I don't know if this will put me over the top but, you know, it definitely is something I'm happy for.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: No, no plans yet.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Well, I mean, I haven't sat down and looked at it, but obviously you do hear, and you do know who is on the list. On that trophy it's a pretty remarkable list. Like I said, it's going to take some time to sink in and we'll move on from there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Yep, I've been there a couple of times and you see all these trophies in there and all of the sudden you're holdin' one of them. It's pretty cool, it's like a dream come true, I guess.   
  
  Q. The second line -- (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Well, I think, you know, the organization has done well in drafting and you watch those guys in camp and they're going to come up and be starting and obviously you can't play forever so there's going to be changes, but hopefully it's a little later.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: I mean, you don't come in expecting it.   
 You come in and whatever happens, happens, I guess. You look at the seasons the other two had, and the only guy to break 100 points in the league in scoring, you never know what to expect. You just come in and have fun with it, I guess.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: That's for the players. They have a vote, so I didn't think about it too much. Sat back, enjoyed the show and had fun.   
  
  Q. You've got a lot of family and friends here, how many?   
 COREY PERRY: There is probably a total of 30, 35 of us. I got close relatives and then my grandma is here and my brother and all our buddies I played with. It's fun to share this with them.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Yeah, offensively those players. (No microphone.)  
  
  Q. When you hear your name it kind of shocked me and you don't really believe it, but gave my mom and dad big hugs and went up on stage.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: I'm an emotional person and it's like going back when we won the Stanley Cup, I cried after that, you know, it's just personal.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: Everything is in the past, you're always lookin' for more.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: I knew what I wanted to say and what I wanted to get across, and hopefully it came out all right.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised? (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: A little bit, you look at the different years everybody had up for this award, 100 points, second in scoring, you never know what to expect when you come to these things.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COREY PERRY: I mean, I don't know how to answer that. He had a great year. Obviously the players saw that and when you have a guy like that going out and scoring 100 points is not an easy thing to do.   
 THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.   
 COREY PERRY: Thank you.
