Q.
Q.  Pat, do you at all allow yourself to think of what you and your team are one game away from accomplishing here?
 
COACH BURNS: We haven't won anything.  We're ahead in the series, that's all.  You can ask me 20,000 questions how I feel; I don't feel anything because we haven't won anything.  
 
Q.
Q.  Pat, you've accomplished quite a bit so far going into this game.  You've got a lot to be proud of.  Are you happier on the inside than you show us on the outside?
 
COACH BURNS: It doesn't matter whether I'm happy on the inside or the outside.  I think what happens is I think this team has accomplished a lot.  I haven't accomplished anything.  I think this team has accomplished a lot.  This team has worked hard.  This team, from back in September in training camp, we've gained some strides, we've done some things.  Like I said, I'm not an overly happy person.  I wouldn't worry about that.  There is times when I am happy, and that's usually in my private life when I'm usually very happy.  I don't think anybody here wants to be my friend, anyways. 
 
Q.
Q.  Is the hardest part of being a coach, especially in this situation, is that you can only do so much and then those guys are responsible for the ultimate end?  Do you think that way, that "I can only say and do so much and then guys have to get it done for me"?
 
COACH BURNS: I have to continuously say things and talk about things and remind things, and that's my job.  That's what I have to do.  The job of coaching is not just opening the door and changing the lines.  There is some things you have to say.  There is things I have to do.  I leave my players alone.  I let them do what they feel as long as it's along the lines that we're all on the same lines of thinking.  I'm not a guy that goes in and bothers them very often.  I'm not a cheerleading type guy behind the bench.  That can wear on players after 112 games.  You don't want to hear somebody yelling and screaming behind you all the time for 112 games.  I think the players know that.  
 
Q.
Q.  Pat, how much does the playoff atmosphere make young players grow up faster than they might have at other times?
 
COACH BURNS: That's a good question, because it definitely does.  You've got to remember when the Eliases and the Gomezes were winning the Stanley Cups there was a lot of leaders on this club.  There is a lot of names that weren't there anywhere when these guys were winning that now they become the leaders of this team.  And it's very important for them to take that leadership, and they've done a great job on and off the ice.  In the dressing room, they've been very vocal at the right times.  Madden is probably the guy that really, along with Scott and those guys, has always something good to bring up.  He knows the game very well.  It's always important.  And as you see, we have a couple of young players following us around right now that could be in this lineup next year.  We have a couple of young rookies that are working it with Larry back home following the games.  Everybody has to touch this point in time in the season.  You don't get to touch it that often. 
 
Q.
Q.  Pat, any idea why home ice has been such a factor here in this series?
 
COACH BURNS: Well, nobody's ever figured that out yet, why home ice happens to be the ultimate.  When you get that rhythm at home ice, it's good to have.  I don't think in Game 6 and 7 it really makes a difference, if there is a Game  7.  I don't believe that it really makes a difference right now.  I think now it's all or nothing now.  It's how you're going to get out there and how you're going to express yourself on the ice with emotion, with discipline.  I think those are all the points that are going to be important right now.  If you look at your jersey and it happens to be a different color and that's what makes a difference, boy you're in trouble. 
 
Q.
Q.  Having so many guys on this team who have won Cups already, does that make it a lot easier for you in terms of they keep themselves on an even keel, they know what the situation is at?
 
COACH BURNS: All the credit goes to the guys who have been there before and won it before.  I have said this before, that it's very easy right now.  It's not very hard when it comes to that point.  When you have players that have won, they know the feeling, what is  -- what are their demanding factors.  There is demanding factors in this every single time you step on the ice.  Things just don't come.  You have to make them happen.  Having players like that, it's easy for me and for them to get those points across. 
 
Q.
Q.  Pat, this is as close as you've been away, 1-1 away.  Do you have an appreciation of how hard it is to get to this point and how important  --
 
COACH BURNS: Are you talking me or the team?  
 
Q.
Q.  You individually.
 
COACH BURNS: I don't really look at it that way.  It's the team.  That's what it is.  It has nothing to do with me.  I'm part of the team, and it's all for the team.  I'm not this, I'm not that; it's we.  That's the way we have always done it all year long. 
 
Q.
Q.  You have been through disappointments as a coach.  You're in an envious position.
 
COACH BURNS: How many coaches have been through disappointments?  There has been quite a few.  There has to be.  You can't have two winners every time.  Somebody has to be disappointed.  There is only so many teams during the course of the year that can win the Stanley Cup, that's one.  You don't cry.  You don't sit there and cry because it didn't happen.  You would rather smile because it did happen.  I'm proud of the fact that we're here.  I'm very proud of that, but we haven't accomplished what we want yet.  That's the most important thing, is we have to accomplish it.  We'll worry about the emotions and feelings after. 
 
Q.
Q.  A number of your guys talked a little more about what didn't happen in 2001 as opposed to what did happen in 2000.  What do you think they've kind of brought to that?
 
COACH BURNS: You will have to say what they said.  I have no idea.  I wasn't there.  That hasn't been discussed when I'm around. 
 
Q.
Q.  Which coaches do you admire the most inside and outside of hockey and which do you try to emulate?
 
COACH BURNS: I think everybody has watched Scotty (Bowman).  I think he's been a guy that all coaches have been great supporters of.  I think Bill Parcells is another guy I really admire and Bobby Knight and Norman Schwartzkopf.  There you go, that's my list. 
 
Q.
Q.  Pat, as you alluded to, more than half of your players on the team went through that 2001 situation.  They all have been saying today that there has been no talk about is that good, bad, does it matter either way?
 
COACH BURNS: I think it's a good thing.  I think the past is what happened in the past, there is not much you can do about it.  It's what's going to happen in the future.  I think the players are right to do that.  This is a different bunch.  Not everybody, but there is quite a few guys different here.  I think we have to worry about tomorrow.  And if we have a Monday, we'll have to worry about Monday. 
 
Q.
Q.  If Joe warms up tomorrow?
 
COACH BURNS: I'm not going to stop him.  That's for sure.  If he feels fine, I'm not going to stop him.  
 
Q.
Q.  Any chance?
 
COACH BURNS: I don't know.  If he can skate warm up and he's ready, I'll play him for sure.
