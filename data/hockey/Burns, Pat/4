Q.  Coach, Did you have any reaction to the hit on Paul Kariya?
 
COACH BURNS: I just saw it.  It was a clean hit.  The League advised everybody, I believe, of that, so it's a clean hit. 
 
Q.  Pat, what was the basic difference between the last game in terms of either your team's play or Anaheim's play?
 
COACH BURNS: They were a far better team on the ice than we were tonight.  We took retaliatory penalties.  They get you in the back.  They're good at it.  They give you a little shot here and there.  We retaliated tonight.  That's not us.  We usually don't do that.  I was surprised our team did that tonight. 
 
Q.  A lot of us were surprised to see Kariya back in the game.  Were you, after a hit like that?
 
COACH BURNS: I didn't see the hit happen at all.  I was getting ready to put players on the ice.  He came back for a pretty nice goal too.  Obviously he's not that hurt. 
 
Q.  How come each team all of a sudden has found a way to score some goals?
 
COACH BURNS: Well, their first goal was probably the one that really hurt us, went off Scott and there was not much Marty could do on that one.  Then it seems to be that the one or two seems to get the ball rolling.  Did the same thing last game.  We got a couple and all of a sudden the ball rolled our way.  Tonight they had it going their way. 
 
Q.  The other coach said he didn't have the puck?
 
COACH BURNS: It doesn't matter what Mike Babcock says.  The League says it's a clean hit and I'm satisfied with that.  I'm not going to comment on what he said, that's for sure.
