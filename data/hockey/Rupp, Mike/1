 Q.   Were you surprised they called a penalty on your hit on Harrold?  
MIKE RUPP:   Yes, I was.  
   
 Q.   How important is it now for Game 5 to sort of let all that stuff go in the third period and start fresh and the emotions?  
MIKE RUPP:   I don't think it's anything that I need to let go or our team needs to let go.   We're focused on a three‑game series and we've got two of those games at home.   So we're confident in that.   And we faced that the first two rounds.   So we're going to go at the same way.  
   
 Q.   Do you take something out of the fact that McDonagh dropped the gloves and you hit Harrold, you guys were showing signs of even a slow start, showing the fight that you need to continue to show?  
MIKE RUPP:   It's got to be more than incidents like that to‑‑ we know we have that in this room.   I don't know that we have to do things to let them know, but we just have to get to our game.   
And we play a particular way and we have that swagger to our game.   It's pretty evident we're clicking on all cylinders.   So that's our goal right now is we have a good practice today and get to that tomorrow.
