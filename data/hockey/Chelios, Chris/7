CHRIS CHELIOS:  I like Boston, I mean I used to love coming in here.  Those were great games; especially a great game with Montreal.  I know I don't have many good friends here, but the ones I have are good ones. 
 

Q.  You are the kind of guy who played for the Bruins and they love you; but you don't, so they hate you?
 
CHRIS CHELIOS:  Now that I have gone about five years from Montreal I think a lot of them have forgotten about me.  It is kind of nice.  It is nice to come back here with the kids.  I have a lot of friends in the city.  I really enjoy the city.  I am looking forward to this weekend. 
 

Q.  Quite a family man?
 
CHRIS CHELIOS:  I have got Jake and Dean and this is our first game.  I don't know how many I have got left in me so I figured they all have to know what it is all about.  They are going to enjoy it too.
