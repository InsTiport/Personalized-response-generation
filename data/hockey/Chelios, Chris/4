Q.  What was it like in the locker room getting ready for this one?
 
CHRIS CHELIOS: Very quiet.  Like I said before, we were a low-key team.  We didn't want to make that much from the last game we played in Colorado.  Everything went right for us. 
 
Q.  You've won a Stanley Cup before.  What's it like to be going back to the finals?
 
CHRIS CHELIOS: Like I said, we got an opportunity.  It's been a long time.  We have been trying all year.  We have to go play against a good team in Carolina. 
 
Q.  What are you guys in for in Carolina?
 
CHRIS CHELIOS: Knocking off Colorado, we knocked off the champions.  It issue give us some confidence going into that series.
