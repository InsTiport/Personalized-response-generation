   THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Any of you guys, how emotional Game 1 was, even though the two teams don't have a playoff history, just staying disciplined, maybe not letting the crowd get you too excited or the particular situation you find yourself in going into Game 2.   
 CHRISTIAN EHRHOFF: I think going into our first game, it's pretty tough to keep your emotions in check. Obviously for most players it was the first game on that stage. So you probably saw that a little bit on all the penalties that were taken.   
 Now that we got the first game out of the way, I think everybody is going to be a little more comfortable in Game 2.   
  
  Q. Christian, how does it affect the D if Dan is not able to play? Does it mean that even though you'll have six defensemen, the five guys will have to do a lot in a way they did when Dan went out of the game in Game 1?   
 CHRISTIAN EHRHOFF: No, I don't think so. Our team was built on a strong and deep defense. We've used it all year long with different guys being out at different times.   
 Yeah, everybody can play with everybody, so it's not a big adjustment we have to make. Obviously whoever comes in has to step up and play some big minutes. That's what we've done all year.   
  
  Q. Daniel, now that you've had one game of exposure to Chara under your belt, what were your impressions?   
 DANIEL SEDIN: Yeah, I mean, I said all along he's one of the top defensemen in this league. Like you said, he's got a long stick. You got to get close to him and try to use that to your advantage, move the puck quick and move your feet. That's the only way you can beat him.   
 I thought we had some good chances last game. Weren't able to beat Tim Thomas. I think that's going to be the key tonight to score some goals.
