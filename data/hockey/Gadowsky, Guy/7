THE MODERATOR:   We will start with Penn State head coach Guy Gadowsky with an opening statement.   
COACH GADOWSKY:   I thought it was an excellent hockey game.   I'm glad we won.   
THE MODERATOR:   We'll take questions for the players.   
   
 Q.   Zach, take us through the faceoff and the goal.   
ZACH SAAR:   You know, I think we ran a quick shot kind of.   Our center, Dylan Richard, did a great job of giving us an opportunity to get the puck.   Kind of just let it fly.   Normal shot, it went in, so...   
   
 Q.   Zach, talk about the confidence coach has in your line.   Seems like it was a pretty tight environment, to be able to come up with a play like that?  
ZACH SAAR:   Definitely.   Just a lot of hockey.   It's funny because we probably ran that kind of scheme on the faceoff countless times and I've never gotten it.   Coach always has the faith in us to keep doing it.   Sure enough, tonight it goes in.   
We're very happy.   
   
 Q.   Matt, the non‑goal that kind of danced on the line a little bit, when you saw that happening, what was going through your mind?   
MATTHEW SKOFF:   I had a few choice words that I wouldn't say right now.   
I mean, I guess the hockey gods had our back on that play.   You're exactly right, it was literally dancing on the line.   I turned around, I think it was Eric Scheid that came up with the big kick save.   So it was good.   
   
 Q.   Guy, what have you been able to do against Michigan?  
COACH GADOWSKY:   I don't think it's Michigan.   I think we've played pretty good hockey.   A couple games we've gotten bounces, a couple we haven't gotten bounces and we lost.   
Today we happened to get a bounce and we did a couple times against Michigan early.   But I think we've been playing pretty well.   
   
 Q.   Is this the type of win that helps build a program?  
MATTHEW SKOFF:   Yeah, I mean, first playoff win in Big Ten history for us.   I mean, first playoff.   That's going to be looked at as a huge gain for the program in the future, so yeah.   
ZACH SAAR:   We've got goals as a program.   These are the types of games we look to win on a regular basis in the future.   Yeah, it was a good step for us as a team.   
   
 Q.   Zach, being from the state of Michigan, growing up there, is there something special about beating that team?  
ZACH SAAR:   Yes, definitely.   I definitely grew up watching Michigan hockey, Michigan State hockey, Western Michigan.   It's always special to be on the same ice as them.   Dream come true really, so...   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you to the players.   
We'll continue with questions for coach.   
   
 Q.   I asked Zach about the confidence you have in your fourth line.   Can you talk about that.   You have to roll four lines in a double overtime probably.   
COACH GADOWSKY:   They're not our fourth line.   Zach has a tremendous shot, as you know.   But you've got also Rocket Richard is as good a defensive forward as you can, so is Tommy Olczyk.   Either in the offensive zone as you saw it but also the defensive zone, so that's why you saw them playing so much.   
   
 Q.   What does this type of win do for your program?   You touched on how you were coming here to learn.   What did you learn from a game like this?  
COACH GADOWSKY:   I think we learned that we have guys with a lot of heart.   I really like the fact that we were playing an excellent game and we allowed them to tie it up relatively late.   I don't think our demeanor changed that much.   I think that's something we learned.  
I think it took us a while to sort of understand the mental strength it takes to play programs like Michigan and the other great programs in the Big Ten.   Obviously those experiences helped us along the way.   We've been in a lot of close games.   
I think what we learned today is we learned something along the season.   
   
 Q.   Scheid, you said something to him.   
COACH GADOWSKY:   I didn't know who it was.   It all happened pretty quickly.   Some of the defensemen said that Scheid was unbelievable.   I went to hear what he had to say about it, asked him if he played soccer, that's all (laughter).   He said, "No, never.   I said that he should."
