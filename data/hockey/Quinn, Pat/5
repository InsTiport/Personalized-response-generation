Q.  Can you talk about the game?
 
COACH QUINN:   Well, we've had trouble generating a lot of good chances against this team.  We didn't really play our game tonight.  We started to get more in the second and the third, but we also gave up a couple put us behind the 8-ball.  They played well defensively, and we have not had our offensive game in sorts, obviously, because of their good play. 
 
Q.  And how do you feel health-wise?
 
COACH QUINN:   I feel fine.  I wouldn't have shown up if I wasn't assured everything was fine and I didn't feel good myself.
