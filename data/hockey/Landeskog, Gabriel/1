 Q.   I noticed you were nervous coming into this.   
GABRIEL LANDESKOG:   Yeah, I mean, it was pretty special feeling.   But I did get pretty nervous before.   
It didn't help that I didn't have my belt.   I forgot my belt back in Sweden.   So it didn't help.   But it was good.   We solved that problem and that was fine.   
   
 Q.   (Question off Microphone)?  
GABRIEL LANDESKOG:   I did, I guess my focus was elsewhere, but I did get to borrow a belt from my good friend and agent, Peter Wallen, so he saved me on that one.   
   
 Q.   Talk about achievement, what it means to you.   
GABRIEL LANDESKOG:   It's an honor to just be in the group of all the great players that have won this award previously.   My good old friend Jeff Skinner, and there's a lot of them.   Peter Forsberg, Alfredsson are two of the Swedish guys, and it's a pretty special feeling and tough to describe right now.  
   
 Q.   It wasn't easy winning it given the other two guys.   They were pretty...  
GABRIEL LANDESKOG:   Like I said, in my speech, they're two great players.   They definitely‑‑ I mean, to me, Ryan would have won it unless he didn't get hurt, and if you come to the Playoffs, I think Adam would have won it.   So like I said, two great players and really great guys.   
   
 Q.   (Question off Microphone)?  
GABRIEL LANDESKOG:   I mean, that's tough.   I don't know if I want to look that far ahead, trying to take one day at a time, like I said before.   And I'm trying to enjoy it.   Trying to soak it all in.   I'm here right now and my focus is just to get better for next year.   And I think that's the key to have a successful career, not look too far ahead and just live in the moment.   I know it's cliche but that's the way it goes.
