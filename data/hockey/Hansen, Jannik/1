   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jannik.   
 JANNIK HANSEN: We know we're one win away now. The fourth one has proven the hardest one so far to get. We know there's a long way to go before we can take anything for granted.  
  
  Q. Why so tough to win in Boston?   
 JANNIK HANSEN: I don't know why it was so tough. We definitely didn't play our game, the way we'd like to. We've been a good road team all year and through the playoffs as well.   
 For some reason we didn't find that game the first two games in Boston.  
  
  Q. (Question regarding being the most hated team in the league.)  
 JANNIK HANSEN: Couldn't care less about what other people think. It's about the guys in the room, the fans of the team, the family. That's what matters for us.  
  
  Q. How important is it that you stay away from all of the extra stuff?   
 JANNIK HANSEN: It's important to try to play in between whistles, stay away from the scrums, play in the game. That's what we're most interested in.   
  
  Q. Does the ice in Boston make it difficult for your speed?  
 JANNIK HANSEN: You see bad ice a lot of different places in this league, so it shouldn't have any effect. At least we shouldn't let it have.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Alex Burrows.
