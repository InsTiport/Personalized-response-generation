 Q.   Can you talk about the feeling you guys had on the bench while Greg was still on the ice for a minute and obviously very hurt?   
TOREY KRUG:   Yeah, it was tough to watch that, a guy like Gregory, he's a warrior.   He's everything that a Bruin hockey player represents.   To watch him out there hobbling on one leg, it's tough to watch, and obviously you want to come back and bounce back for him and win the game for him.   So it was good for us.  
   
 Q.   Tuukka Rask stood on his head once again.   Does anything surprise you anymore with him?  
TOREY KRUG:   I don't think much surprises me anymore.   It's great because there may be a breakdown in our system, one layer unfolds, but Tuukey is back there and he's going to make a big save for you.   It's awesome having that kind of confidence in your goaltender and it kind of takes a little bit of pressure off your overall game.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel any other pressure knowing you're one win away from the Stanley Cup Finals?  
TOREY KRUG:   I don't think it's any more pressure.   I think if anything it helps us dial in a little bit more.   We're one win away from where we want to be at the end of the season, and we're going to come in tomorrow as a focused group.
