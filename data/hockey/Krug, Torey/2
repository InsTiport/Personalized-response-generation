  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TOREY KRUG:   I'd probably try again in the future.   I would just execute it differently. 
For me, playing that way, you have to have a shortâ€‘term memory.   I think the best players do.   I'll quickly forget about it.   I'll learn from it. 

Q.   If your game is really a risky game, what have coaches told you about that?
TOREY KRUG:   Yeah, you have to make sure that you're taking care of business to be risky.   I think defensively, you know, if you can't recover from those risks, then you're not going to be able to take those risks and get ice time. 
For me, it's becoming more reliable, accountable.   Definitely I developed down in Providence like that. 

Q.   It's more fun to be risky?
TOREY KRUG:   It is.   High risk, high reward.
