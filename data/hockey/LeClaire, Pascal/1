Q.  Pascal, being Columbus is only a year old, they haven't had time to build depth in the organization.  Do you feel that even as a goaltender you can get into the League very quickly in that scenario?
 
PASCAL LECLAIRE: That's a hard question for me to say.  I think Columbus has two great goalies right now with Denis and Columbus.  Only thing I can do is work really hard to achieve my goals with the team.  I'm fortunate to be in the organization and really excited to be drafted by them, but that will be their decision, what to do with me, but I'm excited to be there. 
 

Q.  Were you surprised at all that they went after you with Tugnutt and Denis, still a young goalie; were you surprised they took you?
 
PASCAL LECLAIRE: I don't know.  I didn't really look at all the current roster or anything.  I mean I didn't really look at that.  I'm not really surprised.  I mean I talked to Columbus a few times this week.  I talked to other teams a few times, too.  So it was really hard for me to say where I was going to go, even this morning like nobody knew what was going to happen, so it was a surprise maybe for you guys, I don't know, but I'm really happy and it's a nice surprise to me, though. 
 

Q.  What kind of feeling is it inside, though, when you're expecting, waiting for your name to be called and finally you do hear it?
 
PASCAL LECLAIRE: It's pretty weird.  I mean like the cameras came out before they said my name, and my agent gave me a wink.  So it's really exciting.  I've been working really hard to get here today, and my family is here and I mean that's great.  It's really exciting.  I was shaking a little bit when they said my name and when I walked up on the podium, but it's just great.  It's really hard to describe.
