Q.   How does it feel to be chosen for a big market, big city, big team, and wearing the jersey?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   It's the best feeling in the world.   So happy right now.   Words can't describe.

Q.   What was it like when you heard your name called?   Take us through the emotions. 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   It's feelings that I've probably never had before, so it was a great moment for me and my family.

Q.   Did you have any sense that you might be picked there?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Yeah, I mean, I didn't have any idea where I was going to go in the draft, so the meetings were with all the teams, so going into the draft I didn't really have a feel for what was going on.

Q.   What has this week been like for you?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   It's been a great week just taking it all in and enjoying every minute of it.

Q.   Did you get a sense that they might be going after you?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I mean, they don't really let you in too much, but I think they were pretty‑‑ now in the last meeting here, they said they would probably take me if I was still there.

Q.   How close are you to being NHL ready?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I'd say my goal is for next year, but if that doesn't happen, probably I'll go back to Sweden or play in the AHL.

Q.   Are you aware of the Swedish history of the Toronto Maple Leafs?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Of course.

Q.   Which is the greatest Swedish player on this side in your mind?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I don't know, there are so many.   It's hard to play pick one.

Q.   For those of you who don't know your game, can you describe what type of player you are?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I like to score goals and make plays and work hard on both ends of the ice.

Q.   Where do you think you have to get better?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I think every aspect of the game can be improved.   There's nothing single that I try to work on.   It's everything.

Q.   There's some scouts who considered you the best talent in the draft.   How would you respond to that? 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   It's a really cool thing to hear from all the scouts.   That's something that I try to keep on working on every day.   It's nothing I take for granted.

Q.   Is it true you're a free agent, like you can't sign wherever you want in Sweden?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I can sign wherever, no contract.

Q.   Do you think you'll come to North America next year?   Is that the plan?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Yeah, we'll see what Toronto wants and what they think.   It's not up to me, it's up to Toronto and what they think is the best fit for me. 

Q.   After playing in the men's league last season, partially last season, do you think you can handle yourself against men? 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I mean, I have never played at the NHL level, so it's hard to say what it will be like, but I'm pretty sure it might help me a little bit making the transition over if I get the chance in the NHL. 

Q.   (Inaudible) what's he done for you as a person?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   He's always helped me over the years teaching me‑‑ especially playing with him the last year, going on the ice early, 30 minutes before practice, working on small things, stick handling, shooting, and then gym afterwards and before practice, so he's been a big influence on me. 

Q.   What are your memories of your dad playing hockey in the NHL? 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   There are lots, just sitting in front of the TV watching him play, going in the locker rooms after games, going to the practice facility.   I've grown up around the rink. 

Q.   You grew up in the States then, I guess, right?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Yeah, I moved back when I was 14.

Q.   Back to Sweden when you were 14?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Yes.

Q.   So you must have played a lot of hockey in the States, as well, then?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   Of course, yes.

Q.   Do you consider yourself almost like a hybrid, North American and Europe?
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I don't know, it's hard to say.   I mean, I really notice a big difference between going back and playing the big and small ice shape.

Q.   (Inaudible). 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   We had a lot of tournaments there, every May there were a couple tournaments we would go to.   Bauer Select and teams like that.

Q.   Was it a relief not to be picked by a team where your dad played over here? 
WILLIAM NYLANDER:   I don't think it was a relief.   It was just‑‑ I didn't really think about that at all.   I was just really happy to be selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs.
