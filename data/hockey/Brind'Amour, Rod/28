 ROD BRIND-AMOUR: We were battling for first place all year, so, you can't get this guy
on one line. Obviously, you have got to have a superstar. And we do. He has got to be
playing really well. And, he is. 
 
Q. How about the physicality, I mean --
 
 ROD BRIND-AMOUR: Yeah, even this year, he came into his own. I think just from getting
the opportunity. He has always been there. He is a good player. He just never got the
chance, I think. Now he is getting a lot of ice time and he has produced for us. Great to
see. He deserves it. 
 
Q. What is the one thing that concerns you the most about playing the Red Wings?
 
 ROD BRIND-AMOUR: Well, I think their depth. You can't relax. I think the other teams we
have played, we will gear up on Lemieux and you will gear up on Jagr, then you had to gear
up on Gretzky and Leetch, but you never had too much to worry about with the other guys as
much. Now, I can't take a minute break.
