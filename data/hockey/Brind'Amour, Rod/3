 Q.  You got the Stanley Cup.  I know you said yesterday as this team goes so do you sometimes.  You felt you had to play a lot better tonight.  How much better do you think you played? 
 ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  Well, my game wasn't so great but, man, this team, they don't give up.  When their back's against the wall that's when we play our best.  All year I can't say enough. 
 So many deserving guys for this Cup, couldn't have gone to a better team. 

 Q.  Looked like you might have left it a little too late, but the way the team played in Game 5 were you certain that you could find a way tonight? 
 ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  We knew once we -- we had to wait to get our backs against the wall.  We knew we had a couple in the bag and tonight we -- we just played our butts off and what more can you say. 

 Q.  What do you at think defines the Stanley Cup drive of the Carolina Hurricanes, what one thing? 
 ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  Desire.  We wanted it.  We wanted it.  Too many guys that were not going to be denied.  We have too many guys that sacrificeed their whole careers and this is the time.
