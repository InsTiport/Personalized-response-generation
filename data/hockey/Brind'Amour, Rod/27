Q.  You guys played here two games in your place.  Do the two wins surprise you?
 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  It doesn't surprise me.  Obviously we wanted to win at home.  They are a great team.  Just because you are at home, it doesn't guarantee you a win.  And, it doesn't guarantee them a win when we go into their building. 
 

Q.  Is this team's confidence shaken?  You have had two different goalies.
 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  No, I mean, these guys are changing all year.  If maybe one guy had been there one year like some teams, then all of a sudden you make a change, but these guys are in and out all year.  That has nothing to do with it. 
 

Q.  (INAUDIBLE)
 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  I don't know if we have got really up ever in the series.  We are fighting from behind, it seems like, all the time we have got to get ahead and see how the game develops that way.  It is tough to come from behind all the time. 
 

Q.  Can you talk about what you can do?
 
ROD BRIND'AMOUR:  We have got to get some goals offensively 5 on 5, need strength to beat this team.  Not going to do it on special teams.
