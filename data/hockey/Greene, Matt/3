  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
MATT GREENE:   He's found a way.   You got to find a way to stick around, stay in the lineup.   He did that with his offense early on.   He scored some huge goals for us, did a great job on the power play.   He still has.   He still is doing a great job of moving pucks, being a real confident player playing with the puck.   
That's what set him apart this year and got him a spot in the lineup.   He's been doing a great job.   Continue doing it.   
   
 Q.   How much does confidence play, especially for a young player?  
MATT GREENE:   It's huge.   You want to get on a roll.   When things are going great, you want to maintain that.   He's been doing that all year.   
   
 Q.   Jake said he was growing out the beard to get that mean streak.   He's complimented your game.   Have you helped him develop that mean streak?  
MATT GREENE:   He's got it.   It's a different league.   You have to pick and choose your spots a little bit more.   The guys up here are a little bit better, a little bit more skilled.   They can make you pay for it.   
He's done a great job in developing the physical side of his game, too.   The offense came first.   He's a big guy, big body.   I think he's going to grow into that, as well.  
   
 Q.   It was tough for us, but how about for you, watching Jeff talk yesterday?   
MATT GREENE:   You never want to see someone take that much abuse.   He can mumble his way through anything.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a chance to see the Campbell play last night?  
MATT GREENE:   Yeah.   I saw a highlight of it.   Pretty cool.   Pretty special.   It's a lot of heart out of him.   
   
 Q.   Ever been anywhere near anything like that for yourself?  
MATT GREENE:   No.   I try to stay away from those situations at all costs.
