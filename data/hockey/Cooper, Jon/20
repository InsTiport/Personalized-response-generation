 Q. You knew they'd come out playing and give you a big push, knowing how important this game was. What did you see from them in the second and third period to really kind of take control of a lot of the chances there?   
COACH COOPER: Well, I'd say the third period. The second period, what were the shots, like 8-7? It was kind of a ho hum, nothing period really.   
But second game in a row in the third period, we're just not generating enough. We're -- especially tonight, we were a little bit opportunistic. I mean, we had some big time chances, especially last couple shifts in that third period, but we were just too much one and done and not taking advantage of what we're good at. We do it in spurts, but we haven't done it for six periods now against these guys.   
But ultimately, you know, we got one of them. I don't want to sit here and say, oh, well, we did our thing. We got one. We came here to get two, and we had -- albeit, we may not have been the better team tonight, but we were one shot away. So it's unfortunate the way it turned out. But we've got to up our game moving forward here.  
   
 Q. If I can follow up, what can you say about Vasi and what he did tonight. I know you aren't surprised, but -- and how much confidence that can give you guys moving forward.   
COACH COOPER: He's outstanding. You never want to lose your number one guy in Bish, but you've got one A-plus right behind him, and he was -- I thought he was outstanding tonight and probably the reason why that game went to overtime in the first place.  
   
 Q. Coach, is there an update on Callahan? Everyone was kind of surprised to not see him come out for warmups.   
COACH COOPER: Yeah, he's got the flu really bad. I'm not even sure Callahan's moved from his bed all day. I felt awful for him. The ultimate gamer is Ryan Callahan, and you know when he couldn't get himself out of bed, that's an unfortunate loss for us at a time when we need him. So hopefully, he'll be okay for the next game.   
   
 Q. Jon, what did you think of Stralman in his first game back?   
COACH COOPER: I think it took him a couple shifts just -- you know, you've got to get hit. You've got to feel the puck. You've got to feel the pace. But other than that, Stralman is Stralman. He's a thinking man's defenseman. He knows where to be. And I just thought he got stronger as he went on.   
I think him scoring that goal too was big for him to feel like he was right back into the game. He's a really important player for us, and for us to move on out of this series, we're going to need him.
