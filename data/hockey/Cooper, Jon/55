New York   5
  Tampa   1

Q.   How did you see the second period unfold there, where obviously you guys had a pretty good run of play, but they ended up scoring one more goal? 
COACH COOPER:   I don't know.   How did you see it play out?   How did you see it play out? 

Q.   (No Microphone)?
COACH COOPER:   Okay, so I'll start with that.   Maybe some tough luck.   I thought for‑‑ well, I'll go beyond the second period.   I thought for 45 minutes, we did everything but put the puck in the net, and we had some really good looks. 
It's tough to have a period like we did in the second period.   Nine times out of 10, you're coming out with the lead probably by multiple goals.   Instead you come out of that, like you lose the period.   It doesn't happen very often. 
We've been on both sides of that.   We've been in situations where we've scored a bunch of goals in those situations, and we've been a team that's given up or been in the Rangers' shoes and come out on top.   It's how you fight through it after that. 
I thought we opened up the third period pretty well, and I think when they got that fourth one, it took a little air out of our sails, and that was it after that.

Q.   Another whacky goal or two here and there, but ten goals in the last two games that you've guys have given up.   Overall, what have you seen from your defensive coverage in front? 
COACH COOPER:   It's a funny game.   It's a best of seven series.   I think with the skill and the speed of these two teams, where you're going to sit here and see 1‑0 or 2‑1 games the whole time?   I don't think so. 
People are going to wake up in the morning and look at the box score and say, oh, wow, Tampa got waxed.   But I think if you were in the building, you probably wouldn't see it that way. 
We had our looks.   I don't know.   Could you ask for anything more in the first five minutes than to have Kucherov and Johnson by themselves in front of the net?   One we blow wide and one we hit off the cross bar, and things like that happen.   It's how you respond, and I thought we responded extremely well. 
The chances, I didn't think we gave up a whole lot to be honest, until probably the last 15 minutes of the game.   Nash's first one, he makes a good move, but he hit the post and goes off Bish's leg and in. 
I don't even know who scored the second one.   I don't even remember the second one. 
The third one I clearly remember.   That's going ten feet wide.   How often does that happen?   So I don't know if that's really our coverage, to be honest.   I think they had some breaks, and you've got to give the Rangers credit, they made the best of them, and we didn't make the best of ours.   That's plain and simple. 
But I'll take our effort.   Until the game kind of got out of hand a little bit, I'll take that effort any day of the week.   I'll take our chances.
