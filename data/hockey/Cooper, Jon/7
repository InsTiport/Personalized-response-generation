  COACH COOPER: Before we get going, there's a lot more people here than normal, don't ask about the lineup at all because I don't know. Anyway, go ahead. Now that we set that straight. Questions about Game 7?

Q. You can't tell us if even Steven Stamkos will be available to play? 
COACH COOPER: Questions about Game 7. Let's go. 

Q. If you have a full complement of players to choose from, and Steven Stamkos plays, what kind of role do you envision him playing? What kind of impact could he possibly make on a Game 7? 
COACH COOPER: If Stamkos, when he's -- and he's played hundreds of games with me as his coach. He's played center, wing, he's killed penalties, he's played in the power play, and the rest of the time he's sitting on the bench with me. So he's pretty much done it all except for play goal. So that's what he does when he plays, and he's really good at it -- at all those. 
The worst thing he does is sit on the bench. That's what he's worst at. Other than that, that's what he does.

Q. Do you expect he'd be really good then in Game 7 apart from sitting on the bench? 
COACH COOPER: You guys are fishing. Listen, we're preparing to put the best team possible on the ice to win Game 7. There's going to be guys that cannot play. I know you're looking for -- you want to see if everybody that's -- that plays tonight, they're cleared to play and ready to go. 
As I said, our guys are concentrating on winning Game 7. This is, you know, the top couple games of our careers as a group together, and we're going to put our best foot forward. And if Stamkos is in the lineup, it's our best foot forward, and if he's not in the lineup, it's because he wasn't eligible to play.
