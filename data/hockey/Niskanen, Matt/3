 Q.  Matt Niskanen, one of the bright young players surprised a few players in the National Hockey League.  You and Sergei Zubov in Dallas have become just a tremendous pair.  What's made that work? 
 MATT NISKANEN:  He makes it work, I guess.  He's an unbelievable player.  I think he's even having one of his best years as of late.  I'm just kind of trying to support him the best I can. 
 I think we read off each other pretty well and make a lot of good plays.  He makes my job so much easier, so. 

 Q.  You grew up in northern Minnesota.  Did you have an idol growing up? 
 MATT NISKANEN:  Yeah, yeah.  I liked Lemieux in Pittsburgh, and I also because of the Northstars and when they moved to Dallas, I liked Mike Modano, so definitely my two favorite players growing up.  The flashy scorers.  When you're a young kid, that is who you really like to follow. 

 Q.  Were you a forward growing up?  As a defenseman, you had two players that were forwards as your idols.  What is with that? 
 MATT NISKANEN:  Yeah, I've always played defense, but at the same time I always wanted to be a forward.  I was pretty offensive always growing up.  Really could look at those guys and see the offensive skills they have and really idolize them, I guess. 

 Q.  What forward are you looking forward to meeting here at the All-Star Game? 
 MATT NISKANEN:  Oh, all of them.  I mean there are going to be so many good players here in one barn, it's going to be great.  I can't wait to meet all the guys I can.  What an exciting time for myself. 

 Q.  Good luck the second half of the season.  Best of the success the rest of the way.
