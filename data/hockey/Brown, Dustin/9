  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Brown.   
   
 Q.   Better results on the power play the last two games.   Anything you attribute that to?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   Line combos instead of power play combos.   I don't know if that had anything to do with it.   Ultimately we're getting shots to the net.   
   
 Q.   People have said both teams look tired.   Does it look like that from where you're sitting?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   I think it's been a long, long playoffs obviously.   Emotionally and physically you're going to be tired.   It's a matter of finding the next gear.   
I think it's pretty much an even playing ground when you consider fatigue because each teams have gone through three series and are battling as hard as they can.   
It's really about just finding the next gear.   The team that does normally wins.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel any different going into your second chance of winning the Cup as the first one?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   I guess yes, to answer your question.   It's the same with closing out a series.   We had that first opportunity, did kind of move on to the next round and relax, pretty excited about it.   Not to say that we're any less excited, but you're maybe a little more evenâ€‘keeled about it, Game5, for us.   
   
 Q.   Is that just by nature?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   Yeah, I think there was a letdown after not sealing the deal in Game4 with our home crowd.   Everyone wakes up the next morning and understands the situation we're in, not only the opportunity but the responsibility to be better in Game 5.  
   
 Q.   How about Greener's play?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   He plays hard.   He wasn't one of the guys you wanted to play against because he played you physical, hard and honest.   He's been doing that for us all year.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Dustin.
