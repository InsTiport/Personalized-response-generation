    THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Dustin, take us through your winning goal, how you saw it off of Mitchell's stick?
    DUSTIN BROWN:   I think it started on the forecheck.   I'm not sure what defenseman it is.   I just kind of chipped it behind him and got it around him. 
    I picked up the puck and I gave it to Mitch and just circled high, went around the net.   I'm not sure what kind of happened in the high area there.   I went to the net and kind of skated away from the net as he was shooting.   I got a piece of it. 

Q.   Jarret, after wins like this, you say you can't keep doing this.   It really seems like you can.   Is there a mindset that when you get into these situations, since you've done it so much, the confidence is overwhelming?
    JARRET STOLL:   I guess you look at the results, but we shouldn't because it's the way we play. 
    Are we playing good or are we not?   Right now we're doing a lot of things that aren't in our game, haven't been in our game for years here.   We're getting away with it I think right now. 
    Don't get me wrong, we did a lot of good things to come back.   Down 2‑0, down 4‑2.   Resiliency to come back and battle and push and pull everybody into it, battle for that tying goal and the winning goal again. 
    It's just how we're playing.   We've got to be honest with how we're playing.   We know we got more. 

Q.   Dustin, you made mention of live by the sword, die by the sword.   How concerned are you with this team's ability to get going at the beginning of games?
    DUSTIN BROWN:   I'm not really that concerned because I understand that we can't do it, but I also understand the type of guys we have in our room.   I know we've been through a lot of emotional ups and downs. 
    Again, I'm confident in our group, that we can sort it out and figure it out.   We're all well aware of what Stolly just said.   In saying that, we're also aware of the type of team we are, how good we can be.   It's just a matter of resetting, reloading and dialing it in for Game3. 

Q.   Was there a sense that maybe Quick deserved better?   Four TV plays for him. 
    DUSTIN BROWN:   Some of the goals, especially the first goal, he had zero chance on.   Stolly had a good lane on it, it went through his legs somehow, found its way in the net.   They had a few goals where Quicky didn't have a chance. 
    We tie the game, he makes a save on Brassard. 
    JARRET STOLL:   It's a game of mistakes.   We made some mistakes on those goals, they're in our net.   You're not going to blame your goalie.   They made some mistakes that made it into their net.   I'm sure that's what they'll say. 

Q.   Jarret, you seem to have this never‑ending well of persistence.   How much does Dustin define what you guys are all about?
    JARRET STOLL:   Well, we all know what type of player he is.   It's pretty black and white.   Hard, physical, leads by his play.   You know, big part of our team, huge part of our team.   No other guy should have the C on his jersey, that's for sure.   Big goals, big plays.   He does it all. 

Q.   Dustin, how satisfying is it that all your grinding culminates with this kind of double overtime victory, a crazy game?
    DUSTIN BROWN:   I think probably 'satisfy' is not the right word for the first two games.   I think the way we play, everyone is talking about how we come back.   I think it's more how we turn the tide of the game over the course of the game. 
    We're not worried about scoring the game‑winning goal.   We're worried about just playing our game, grinding away. 
    It starts with one.   That's what our mentality is.   Whether we're down two, up two, the situation doesn't change for us.   Where we have faltered is at the start of games, the last three games really. 
    The mentality of our team is very black and white.   We've been missing that in the first period.   Again, in saying that, our mentality, it allows us to stay in games and to kind of turn the tide over the course of the game, has allowed us to come back. 
    We have to get back to it at the start of games. 

Q.   Jarret, you talk about maybe not getting away with it if you don't step it up a bit.   Does it remind you a bit of the Anaheim series when you were up 2‑0?   They turned that series around. 
    JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, I think so.   It's good teams.   They're in the Stanley Cup Final.   They went through a lot.   They're a good team. 
    We never expected this to be an easy series or a short series.   It's going to be a long series.   It's going to be a very tough series. 
    There's a lot of momentum swings within a series, within a game obviously. 
    Yeah, I think it's similar to that.   But, you know, maybe totally different, too, in a way, different teams, different scenarios. 
    We just got to keep pushing and throw our best game at 'em in Game3.   That hasn't been there yet.   We have to go in MSG and have a simple, smart, physical road game, grind it out again, do whatever it takes to win a game. 
    We've put ourselves in that situation a lot in the last two months.   We just got to win a game.   It's no different again going into Game3.   We'll be ready to go. 

Q.   Jarret, you mention MSG.   What are your thoughts about playing there?
    JARRET STOLL:   It's going to be cool.   It's going to be great.   I'm definitely excited about it.   It's quite the building.   A lot of history in that building.   You see all the highlights of those classic games they show on TV like '94.   It was rocking.   It's going to be exciting to play there. 
    We want to go in and play well, too.   Otherwise it's not going to be much fun either way.   We want to go in and play well and win a game. 

Q.   Dustin, you have now played 13 periods in the last three games combined.   As the captain, knowing there was an NBA game where dehydration played a factor, can you speak to what overtime does to staying mentally and physically focused?
    DUSTIN BROWN:   I think overtime games, it's an extension of our normal game.   When you are able to play six defensemen, four lines, it goes a long way in games where you go into multiple overtimes. 
    The other side of that is we don't rely on one guy or any two, three guys.   We have a team that each night, I mean, if you look at it over the course of these playoffs, we found big games from different players each night. 
    We share the workload which makes it a lot easier collectively on us as a team.   Again, short shifts, being able to use 20 players, 19 players, goes a long way. 

Q.   Dustin, what has Mitchell meant to your run this year? 
    DUSTIN BROWN:   Mitchy, we missed him last year, him being out.   It changed the dynamic of the back end.   Where I think he makes a very big difference obviously is his defensive coverage, PK.   He's very hard to play against down low. 
    You know, tonight you get an added bonus with him making a difference on the offensive side of the puck.   His bread and butter is down low and PK. 

Q.   Dustin, you talked about the mentality of this team.   I'm wondering if that is not the key to everything here.   It seems you play the same way whether you're up two goals, down two goals.   It just seems like the template is always there and you seem to follow it. 
    DUSTIN BROWN:   I mean, that again is part of our so‑called mentality.   We're not focused on the end result.   We're worried about our next shift.   If you want to break it down even further, it goes to an individual getting ready for the games, doing what you need to do, taking care of your job. 
    It's one of those things we're down 2‑0, we're down 4‑2.   We've been down a lot in the playoffs and we're not focused on tying the game or winning the game.   We're focused on our next shift. 
    You know what, that next shift might be a defensive zone shift where you need to grind it out.   We don't try to tie the game in one shift or come back in one shift, we just play our game.   When we do that, we find ways to score big goals.   Again, big saves allowed us to stay in the game tonight.
