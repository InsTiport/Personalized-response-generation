  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Brown. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DUSTIN BROWN:   I said this about Kopy the other day, he's a hockey player.   He does all the right things at the right time. 
For him to be able to switch back from wing to center, I don't know, is a really big plus for our team from a utility standpoint.   A lot of it's just because of his skating ability. 

Q.   Four and a half minutes of ice time in the third period.   You made the most of it. 
DUSTIN BROWN:   That's how it goes sometimes.   Ty is another guy like that.   See some of the goals that those guys score, they're goals that probably if it was someone else, they wouldn't have gone in the net.   That's why they're goalâ€‘scorers.
