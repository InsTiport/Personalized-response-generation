  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Brown.   
   
 Q.   There's been so many guys in this room that have elevated their game in this playoffs to get to this point.   When you see a guy like Drew, the rough season he had, what does it mean to get him going, playing well defensively?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   You know, it's funny with Drew.   He's still young.   He's so good on so many different fronts.   I room with him a lot on the road.   I think he's definitely playing a lot better hockey right now than he was probably during the year.   
He looks at the stat sheet like every other player.   He had that one year where he had 60 points, and that's his bar.   But I think he's been a better overall player for us this year than he was the year he had 60.   
He's playing against every team's top line every night.   That's not an easy thing to do, especially considering he's only played 300â€‘something games in this league.   He's done a great job for us.   
Like you said, this time of year, people need to step up their game, and he's been one of those guys for us.  
   
 Q.   Same thing with Dustin, Game2, second goal.   
DUSTIN BROWN:   Yeah, I mean, he's been a big part of our success in the playoffs.   I mean, Penns has probably had a tough year, not the year he wanted, but he's really good at putting stuff behind him and getting better.   
He seems to be really focused this time of year.   I mean, he's been there, he's done that.   He's been through a Cup run.   He knows what it takes.   He's a big piece of our team.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Dustin.
