  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Brown.   
   
 Q.   Dustin, you've won two games, but is there still a concern about the power play, wishing it was producing?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   I think it's one of those things you should stay focused on.   Our percentage is not going to be good regardless, but we have opportunities ahead of us on the power play.   
You look at our power play thus far this whole season, we haven't scored many goals.   But the goals we have scored have been really key goals for us, dating to the very first series, Vancouver.   When we got that third goal, that put us up, was a huge goal for us.   
Sometimes power play, you look at the percentages, struggling.   The flipside of that is we have seven of our eight goals on the power play all season, five of them are big goals, that's a big part of it.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding acquiring Carter and why it took him so long to find a place.)   
DUSTIN BROWN:   I think it's an adjustment for anybody that gets traded.   It's hard to come right in and fit in.   From learning a new system to meeting new players.   You're picking up and moving in the middle of the season, living out of a suitcase, a lot of variables.   
Since we've acquired him, we've played really good hockey.   A lot of that is because guys have elevated their games across the board.
