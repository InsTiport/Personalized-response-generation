  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Dustin Brown. 

Q.   Hard not to look ahead? 
DUSTIN BROWN:   You know what, at this point of the year, I mean, you're looking.   Everyone talks about getting to the Stanley Cup finals.   But I think as players, especially for myself, I can only speak really for myself, playing in that game tomorrow night is pretty fun, as well.   It's one of the things you really have to enjoy the journey. 
We're one game away from, you know, the Cup finals.   But, again, it's one game we have to win.   Again, like I said, these games that we're playing in, not like they're no fun to play in.

Q.   A lot of pride in the other team.   No one likes to get swept.   What do you expect from them?
DUSTIN BROWN:   I've said this about Phoenix not only this year, but the last few years, they're a pretty tight, resilient group.   Considering they're the Pacific Division champs this year, battled through a lot of things.   I don't know if they've been this far in a hole, but they've showed character all year.   It's going to be no different tomorrow night. 
I think, like you said, they're a practical group.   They're going to come out with everything they got. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
