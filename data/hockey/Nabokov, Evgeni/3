   EVGENI NABOKOV:  I think it was a little bit harder to play -- we didn't do as much.  We didn't have as many chances.  They were coming pretty hard.  It's definitely not the game three or game four, it was a little bit of a different point.  But I thought we played all right.  We didn't play bad.  But unfortunately it's not enough in the game six to play all right.  You have to play better, harder, whatever you can call it, but you got to get the job done and we didn't. 
 Q.  Are you proud of what you accomplished or do you think it will ultimately be a disappointment for not getting all the way? 
 EVGENI NABOKOV:  Well, it's hard to jump on a conclusion right now.  But we had a hell of a season and we had a -- I said it before -- we had a good run, but we didn't accomplish what we were shooting for.  We were going to the Finals and we wanted to win the Stanley Cup.  And we didn't do it.  So you can be satisfied with the effort.  I think that the resolve, that's the main thing.  But again, the guys were playing hard and we gave a good effort most of the times.  If you look at the whole playoff, we didn't do it one time and that kicked us in the butt.  And that's how hard it is.  And we're a young team and we're going to learn our lessons and that's -- we can't take a game off in the playoffs.  Like I said, we did in game two.  I really do think so.  The one game we played, not quite like the San Jose Sharks, and that's where we found ourselves.
