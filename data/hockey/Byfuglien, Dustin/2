   THE MODERATOR: First question for Dustin.   
  
  Q. Dustin, you've had one game where you've kind of gone back and forth with Chris Pronger. How long does it take before you have a genuine dislike for this guy?   
 DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN: Probably I guess when you guys started talking about it from the get-go. It is what it is.   
  
  Q. Chris kind of yesterday kind of insinuated he wanted to make it really hard for you get to the front of the net, and he wondered if you were willing to pay the price to consistently do that? Are you willing to pay the price if he's making life miserable for you?   
 DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN: Definitely. You go out there and stand with him and do what you have to do. It's part of the game. When they get a power-play they really stand around and be there with their presence. I'll be there until the end of it.   
  
  Q. Dustin, after being in front with Pronger, you guys battling in front, can you believe no penalties were called in that game? What do you need to do to draw some penalties?   
 DUSTIN BYFUGLIEN: We have to continue to work and move our feet, and the penalties will start coming our way. You have to keep working.   
 We didn't get what we got last game. We didn't get any calls. So that's something we have to work on and keep working harder.
