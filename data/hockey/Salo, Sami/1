   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sami Salo. 
 SAMI SALO: Our thoughts are with Mr. Horton. Hopefully he's going to make a full recovery. Our team has to move on. 

 Q. What is it like for a player being in this situation in a Cup final? I'm sure you must feel for both right now. 
 SAMI SALO: Yeah, for sure. Like I said, it's tough to see. Obviously Aaron is hard-working. Not being able to participate in the rest of the playoffs, and obviously the same thing with Horton, our thoughts are with him, and hopefully he's going to make a full recovery. 

 Q. Is a loss a loss at this point? What we saw last night, can you easily put that behind you or... 
 SAMI SALO: I think we had a tough loss in Chicago in the first round. Same thing. We got blown out. But we came out strong the next game. That's our mentality, focus on our game, put the best game out there the next game. 

 Q. Is it actually easier to make sure that you step up because it seems like there's a lot of areas that were just off for the Canucks generally last night?
 SAMI SALO: I think we had a really strong first period. They got lucky bounces the first goal with our breaking a stick. It just accumulated over time. They got some easy goals at the end. 
 Overall, you know, we just have to change a few things. 

 Q. The NHL is talking about the crap and garbage going on in this series. Do you feel this series has gotten out of control a little bit?
 SAMI SALO: No, no, not at all. All the three series that we played so far have been hard-fought. Things happen all the time. So nothing that crazy.
