  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jarret Stoll.   
   
 Q.   Coming this far, so efficient, only the one loss.   Two of the three series, you're playing within your own time zone.   Almost too easy to be believed.   
JARRET STOLL:   It's nice.   You definitely want to have an hour flight, as opposed to Nashville, four and a half hours coming home.   Get in your own bed pretty early last night, get some good sleep.   
We faced some adversity here and there, but we dealt with it pretty well, I think.   We put ourselves in good situations by getting the first goal in a lot of games, which helps.   Some games you get a quickie early on, but it s huge for us to keep the game 0‑0, and just get our game going.   
   
 Q.   They seemed to show some frustration last night.   Is your response, Good?   
JARRET STOLL:   Exactly.   As far as we're concerned, they have to adjust to us.   If we keep playing our game, keep playing the way we want to play, hopefully that's what they'll have to do.   
We have to worry about ourselves.   We can't worry about them.   Our game is obviously in the right place, and we're winning hockey games.   
We know we can get better in certain areas, and that's what we have to focus on.  
   
 Q.   How much sense does it make to remain poised and not retaliate?  
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to retaliate, you got to just play the game.   We were in a good situation to not retaliate.   If they want to get something going and set the tone maybe for the next game.   Maybe that was part of their mindset or whatnot.   
We just have to stay within the game, stay within ourselves, realize the situation we're in and how we got there.   
The whole St.Louis series, we were a disciplined, composed team.   Took some penalties probably didn't want to take.   Ended up winning the series.   
It's composure when everything is on the line and everything is at high tempo, somehow you have to be composed in those situations.   
   
 Q.   Can you address the shots?   First game, 17 in the first period.   Right off the faceoff, Carter throws it on net.   Is that a conscious mindset that the Kings have had here so far in this series?  
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, we have to, especially with facing a goaltender like Smith.   You have to throw everything at him.   Obviously he's going to make a lot of saves.   But you never know where those rebounds are going.   
Not only by Smith not knowing where the rebounds are going, but the defense.   Maybe we can jump on a loose puck and get second‑chance opportunities that way.   
Very rarely are you going to beat them on a clean shot.   Have to have traffic.   I knew we were playing okay, but I didn't think we were getting that many shots at them.   It's nice to see.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding the disciplinary actions.)   
JARRET STOLL:   The Doan one is kind of tough.   It's a hockey play.   When you face off with someone who is trying to protect the puck and he ends up kind of turning a little bit.   Putting yourself in Shane Doan's position, it's a tough position for him to be in.   I don't think he has a hearing, so be it.   The Hanzal one, I definitely think‑‑ hopefully he gets two games, in my opinion, hopefully that's what he gets.   
If you're going to finish a check, maybe you close him that way on the board, you don't shove him in the board, especially when he's five, six feet from the board.   
   
 Q.   Brown keeps going down and gets back up.   
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, I was a little shocked how quick he did get up.   It was a pretty dangerous play.   Like I said, he was vulnerable.   Guy is going in to get the puck, he's got to get that puck, he's in a tough situation.   
He's a tough guy.   He'll be back and ready for Game3.   
Finish your checks, maybe they get a little frustrated from that.   That's the way it is in the playoffs.   You have to remain composed and battle through it.   
   
 Q.   Does it come as a shock or surprise how you've been able to steamroll throughout these Stanley Cup Playoffs?  
JARRET STOLL:   Well, it hasn't been easy.   We've had some adversity, we've had some tough games where we haven't had our A game, we needed our goaltender or defense to bail us out.   
But as a four‑line unit, going out there, we're in sync a little bit more than obviously we were in the regular season.   We're getting contributions from everybody.   We're winning different ways.   That's the way you have to do it in the playoffs if you want to go deep.   
Some games we got Kopie, Brown, last night Carter with the hat trick, Penns, Lewy.   Everyone is playing well, playing on the same page and contribute.   
   
 Q.   When did the feelings start to turn for this team?   
JARRET STOLL:   I think it turned in our first series against Vancouver.   We know how good a team they are.   The last couple years they've had some great seasons.   
We just got some confidence throughout that season, playing our game, playing the style we needed to play, and it was working.   Good goaltending on out, we just played a good game on the ice, and we were very consistent with it.   So far so good, but there's a long way to go.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding Carter.)   
JARRET STOLL:   Just the added depth it gave our whole lineup.   One player coming in of his caliber changed everything.   Didn't matter where he was on the lineup, first line, second line, didn't really matter.   Throughout our whole lineup, it gave us that much more of a scoring punch.   Moved a couple guys around here or there.   
He fit in very well right from the start.   I knew him a little bit before.   Obviously Rick knows him.   He knew a couple other people, too, so it was a very easy transition.  
   
 Q.   Face offs, anything going on?   
JARRET STOLL:   There's a lot of talk with the linesmen, what they want, what they don't want.   First couple games, there's been a lot of that for sure.   Guys getting kicked out.   
I don't think we were too good last night, but we'll regroup and be better here.   
   
 Q.   Are they cracking down?  
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, seems like they're cracking down a little bit.   We just have to figure that out and make it work somehow.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding the Lakers.)  
JARRET STOLL:   No, I don't really.   It is what it is.   It's L.A.   We're all in the playoffs.   It's great to see that.   The Lakers, with their whole winning tradition, it's pretty special.   Hopefully we can switch it over to the Kings for a little bit.   
  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
