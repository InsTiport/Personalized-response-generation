THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Sutter.   
   
 Q.   The pass of Voynov, a lot of people don't know about him.   Talk about Voynov.   
COACH SUTTER:   Good partner for Willie Mitchell.   Played the right side, moved the puck, played against the top players.   
   
 Q.   You were the aggressors tonight.   How important was that to set the tone?   
COACH SUTTER:   Do you know the Coyotes have won both games at home prior series, right?   It was really important we had a good start.   It wasn't so much scoring or any of that stuff.   Just make sure we match their start.   
We were able to overcome a rare bad goal against us, have the resilience to stay with it.   
   
 Q.   Your PK continues to be very impressive.   I know you don't like to talk about it.   
COACH SUTTER:   We weren't very good at it early.   We got better as we went along.   The key is stay out of the penalty box (laughter).   
I think there's a lot that goes into the penalty kill, faceoff, shot blocking clearing the puck down the ice, it's a big job against obviously against these guys because the way Yandle moves back there and Larsson moves back there, Whitney, then they get the net presence, it's tough to handle.   Then you got to be careful in your clears because Smith moves it back up against the wall.   
   
 Q.   Discuss Dwight King, and the fact that you had the trust to put him out there late in the game?  
COACH SUTTER:   Trust putting everybody out there late in the game.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the Morris goal from the redline.   
COACH SUTTER:   I don't think it rattled them at all.   As I said, it's a rare bad goal against them.   Our team was resilient enough just to play through it.   
   
 Q.   The play that Dustin Brown makes to make the Kopitar goal at the start, how important is that?   
COACH SUTTER:   I think it's an important play because Kopie scored.   Don't you (laughter)?   If he didn't, you wouldn't have said nothing about it.   
Line in the first period had a lot of good opportunities.   Because they scored, it sort of highlights it.   But the line was really good in the first period.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling at 2‑2 after the second period?   34 shots on net, dominated play, but still an even game.   
COACH SUTTER:   Means we probably had lots of missed opportunities, you know.   That's the way the game is, too.   We've been on the other side of it, too, where you're out‑shot 2‑1 and we're on the other side of it.   
That's the way it works some nights.   
   
 Q.   You've coached some captains who were emotional leaders.   Dustin Brown, the way he's going right now, can you touch on the way he played again tonight.   
COACH SUTTER:   You know what, the playoffs have been something for him that he's taken the next step, right?   That's the key to it.   Right now he's a playoff‑type player because the game, it's the way you have to play at playoff times.   
You think about the intensity, the controlled emotion.   Probably if you said tonight he'd like to have the penalty back in the first period, and he certainly covered his butt good by scoring the game winner.   
   
 Q.   That top line you mentioned a little bit.   They've been on a roll this whole post‑season.   Have they played better at any point this year, in your mind?   
COACH SUTTER:   I think the lines got good after we were able to play, you know, Richards and Carter together, makes a difference, right?   Makes a difference who is playing against who.   It's just another dimension.   I don't think it's got anything to do with this year.   
We started at zero tonight, right?   Everybody did.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH SUTTER:   You got to make some big saves at some point to win a hockey game.   
   
 Q.   Does a goaltender ever have anything to say when he gets back into the room after that?   
COACH SUTTER:   Yeah, I'm not sure if he did or not.   I mean, you're reloading.   I don't think you can dwell on anything that's a negative or anything like that.   I think you're getting ready for the next one.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.   
Questions for Jarret or Dustin.   
   
 Q.   Dustin, can you talk about the pass from Voynov?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   Yeah, I mean, he's a pretty skilled guy.   Not many people know about him.   He has the ability to make those long stretch passes, which are not easy.   
We did a lot of those short plays breaking out.   I kind of caught one, their D was sleeping a little bit, put it right on my tape.   
   
 Q.   Jarret, this team has shown a lot in this post‑season.   To be able to rebound from the goal, how are you able to play well in close games?  
JARRET STOLL:   That was probably the biggest game we've had so far in the playoffs with that much adversity against us.   
A tough goal.   Then a little miscommunication behind our net with our goalie and our defense.   Tough goal to give up.   On the bench we were fine.   On the ice we were fine.   We kept pushing and pushing.   We knew we were playing our game for the most part there, great shifts.   Just kept staying positive.   
We all know on our team that wasn't going to beat us.   That's just the way we played.   
   
 Q.   Jarret, can you talk about the growth of Dwight King.   
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, he's a strong guy.   He's very smart, too.   He thinks the game well.   With me, him and Lewis, we're on the same page defensively trying to turnover pucks.   He protects the puck so well.   He can find the puck and score well.   He did it in junior.   A lot of people have done it in junior.   You come up here, he's contributed down the stretch in the playoffs.   
It's not easy for a young guy coming in to be put in a role like that, be playing an empty netter in the Western Conference final and he's on the ice.   So he's a big part of our team.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DUSTIN BROWN:   No, he didn't say much.   Quicker, he doesn't really talk a lot.   He makes 25 big saves a game and he don't say anything after those.   He lets one in that he probably wants back, he just put his head down and got back to work.   
There were one or two saves that were pretty remarkable in the third.   One on the blocker's side.   I don't know.   Four or five minutes left in the third.   That definitely saved the game for us.   
He's one of those guys, he gets right back at it and doesn't let it affect him.   
   
 Q.   Dustin, you and your line obviously made things hard on them tonight.   How much tougher does that become in Game2?  
DUSTIN BROWN:   It's just like pretty much any series.   You get that first game out of the way, start looking at film, tendencies.   I'm not sure what they're going to try to do to stop us.   It's one of those things where they're going to make adjustments.   
It's up to us as players to make adjustments in games to be effective and have an impact on Game2.   
   
 Q.   Your PK was perfect against the Blues.   How much momentum are you generating off that right now?   
JARRET STOLL:   Quite a bit.   Smart pressure.   You can pressure all you want, if you're not smart with it and you got one guy going and you got two guys sitting back, gaps open up, lanes open up, a good power play can eat you apart.   
We're all on the same page, moving together, pressuring together.   If you get one more guys in there, they're going to get a shot, a chance.   As long as it's not a grade‑A scoring chance, Quicky is going to save those all right.  
   
 Q.   Jarret, Dustin with the game winner tonight, can you talk about the magical carpet ride that continues.   
JARRET STOLL:   He's an all right player, yeah (laughter).   He's doing it all for us.   Both ends of the rink, too.   Not just offensively, which is nice.   But coming back defensively, being physical, leading by example.   He doesn't say all the rah‑rah stuff sometimes, but he definitely speaks on the ice.   
   
 Q.   Dustin, was there ever a sense of frustration after the second being tied at two?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   No.   We knew coming in, you watch Phoenix play, they got a really good goaltender.   Part of our thing is getting as many shots on him as we can, make him work, make it hard for him.   The more saves he has, the chances for us winning go up.   
On the flipside, we understand they're a very opportunistic team.   They've won games in this playoffs getting 10 shots, 12 shots.   They are very patient, very opportunistic.   They get a chance off the forecheck, it's 2‑2, that didn't change our mindset.   
I think we're pretty well aware of how opportunistic they are.   
   
 Q.   Is that kind of nerve‑wracking, to play in a game where you're constantly one bounce away from a tie?   
DUSTIN BROWN:   One of those things where at this time of year you got to just stick with the game plan, execute, things will fall into place if you work hard.   It's one of those things where we got to keep going with the type of offensive threats we had tonight.   We had a lot of shots, a lot of traffic.   They're going to get chances.   That's part of the game.   That's why we have a goalie, as well.   
We just got to keep on making it hard on Smith.   The longer they play in their D zone, the more tired they're going to get.   Over the course of the series, that's going to be to our advantage.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, guys.
