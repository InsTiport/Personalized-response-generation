  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JARRET STOLL:   We got to win a game.   That's what we've got to do.   I don't care how we win a game.   Find a way to do it again. 
We've done it in the past, we know that.   But you can draw on those experiences, you got to draw on them the right way to make it happen.   We have to make it happen. 

Q.   Do you have a sense of what Mike is going through?
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, it's just one of those things.   It's tough.   We definitely miss him.   We got to have guys that step up and play better when guys are out. 
When I was out, guys had to do it.   When Greene was out, a lot of guys.   You're not a good team unless you do those kinds of things.   We're still playing, so I think we're a pretty good team.   So we got to do it.

Q.   Is Jonathan a guy that comes back even stronger after the last game?
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, I think we've seen that before.   He's a pretty focused guy.   Narrow mindâ€‘setted kind of guy.   Not too many things bother him. 
We expect his best tonight.   We have to be better in front of him.   That's no secret.   You can't rely on your goaltender as much as we have.   Have to make their guy work a little bit harder in their net.   That's definitely one of the things we want to do. 
I think he's made some good saves, played well, but we got to make him work a lot harder.
