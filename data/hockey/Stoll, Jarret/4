Q.   (Question regarding faceoffs.) 
JARRET STOLL:   You got to know where they are.   You don't want to give them too much space, but you also don't want to be on their hip.   There's got to be a buffer zone there, otherwise they can spin off you pretty easily, too. 
Starting with the puck is the main thing.   We have to start off with the puck as much as possible.   If we can be 60, 65%, for our team that's what we want.   Make them work for it to get it back. 
That's the easiest way to start with the puck, is win the faceoff.   Get to our game before they get to theirs. 

Q.   Even when you don't play your best, as long as the game is still on the table, you're going to still be motivated.   Has that developed under Darryl?   If so, why? 
JARRET STOLL:   I think you have to know when your push needs to be there.   There's parts of those two games where it seems like it was a dead game at points, not much was going on maybe for either team at times. 
Definitely third period we needed to have a push.   Third period in Game1 we needed a push, didn't get the push we wanted. 
Darryl brings that out in us.   We bring it out in ourselves. 
If you're a young, inexperienced team, maybe you don't know when those pushes should happen or how to play in those situations. 
We realize it.   Team across the way, they realize it, too.   It's just the way it is, the way you play. 

Q.   (Question regarding special teams.) 
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, you never want to go five‑on‑three, especially against Chicago in the playoffs.   We had to battle to get that kill.   Start with faceoffs, start with blocking shots, you know where the one‑timers are.   You got to know where everyone is on the ice, who is out there. 
We did that, killed it off.   Just finding a way to win.
