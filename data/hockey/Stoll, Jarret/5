  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Talk about playing from behind in a series. 
JARRET STOLL:   Yeah, you don't want to get in that position, but we have a couple times.   Obviously we're in it now. 
You just play the games.   You're prepared to win.   Sometimes it doesn't always go your way.   Our group, we're not going to get rattled.   We're not going to get down.   We're not going to turn on each other. 
It comes from our coaching staff, our leadership group, all the way down our lineup, it's just a strong group that way. 
Sometimes when you're going through a playoff series, you can easily see cracks probably not after Game1, but maybe Game2, 3, 4, you can see cracks in teams, and then you push at them until they're done. 
With our group, I don't think we have any of that.   I haven't seen any of that in all the playoffs that I've been a part of with the L.A. Kings.   It's a strong group to be a part of.   Hopefully we can keep that going. 

Q.   Jarret, how far back did this team learn to live like that?   I'm sure the confidence hasn't always been there?   Was there a turning point or a series where it was like the light bulb went off for this group? 
JARRETT STOLL:   The one two years ago was pretty special.   To be up 3â€‘0 in every single round is, you know, tough to do.   We got lucky.   We got fortunate in a lot of those situations.   We gained a lot of confidence from that, realized we can go into tough buildings and win this year as well. 
San Jose and Anaheim had arguably the top two, three, four best home records this year.   We went into those tough buildings and won. 
Chicago is no different.   A tough building.   We're going to have to figure out a way to win Game2 and move on.
