  DEREK STEPAN:   Not really long, and he plays physical and he plays that way.   He played it that way for two years since I've been here, and we've never had an incident like this. 
So Brandon obviously is just trying to play his game and he's not trying to intentionally do anything.

Q.   Those guys are picking you guys on the power play when they're on the power play?
DEREK STEPAN:   When they're on the power play? 

Q.   Trying to create shots. 
DEREK STEPAN:   Yeah‑‑ yeah, I think our penalty kill did a great job battling and trying to find ways to get in lanes from here.   I think we're just working as hard as we can to try to get ourselves in the lane so they can get clear shots.

Q.   What's the thought here, you've had a 2‑1 in the series twice and it's always come back 2‑2, just the urgency to get this to 3‑1 for the first time?
DEREK STEPAN:   Obviously we want to play with urgency every game.   And I think that's where maybe in the first two series we kind of lost it coming into certain games, but we want to try to focus on that and make sure we come out with a lot of intensity.
