Q.   Derek, earlier in the playoffs you were getting clubbed over the head with negative power play stats, now the power play seems to be an ally for you.   Maybe just talk about the difference in the confidence in it? 
DEREK STEPAN:   Yeah, I think confidence is one thing, but I think as a five‑man unit, we're working hard and finding ways to get pucks back, and when we do get a chance to score a goal, we execute.

Q.   How big of a boost do you get with this 2‑0 in the series going back to New York? 
DEREK STEPAN:   You don't get much of a boost.   You just try to focus on winning a Game 3, and that's our main focus right now is getting ready to play at home.

Q.   With Henrik Lundqvist playing the way he's playing back there, how much confidence does he give you guys to not think about that and do what you have to do? 
DEREK STEPAN:   Yeah, Henrik doesn't surprise me anymore.   He seems to just stand tall every game, and he's out to continue to do that for us.

Q.   The thought of leaving Montreal 2‑0, is that a fairy tale, a dream come true? 
DEREK STEPAN:   Like I said, it's kind of clichÃ©, but we've been taking it a game at a time, and we're going to continue to do it that way.   Right now we're just focused on competing for 60 minutes in Game 3.

Q.   Can you talk about the work of your defense?   It's been so effective and efficient. 
DEREK STEPAN:   Yeah, working in groups of fives in the "D" zone, and when there is a breakdown, Henrik has been there to stand tall.   So it's a full team effort when you're playing defense, that's for sure.
