   PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Come on up, Patrick.  From Buffalo, New York, one of the best-kept secrets in terms of players being developed there.  You think about Kevin Adams and Aaron Miller and Tim Connelly and all the players coming from Western New York.  It's unbelievable.  Is that because of the youth hockey coaching there or just the amount of rinks available? 
 PATRICK KANE:  I think a combination of both.  Growing up there's obviously a lot of coaches out there that know what they're talking about.  And Buffalo today with the Sabres and their success, there's a lot of rinks and a lot of players that want to play hockey.  It's pretty exciting. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  You had a chance to grow up in Buffalo, and you watched Mogilny and LaFontaine.  LaFontaine is more of a disher and Mogilny is more of a scorer.  So what's Patrick?  A disher or a finisher? 
 PATRICK KANE:  I don't really think about it myself as either a disher or finisher.  But I like doing both.  I mean, Sammy sets me up for a lot here and I like giving something back to him, too.  So either way we're happy. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  You like playing the wing or center better? 
 PATRICK KANE:  Doesn't matter to me. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Because I remember the Forsbergian move over in Sweden this year and it looked more like you were a centerman than a winger in that situation. 
 PATRICK KANE:  Yeah, I played the wing all year, left or right doesn't matter to me.  But I've had a couple teams talk to me, asked if I would like to play center.  Doesn't matter to me.  Whatever is best for the team. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  I heard you talk about Pat Verbeek and the influence he had on you.  Any other coaches have an influence on you? 
 PATRICK KANE:  Yeah, a couple, Don Harkins from Honeybaked days.  He pushed me.  He was great motivator.  And also John Hines and Dale Hunter and Dave Gagner. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Do you ever talk to Scotty Bowman?  He lives in Buffalo. 
 PATRICK KANE:  Yes, I golfed with him.  He wanted me to go to the college route, but I decided to go the OHL route and it worked out.  I stay in touch with him today.  He's a great fan and great supporter. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  So can you go to any team you want?  Tell me which team you want to go to. 
 PATRICK KANE:  Obviously growing up in Buffalo, watching the Sabres this year, you'd like to bring the first Cup to Buffalo.  But it doesn't matter to me.  Just having a team, having my rights will be special in itself. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Where will you spend the summer? 
 PATRICK KANE:  In Buffalo. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Do you think the people are over their conference final loss to Ottawa? 
 PATRICK KANE:  Not yet, but hopefully they will be before next year. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Briere or Drury? 
 PATRICK KANE:  I like Briere. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Thanks, Patrick.
