THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Brent, walk us through that last goal.   Was it close your eyes and shoot?   
BRENT SEABROOK:   No (smiling).   I like shooting in that spot.   But to be honest, I was just trying to get it past the centerman, their forward coming out and trying to block it.   They do such a good job of blocking shots, getting in the way, getting in lanes.  
I just tried to get it past the first guy.   I thought all the forwards on the ice, Kaner made a great play putting it on the ice, Bicksy tried putting it there, it bounced around a little bit, our forwards did a good job of getting in front and boxing out.   It was just a great play.   
   
 Q.   Jonathan, I'm sure everybody is going to be talking about the goal for you tonight, how it must have felt good to score.   I'd like to ask you about Chara on the winning goal, how you were screening Rask.   You won that one‑on‑one battle with Chara.   Talk about the impact you made on that play.   
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I definitely have to give credit to Seabs for the shot he made.   Maybe Rask didn't see it at first.   I think I kind of pivoted and maybe let him see it.   Obviously it was a little too late.   
For the most part there's just those little battles, whether it's with Chara or their other defensemen.   All our forwards were really keen on winning them tonight.   We made a point of it in our locker room.   We scored a couple goals off of that.   
Kaner's goal came from two guys being in front with traffic.   When you have two guys going into the net, you're bound to get the rebound.   Kaner got the second rebound.   Big shot by Seabs tonight.   Same thing on Sharpy's goal.   We were just around the net.   We were getting inside and found the rebounds.   
Ugly goals, we don't care.   We'll find a way.   It's something we need to keep doing.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, this game was such a departure from the first three games of the series.   Was it a little unnerving how they kept coming back?  
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, you know, you think you have a good lead at 3‑1.   They make the 3‑2.   We score a big goal the next shift.   4‑2.   Then they score on a power play.   It was just kind of back and forth the rest of the game.   
I guess it was just our turn to score again.   
Like Sharpy said, it was a fun game to play.   At the same time you want to preserve those leads and play better when you do have those, especially late in the game.   I'm sure the fans enjoyed that for sure.  
   
 Q.   Jonathan, how much fun was it to play in a wide‑open kind of game like that?  
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Like Kaner said, every time we scored, I think we had a couple times where we had two‑goal leads.   I wouldn't say we got comfortable, but we definitely need to focus on being smarter and better defensively in that situation.   
We let them bounce back too quickly.   When we get that momentum, we have to hold onto it a little bit longer.   It was just a couple defensive plays here and there.   If we get in shooting lanes, if we don't allow those shots from the point to come in, we can do a better job in front of Corey and help him out a little bit better, keep that momentum, like I said.   
Sometimes it's not easy, especially in this building when you let them come back and score a goal, they feel they're right back in the game.   That's something definitely we want to do better in the next one.  
   
 Q.   How much of a lift do you get before the game knowing Hossa is back in the lineup?   
BRENT SEABROOK:   Yeah, I think Hoss has a lot of pride.   He was upset with not being able to play last game.   
He battled the last couple days to get prepared and get ready for tonight.   It was a big lift for the boys, I think.   Just to see him out there battling and skating, working as hard as he does all the time, it's definitely nice to see.   
   
 Q.   Jonathan, you said this morning, it's bothered you, the scoring, you feel you need to be more accountable.   Scoring today, do you feel you broke through and did what you had to?  
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Absolutely.   I think it makes a world of difference for you when you finally see one go in.   
I got to say this, the last couple days Seabs has been coming up to me, asking me what I'm thinking about.   You know, I have to give him the right answer.   I'm thinking about scoring a goal (smiling).   
He's been trying to help me out, make me think a little bit better, have those positive thoughts.   You work hard, eventually you're going to find a way.   Tonight was one of those games, we treated it as a Game 7.   We weren't going to be denied.   
So I felt that same way, too.   It's time to put all those other games behind us, the games where we struggled to score, forget about it, just find a way to do what you do.   
It was fun to see the puck go in as often as it did tonight.   We know we can be better defensively.   But we'll use that confidence and try our best to pounce on them in Game 6 here‑‑ Game5, sorry.   Getting ahead of myself (laughter).   
   
 Q.   Brent, is this a question of trying to win games your way, not try to win games the way they play?   
BRENT SEABROOK:   I mean, we just want to win games.   At this point of the season, it's down to best‑of‑three.   We want to win games, find a way to win 'em any way we can.   
Obviously we like when we're playing with speed, trying to play a puck‑possession game, get down low, create chances.   That's when we're playing at our best.   
Both these guys have been saying we got to be better defensively, as well.   We got to be prepared to win a game 1‑0 or 2‑1.   That's what it's got to come down to.   
Boston is a great team.   They play a solid style of play.   We're going to have to shore up our D zone and be better at that.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, can you talk about being back with Jonathan on that line?   At times was it a mystery to you why you weren't on the same line?   
PATRICK KANE:   Well, I think from a coaching standpoint, you're always looking for different matchups.   You can understand where they're coming from when they split us up after the last series.   
I thought it was a game that we needed to get some excitement.   It was a big goal by Handzus starting us off.   I thought all three of us played pretty well, had some goals.   Contributed the way we want to contribute.  
At the same time just playing with each other for the first time in a little while again, we feel we can get even better and learn what each other does after playing a game like that.   
It would be nice to get a little more offensive zone time, keep it in their end, play better than tonight.   But you have to be happy with our production.   
   
 Q.   Jonathan, you have taken more shots than they have in each game of the series, in some stretches by a wide margin.   Do you have a sense of that during the course of the game or do you still feel like you need to get even more rubber towards the net?   
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I think maybe in the game tonight we definitely worked really hard at creating the chances that we did.   The chances that we got, the goals that we scored, weren't turnover plays by them or just lucky bounces by us, they were goals that we were moving the puck around, we shot it, we got rebounds, we recovered the puck, we kept it moving around and finally scored a goal.   
We have scoring chances, attempts to shoot the puck, we never want to pass that up.   It's something that we always tell ourselves, that there's not a better play.   The best place to shoot is on net.   We need guys crashing.   That's the way we played tonight, and we got success off of that.   
   
 Q.   Brent, game winner against Detroit in Game 7, overtime winner tonight.   Are you beginning to relish these moments?   
BRENT SEABROOK:   It's exciting.   Everybody worked so hard tonight, everybody's worked so hard through the playoffs, we're all contributing.   It doesn't matter if I score or anybody else scores, it's nice to get the win and move on to the next day.   
I think it's definitely exciting to score in an overtime game, an overtime goal.   But at the end of the day it's just a win and we still need two more, so...   
   
 Q.   Patrick and Jonathan, so much of the narrative going into this game was about Zdeno Chara, the effect he was having on this series.   Tonight it seemed like you really pierced the armor there.   I don't want to put words in your mouth.   Your body language on the ice was almost like you were saying, Screw this guy, screw Chara, we're just going to go out and play.   I'm wondering if that was your attitude going into this game.   
PATRICK KANE:   I think that was the way for the whole team.   That's the way you want to look at things.   I think we played so well as a team all year, just getting back to our game, playing with speed like you saw out there, not worrying so much about what they do.  
Obviously you got to be aware of who you're on the ice against, whether it's Chara with his reach, Krejci, Bergeron, whoever it may be, they're great players, they're going to have offensive chances.   
If we can be responsible defensively, try to create anything you can against him because he's such a good defenseman and big body, it's going to be huge for our line.   
You know you're going to see a lot of him.   The biggest thing is to try to keep it away from him.   If you're matched up against him, try to win that battle and make some plays.   
I think we've done it for a long time in our careers, so no use backing down now, I guess.   
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I agree with a lot of what Kaner says.   Credit to Chara, he's one of their key players.   He's a great player.   We know his number one advantage is his size, reach and strength.   
I think at the same time you can't give him too much respect and want to compensate the way you play as a line considering the fact he's out there against you guys.   
I mean, there's certain ways you can expose him.   I think the dumpings that we made tonight were going to his side.   We made sure we were out numbering him everywhere we went, taking away his stick first thing.   
We just try not to be intimidated by his size.   You have to get to the net, find a way inside, not be, like I said, intimidated by that.   
We can out‑work him, and we did that tonight, and we want to continue that.   
   
 Q.   When Joel put you together in Game4 against the Kings, it worked.   Then Kane gets the hat trick.   Why does it work right away when he puts you, Patrick and Bickell together?   
JONATHAN TOEWS:   First, I think Kaner and I have played together over so many years now, and I think whenever we get the chance to get back together, we complement each other because we play very different games.   But we do a lot of good little things out there to help each other out.  
A lot of credit goes to Bicks.   He's having a great playoffs.   We work hard, get the puck back, get chances, we're cycling the puck, he's playing smart hockey.   He's not giving the puck away.   He's holding onto it, keeping the play alive.   He had a heck of a shot late in the game that hit the crossbar.   When the two of us can make some plays and open up space for him, he's a dangerous guy, too.  
The three of us have been playing well together and we want to keep that work ethic going.   
   
 Q.   Patrick and Jonathan, that second period, what is going through your mind?   How important was it for both of you to get into that dressing room with a 4‑3 lead?  
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, well, for me, you don't want to take a penalty in the offensive zone.   I was a little disappointed in myself for that.   
But, yeah, when you see them moving the puck in our end, I think one of our guys, Dunks lost a stick, Johnny gave him his stick, whenever you're down like that, it's almost like you're playing a penalty kill.   It was huge to get out of that with a lead.   
  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
