 JAMEY HORAN: Questions for Patrick Kane. 

 Q. Patrick, it seemed like you and Jonathan have only been in Chicago a very short time. Can you believe it's come together so quickly? 
 PATRICK KANE: It's pretty crazy. You know, I think you envision this and hope for the best when you first come in. But everything we've been through, it's been obviously an unbelievable year. Very exciting. It's fun to be a part of right now. Crazy game tonight. Just unbelievable, the result, though. 

 Q. Patrick, a couple of guys said that you knew it was in as soon as it was in and they were all still kind of wondering what was going on. Can you tell us about what was going on? 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah. I shot, I saw it go right through the legs. Sticking right under the pad in the net. I don't think anyone saw it in the net. I booked it to the other end. I knew it was in. I tried to sell the celebration a bit. Everyone came down, and I think some guys were still kind of a little iffy to see if the puck was in the net. I saw the coaches there pointing at the puck and jumping around. It's pretty surreal right now for sure. 

 Q. Can you talk just about the year that you've had? It's been so many games that you've played. So many big emotional highs and lows throughout the year. Can you just talk about the year as a whole? 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah. It didn't start off very good back in August. But I think sometimes you know you go through those kind of things as a young kid. You can really learn from them and try to better yourself as a person and as an athlete too. Yeah, there was ups and downs. 
 As far as hockey-wise, I can be pretty satisfied. I thought I had a really good year as far as, you know, Olympics, obviously, you win the Stanley Cup, it's pretty special too. Just really unbelievable to see how things can go from so bad to so good. 

 Q. Pat, this could be the last night where the coaching staff remains intact. Can you just talk about the job that Havi and John have done and if they're NHL ready to be head copy? 
 PATRICK KANE: For sure they are. I think they're both really good coaches. We're lucky to have them. Hopefully they can stay aboard and be part of something special here. But I have a very good relationship with both of them. Very easy-going. A lot of fun around the rink. So I think that helps too. 

 Q. Pat, can you talk a little about Dustin Byfuglien and how he rebounded after those first three games? There was a lot of talk about it and how he rebounded these last few games here? 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah. He was awesome. He's really good. As far as in the playoffs, he's probably our biggest force on the ice whenever he was out there. But it's really good to see him come out. He was from defense to forward, he's kind of mixed up in the regular season. He found a real nest with myself and Johnny on our line as far as in the last two series. And then this series you mix things up. He was pretty good on the power-play and got a couple of big goals. 

 Q. I know you're tired of talking about him, but he did win the Conn Smythe. Can you talk about your captain? 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah. I like to joke with him a lot. We have pretty different personalities. I think one thing that remains the same with us is we both love hockey and we both love to compete and play the game. 
 Obviously, it's fun to be around a kid like that. He loves to win. He loves to play. He's a great player. And he's had a hell of a year. He's going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future as far as, I think, one of the greats of all time. 

 Q. What did you guys talk about between the third and overtime? Did you talk about winning it for Hossa at all? 
 PATRICK KANE: No, no, no. Just trying to rebound from that goal. It was tough. I think our bench deflated pretty good. Obviously we had to pick it up ourselves in the locker room there.
 So I think we did that. It was -- we came out in overtime. A couple of bad shifts. Niemi made some big saves. Luckily enough we snuck one in there. 

 Q. What are you going to do with the Stanley Cup? 
 PATRICK KANE: A lot of questions about that. Hey, Buck, I want to say sorry about that. I had to get that off my chest. 

 Q. That's all right. 
 PATRICK KANE: You understand? 

 Q. Yes. 
 PATRICK KANE: Yeah, I think probably bring it back home. A lot of friends and family back there. But I think it's something you probably think about a little more and try to have a great day with it. I'm sure it will be unbelievable having that thing for a full day. 

 Q. Can you talk a little bit about the Flyers and their resolve and how competitive they were in the series? 
 PATRICK KANE: They're a really good team. They're very well coached. A lot of offense. Ton of offense. That was probably the best we've seen all year where they had three really good lines that were pretty scary. 
 So I think we're pretty fortunate to come away with winning this series. But it's been a hell of a year for us. We just had to end it on this note. 
 JAMEY HORAN: Thank you, Patrick.
