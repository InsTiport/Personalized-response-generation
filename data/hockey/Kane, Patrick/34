 Q.  How will it be to be with your old teammate Sam Gagner this weekend? 
 PATRICK KANE:  It will be fun.  Hopefully I'm paired up with him or something.  Hopefully, we can revive some magic that we had last year.  It sure will be fun playing with him.  We're good buddies, so there will probably be some jokes about some plays and be fun in general. 

 Q.  Being a rookie and a rising star in this league, how do you feel about this weekend? 
 PATRICK KANE:  I think it will be fun, obviously.  It's nice to be part of the All-Star festivities in any way you can your first year.  So just being here as a Young Star and as a player.  That is part of the whole process.  It should be fun, and I'm looking forward to it. 

 Q.  How do you think your game has changed since you joined the NHL? 
 PATRICK KANE:  Well, I mean last year I thought I kind of viewed myself more of a goal scorer.  And obviously playing with players that could dish the puck and make a lot of plays.  But this year I seem to be more of a passer this year. 
 Hopefully I can add the goal scoring a little bit more to my arsenal at this level.  But I think it will just take some time and just got to adjust a little bit. 

 Q.  Has anything surprised you, been too easy for you or too hard for you? 
 PATRICK KANE:  It's kind of what you expect coming in.  So I mean, obviously it's the NHL.  It's the best league in the world.  And there are going to be times when the game might be a little too fast.  You're playing against men now, so it's something you're going to have to work with and adjust at times. 
 But I think the biggest thing probably will be adjusting to the speed of the game.  The players are still there, but they just happen so much quicker, so it's something I had to adjust to a bit.
