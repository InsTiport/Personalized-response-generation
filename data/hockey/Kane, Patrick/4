THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   When the Kings went up 3‑2, building going crazy, was anything said as far as, Here we go again?   
BRANDON SAAD:   Not too much.   There's plenty of time left.   So don't put your head down.   It's do or die here.   
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, you know, nothing was really said.   I think it was pretty much just keep playing the same way and play the way we know how to play.   Ended up working out.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, both teams have been resilient throughout the playoffs.   How much fun are you actually having out there?   
PATRICK KANE:   Yeah, the last two games have been pretty wild to say the least.   I'm sure it's fun for the fans to watch.   
But we know they're a resilient group.   They've won two Game 7s on the road in their first two series.   It's going to be a tough one.   
Right now we're happy we got the win, but it doesn't mean anything because we haven't won anything yet.   
We'll get ready for the next one and we know they'll bring the best for Game 7.  
   
 Q.   Walk us through the game winner.   
PATRICK KANE:   I think Hjalmarsson made a great play at the redline to have a good stick.   He tipped it up to Saader.   Saader drove his own with speed and dropped it to me.   I didn't see anything off the rush.   I took it up the line and tried to get a shot through.   I think Shawsy was in front getting a great screen.   Luckily it went in.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, how have you been able to find room for yourself when there wasn't a whole lot of it early in the series?  
PATRICK KANE:   There's still not much room out there in this series.   Right now you have to take advantage of your opportunities when you do get space.   
Playing with two hard workers that work really hard to get the puck back, have made my life a lot better as far as getting the puck in good areas where I can make plays.   
I give the credit to Saader and Shawsy.   
   
 Q.   Did you say anything to your teammates when you were down?  
PATRICK KANE:   No, there really wasn't much talk, to be honest with you.   
   
 Q.   Are you expecting to win at that point, down 3‑2?   Are you expecting to be the one to do it?   
PATRICK KANE:   I think, you know, we were upset with giving up that third goal.   We were on the ice for that one.   It was kind of a breakdown defensively.   I'm sorry, the second goal, Doughty's goal.   
Then, you know, we got ourselves down 3‑2.   We've been in that position before where we've been down, tied it up, ended up winning.   
Not much was said, to be honest with you.   We have different guys stepping up every night.   A huge goal by Duncan.   To get that fourth one was huge, too.  
   
 Q.   The third goal?  
PATRICK KANE:   I think Saader put it down to Shawsy.   I was open for a little bit.   They converged on me and I just brought it up the wall.   Dunks did a great job of splitting through the zone there, beat the guy and made a great shot.   
   
 Q.   I think some of the Kings chuckled when you said it was a 3‑1 series.   Who is the pressure on now?   
PATRICK KANE:   There's pressure on both teams.   Obviously we have some momentum so we want to keep it.   
Going into a Game 7 when there's been momentum each way in the series, the series is tied 3‑3, there's pressure on both teams.   
Once again, they were up 3‑1 in the series, so we'll put all the pressure on them.  
   
 Q.   Why does being with Kane on the line work so well?  
BRANDON SAAD:   Me and Shawsy try to do a lot of hard work.   He's a world‑class player with world‑class skills.   We try to get him the puck, get to the net.   He makes things happen.   
It's been fun playing the last couple games.   Hopefully we continue to have success.  
   
 Q.   There's been talk amongst people like us about the word 'dynasty' with you guys.   You're on the cusp of achieving that or not achieving that.   Does that ever go through your head at all?   
BRANDON SAAD:   He's been here a lot longer than I have.   I know these past couple years we've got some young guys coming in.   Obviously with the core here, they've got a lot of skill.   Guys that are going to be around a long time.   
It's been fun the last couple years.   They've had success even before I was there.   It's been a fun run.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, can you talk about that, as well.   
PATRICK KANE:   I don't think anyone thinks about that.   This year is a new challenge for us.   A totally new year.   I think it's exciting to be in the playoffs and competing for a chance to go to the Stanley Cup again.   
I don't think anyone's thinking about the word 'dynasty' or anything like that.   It's a totally new year for us.   
   
 Q.   Patrick, on the last goal, how difficult is it to be that patient and slow things down when the game is so tight?   
PATRICK KANE:   Well, we always talk about having our D active in the play.   When they're jumping up, cutting through holes, making space, I think it makes it a little bit easier for you.   
But that's a play that I try to do every now and then, is come up the wall and read what the defense does.   
Just try to let your instincts take over.   
   
 Q.   You scored four goals tonight.   Jonathan Quick not the easiest guy to score against.   What impresses you about him out there?  
BRANDON SAAD:   Well, he's been through it all, winning a Stanley Cup, playing in the Olympics.   He's a big kid.   He's athletic.   He never quits on the play.   
We just try to get guys to the net, get second‑effort goals because he's tough to beat on the first shot.   
   
 Q.   Coach Q said the bigger the stage, you like the challenge.   Explain your ability to step up when it really matters.   
PATRICK KANE:   I don't know, you try to take it upon yourself to try and step up in big situations.   But we have a lot of guys that do that.   
I think with our team and the amount of great players that are on it, it seems like everyone has their time to step up and have the spotlight and be in that moment.   
There's been numerous guys that have done it.   When it's your turn, it's always fun to contribute.
