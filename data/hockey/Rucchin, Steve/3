Q.  I know and everybody's been talking about the fact that people stepped up and appealed to the team's emotion.  What was said and what were you appealing to, Steve?

STEVE RUCCHIN: Well, things were said, but really not a lot needs to be said.  We're all aware of the effort we have been putting in and what's been going on on the ice.  It's pretty frustrating, but we've got two games at home here now.  We expect to turn things around.

Q.  One of the mantras of the Ducks has been through two games that we have to manage the puck better.  In what way do you believe you did that in Period 1?  It sure looked better.

STEVE RUCCHIN: Yeah, they've got some pretty good D back there, and the first two games we were kind of giving it to them, and you can't do that to these guys.  That was pretty evident.  Tonight we want to hold on to it that half split second longer and try to do a little better, but we can still do a bit better.
