Q.  (Inaudible)?

STEVE RUCCHIN: I don't necessarily think we dominated.  Of course, we scored four goals, but, you know, it was a pretty close game for the most part, and they had a lot of opportunities still, which we need to cut back on definitely.  We're proud of what we accomplished so far.  We expect the next game to be our best game still.

Q.  Every single time you answer questions about Giguere, but what can you say about him now?

STEVE RUCCHIN: You know, it's been like this all season long.  This is no different.  Right now you look at his numbers in the regular season, they're phenomenal, and, yeah, he's incredible back there, and it's nice that he's a part of this team.  He's a player on this team and obviously he's a big part.  He's doing his job.  We still need to make his job a little easier, and we expect to do so next game.

Q.  What does it mean to be one game away from the Stanley Cup Finals?

STEVE RUCCHIN: You know, of course, we're proud of what we accomplished, but, you know, by no means have we really accomplished anything.  We put ourself in a great spot and we need to take advantage of this opportunity.  We're not looking beyond this series whatsoever.  They've got a good specialty road team over there and we're going to be ready for them the next game.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

STEVE RUCCHIN: You know, it was definitely a nice bounce.  It was a great play with Mike Leclerc getting to the net, and it was a fortunate bounce for me.
