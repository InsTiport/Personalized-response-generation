 Q. Something different happening for you guys last night? 
 DANY HEATLEY: No. I think the first game we really generated a lot of chances and probably could have had a few more. You know, last night, I thought at times we really got away from our game. Got to get back to it on Friday. 

 Q. In what way? 
 DANY HEATLEY: You know, I think when we're going well, we're chipping it, going and getting it, putting a lot of heat on their D. I thought last night we didn't do a very good job of getting behind them. Allowed them to have time for them to do what they do well.
