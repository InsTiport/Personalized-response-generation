   DANY HEATLEY:  I think we obviously didn't get off to the start we wanted to.  We all feel we haven't played our best game yet.  And we gotta come back here in front of our own fans.  We're excited to be home.  There's people at the airport waiting for us showing their support.   
 So we're excited to play Game 3 on Saturday.   
  
  Q.  When you win a series in five, what's the biggest (indiscernible) after the long layoff?   
 DANY HEATLEY:  You don't look to the past.  That's something for you guys.  We're taking each series and each game one at a time.  And whether those series were five games or not, doesn't matter at this point.  We're in this series right now against a very good team, and we have to step up our game.   
  
  Q.  The deeper you get into the playoffs, the harder it gets to score (indiscernible).  What do you do all of a sudden, kind of switch on and try and get some of the goals (indiscernible) the goals you have gotten so far on both the power plays?   
 DANY HEATLEY:  Whatever way they come.  I think you're going to see a very - like you said, it's very tough to score in the Finals.  Especially, I think yesterday 1-0 game.  3-2 game the other night.  They're going to be tight games all the way along.  And it's a bounce here, chance here, good shot here.  And Pahlsson made a great shot the other night.  And we missed a couple of chances early that could have changed the game.   
  
  Q.  But nobody comes back, hardly anyway, from a 3-0 deficit.  Is there a sense already, look, you gotta lay it all on the line?   
 DANY HEATLEY:  No question, I think.  History says 3-0 down is not a great position to be in.  So we're definitely treating it as a must-win Saturday night in front of our fans.
