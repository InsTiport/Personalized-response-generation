Q. I know we addressed the power plays.  Were you at least satisfied to get so many shot attempts during those power plays?  If you keep doing that, you guys will break through?
BRYAN RUST: We had some good looks.  We had some good chances.  Anderson had some good saves.  We've got to do a better part to make it harder on them.
Q. You've really got to see what they're doing five-on-fives to understand it.  Preparation will take you so far when they have three guys back and clogging the neutral zone?
BRYAN RUST: We were actually prepared for it, but yet it is a little different when you're playing against it.  I think as the games go on, we'll get better.
Q. (Inaudible) defensive playing, get a lot of those chances in the first and kind of didn't amount to anything.  Was that kind of tough on you guys?  Was that deflating at all?
BRYAN RUST: I think for us, yeah, it always sucks when you don't capitalize on those.  But I think, to be able to get those and get those power play opportunities, we were doing good things.
