Q.  We talked about Brett Hull and the influence he had on you.  Can you give us a little bit more insight?

BOYD DEVEREAUX: It's been a real experience playing with Hully.  I have had a good chance to play with him pretty much the entire season.  And, you know, you can't help but learn so much.  And besides that, he's a fun guy to be around.

Q.  The wins over Los Angeles, and, of course, with Vancouver in the playoffs, and then with St. Louis and Vancouver in the playoffs, do you see the notch go up with Colorado?  Do you notice that?

BOYD DEVEREAUX: Oh, yeah.  Obviously the play has become more intense.  The excitement around the city and with the media, it's been incredible.  It's been a real experience.  I have never been this far in the playoffs.  So, I'm having a blast.
