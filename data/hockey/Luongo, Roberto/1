 WILLIAM M. JENNINGS TROPHY  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: It's fantastic, we've always had great ownership, do whatever it takes to win, so they're bringing the guys in to make this team get a chance to win the Cup and obviously we had a great year.  
 We wanted to do anything that we could to win and it's nice to be playing for the Bruins.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: It was huge. There is no doubt I wouldn't be up there if it wasn't for him. He had a fantastic year, every time he went in net he gave his team a chance to win, he has a bright future ahead of him, he's going to be a super star in this league and I was happy to have a partner like that and hopefully that will continue.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: That's the best award to win, when you get recognized by your peers like that, and it makes you really happy, he should be proud of what he did this year and I was really happy for him that he won.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: I'm not going to lie to you, start looking at it at some point but not until very late in the season, obviously with 10 games or less to go, when I saw that we might have a chance to win it I started talking to Schneids about it and he was obviously aware, too. I never had a chance to be part of a team that had a chance to win that trophy and it was nice especially down the stretch when we didn't have as much to play for to focus on that thing.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: He had an unreal year, he's well deserving of the trophy, you know, it's unbelievable, what he's been through with not only his career but the surgery he had and to be able to come back and play the way he did is spectacular and he deserves it.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: The funny thing is you could have four or five more guys on the list. There is a lot of guys that deserve it. (Away from mic.) You know he's going to be solid back there for his players and the list goes on and on. (Away from mic.) He's going to take over in the future here and it's nice to see the battle and the competition.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 ROBERTO LUONGO: We spoke briefly. I always said, you know, I admire what he does and he's a great goalie and I don't think it takes away from the respect I have for him and the talent that he has. That's something more you guys made a story out of than what was going on.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
