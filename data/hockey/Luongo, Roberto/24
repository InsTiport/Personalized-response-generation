Feels great.  It is something great just to accomplish.  They have confidence in me. 
 
Not really because what I do mostly is I don't put pressure on myself and when I play hockey I have fun, so this is not any pressure whatsoever. 
 
That is not the situation, but like I said before, throughout the years I have always had to make my place in a team.  That is what I am going to have to continue on doing and I think I am pretty good at that. 
 
Well, I think I am pretty much a big guy, so I could rely on the net so the shooters don't have a lot to shoot at.  I think I have great style and great technique.  So that is to my advantage. 
 
Well, I think there is a couple of things like mostly my work around the net still, I have to improve that and also sometimes I am just too deep in my net, maybe come out and challenge them more. 
 
Well, I know they won a couple of Cups in a row.  They had a great tradition and they have a young team and they will be pretty strong in a couple of years. 
 
Not really.  Surprised or not surprised, there was rumors that I would go fourth, but I wasn't sure.  I guess when my name was called I was pleasantly surprised.
