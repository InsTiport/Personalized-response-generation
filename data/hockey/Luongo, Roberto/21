  ROBERTO LUONGO:  You take people seriously.  You have fun with it.  Doesn't matter how many I go to score, just enjoy the day.   
  
  Q.  Pretty much have a good day?   
 ROBERTO LUONGO:  I think everybody approaches it different.  But for me, I enjoy it and I appreciate that the fans were in.   
  
  Q.  All-Star games in the past we hardly ever see slap shots.  It's one of those unwritten codes.  You were launching them all over the place?   
 ROBERTO LUONGO:  Yes.  A couple of one timers, a couple of slap shots.  I felt bad for Marty when (inaudible) and D man put a sticker up.  And move didn't touch.   
  
  Q.  Is that -- unwritten code you don't fire those like that?   
 ROBERTO LUONGO:  I mean, actually, a couple that period.  So I don't know.   
 It's an All-Star game.  But it's part of the game.  I think it's not -- harmless unless a guy really goes high.   
  
  Q.  Different than you're seeing, they were on the ice.  I mean, as far as the slap shot, is he one of the best you think there is?   
 ROBERTO LUONGO:  Yeah, he's got a cannon.  Definitely don't want to leave him time to wind up like that, especially full speed.   
  
  Q.  Little different, though, on the ice than you've seen?   
 ROBERTO LUONGO:  Hopefully we're doing the same next time we play him.  Show some respect the same way today.
