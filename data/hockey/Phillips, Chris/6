Q.  You say you didn't celebrate right away, but it sure looked to me like you were celebrating right away. 

CHRIS PHILLIPS:  Well, you know, when I came into the net, the puck was laying there and I hit it.  I didn't actually see it go in the net.  You know, I saw the other guys jump up, and they were coming off the bench.  I knew it went in then.

Q.  Chris, this wasn't supposed to happen against a New Jersey Devils team, with experience, up 3-1.  What's been going on here, Chris? 

CHRIS PHILLIPS:  Well, you know, we've stuck with it the whole way.  We got, you know, down 3-1, not where we wanted to be.  But we still had a lot of confidence.  We were doing a lot of things right.  You know, we're not surprised that we're where we're at right now because we have a great hockey team.

Q.  How has this team matured over the course of not just these last playoff series but these last few games?

CHRIS PHILLIPS:  Well, it sure has showed the character that we have in this dressing room.  You know, we've been through some tough times in previous playoffs with high expectations, high expectations of ourselves to do well.  We know that this is a great opportunity for us this year and we just don't want it to end sooner than what we want.
