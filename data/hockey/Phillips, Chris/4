   CHRIS PHILLIPS:  (Indiscernible) some turnovers and in turn we gotta be smart enough not to be - you know, turn the puck over and be sure plays get in.   
  
  Q.  How precarious a position do you think your team is in?   
 CHRIS PHILLIPS:  Well, it's disappointing to not get a win down here.  But we can't hang our heads.  There's a lot of pride in this room and we're going home now.  We've got two games at home to even out the series.
