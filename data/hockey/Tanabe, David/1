Q. Can you talk about your first year of college? Can you talk about how Wisconsin
prepared you for what you're going to see in the National Hockey League?

DAVID TANABE: Well, you know, as you know, college is a league similar -- comparable to
the WHL, major and junior in Canada. It prepares me similar to those leagues do. Gives me
ice time and an opportunity to develop in that way. 

Q. What were you most looking forward to about today?

DAVID TANABE: Well, just basically, you know, finding out who was going to select me.
It's a big decision in my future. You don't know what's going to happen. You might spend
four years in college, another might give me an opportunity to develop more quickly. This
is a big decision in my future as a player.
