Rangers   3
  Canadiens   2

Q.   After these last two days with the talk back and forth, is this as satisfying a win as you've had in quite a while? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I mean, it's a win in our quest to win four.   I mean, it was a real competitive game.   We put ourselves behind the 8‑ball a few times by taking, I think it was five penalties 200 feet from our net.   We're going to have to do a much better job than that. 
But give credit to our killers and our goaltender.   They did a real good job.   The goal they had on the power play was deflected, but for the most part I thought we did a pretty good job killing those penalties, but we're going to have to be better than that.

Q.   Why do you think you guys have had so much success on the penalty kill especially of late here? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You know, I don't think it's one thing specifically.   I think our guys do a good job whether it be on the forecheck coming back in the right positions and trying to create those battles where we have a chance to make a couple plays and get it out.   When we don't, goaltender stops the puck.

Q.   You talk about Marty always working on his shot in practice, again this morning, and he comes through in overtime. 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It looks like a goalie score tonight is exactly what you see him practice every time he's on the ice, like a hundred pucks.   He's trying to put it right there.   Made obviously a great shot on that goal.

Q.   When you guys were down 3‑1 Brad (Indiscernible) said these chances don't come around that much.   How do you guys get refocused to get that one? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, what we're going to do is reenergize.   Today was a really tough game, especially with the penalties that we took, there wasn't a lot of flow.   We're going to reenergize.   We're going to travel to Montreal tomorrow, have a good meeting tomorrow night, have a good meeting Tuesday morning, have a morning skate, and get ready for the game at night.

Q.   Couple of nice stretch passes from those opportunities early on.   Is that guys being opportunistic or a point of emphasis for you guys? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You know, I would say it's in the middle.   If you look at Brass's goal and they dump it in and we're able to go north‑south real quickly where we're sort of half interchange.   You know, one of the things that we've talked about is being able to play a north‑south game real quick, and that was one of the times we were able to do it.

Q.   Boyle got the assist on the shorthanded goal.   Can you talk about his role on the P.K.? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   He's one of the first guys I send out with Hags every time.   Big body, blocks shots, good on face‑offs, and he made a great play on that first goal.

Q.   Was (Indiscernible) available? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I got out of the flow so much that didn't risk it.

Q.   What would you attribute the number of penalties do you think?   Were they calling it extra close?   Was it the emotion? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It was us.   It was us.   They were penalties.   Can't do that.
