Boston  Â– 4
  Vancouver - 0

 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Vigneault. 

 Q. Alain, did you feel good about tonight the way the game started? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Yeah, I thought, you know, our guys were ready to play. But you know what, at the end of the day, I'm not going to analyze this game right now. Everybody is disappointed. Our players gave it their best shot. At the end of the day, you've got to give credit to where credit is due. Boston played a real strong game. 
 They have great goaltending and they were able to score a couple of tough goals around our net and they deserved to win. 

 Q. Was there a turning point in the series in your mind? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I can't see one right now. You know at the end of the day, I think both teams competed real hard. We played well the first three games in this building and they played real well in their building. Came down to Game 7 and we weren't able to get it done. 

 Q. Alain, which guys were playing with injuries --
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Everybody was fine. We're not going to use injuries as a reason for not gettin' it done. 

 Q. Your inability to score, what do you chalk that up to? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, again, I think you've got to give credit where credit is due. Their goaltender was real tough to beat. The way they played in front of him was real tough to beat. 
 We had some grade "A" chances and we weren't able to score. 

 Q. How would you describe the way they played in front of him? What do you mean? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, they let him obviously take the shooter and they did a great job of taking care of rebounds when he did give up some rebounds. They did a good job of collapsing five guys in front and makin' it real hard. 

 Q. Alain, is it more difficult because you were the best team all season, the best scoring team, the best defensive team and you get to the end and it doesn't work out? Does that make it more difficult? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I think anybody in our situation right now would feel real disappointed, whether you're the favorite or not. We battled real hard. I know we gave it our best shot, but in this one game, they were the better team. It's that simple. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.
