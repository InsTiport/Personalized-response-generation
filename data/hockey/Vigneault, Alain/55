 Q.   Coach, what was your reaction when you heard about Price being out?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It doesn't really change anything for us.   We're trying to get ready for our game.   Prior to the series, we had prepared for three possible goaltenders, obviously, spending more time on Price.   It's very unfortunate what happened to him.   But for us, it's business as usual.  
   
 Q.   Do you have any expectation of Kreider and/or that he might be a little bit of a target tonight?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I can't speak for how they're going to react.   I can just tell you how we're going to play.   Kreider is a good player, an honest player like the rest of our team.   We play a straight‑forward game, whistle to whistle and that's not going to change tonight.  
   
 Q.   Coach Therrien said it was a reckless play, and he said that Kreider has a history of doing this.   What is your response to that heavy language?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   We're getting ready for tonight.  
   
 Q.   Is Derick Brassard going to play tonight?   Do you feel the need to have Carcillo in the lineup based on the potential response from the Canadiens?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Brass is day‑to‑day.   And as far as lineup decisions, I haven't finalized that.   It's like any other game, you'll find out tonight at 8:00 o'clock when the puck drops at 8:00.  
   
 Q.   Obviously you know Michel very well.   Do you see it more as a coaching thing to kind of rally his team when he kind of speaks out about Kreider?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Again, I can't speak about their team.   I mean, I'm not there.   I'm coaching the New York Rangers.   I'm getting the New York Rangers ready to play tonight.   Are you trying again?   
   
 Q.   I'm trying again.   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You're going to get the same answer.  
   
 Q.   Was it a reckless play?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It was a hockey play.   Anybody else want to try?   Go ahead.  
   
 Q.   Let me try one, okay?   Yesterday you said that you thought Price would play today, and you said it was because you had not heard that he was injured.   Do you regret having said that?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   What does it matter?   Anything else?
