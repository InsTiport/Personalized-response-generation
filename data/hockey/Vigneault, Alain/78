 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Could you talk about your team's response when you're down 2-1, the mood in the dressing room going into the third?  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Yeah, you know, didn't like 15 minutes of that second period. Thought we didn't have our work boots on. We got out-muscled down low in our end and out-muscled in their end, thought they really took it to us.   
 But we talked about adjusting different things, especially our work ethic. Thought our guys were real good the last five minutes of that second period and real good in the third period.   
 There's another tough battle by two teams that are battling really hard.   
  
  Q. Talk about Burrows just in general and also about the ending, how that must have felt after the last couple days.   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, I mean, anybody that follows our team knows he's a really important part of our team. He plays five-on-five, he plays power-play, and he kills penalties. So, you know, he's overall one of our go-to guys. Again tonight he came up big in key moments.   
 I thought he was one of our better players. We need him to play that way.   
  
  Q. Talk about the way your team seems to have pushed the pace another level in both third periods in this series so far.   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Yeah, if you look at our stats during the regular season, I think we were the best team in the third period as far as scoring goals. So that hasn't changed throughout the playoffs.   
 We can push the pace and create scoring chances. I thought we did. I thought the twins, that line, really look over in the third and spent a lot of time in their end wearing down their defense. It paid off for us. We were able to tie the game.   
 I'm sure that has not happened very often to Boston this year, where they gave up a lead. They gave up a lead, we scored that game in OT right off the hop there.   
  
  Q. How did Manny look tonight and how much of an option does he give you moving forward?   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Yeah, I mean, I'm real happy. It was a real happy moment for our whole group to be able to put Manny in the lineup and to have him play the way he did. He did exactly what we all expected. He was real good on faceoffs. He was good on the ice. He created a scoring chance. That line played more minutes than throughout the San Jose series and I think obviously more than in the first game against Boston.   
 So I'm excited to have him back and I think he's only going to get better as we move forward here.
