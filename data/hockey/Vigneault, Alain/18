Tampa Bay   6
  New York   2

Q.   The way you guys came out of the second period down a goal, what was the feeling at that point and what changed there in the third for you guys? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, we took a penalty.   Got a couple of looks on their power play where we almost tied it up, and then the guys stepped out of the box, they scored, so 4‑2, tougher deficit.

Q.   Coach Cooper mentioned how he felt there was a lot more determination and effort by his team.   Did you see any difference in the way they played tonight? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, there is no doubt their top players had a very strong game, and a couple of our guys didn't have their best game tonight.

Q.   Your guys were pretty upset about the effort tonight too.   How do you think they're going to respond?   You've just played a lot of close games in this postseason.   So after a close game like this, how do you think they're going to respond? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Confident that we're going to respond the right way.   We always have.

Q.   Is tonight mostly about not being able to stay out of the penalty box, or did you see other things out there that were troubling for you? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You know, five‑on‑three, we don't execute on the play.   They come back and they make us pay.   When we made some mistakes they were able to capitalize on it and we weren't able to do the same thing.

Q.   Coach, is Johnson just in a zone for them at this point?   It seems everything he's putting on net is going in. 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Without a doubt he took his game to another level tonight.   We need our top guys to do the same thing.
