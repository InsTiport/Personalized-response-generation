 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Vigneault. 

 Q. Alain, chance to win the Cup tonight. How do you explain what happened in the first period? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, to tell you the truth it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, they won and we're going back home in front of our fans. One game showdown to win the Cup. That's it. 

 Q. Alain, is there a way to describe that period of time, most important game these guys have ever played, and you have a period of time you allowed a record number of goals in the Stanley Cup final? Any reason you can see that that happened? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Again, I'll give you the same answer I gave you off the hop. It happened, there is nothing we can do about it. We've already turned the page on that and we're going back home. 
 We've got this great opportunity in front of our fans behind us. We're going to make the best of it. 

 Q. Mason, how is he? Have you gotten an update?
 COACH VIGNEAULT: No, I haven't.

 Q. What was the impact of losing him so early in the game? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: All year long we've played through injuries. It's no different right now. 

 Q. Coach, there has been a tremendous difference in the games played in Vancouver and the games played in Boston. I wonder in your opinion are the Bruins playing better in Boston or is Vancouver playing worse in Boston? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Again, doesn't matter. At the end of the day, they've won at home, we've won at home, and we're goin' back home. 
 That's it. 

 Q. What do you say to your goalie after you make the change? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I haven't talked to him. He knows he's going back in next game. He's going to be real good. 

 Q. Coach, what would you say to Luongo to help with mental preparation for the showdown in Game 7? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Sorry, I didn't get that.

 Q. What do you say to Luongo in terms of helping with mental preparation? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I don't have to say anything to him. He's a professional. His preparation is beyond reproach and he's going to be ready for Game 7. 

 Q. Coach, you take nothing away from this game? You think going home cures all ills? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: We've turned the page, gettin' ready for next game. 

 Q. Coach, your team certainly is capable of scoring three goals in a game. Why the decision to pull Luongo that early? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I just felt that it was the thing to do at the time. 

 Q. Did he seem rattled? 
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I just felt it was the thing to do. That's all. 

 Q. Coach, how do you explain the difference between what your team has been able to do at home with your --
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Again, I think I've answered this question here many times. It doesn't matter. We're going back home. We've got home ice. We worked all year long to get "home ice." Our fans are going to be excited and our players are going to be excited and we're goin' back home.
