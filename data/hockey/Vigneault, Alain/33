    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Vigneault.   
   
 Q.   Second straight game you've given up a two‑goal lead.   You seemed to be better in the third period.   How do you get past that?  
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   We played a good game tonight.   We had a good third period also.   I mean, if you look at the scoring chances in the third, they were 3‑2 because their third goal I guess was a chance because it ended up in the back of our net.   
    But we played well.   We gave ourselves a chance to play.   They're a good team.   We had some looks in overtime.   Just couldn't score.  
   
 Q.   How frustrating is it to have two really good skates and come out of this barn with no wins?  
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, I mean, I think we've played close to nine periods now.   For the most part I've liked a lot of things about our game.   Our guys are trying real hard.   We're going to continue to try.   
    I mean, both games we had opportunities.   We didn't get it done.   We're going home in front of our great fans.   We're going to be ready for the next game.   
   
 Q.   The Dwight King goal that you referenced, is that interference in your mind?  
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Ask the NHL.   
   
 Q.   You forced a ton of turnovers tonight.   What is it going to take to keep that rolling as the series goes on?  
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, they're a real good team.   You got to try and take away their space and time.   We've done I think a fairly decent job against that high skill level.   
    You know, we're going to get ready for the next game and try and win.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of Zuccarello?   He was all over the ice tonight.   
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   His line played well.   They had some good looks.   Trying real hard.   They're going to continue to try.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think you lost tonight?   
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   They scored one more goal than we did.   
    Thanks.
