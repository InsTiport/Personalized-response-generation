  Rangers   2

Q.   Did you have a chance to take a look at that Prust hit?   If the league reviews it, what are your thoughts? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yeah, we looked at it where he missed it.

Q.   Do you have any idea what you might be looking at in terms of (Indiscernible)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, he can't do, obviously, what he did there, but we'll let the league handle that.   I believe if a penalty would have been called on Prust, it probably wouldn't have happened, but there is nothing we can do about it.

Q.   You've been talking a lot about how you want to play whistle to whistle.   Were you okay with the response after that hit? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You know, I didn't think Dan deserved to get a penalty on that and Dorsett obviously felt that they went after one of our top players and he wanted to do something about it.   So that's something that might happen sometimes, but for the most part I thought we played a good game and we had some real good looks.   We had the opportunities to take the lead in the game and we didn't.   Give credit.   Their team played hard and their goaltender played well.

Q.   Does it seem like the intensity in the series after this game has ratcheted up quite a bit? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, I think the series has been intense.   I mean, we battled real hard in both games in Montreal and battled extremely hard tonight.   We came out and we were ready to play.   We had some good looks.   We didn't finish, obviously, as many opportunities as we would have liked to, but it was a hard‑fought game.   Next one's going to be the same.

Q.   There is sense among some of the players that the Rangers were a better team tonight and there was a little frustration about that.   Any sense or comment about how may have been the better team tonight? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Both teams worked hard.   I thought we had some real good looks and give them credit.   They had some looks.   Their (Indiscernible) line was real good.   Their goaltender made some big saves.   The two teams are very similar.   Both teams are working really hard.

Q.   You like to try to run through four lines and use the whole bench.   But when you lose a guy like that, is there a rhythm you can't regain? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yes and no.   I don't think losing Dan hurt us as far as I was able to, for the most part, still play four lines.   We went down to 11 forwards and had some good looks. 

Q.   Have you spoken to Dan yet regarding the situation?   Will you, if you haven't, and what do you say to him? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Wait and see tomorrow, talk to him tomorrow and see what happens.
