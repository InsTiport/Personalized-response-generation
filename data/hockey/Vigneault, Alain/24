THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Vigneault. 

Q.   Can you I guess describe how you're feeling, how the team is feeling, what you take away from an effort like that. 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, obviously everybody's very disappointed in the outcome.   That being said, I think in a couple of days, you know, we're going to reflect. 
You go into this hoping that you don't regret anything.   We put it out there.   We gave our best shot, best effort.   Three games here all went to OT.   What can I say? 

Q.   I guess a few words about the game Hank played, keeping you in there. 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yeah, I mean, during the regular time, I mean, he made some big saves.   I thought in the overtime, though, that's when we played our better hockey of the night.   Had some real good looks.   Both goaltenders were outstanding. 

Q.   Obviously you have talked about luck throughout this whole thing.   With as many posts that were hit tonight, does it make it tougher, a tougher loss?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I mean, any loss in the Stanley Cup Final is going to be a real tough loss, so... 
Tried our best.   Everybody laid it out there.   I'm very proud of our group, very proud of their effort.   We'll see what happens. 

Q.   Being that you're proud, you get all the way here, can you tell yourself that it's a successful season?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yeah, I'm not going to get into that tonight.   Take a couple days here to reflect on what happened and we'll go from there. 

Q.   Just watching as a fan, it almost seemed a shame the game had to end the hockey was so good.   Did you have that sense?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I mean, it was a hard‑fought game.   I mean, every inch on the ice was contested real hard.   You know, both teams were battling at an unreal level. 
All three games here, when you look at it, they all went to overtime.   Tough loss. 
Thanks, guys.
