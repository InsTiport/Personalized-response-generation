 Q.   Are the scoring chances that they're getting too high of a quality?   Or no matter what the chances are, do you need more saves?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I think I've mentioned many times before, some games unfold differently, and tonight, I mean, you've got the highest scoring team in the league going up against the third highest scoring team in the league.   We've got a 2‑1 lead.   
Obviously, they're going to open things up.   They've got some goals in the second.   We had to open things up.   Found a way to crawl our way back and pushed it to overtime.   Had some good looks, they had some good looks.   It was one of those games.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised (No Microphone)?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   You know, in overtime everybody is thinking everybody be a shooter.   Hank had stopped the breakaway just before that, giving us a chance.   Sometimes stuff happens.  
   
 Q.   Coach, what did you think of Jesper Fast's game tonight?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   He played a good game.   You know, that line had some really good looks.   Both teams are battling really hard right now, and it went to overtime.  
   
 Q.   What has happened between the first game and these last two games from your standpoint?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Again, like I mentioned, some games unfold differently.   You know, you've got two of the highest scoring teams in the league.   You're going to get some nights, with the skill level out there, that there are going to be more goals, and this was one of those nights.  
   
 Q.   You guys have been pretty comfortable in playing tight, low‑scoring games.   How comfortable are you in playing these high‑scoring games?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, it's the way the game unfolded.   We took a 2‑1 lead, and then we're trailing by 2‑4, 4‑2, and we've got to push.   We were able to tie it up in the last minute and something in the game.   You know, some games there is just a little bit more scoring than others.  
   
 Q.   Coach, once again, their big guys show up, Stamkos and Johnson.   How imperative is it for you to get your big guys going?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I mean, guys are trying hard right now.   It's a one‑goal game.   It's a game where I thought we showed a lot of character coming back and evening this up in regulation.   
Got a little unfortunate on the game‑winner there.   But our guys are battling, and went to overtime tonight.   We're going to look at the game, see if there are some areas we can improve on and get ready for the next one.
