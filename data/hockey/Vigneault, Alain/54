 Q.   I guess, just start off, I know you always say that the goalies give you a chance, but the way the Canadiens started out tonight and with the atmosphere in the building, just how big was Hank in procuring this win?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, he's the only reason why we were still in the game.   They had a tremendous push.   They had total control and possession.   They make it 1‑0, and obviously, the turning point is us.   Within a minute, scoring to tie it up off a lucky bounce.   That changed the momentum and the dynamics of the game a little bit.   
I thought we were able‑‑ from there I thought we clawed our way through that period, and in the second and third we were good until we took the penalty at the end there.   We gave them a 6‑on forward, and they got some looks.  
   
 Q.   It just seems like these last five games you've been able to‑‑ whether it was against Pittsburgh, they were able to come back or tie it.   Just the even keel that you guys have seemed to be able to maintain with some hiccups, has that been hugely important to this point?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Credit there goes to, obviously, we're getting the right saves at the right time.   We've got some good leaders on our team that have been through battles and been through wars, and they keep our team well composed.   When Montreal was pushing, on the bench, the talk was about we needed to start making some plays here.   We needed to start to manage the puck, and they made it really challenging for us.   But I thought after we got that break there on the goal there, we were a little bit better.  
   
 Q.   You talked, I think it was before the series how Rick Nash had been leading your team in chances almost every game, but just couldn't find the back of the net.   He scores the goal the other day to make it 7‑1, and then gets the win tonight.   What's it mean to the group to see him put the puck in the net being who he is?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, he's smiling a little bit more lately.   And to see him finally get rewarded for working extremely hard, he was finding other ways to contribute, but I think he might be getting that little touch around the net back.   That's a really good sign for us.  
   
 Q.   Alain, after the game, six points in two games now, but he was more concerned about how his defensive game has improved.   Is that what you've noticed as well?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Both go hand in hand.   Like when Ryan's gap is good and, obviously, he's got tough match‑ups because he's always playing against the other team's best line.   When his gap is good and he's battling hard in his one‑on‑ones, usually the offensive part of his game is there, and it's been very good the last two games.  
   
 Q.   I'm just wondering what your reaction was or what you thought when you found out that Montreal was going with the rookie?   
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Somehow we had an inclination last night that it was probably going to be him, so that didn't surprise us.
