  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   Is the mood different from yesterday?   The guys seemed a little down yesterday.   You thought they'd be more upbeat today. 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Not sure what you guys expected.   But I think our overall mood was the one that was expected and appropriate.   I didn't think anybody would be making cartwheels yesterday. 
Today we're back at work.   We had a good meeting this morning.   We're getting ready for a good hockey game tonight. 

Q.   I'm assuming all lineup decisions will be a game time? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Your persistence, I love it (smiling). 

Q.   If you do bring Dan back into the lineup, after a sixâ€‘game suspension...     
COACH VIGNEAULT:   He would bring what he's brought to us all year long, is real good energy.   He's been in these situations before.   He's been a good player for us.   If we do use him tonight, I'm sure he's going to be ready. 

Q.   Have you seen this before with guys who are in and out of the lineup like that, and when they come back in, they tend to do something positive?   Is that adrenaline?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   That's why sometimes we make changes.   You know, we're expecting changes to be positive for our team. 
Sometimes you can shuffle the deck with the lineup you have, or sometimes you bring new players into the lineup to hope that they can give you a spark, so... 
Every time we needed players to come in for different reasons, they've usually come in and done a pretty good job for us. 
I had my Netflix imitation for you guys today.   Nobody asked (laughter).
