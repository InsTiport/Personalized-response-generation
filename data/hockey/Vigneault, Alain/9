Tampa Bay   2
      New York   0

Q.   Coach, did Tampa Bay do anything differently tonight that made it difficult to get shots on goal and find shooting lanes? 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, they did find, obviously, those shooting lanes, and I really like the way we came out, the energy, and the time we spent in their end.   But for all that time, we didn't get much out of it. 
    They did a great job of defending, blocking lanes and blocking shots, and it made it really challenging for us.

Q.   Your power play obviously had two goals a game the past three games.   Tonight couldn't get anything, and really didn't get a lot of shots either.   What do you think was the difference there? 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, you know, our power play had been getting us some momentum, had been getting us some really good looks.   Our execution was a little bit slow tonight on the power play.   Because it was slow, it made it easier for them to defend.   We didn't get very many looks on it, and obviously that was a big part of tonight's game.

Q.   Does the fact that your team has been in this position before have any role whatsoever, any effect whatsoever, in the next 48 hours? 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, I mean, our intentions are to continue to play.   If we want to continue to play, we're going to have to, obviously, play our best game of the year. 
    That team is playing extremely well.   I think our experience in these situations might come in and help.   But at the end of the day, we've got to go out and execute and we're going to have to play our best game of the year.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Sorry, I didn't understand the first part.

Q.   The low‑scoring type of control, was this more your team's type of game? 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, we went after them.   I mean, look at the time we spent in their end in the first 30, 35 minutes.   We were going.   We had two "D"s up in the play, two "D"s up trying to cycle and create some open ice. 
    It was just very hard to get to.   You have to give them a lot of credit.

Q.   Once again backs to the wall, down 3‑2.   The previous game in Tampa, there was a little bit of a looseness beforehand.   Nash took the guys out to go see a movie.   Can something like that happen now going into this critical game?   How do you stay loose when everything is really on the line? 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   I have a lot of faith and trust in my players.   They know how to prepare and they know how to get ready for games.   For us this year, there is going to be no bigger game than the next one.   So I'm confident that we're going to be ready for it.
