    THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Vigneault. 

Q.   You out‑shoot them 2‑1.   What went wrong?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Couldn't score. 

Q.   Did you feel Quick was just that good tonight or were the mistakes as costly in this game as they've been in others?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, he was obviously the best player on the ice tonight. 
    But, you know, we got sort of a bad rush read on the first.   We deflect in our net.   Same thing happened in the second goal.   On the third goal we played a two‑on‑one right, take the pass, goes right back on their stick. 
    Give them credit.   They found a way to put the puck past a real good goaltender, and we couldn't do it. 

Q.   They've been good mentally responding to your goals early in the first two games.   How difficulty was it to respond to the first goal?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, I know there wasn't a lot of shots on net.   But we felt we played a real good period, the pace was good, there wasn't a lot of room, both teams were battling real hard for ice. 
    That was their only chance in the first period.   We out‑chanced them 4‑1.   We had some real good looks.   Stuff like that happens. 
    Effectively we came out hard in the second and we kept trying. 

Q.   You haven't used Rick Nash on the power play much this series.   Was it a matter of just trying to switch things up to get something going or was there something in his game that you liked?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   I liked his effort level tonight.   He battled real hard like he's done through the playoffs for us.   Doesn't have a lot to show for it, but he's competing hard. 
    I just wanted to see if we couldn't throw a different look at them. 

Q.   You've been pretty hands‑off with this team all year, leaving it to the leadership group.   Are you going to stay like that in this moment or are you going to try to send a message to them in some way?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   I'm going to do like I've done all year long and do what I think is right for the team. 

Q.   Were you happy with the power play tonight, the opportunities, the chances you had?
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, you got to finish in this game.   It's a performance‑oriented business.   Power play had some looks, but it didn't finish. 

Q.   Obviously your players are human, they know the situation they face right now.   What are you going to tell your players?   We've seen the Kings come back from a 3‑0 deficit. 
    COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, I'm going to take the night to figure it out. 
    Thanks.
