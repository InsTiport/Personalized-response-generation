   THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. Any added importance to winning it there on the first opportunity?  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: For us, what we want to do is put our best game on the ice. If we put our best game on the ice, the results usually take care of themselves.   
 So we're going to go out there, we're going to work real hard, we're going to play for 60 minutes. If it takes more, we'll play longer. We're going to try our best.   
  
  Q. Is it difficult for you to get calls right now?  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: You know what, the game is played on the ice, like I've said many times. We play whistle to whistle. We play hard. We're a physical team. We hope the right calls are made at the right time. We haven't let that bother us and we're not going to let it bother us moving forward.   
  
  Q. Is it hard to keep the players down-to-earth when they're only one win away from the Stanley Cup?  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: I don't think so. I think we've got a very mature group, a group that set out at the beginning of training camp to win the Stanley Cup. We weren't shy about talking about what our goals were. Now we've got an opportunity on Monday to achieve that goal. Until that's done, everybody's real focused on the task at hand.
