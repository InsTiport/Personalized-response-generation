Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, our overall situation is a little bit better.   I mean, we knew that yesterday was a very important game.   We've evened the series out.   Best of three now, and we have home ice advantage. 
But it's been a really tough series.   Every game has been different.   First game was tight checking.   Second game special team units took over.   Third game it was back and forth where there's tons of open ice and both teams are scoring when it's overtime.   And last night from our standpoint we had a really solid first period.   They got momentum in the second and some looks, and our goaltender stood tall. 
In the third we were able to get him out of reach with a couple of big power‑play goals.   So every game has been different.   At this time of the year it's about finding ways to win and that's what we're trying to do.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   No, because I would say to you this is sort of to be expected.   I mean, you have the No. 1 offensive team and number three offensive team in the league.   Tons of skill, tons of speed on the ice.   It makes it challenging for goaltenders.   I mean, teams are going to get some looks.   So you prepare your team, you prepare for the execution that's needed with the puck.   You prepare them what they need to do to defend.   But there are so many players that can beat you one‑on‑one that they're going to get some open looks.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I believe my staff and my players really believe in our approach and our process to be successful.   The difference is the opposition.   We're meeting obviously a quicker team and a more skilled team at this time, and it makes it very challenging. 
They're one of the best teams I've seen.   They come at you hard and we do the same to them.   We've been, I think, very good in the last couple games offensively.   We've been able to find the back of the net on more than a couple of occasions, which we hadn't done so far on a fairly consistent basis in the playoffs.   So we get some looks, the right guys are getting the looks.   The right guys are putting the puck on the net, so hopefully we can continue.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Typical.   No, you know what?   I thought the way J.T. had played, to give you an honest answer, I don't always do it this time of the year.   I keep things in tight, you know.   I don't want to divulge everything, but I will say I thought J.T. had played really well in that third period of the last game.   I saw something with him and Brassard and Nash there.   He, Hagelin and Marty had some good looks and good offensive zone time.   I used him in the Pittsburgh series.   I thought it might be something worthwhile going back to and it paid off.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yeah, he's coming along.   Part of the overall knowledge of the game and figuring the game out and when it's time to go and not to go.   J.T. is one of our younger players like Jesper and Kevin and Step and Kreider, with the knowledge they're getting better, and that's what we need.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, after Marty scored that goal, we had three other real good looks.   I'm hoping that we're going to see more of those.   He's been the constant pro here even though it's been a test for him to get on the score sheet and score some goals, which he knows that's part of his mandate with any team, especially ours.   He's stayed with it and he's worked extremely hard.   Got a little relief last night, and hopefully we'll be able to build on that and take it to the next level.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   I'm going to worry about my players and get them ready, and I'm sure their coach is probably doing the same thing.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It depends on the struggle.   There will be some types of plays or decisions out there that tell me that this guy is going to be off and I should do something quick, but most of our guys are pretty good.   Be at this time of the year you need your four lines and your 16.   They know one part on the line and one part on the deep there isn't bringing that security to the whole team (Indiscernible).   It affects the whole team, and nobody wants to affect the team.

Q.   (No Audio)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   It's the best I've seen him play so far with the puck.   How to beat the forecheck, when to jump up in the attack.   It's the best I've seen him play with that so far.   I've seen him play really good with Phoenix before.   It takes players a little adjustment time.   He's playing really well.
