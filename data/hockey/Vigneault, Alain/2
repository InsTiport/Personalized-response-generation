Q.   Hank gave you a chance in the first two periods, and one slips by him.   Did you think it was going to be a goal like that that decided it? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, it was a hard‑fought game.   Both teams were battling hard to try and create some chances, playing well defensively, and their first goal, their winning goal, obviously slipped through.   We're tight on the checking, and the puck had eyes and went through a couple of bodies and went through Hank, so that turned out to be the winner.

Q.   It seems like in both Game 5 and Game 7, it was very difficult to generate any type of offense.   Were they doing anything differently in those two games, as opposed to being at home, that you saw that made it difficult? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Well, the difference was we were able to score early on the road, and that obviously made them open things up a little bit.   Two games‑‑ the last two games at home, we weren't able to find the space and generate the looks to get anything past their goaltender.

Q.   When you're looking at this roster and evaluating it this off‑season, is there something you're missing?   Is there something you need? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Yeah, I'm not going to get into that tonight.   We just were basically one period away from going to the Stanley Cup Finals.   Our guys competed real hard, battled real hard, and this is very disappointing to us, to our fans.   So we're going to take a little bit of time here to contemplate on our season and get back to you on a better day for an answer on that.

Q.   What did you make of McDonagh playing through whatever he played through, and how difficult was that one? 
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Mac has been playing on a broken foot, and we've sort of got caught there after warm‑up.   The freezing hadn't kicked in, so we weren't sure if he was going to be able to play. 
So at that time we made the decision to go with seven.   He went back in right at the start of the first period, and it kicked in a little bit.   But he played through a lot of pain.

Q.   How long has it (Indiscernible)?
COACH VIGNEAULT:   Couple of games.
