 THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.   
  
  Q. Just wondering the combination of your goaltender in this building, if you're considering a change in that area for Game 4?   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: No.   
  
  Q. What did you think of the hit on Rome?   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, if I was Aaron Rome, I'd be upset right now. But I know that they got the right call on the ice. We'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. Alain, would you say this was more about what they did positive than what you did negative or how would you look at how this game went?   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, we gave that team I think it was 10 power-plays. I thought we were pretty disciplined.   
 So if I were to comment on what I think of the penalties, I'd get a pretty big fine so I'm going to save my money.   
  
  Q. Is there a possibility that Rome and/or Ehrhoff could miss Game 4?   
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Yes, both.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: Well, you know, I think Kevin's intentions were real good. But on certain occasions sometimes he wanted to do a little bit too much out there, got him in trouble. But, you know, overall, he tried real hard, and that's what we want our players to do at this time of the year.   
  
  Q. Alain, at one point in the first period you were getting out-shot 15-1. Is that a direct result of the penalties or more than that?  
 COACH VIGNEAULT: All their shots were on the power-play, so that's what it was.   
 Thanks, guys.
