 Q. Did killing off the five on three provide the lift necessary for Jason Arnott's's
goal?
 
 JOHN MADDEN: I think so. I think Arnott's goal is more important than people realize.
We killed off a 5-on-3 situation; they had the momentum going. I think Arnie's goal really
helped our team. Hopefully it will carry over to next period. 
 
Q. For seven periods a lot of people would say the Devils have outplayed the Stars. How
is it this series is tied at one?
 
 JOHN MADDEN: I am not real sure. I think lack of scoring in the second game and lack of
following our game plan. We got a way away from it the second game and we got to get back
to it tonight. We have been doing it so far. With these penalties it is hard to get your
momentum going.
