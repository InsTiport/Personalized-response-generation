Q.  I'm here with Adam Oates.  We've got seven goals in two periods.  How do you explain the difference?
 
ADAM OATES: A little more intense.  Better hockey, a couple breaks.  Guys are working real hard, getting chances. 
 
Q.  You're the best in the faceoffs in the league so far.  What's your secret?
 
ADAM OATES: Well, sometimes you get against guys on the wrong side and they have a lot of lefties, no righties, and on their right side of the ice, it's harder for them.  You get some confidence and pull some out. 
 
Q.  Enjoying the wide-open game?
 
ADAM OATES: It's not really wide open, just more goals. 
 
Q.  John Madden has war scars.  You can see the stitches.  What happened, John?
 
JOHN MADDEN: I don't know whose skate made contact with me when I was on the ice.  When I was down in the scrum, someone came up and hit me in the face. 
 
Q.  20 minutes of hockey left now.  How do you protect the lead?
 
JOHN MADDEN: Take care of the puck.  You can't take long shifts, you can't give them many chances.  I can go on, but we've got to be smart with the puck.
