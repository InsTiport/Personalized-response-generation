Yes, I'm very excited.  I'm happy, yes, sir greatest day of my life.  Greatest day of my life. 
 
I know about wanting to be -- I'm just excited they picked me in the first round. 
 
They've got a lot of players who I  like.  I like guys like Peter Bondra, guys from Washington. 
 
I would try to practice hard.  I would try training as hard as I can and I hope next year in better level than junior league.  I hope I can play NHL, so I'm trying to do everything for this.  It's my dream. 
 
Yes, I've been there. 
 
About four weeks ago.  I had some things, so I was there and I saw training camp stuff like that about Washington Capitals. 
 
I was just -- I've never been in the locker room.  Guys like, I don't know Bondra (ph) and Wyndacof (ph), so I'm very excited. 
 
Thanks.
