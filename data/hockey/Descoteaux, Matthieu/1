I'm surprised to be with the Edmonton Oilers for next year.  I think they try to build a new team, a young team, and I'm very proud to be one of those, yeah.

Yeah, because yesterday I had an interview with the Oilers and they gave me, I think, a good feeling.  So when they went on the stage, I was thinking about it and I was thinking about it and really when I heard my name, so I was very proud and so excited about it.


Q.  What do you know about the Oilers?

Yeah, I know the team.  I know last year they drafted Georges Laraque.  I played against him this year.  He's a very, very good player.  I talk sometimes with him, and it was -- and I was very impressed with the Edmonton Oilers organization and the town.  I have a good feeling for training camp.


Q.  Were you getting nervous?

Yeah, really, big time, because you know, it's a dream for a young player, and I'm very, very proud.


Q.  What are your expectations for this training camp?

For sure I'll try to make the team, because every player -- I think they all want to make the team, so I'm one of them, sure.


Q.  How would you describe yourself? 

Good player, I'm defenseman, basically.  I'm physical, defense.  I give a lot of body checks during the games.  This year I used to play in a lot of the penalty situations, and one of the good defensemen in the league.  But I'm still basically a defensive -- defenseman.

Interviews, yeah, yesterday.

Yeah, a little bit, because I was thinking about it when I went on the stage and I cracked my finger and it's like a dream for me right now.
