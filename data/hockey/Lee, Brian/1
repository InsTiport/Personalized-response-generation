  Q.  You're ranked I believe 15th among North American skaters.  Were you surprised to go this high?  Can you talk about what it's being selected by the Senators?   
 BRIAN LEE:  Yeah, I was really surprised to be picked so highly, by such a great team.  It's really exciting for my family and I.   
  Q.  Ottawa has so many good young players.  How long do you think it will be before you can make any kind of impact in their lineup?   
 BRIAN LEE:  I have no idea.  I'll have to go to college and hopefully improve a lot there and then someday hopefully be able to play for the Senators.   
  Q.  Give us an idea of your game for Ottawa fans who don't know anything about you.   
 BRIAN LEE:  I'm just a defenseman, hard worker, team player.   
  Q.  Had you met with the Senators?  Did you have any inkling?   
 BRIAN LEE:  No.  I wasn't supposed to meet with the Senators at the Combine.  I ran into one of the team representatives in the elevator, met him.  He decided they were going to interview me.   
 Kind of a good thing I met him in the elevator, I guess.   
  Q.  Did they at least go to some of your games, have any sort of contact with you?   
 BRIAN LEE:  They maybe did, but I'm not sure.  I guess coach took care of all that.   
  Q.  Coach Morville was a Senator scout.  Does that have an impact?   
 BRIAN LEE:  I have no idea, I guess.  If it did, I want to thank him, I guess.
