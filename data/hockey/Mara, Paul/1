I just really had a general interview with them yesterday.  There was really no inclination I was going to go there.  I just went on a whim, I guess. 
 
I really had no idea they were going to draft me.  It is a great time in my life right now.  They have a great organization down there.  I am really proud to be a part of it. 
 
Well, I am going to do everything possible.  This summer I'm working hard and everything to break the lineup next year.  But, if not next year, definitely the following one. 
 
It is a great honor to be drafted in the top 10.  I am really excited right now, as well as my family. So, it is really great honor to be drafted this high 
 
To be in the first American draft it is a great honor.  There are a lot of great players in this country and to have my name on top of that list is a privilege. 
  
It is definitely one of the most exciting moments of my life right now.  For the most part it is the highest, highest excitement that I have ever had. 
 
Well, I am definitely excited to be drafted by Tampa Bay.  They have a great organization.  I am really not going to comment on wishing I got drafted from the Bruins because Tampa Bay has a great organization down there. 
 
I am not sure about that.  They are great friends and they have played together.  What goes on between them, I try and stay out of.
