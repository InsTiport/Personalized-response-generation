  BRIAN ROLSTON:  The third period was a tough one there to get back into it.  But it was a great experience.  It was tremendous. 
And to be a part of it, to, you know -- my first time here with all these talented players, it was a lot of fun.  I thought the game was pretty good, too.  I thought it was pretty competitive.  And obviously (inaudible) goals.  But it was a good game. 

 Q.  There was so much talk about Ovechkin and Crosby and the young guys over East.  You guys got some old guys who got it done here? 
 BRIAN ROLSTON:  Veteran players.  When we get back in the zone, stay in the middle because they're trying to embarrass us out there.  Not that, but they were looking for each other through the middle all the time.  But they're tremendous players. 
 And they're going to carry the torch for this league, and it's great that we have them. 

 Q.  Your second goal, you had to be (inaudible) for about a minute. 
 BRIAN ROLSTON:  Exactly.  You know, like I said, that was one of those situations where we just kind of stood there in the middle and kept buzzing around on the outside.  Eventually they threw an inner pass and we got one out of it. 
 So it was a fun game.  Playing with Billy again was nice and Yanic is a tremendous player.  It was a lot of fun. 

 Q.  (Inaudible) did he break the puck?  Did you at any point in time think -- 
 BRIAN ROLSTON:  I saw the mic but I thought something came off the camera or something, behind the net or that it was in the net.  But I heard the commentary was that I broke the puck or something like that.  I'm not sure.  I don't shoot at that. 

 Q.  When you hit it (inaudible) Michael? 
 BRIAN ROLSTON:  I don't know.  I don't know where it could have hit.  Where it would have knocked his mic off.  It was a five-hole shot.
