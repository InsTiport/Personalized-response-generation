  Q. With all the rallying you guys had to do in the first two rounds, did you guys just run out of gas at this point?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, I don't know if we ran out of gas. I think I give credit to the Flyers. They had a good Series. They played well defensively. They've got some people back; I think that helped them. You know, I think we battled hard, but we just weren't able to score enough goals.  
  
  Q. The power play was a big problem in this Series. I mean, you had a hard time scoring goals on the power play?  
 COACH MARTIN: (Answered in French).  
  
  Q. You came out strong the first period taking the lead. What do you think the turning point of the game was?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, probably a couple of breakdowns. I thought we came out real strong with some good opportunities in the first period. You know, their shorthanded goals got them back in the game.  
 In the second period, we came out hard again, and spent some time in their zone. A couple of mental lapse or mistakes, and they were able to capitalize. They've got people that can capitalize.  
  
  Q. How much do you think Carter and Laperriere changed the momentum of the Series after they returned?  
 COACH MARTIN: It helped. You get two players, especially an individual like Carter who is  
a premier player. But, they played well. I give them credit.  
 But at the same time, I think we just didn't score enough. That was the difference; and the special teams were the difference in the game.  
  
  Q. Did you need -- when you talked about you didn't score enough goals -- did you need more presence in front of the net? Was that something that you were looking for that you didn't get in the Series to help create some of those goals you were talking about?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, there was a presence in front of the net. I don't know, I just think that we didn't -- the Game 1, we didn't play well. But I thought Game 2, first period we came out. Their goalie made some good saves, and then Game 2 as our game. We just didn't finish; we had some good opportunities and we didn't finish.
