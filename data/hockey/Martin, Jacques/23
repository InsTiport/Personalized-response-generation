Q.  Was it a case of your team dropping after the tying goal or was it their team just taking off?

JACQUES MARTIN: Well, I think that I thought that we played very well for the first 40 minutes and unfortunately I think we lost the momentum probably like in the last penalty of the second period there, the penalty-killing, the high stick, I guess they didn't see:  We came out strong did a lot of good things for 40 minutes once we got behind and we lost  -- they capitalized and they are a good team that way.

Q.  Lalime himself thought he should have had the Pandolfo goal.  Is it tougher for a team to come back when you have had a lead, you have got them where you want them and then he gives up a goal like that?

JACQUES MARTIN: I think that was probably  -- I thought that we played really well for 40 minutes and then we had some breakdowns in the third period and I think that was the difference.

Q.  You have seen this these Playoffs, that teams can come back from three games to one.  Do you take comfort in that?

JACQUES MARTIN: Yeah, I think that you take the positive points from today like for 40 minutes.  I think we had pretty good  -- played well and you know  -- the score was tied, but with a bit of luck we could have been ahead.  So I think you build on that and you give everything you have on Monday.
