  Q. I looked for any Wachovia sand and didn't see any. What is your reaction to all of this stuff about that?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, I think that it's a complete fabrication. We did an investigation, and the Bell Centre is really an impeccable building; and we have some more important things to focus on and prepare ourselves for the game tonight.  
  
  Q. Any update on Tom Pyatt?  
 COACH MARTIN: Tom will be a game-time decision tonight.
