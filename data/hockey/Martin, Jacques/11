  Q. Are you surprised at how well Michael Leighton has played for the Flyers so far?  
 COACH MARTIN: I shouldn't say I'm surprised. I think he's a good goalie. I think he had a good season for their team, so I'm surprised that we haven't scored, that's, you know, I think that we have to do a better job in certain areas.  
 But I thought that we competed hard tonight, and it was a good game. The difference was the special teams.  
  
  Q. What did you think of the chances that Montreal had on the Flyers' net tonight?  
 COACH MARTIN: We had some good chances, especially in the first on our power play. I think we had some real good chances there. You know, I think we played a much better game. We competed, and we made some progress.  
 We still have to make some changes. The difference, obviously, in the hockey game was the special teams. They got two power-play goals, and we didn't score.  
  
  Q. You've done this to other teams this spring, frustrate them and then take advantage of your opportunities. Are you worried about the frustration in your room coming out of this without having scored down 2-0?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, I don't think so. I think that, you know, we did certain things much better tonight. I thought I can't blame the effort. I thought we got a good effort. We just need to bring some solution to our special teams and five-on-five do a couple of things different. But we made some progress, and we just got to get ready for Game 3.  
  
  Q. Do you feel your team needs to get more physical against the Flyers at this point?  
 COACH MARTIN: Well, I don't know. I think physicality; I don't think that's the issue. I think we've just got to find ways to probably get a better net presence. I think that's one. I thought that we made some progress in areas. We played much better in certain parts of the game. We spent more time in their zone tonight than the first game. Our level of competition was better. So we'll dissect the game and bring the necessary changes for Game 3.
