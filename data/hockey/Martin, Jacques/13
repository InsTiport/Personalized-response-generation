  Q. What would you like to improve on the most in Game 2?  
 JACQUES MARTIN: Well, I think we'll analyze the game. There's no doubt the special team is one area we have to be better at, and also our overall game.  
 I think what has brought us some success, in the first two rounds, was our ability to compete. Tonight, we didn't compete at the level we needed to.  
  
  Q. Is part of that the fact that perhaps out of the three opponents you've played so far, it seems that Philly did the best job of getting in and around Halak and screening him? That was one thing that Pittsburgh felt they didn't do well enough in the last round?  
 JACQUES MARTIN: I don't think so. I think it's a matter of adjusting our game and raising our level of intensity.  
 I think tonight we didn't play a team game. We played an individual game, and you can't be successful that way.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised at the Flyers' extraordinary patience in picking their shots, waiting for your guys to make a move, or go down before shooting which they don't often do?  
 JACQUES MARTIN: No, I think that they have a lot of poise. They've got a lot of good players. You know, they've been playing extremely well, and I think when you look at their success against the Bruins, it showed that.
