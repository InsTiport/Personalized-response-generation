 Q. Are you disappointed at all you didn't go as the No. 1 pick?
 
 PAVEL BRENDL: Not really. I said before, I didn't really care if I will be No. 1, No.
4. I'm really, really happy be in New York.  
 
Q. Did you have any idea that the Rangers were going to trade up to pick you? Was there
any hint that they were going to do that? Did you know that?
 
 PAVEL BRENDL: I had a late meeting last night with them. They gave me some ideas what
could happen. But I didn't know anything for sure.  
 
Q. Going to New York can be a lot of pressure. Are you prepared for dealing with
something like that every day?
 
 PAVEL BRENDL: I never felt any pressure in my life, so I believe, again, I will not
feel pressure. 
 
Q. What do you think is the biggest asset to your game, the best part of your game that
you'll be able to utilize in the National Hockey League? 
 
 PAVEL BRENDL: Probably scoring goals. I hope I will score a lot of goals again.  
 
Q. Do you expect that you can play in the National Hockey League next season? 
 
 PAVEL BRENDL: Yeah. It's why I'm here. I came to play National Hockey League one day.
Now I got the opportunity to play next year. So I've got to work hard during the summer.
We'll see after training camp. But I believe I can make the step.
