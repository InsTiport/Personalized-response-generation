Q.  What about communication, when you come in and all this stuff is thrown at you -- all of a sudden you're thrown in with a bunch of guys -- a bunch of guys that you've never played with it?
 
KEITH TKACHUK:  I was asked to go out and have fun. It doesn't matter, really. It's just for the fans. You just want to win. There's a lot of pride going on. It's just great. 
 

Q.  It might be something like you play at one of the local places when you grow up?
 
KEITH TKACHUK:   Yeah, this is the best  experience in the world. 
 

Q.  Okay, thanks, Keith. What did you think of Nick's play tonight?
 
KEITH TKACHUK:  Nick's solid. He shutout a lot. 
 

Q.  He gave up one.
 
KEITH TKACHUK:  Did he? 
 

Q.  Yeah.
 
KEITH TKACHUK:   He's awesome. 
 

Q.  Was there a sign when you were lining up that one shot, was there a thought, hey that's my goalie?
 
KEITH TKACHUK:  No, I was thinking, hey, I want to beat him. That's what I was thinking. He's solid. He did a good job tonight.
