Q.  Can you tell us how you feel about going to Anaheim? 
 
JOFFREY LUPUL:   I'm really excited.  I mean, it's one of the places that I interviewed with and I knew there was a good chance that I would be going.  Looking at some of the players they have there and what the team needs, I think I can definitely bring some scoring to Anaheim.  
 
Q.  Do you feel ready to step into the NHL next year?
 
JOFFREY LUPUL:   I think right now, that's definitely my goal, going into camp.  I think going into a training camp, you have to have one thing in mind, and that's making the team.  I think right now, that's definitely the first thing on my mind is playing in the NHL next year. 
 
Q.  Were you surprised at all; do you think Nashville might pick you before Anaheim?
 
JOFFREY LUPUL:   I knew there was a good chance that Pittsburgh or Nashville might choose me, but I also knew there was a lot of other good players.  Ryan Whitney and Scottie Upshall, I can't say enough about, he's a great competitor, a lot of grit.   It was not really a surprise, no, to be pick.  I knew there was lots of guys there.  I knew it made it hard on Pittsburgh and Nashville.
