   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chris Kelly. 

 Q. (Question about special teams.) 
 CHRIS KELLY: Special teams are huge no matter what, even in the regular season or playoffs. Then if you get one on the PK, it would be great. Give a boost to the team. 
 I thought we moved the puck pretty good last game, solid shots. The only thing missing was putting the puck in. So we just have to make sure we bear down on those chances. 

 Q. How is the adjustment of putting Zdeno in front of the net? 
 CHRIS KELLY: I think it helped out. He's a big guy, hard to move. It's always like Holmstrom in Detroit, he's always in front of the net, make it tough for the goalie. Z done it before when he played in Ottawa. Not like something new for him. 

 Q. The first Stanley Cup game, what was the experience like?
 CHRIS KELLY: It was awesome. I thought the atmosphere was awesome. You can feel it even the night before the game. Obviously you want to leave everything out there. It's a great experience. You can compare it to pretty much like Olympic hockey games. Similar style. You see a lot of people around the hockey. That's really a good atmosphere. 

 Q. Talk to your brother a lot and did he prepare you for the Cup finals? 
 CHRIS KELLY: We always talk on the phone and stuff. He knows what we going through and stuff. He said, Just make the most of it. It would be nice to win Game 2 for you guys and be back in the series.
