Q.  Congratulations.  What are your impressions of being drafted by the Phoenix and ow soon do you think you'll be able to play for them?
 
FREDRIK SJOSTROM: Well, I'm very happy to be drafted by Phoenix, and well, I don't know I want to go to training camp this year and we'll see if I make it.  I hope so.  But I'm very glad to be drafted by Phoenix. 
 

Q.  You were ranked really high in a lot of magazines.  Were you surprised when you went to 11 and not maybe a little higher?
 
FREDRIK SJOSTROM: Well, you don't know at the draft.  You can go like anywhere, but I was very pleased to go at 11.  It doesn't really matter because it's the years to come that are important.  You can't stop playing just because you are drafted.
