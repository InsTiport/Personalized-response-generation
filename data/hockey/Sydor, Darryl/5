 Q. You scored the goal for the Stars. Jersey, in that last series, the first goal meant
everything. How important is it for you guys to counter?
 
 DARRYL SYDOR: I think it was really important. I think to start the game we didn't
start the way we wanted to start. Obviously came down to the goal we needed. I think to
come out even after the first period and get our legs underneath us. Obviously now we are
tied going into the second and hopefully we have a better start.
