Q.  (On the first goal.)
 
PATRICK ROY: I thought I had the puck, and I made a great save on Yzerman and I thought I had it in my glove.  I was looking for the puck.  I guess it just rolled under me and they put it in. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
PATRICK ROY: We came in and we tried to play a solid game in the second.  We may have given an up a few too many outnumbered situations.  And the second one of them was very costly.  It would have been nice to go to the dressing room 1-0.  It could have been different.  Two goals was good for them and they played a simple game, and I think they had some confidence.
