 Q. Are you disappointed in what they did in the third?  
COACH ROY: (Indiscernible) not much going into the third period. But that was there for both teams and I thought they were both playing hard and fought. And I thought our penalty killing was really good. We got important kills in the first two. They did a good job in the second, same thing. And I was very happy that we would kill the penalties.   
But it's also, I mean, we had about the first five shots of the game were I thought really a good start. Scoring, I liked the way we bounced back, found a way to score and took a lead after that. The same thing in the third. Down 3‑2. Waited to score, the next one it's a 3‑3 game. Unfortunately for us they score with about a minute left in the game.  
   
 Q. Overall, can you talk about the experience?  
COACH ROY: I enjoyed it. It was a nice experience. I'm just wondering because we lost tonight and everything was first class by the organization. You did a super job in every detail. ‑‑  
   
 Q. Did the wind and ice conditions affect the way the game was played or did it affect you?  
COACH ROY: I don't think so. I don't think so. It isn't that bad. We have a different view of it. But I thought that was the fact that‑‑  
   
 Q. Hard play, two penalties going on in the power plays?  
COACH ROY: Both teams played well in penalty killing. They led there and there. We had a few chances on power play. But the main thing is both teams were very capable of scoring there's a lot of skills on both sides. People were scoring in the power play.  
   
 Q. [Indiscernible]?  
COACH ROY: Very confident that they would bounce back. There were a couple that we would like to see different. [Indiscernible].  
   
 Q. Did you get a feeling on the bench after you guys tied it and the other power play about a minute ago this could be your night?  
COACH ROY: Absolutely. I thought that [indiscernible] on the bench and I was confident that even with a minute left, we brought the puck in on the ice. I thought we might have had a chance to score.
