THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk about what's been working so well on the penalty kill for you guys.   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   Well, I think we try to stay compact in our zone.   Once the puck is bobbled, if you see a chance to pressure them, we do that.   
For the most part we've been doing a good job keeping them to the outside.   
Then there's Tuukka.   He always seems to make that save.   We try to clean up for him to get the rebound or for us to clean it up.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, there's frustration mounting on the other side.   Quenneville was saying how few opportunities they're getting.   Talk about the defensive help that you got in front tonight.   
TUUKKA RASK:   Tonight was great.   If you take the first period out of the last game, I thought the last two periods in that game was really good.   Today we continued to do that.   
I mean, they had shots, but most of them came from the outside.   We eliminated a lot of those rebound opportunities.   I think that's something what every team likes to do, and we succeeded today.   
   
 Q.   Dennis, before the game this morning you talked about how the team needed a better start.   How did you like the start that the team got off to?   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   It was decent.   I mean, it was not the best, but I think we came out pretty solid.   We tried to get pucks deep, tried to forecheck them, tried to force turnovers.   
It was, I think from both teams, a pretty slow start, a little tentative maybe.   But we slowly got it going and started skating better once the game started, found our game eventually.   
   
 Q.   Puck management, puck possession in general, how big of a role did that play?  
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   Pretty good.   I think, like I said, in the first period maybe a couple times we tried to make too many plays on the blueline instead of getting it deep.   
But the second and third period, I think we did a decent job getting it deep, getting it behind their Ds, and forechecked from there on.   
That's when we can put pressure on them and try to get to our game.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, you mentioned the rebound control.   Tonight it seemed that was one of the better games you played in terms of that.   How did you feel in that regard?   
TUUKKA RASK:   Yeah, I thought today was pretty good.   I mean, they shot high shots from off the wing, and I was able to just catch a lot of them with my glove.   Then a few loose pucks were laying around there.   Our D or forwards took care of that.   
It helps when we get the puck quick, then just move it forward.   It helps our breakouts a lot.   
   
 Q.   The two new lines, third and fourth lines, they seemed to be gelling very quickly.   How do you feel about that?   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   Like you said, they played a strong game.   They skated hard, kept the game simple.   That's what you want from guys that haven't played with each other.   
It's about playing basic hockey, getting pucks deep, forechecking, getting pucks to the net.   They've done a good job working as a unit and communicating out there.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, from your vantage point, what seemed to spark the scrap in the final minute there?   
TUUKKA RASK:   I have no idea.   Well, I think Z was battling in front with somebody there.   I was just focused on the puck.   I had a tough time trying to find it.   I didn't really see what was going on.   
   
 Q.   Dennis, in general, in the warmups, Zdeno goes down in a collision.   Were you concerned for his health?   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   Well, at first you always are concerned that he's okay.   But once I got to the locker room, he was fine.   He just lost an edge.   The ice was not the best tonight.   A few guys had to get their skates sharpened, or the sharpness adjusted.   
Again, we knew he was okay once we got into the locker room.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, they were saying they didn't get a lot of scoring chances.   All of a sudden at the end of the game a barrage of chances.   What is it like for you when there's some time between all those chances and all of a sudden you have that pressure?  
TUUKKA RASK:   Well, I think I've gotten used to that already during these playoffs.   There's been a lot of games like this that you don't get quality opportunities, then all of a sudden, there's four or five of them.   
But, I mean, you're playing the last five minutes of the game, you know they're going to throw everything at you, what they possibly can.   That's the case.   
Got the penalty there.   Got a little lucky there, one save off my blade and the post.   
For the most part I think we kept them outside, as Dennis said, blocked a lot of shots, took care of the rebounds.   That's always a positive sign in my mind.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, you talked about blocking shots there.   You talk a lot about the layers in front of you.   As a goalie, what does it do for you and how much do you appreciate when you see Dennis blocking a lot of the shots?  
TUUKKA RASK:   It's a huge help, obviously.   We've gotten better, a lot better, as the season has gone on.   They're not trying to play goalie, they're just trying to be in the lane.   
All the other guys are taking care of their ice, keeping their head up, looking to guys behind them or in front of them.   
Dennis, for example, today, he blocked shot.   Our D did a tremendous job during the playoffs doing that.   I like that, as long as they block it and not let it go through, we'll be all set.   
   
 Q.   It's June 17th.   It was a humid day today.   I suppose we should expect the ice to not be great.   Just how bad was it out there?   Looks like the ice conditions are pretty crappy.   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   It is pretty bad.   When you try to shoot, try to swing your blade on the ice, it feels like it's sandpaper.   It's really rough.   When you try to pass, the puck bounces.   
That's why you have to keep the game simple, like I said.   If there's a play to be made, you have to make sure it's an easy one.   If not, you rather choose to go over the wall and out.   
Again, there was breakdowns today, but we seemed to cover them up a little bit better than the other side today.   
   
 Q.   Does that create any challenges for you, as well?   
TUUKKA RASK:   Yeah.   I mean, you know, the ice was pretty good in the start of the periods.   Then pretty quickly it got really chippy.   It's tough to get the read off of shots when it's really a mess out there with the ice.   
You just got to be extra careful with the crazy bounces and stuff.   You don't want to make any stupid mistakes playing the puck either.   You just got to be extra careful.   
   
 Q.   Dennis, a lot of talk in the room about you and Patrice doing a lot of the things that don't show up in the stat sheet.   What does it mean to you when people say you're one of the unheralded heroes of this team?   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   It's something nice when you hear something like that about you.   I mean, yeah, that's my job.   I haven't really been scoring, doing anything offensively.   I better do that stuff (smiling).   
It's fun.   I enjoy playing tough minutes and doing the little things, just like everybody else in this room.   We all thrive in tough games.   
   
 Q.   How much of a relief is it to win a game in regulation after three overtimes?   
TUUKKA RASK:   I mean, it's better, I guess.   A win is a win.   We'll take a win any day.   It gives you a little extra time to recover.   Obviously, you go triple overtime, overtime the next game, it takes a lot of energy out of you.   
But we'll take a regulation win, sure.   
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   Same thing (smiling).   
   
 Q.   Dennis, you got up 2‑0 and kept attacking, almost made it 3‑0.   How much of that was lessons learned from what happened in Game1 when you had two‑goal leads twice and gave them back?  
DENNIS SEIDENBERG:   We told ourselves when we came into the locker room, we said, We've been in this position and we gave up the two‑goal lead, so let's do it better today, keep attacking.   
If you attack, it's tough for them to score in our end.   
We did a good job, kept playing our style, kept putting pucks deep, except the last couple of minutes actually.   They threw everything at us, like Tuukka said earlier.   They got quite a few chances.   For the most part we did a decent job.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka, the defensive play of Patrice, you've been playing behind it for a while now.   What are your thoughts about the way he defends?  
TUUKKA RASK:   He's really patient and he's really good at reading the play.   He always knows where everybody is.   He knows when the guys are behind him and when they're in front of him.   
You know, he just makes the right reads all the time.   Then when there's time to lay down or block a shot, he does that.   He does a great job standing on his feet, too, and taking care of those passing lanes.   
He's got to be one of the best in the league for doing that.   I like playing behind him.   It's awesome.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
