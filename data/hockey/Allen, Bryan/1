Q.  Bryan, this is certainly a --

BRYAN ALLEN:   I'm going to talk to her a couple of times.  They didn't really indicate whether it was for sure but there was a possibility.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   It is great, you know.  It was only the one Canadian team in the top five, so it was just a great opportunity to play for a Canadian team.


Q.  In Kingston, is that something that you wanted to be a Canadian?

BRYAN ALLEN:   I don't know.  I think it is just my own feelings, you know.  A true Canadian.  I played for national teams for Canada.  It is a neat feeling to play for another Canadian team.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   You know I'm not worried about setting a time limit for myself.  It is just going to come with experience and maturity.  When I'm ready I will play. I'm not going to set a time for myself to play in the NHL.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   I will have to wait and see what happens in the training camp, with the frame of mind to make the team.  If it is not, I will go back to Austin just as happy.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   I might have heard rumors of that. I'm not hung up on the fact if I wasn't picked.  I wasn't trying to set my heart on one time or another.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   A little bit.


Q.  Talked to some other coaches they told me -- (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, just outside of Kingston.  You know, I don't think there was even a population sign.  If you blink on the town, you will miss it.


Q.  You were telling me that -- (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Actually I played in Kingston for my minor hockey.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   It was USC in ^ Ernest Town.


Q.  It is a big jump for you to play for --

BRYAN ALLEN:   Major juniors sure is a big step.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Like I said, I wasn't trying to stop  myself in any one team or not.  Now I can kind of sit back and look at that.  What prospects they might have and where I might fit in.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   I think I've always had that, but I have two older sisters and they probably developed that in me.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   They tried.  I'm bigger than them, you know.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   The whole family, friends, crew.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   My dad is a salt salesman.


Q.  For who?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Salt salesmen for Systems.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   Salt.  Any kind of salt you can think of.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   I have two older sisters and a niece.


Q.  How old are your sisters?

BRYAN ALLEN:   19 and 21.


Q.  Is your mother the one that kept you in shape?

BRYAN ALLEN:   She tries to.  She tries to, keep me in line.


Q.  This year -- (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   It was a pretty tough season.  I never had a season with a lot of adversity.  In the beginning of the year I had my suspension.  Then I had mono and that was kind of hard to shake off.  Then I had my knees at the end of the season.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Cross-checking.


Q.  That was at the end of the year?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Actually an exhibition game.


Q.  How many games?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Five games.


Q.  Did you have to work?

BRYAN ALLEN:   No.


Q.  Do you have any plans with your agent, how far to go?

BRYAN ALLEN:   I've had two years, professional trainers.  Bob Tyson.  I would like to work with him.  But if Vancouver wants me to do something there, we have to see what they want.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Ian, I think.


Q.  ^ Ian Ryan?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Ian.  They were a little town. 


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Actually, it was a three-room school.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, I went fine.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Sure.  They will give me a little bit of confidence.  I just have to come to camp in the best shape I possible can be in.


Q.  Do you think you will get --

BRYAN ALLEN:   I'm trying to get to 215, 220, 210.


Q.  Do you think the whole experience is like what you have been watching on TV, watching three guys, four guys?

BRYAN ALLEN:   It is pretty neat.  It almost doesn't seem real.  So much emotion is going through my head right now.


Q.  Easier to deal with because you can go and play -- is it a little more frustrating?

BRYAN ALLEN:   It is a little bit stressful.  It only happens once in your life.  It is like Christmas and it is true.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   With the mono I missed 11 games.  On tour it is 18 games.  I'm not sure.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE).

BRYAN ALLEN:   Pardon.  I can't hear.


Q.  The coach said it is 18 games you missed?

BRYAN ALLEN:   He won one game.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   It is two ties.


Q.  60 losses?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, yes.  And a suspension, too. There are only four regular seasons.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes.


Q.  Did you play in (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, there was, we lost body guards in the years before that.  It is lot easier to go there I would say.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes.  It was tremendous.  If anyone gets a chance to go there, it is a world of experience.  My first year I had three years worth of experience in one.


Q.  It is like going that far in one?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes.


Q.  The previous year (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Number one and number two.  There is ^ Pete Hogan as well.


Q.  Logan?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Hogan.  He's a 19 year old.


Q.  How was that for you guys? 

BRYAN ALLEN:   It took a little while, but I was ready for the challenge.  I thought I stepped up.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   It seems pretty much.  Everybody meets from Ontario.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   Hour and a half, two hours.


Q.  You were a real Canadian, Vancouver?

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, I know.


Q.  Do you know any of the -- I think I met them yesterday -- any of the other players?

BRYAN ALLEN:   No.  I know who they were.


Q.  Have you ever played against them?

BRYAN ALLEN:   No.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   Yes, it seems what everyone wants, big five.  It is major hockey, I guess.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

BRYAN ALLEN:   I beg your pardon.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

BRYAN ALLEN:   Five games.


Q.  You missed two games?

BRYAN ALLEN:   I'm not sure.  I missed a couple regular season and a couple of Playoff games, two Playoff games.  I'm not sure of the total.
