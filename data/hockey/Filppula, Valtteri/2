  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Steven, from the time you started till right now in the playoffs, has it been fun?   Has time flown or does it feel like a long grind?  
STEVEN STAMKOS:   It's been a pretty long grind.   Feels like the first series was last year.   I mean, what is this, game 25 for us tomorrow, something like that?   You know, that's over a quarter of another season.   
That's why we're excited about this opportunity.   We've worked way too hard, like I said after the game, to not leave everything on the ice in this next game.   
We proved it all along that we can bounce back.   We've been in this exact same situation before.   You just draw on that experience.   
   
 Q.   Speaking of last year, Detroit, obviously a different opponent you're facing.   What kind of things can you draw from that, your mentality, how you played to get back into it?  
STEVEN STAMKOS:   Everyone talks about experience.   We've been in this situation before.   So you just draw back to that.   I think both teams have some guys that are banged up.   
No excuses for our group.   We're here.   We've given ourselves a chance.   There's two games scheduled left in the season.   We can be part of that.   That's the mentality we've had.   We've played extremely well on the road.   We've won in this building before.   We're going to be a confident group heading in.   
   
 Q.   Anton, Steven talked about being in a similar situation.   The New York one is the one you can draw the most comparison to, the way you approached that.   Can you use that in this situation?  
ANTON STRALMAN:   Yeah, I definitely think so.   I said this before, but I think we're a growing type of team.   Each series in this playoffs so far, we've been challenged, going back to the Detroit series, being in the same situation right now.   We learned from that.   Even the MontrÃ©al series, when we get up early, 3‑0 lead, try to close the series out.   It's also a big challenge.   It's not easy.   
Like you're talking about, the New York series, when we had the chance to close it out at home.   For whatever reason, couldn't pull that off.   We had to go into New York with the odds against us.   Not a lot of people thought we could pull that off.   
I think there's a strong belief in our team, within the group we have.   We know what we have to do to be successful.   It's just a matter of execution.   
   
 Q.   Steven, I know it's a team game, but being the captain and leading scorer on this team, how much responsibility do you feel you have to have in this game?  
STEVEN STAMKOS:   No doubt, I want to help our team win in any way possible.   We've struggled to score, obviously myself personally, as a team the last couple games.   
We'll find a way.   There's really no choice that we have.   For me, definitely want to go out there and have my best game.   I feel like the chances are there.   You just got to keep working hard.   
For me, I definitely want to be a guy that can go out there and help our team get a game back home.   
   
 Q.   Steven, your line has spent a lot of time defending Patrick Kane's line.   Do you think from both sides there's so much attention to shutting down each other, you kind of neutralize each other?  
STEVEN STAMKOS:   You know what, that's the way it goes sometimes, especially in the playoffs.   There is a lot of focus, especially coming into this series, a lot of offensive firepower.   Obviously we're not seeing a lot of that.   It's so tight out there that both teams are focused on certain groups, certain lines, certain players.   They've done a great job of defending so far.   
That's why you need the depth at this time of the year.   These are probably two of the deepest teams in the league.   You have to rely on all players in these situations, which we have, and they have as well.   
But in the big moments, you want your guys to step up.   I definitely want to be a guy that can step up tomorrow night and help our team win, whether it's on the score sheet or not.   Our focus is getting a win.   
Like I said, there's really no other option for our group right now.   
   
 Q.   Steven, do you feel like the quality of chances and the quantity have gone up as your ice time has increased?  
STEVEN STAMKOS:   I mean, the ice‑time thing I think is getting a little blown out of proportion.   
Whenever your name gets called, you hop over there.   The coaching staff obviously have a game plan.   Our teammates believe in everyone that goes over the boards, that they're going to get the job done.   
For me, I obviously want to produce.   That's part of the territory.   The chances are coming.   Obviously you want to create some more.   
The first five games mean nothing now.   It's finding a way to win.   Like I said a second ago, you want to be the guy that can help lead your team to victory.   
I mean, it's going to be a good test for myself and our group tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Losing Kucherov last night, you were able to shuffle things around and tie the game.   Explain how that worked last night.   Moving forward, that's a key contributor that may be absent.   
VALTTERI FILPPULA:   Go ahead, you're on a roll (laughter).   
STEVEN STAMKOS:   You know what, that's the things that happen at this time of year.   Obviously Kuch has been a huge part of why we've been successful.   A clutch player, scored some big goals.   Very good player.   Hopefully he's back.   
But we found a way to come back in a game that we were down one and tie it, give ourselves a chance.   Every game could have gone either way this series.   That's the beauty of this sport, how close the series really is.   
We're hoping that he's back.   If not, we have guys that are capable.   We've proved that before.   We just got to keep believing that.   
   
 Q.   Fil , you've competed against Patrick Kane for years.   You've done a good job of containing him, but he could pop a goal at any moment.   What is the key defensively to slowing him down?  
VALTTERI FILPPULA:   I just have to try to stay close to him, try to limit his room.   Obviously when he gets the puck, he can do things that not a lot of players can in the league.   That's what makes him really hard to defend.   
I feel like so far we've been able to limit his room and time and space a little bit.   It's been a big help for us.   
   
 Q.   Val, you obviously play a lot with Steven.   Is there anything you as linemates can do to take some of the pressure off his shoulders?  
VALTTERI FILPPULA:   I mean, I think we're all trying to do the best we can.   At this point it doesn't really matter who gets the goal or who gets what done.   Everybody's trying to do their best, both defensively and offensively.   
I think he's been great, having a lot of chances.   Obviously he hopes pucks going to go in next game.   But I believe when you do things right, you keep playing the right way, you're going to get some results.   Hopefully we can do that tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Val, as one guy who has been able to win the Cup as a player on this team, what kind of advice can you give to these guys?  
VALTTERI FILPPULA:   I think we've been doing a good job taking it one game at a time.   We've been in tough spots before.   We just got to keep working hard, think about next game, do the best we can, hopefully get a win, and have a Game 7.   
But you can't think too much ahead.   That's where we have to keep our focus, on the next game.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, guys.
