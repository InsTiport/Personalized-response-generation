I don't think I'm ready to jump in next year, maybe a couple of years to develop.

Well, I don't really -- yeah, in a couple of years I could see that.

Yeah.  It feels great.  I am really excited I was a little bit nervous in the beginning there, but I'm really, really surprised and it's a great city and a great organization.

No, but I've had numerous meetings with them and great, great people.

No, never.
