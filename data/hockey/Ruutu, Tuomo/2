Q.  It seems like you were the guy the Hawks wanted all along, did you get that impression also from meeting with them?

TUOMO RUUTU: I don't think so.  I think it's just a good thing.  Yes, yes. 


Q.  Tuomo, talk about your style, your strength on the ice.

TUOMO RUUTU: I think I am a North American player.  I like to play tough. That is my strength. 


Q.  Talk about what's it been like with having two brothers the last couple years drafted as well?  Must be fun.

TUOMO RUUTU: Yeah.  It's fun.  It's fun, yeah.  Actually, sometimes it's very hard to have those two brothers, but they give me good advice when I'm playing.  And if I don't play so well, you think about those times when you play, what you feel about them, sort of like that.  But it's good.
