 Q. I guess the obvious one, Scott, how do you get cranked up again? You have to do it;
you have no other choice. But it is awfully -- got to feel like it is in the pit of --
 
 SCOTT STEVENS: We have got to rebound and just get back, go up there and try to win
their building. We have had success there. We have to go back there, that is the bottom
line. Can't hold our heads down now. Both teams, the chances -- it was a 50/50 chance of
winning, and we didn't. We have to go with the next game. 
 
Q. How would you rate the way Marty and Belfour played tonight?
 
 SCOTT STEVENS: Everyone got their monies' worth. The goalies played unbelievable. It
was just one great save after another. 
 
Q. Just knowing that you guys came back yourselves from a 3-1 deficit, how does that
enter into your thinking in terms of preparing for the next game, knowing so recently that
it can be done?
 
 SCOTT STEVENS: I am not thinking about that. I am thinking about: We are up three games
to two. That is the bottom line right now. I mean, that is not a bad position to be in.
