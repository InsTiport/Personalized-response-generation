Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: Do the things we do at home.  Do them here and do them well and go from there. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: That's all we talked about all the way here. 
 
Q.  Really?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: No, none at all, really.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: No, we haven't talked about that yet. 
 
Q.  Can you talk about that experience?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't think I plan on talking about it. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: That's behind us now.  It's a new day, different time. 
 
Q.  Are you still concerned about Kariya as the guy to contain?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: Of course.  Anytime there is a player of that caliber, it doesn't matter.  Anytime any game he can turn it on or make a difference.  He's definitely important to watch. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I really don't know why.  I thought about that.  I don't have the answer or the reason why that is. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  We'll have to wait until tomorrow comes and we're getting ready to talk about things.  Today we're just relaxing.  Before the game, we have stuff to talk about, but there is not going to be any meetings or talk right now.  We know what's at stake, and it's a pretty important time of year.  We know that. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know if that's the right way to approach it.  I think you approach it as win one more game and the next game, and that's all you think about.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: Yeah.  It doesn't matter, any series, this is always a different time, a different feeling.  It's a time where you have a chance to close it out, and obviously being the last series, it makes it a little different.  We've got to focus on the game and do all the things that got us to this point and go from there. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it. 
 
Q.  In terms of learning from it and drawing on it so the same things don't happen again?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: You try to win every game.  That's your approach.  That's how it is in the Stanley Cup Finals.  I really can't put my finger on it.  Actually, I don't even remember a lot of it, which is probably good. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: Yeah, it's been pretty tight, especially here.  I think that's the way it will be.  It was just an odd game yesterday.  There was a lot of scoring, a lot of scoring quickly.  Especially in the first period. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: If you're on the winning end of it, yeah, it's nice, I guess.  But, I mean, it was a little uncharacteristic for both teams.  Sometimes that happens and then you get back to the old ways again. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: It's hard.  I think with the travel, it's hard to get a feel of that, the sleeping part, because of the travel.  I don't know if it's a mix of both maybe, or what it is, but the time change definitely makes it difficult for sleeping, and maybe add the Finals into that too. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe.  That's when I'm used to getting up at. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I think we want to come on with a good aggressive approach like we did at home.  We want to play not sitting back and get some pressure on them.  I'm sure that's what they want to do in return. 
 
Q.  Is it harder to stay patient on the road given the amount of success they have had on the road in late game situation?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  Like we said, if we come out being a little more aggressive, and do that, hopefully that will be a little bit of a difference.  We'll get some opportunities and maybe get a few goals. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: Similar, but maybe not to the same extreme.  There is nothing wrong with having that.  You still want to do what you do best and bring what you can to help the team, not try to do anymore than that.  You're definitely still a little nervous.  It's definitely easier for the guys who have been here once or twice to handle it better. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  I don't know if we really know the way to act.  I don't know if you ever know that, what's wrong, what's right, what to do, if you should do anything or nothing.  It's one of those situations where maybe the least said is better.  The best thing we have to do is think about what we did the next game and feed off that and talk about that. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)?
 
SCOTT STEVENS: With Ottawa?  
 
Q.  Yeah.
 
SCOTT STEVENS: I don't know.  Everyone talks about these things.  I don't know if I look back on that stuff, maybe the other guys look at it different.  I don't know.  That's the biggest question here by all the media.  Like I said, I look to the moment.  I really don't look back too often.  You try to put those things behind you.
