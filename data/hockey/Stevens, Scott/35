Q. Playing with passion in this series. Have you got enough of it to win tonight?

SCOTT STEVENS: I think so. I think we got to stick with our game plan -- in order to
win we have got to stick with our game plan; move forward; get a bounce here and there.

Q. Scoreless, open to anybody to be the higher row in this game. Do you think it might
be you?

SCOTT STEVENS: In this situation you just want to do your job and hopefully get that
opportunity. If I get it, I will take it.
