Q.  Are you surprised after all these years and after all these hits like that that people get caught with their heads down around you?

SCOTT STEVENS: People talk about it all the time, it should be harder for those things to happen.  It's pretty well known.  So, yeah, but you can't let your guard down.  Hey, it's a physical game out there.

Q.  Can you talk about the way they came out in the first period, they were able to put three up on the board?

SCOTT STEVENS: We talked about a lot of things.  It just didn't happen for us.  No excuses.  They worked hard and got the win.

Q.  Did you expect that here?

SCOTT STEVENS: Yeah, you expect that, but they didn't quit after we beat them pretty well back home.

Q.  Did it surprise you that Kariya was able to bounce back?

SCOTT STEVENS: He was probably winded and had to get his wind and came back.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: I guess so.  Obviously that was a tough period for us, and it was a big part of the game for them.
