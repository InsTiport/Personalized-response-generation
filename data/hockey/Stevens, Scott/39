 Q. After two periods of play, 1-0. Tremendous swings in the second period. They started
strong; you took over and then they came on at the end.
 
 SCOTT STEVENS: Well, yeah, when you take penalties we had to kill a few in a row; took
all the momentum away and with the powerplay, we have got to be smart and stay out of the
penalty box. 
 
Q. What about their team when they play with the lead they are a lot like you try and
shut things down?
 
 SCOTT STEVENS: There is no question that our work is cut out for us in the third here.
We just got to get one goal in this period and go from there.
