Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: We have had success there, and we can build on that and hopefully make that the difference.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: No, we've talked a long time now.   Enough's been said.  It's time we just come and play, play your game.  Nothing has to be said.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: I feel a difference.  Obviously, this sort of play is more intense than any other game.  Obviously, they're all intense, but Game  7 seems like it's a faster pace, quicker game.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: I don't think so.  I think it's pretty even.  You go in there.  It's the last game.  You go from there, and I don't know if there is really much momentum.  It seems like home ice is the momentum in this series.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: That's always possible.  I think you've got to keep that out of your mind and go play a solid game.  You've got to go out there and try to play a perfect game.

Q.  (Inaudible)?

SCOTT STEVENS: I don't think so.
