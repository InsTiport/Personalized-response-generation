Q.  How do you feel about going to Washington? 

STEVE EMINGER:   I'm really excited.  I just hear great feedback from a lot of people about this organization.  It's just been a great day for me when Washington selected me, I'm just so, so overwhelmed right now.

Q.  What's it like doing this, basically in front of your hometown crowd?  You have a lot of people up there in the stands with you. 

STEVE EMINGER:   Yeah, that was really nice.  I had I think 120 people here, and to enjoy this moment with my family and friends, it was really nice.  They can take part in that, as well.  I heard the cheer, too, when I got selected and it just kind of sent shivers down your back.  

Q.  Before the draft, did you have any idea that Washington was this high on you?

STEVE EMINGER:   You have a bit of a feeling.  I think with this draft, you can't really predict anything.  There's so many drafts in it.   You might have a bit of an idea, but I wasn't sure at all. 

Q.  Another year in the juniors or the NHL?  And what do you have to work on your game to get there?

STEVE EMINGER:   I just think I'll work on my overall strength.  With a good summer program this year, it will develop.  I'm not going to be rushed into anything, but we'll just take it by what happens.
