 Q. What is your reaction to being drafted today by St. Louis?
 
 BARRET JACKMAN:: You know, St. Louis is a great organization. They have two of the top
defensemen in the league. I'm just thrilled to get the privilege to go and play under the
wings of those two. 
 
Q. After all the time you waited for this day, is it what you expected?
 
 BARRET JACKMAN:: Oh, yeah, and more. It's a little nerve racking sitting there not
knowing where you're going to go, who is going to pick you. But it's tons of fun once you
get down here and go through all the stuff. It's great to see everyone being so excited
here.
