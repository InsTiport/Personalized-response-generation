THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. 

Q. Joe, do you remember when the first time was that you and Pavelski became an item in terms of a consistent linemate? He was a center on this team. 
JOE THORNTON: I really don't remember. I don't know how many years ago, but it's been years. I remember me, him and Burnsy all played together. Had to be before that we started together. 
Have to be at least three or four years I'm thinking. I just can't recall when. 

Q. How has that grown?
JOE THORNTON: Well, I think just playing a long time with somebody, we just know each other's tendencies in our sleep. 
For me, I like to pass. He likes to shoot. Then you throw this big fella in there, it's a pretty good line. 
But, yeah, all three of us, we read so well off each other. We just got to keep continuing that. 

Q. Tomas, the third goal, your second goal, take us through that pass. Seemed like an incredible pass from upstairs. Did you expect it to hit you on the tape the way it did?
TOMAS HERTL: Yeah, you know, it all goes after he pass, he amazing passer. We just talking every time, spread out. I just waiting. I saw him looking me. I was waiting pass. I just try go to net and shoot. Was a little bit lucky it was in. 

Q. Tomas, what time is it in Czech Republic and who is watching at home?
TOMAS HERTL: It's probably 3 a.m. All my family, just we can handle little playoff. Everybody go to work, some are sleeping. I mean, if you don't bring Cup home, so mad because we watching every other game, it's too hard for us. Please, let's bring Cup home. 

Q. Joe, on Tomas' second goal, where did you see that passing lane behind the net? 
JOE THORNTON: I'm just always looking for him or looking for Pav. Usually they do a great job of getting open. 
Just one of those instances where I just used blade. You try to aim for it, sometimes it hits, sometimes it doesn't. 
It's my job to get these guys the puck. What a play by him to put it in. 

Q. Joe, is this the closest you've been, two wins away? 
JOE THORNTON: Yeah, I think we got swept against Chicago. What was Vancouver, 4‑2? Yeah, it's the closest, I guess. 

Q. How does that feel? Also, are you surprised at all at the way you continue to play at this stage of your career?
JOE THORNTON: No, no. I know I'm a great player (laughter). I love to play. I feel good playing with who I'm playing with, our team. 
Yeah, I feel good. Yeah, I just feel really good about my game. I feel good about my linemates' game, our whole team game. I'm just really, really comfortable with it. It's been fun. 

Q. Joe, could you describe the difference in this playoff run, how much more maybe confident and clicking this team is at this point than it's ever been before?
JOE THORNTON: Everybody's been saying our depth, our depth. But I really do believe our depth is strong. It's the strongest its been since I've been here. 
Then we have this guy that is just incredible. We love playing for him. It shows night to night. None of us forwards play 25, 26 minutes. They all play 17, 18 minutes a night. The depth is just incredible this year. 

Q. Joe, about Martin Jones, when he's exuding the confidence he appears to show, how does that translate to how you play on the ice?
JOE THORNTON: Well, yeah, he's the backbone of our team. When he's on, we feel we can't be beat. That's just how it is. Just knowing him from down in L.A., just such a big guy, such a calm goalie. 
We love playing in front of this guy. We honestly believe that he's the best goaltender in the league. 

Q. Martin, what are your thoughts on back‑to‑back shutouts in the post‑season? Tough time of year to get an accomplishment such as that. 
MARTIN JONES: Yeah, I think if you look at the games, we've done it as a group. I'm not being asked to steal these games, just make the saves that you expect your goaltender to make in a conference final. 

Q. Joe, so much is made about the team having an older core overall. Talk about what the younger guys are bringing, especially this playoff run. 
JOE THORNTON: Oh, yeah, we have some older guys, but we have some younger guys. A great mix. Our young guys play hard. They play really, really well. I give our coaching staff credit with these guys. They've been really, really hard on these guys. They've really responded. Chris Tierney, Tomas Hertl, they play hard every night. 
For me being an older guy, it's great to see how hard these guys work. They just put in the time, and it's great. 

Q. Martin, Joe was talking about you exuding confidence. Can you practice exuding confidence? It obviously carries over. The first 10 minutes of the game were pretty busy for you. Did you sense that? Did you purposely try to look confident out there for the rest of the team?
MARTIN JONES: I'm just trying to stop the puck, to be honest. 
No, I mean, they came hard. Both teams knew the situation that we were in. They pressed hard the first 10 minutes. Even the times we were in our own zone, we really didn't give up a lot of grade A chances. We did a great job all night. 
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
