Q.  You scored a goal tonight. Have you been practicing your shooting?
 
DOMINIK HASEK:   No, I didn't. I just shot maybe three times in the practice this morning. Because I didn't know about this new competition this year. I was surprised. I was surprised that I hit the net on two shots. Normally, it takes me five or six shots to hit the net. Only two shots tonight. 
 

Q.  Will it be fun tomorrow going up against the best in the world?
 
DOMINIK HASEK:   Yes, I am looking forward to it. But I hope that it is different from last year. I just hope we win the game. 
 

Q.  Everybody is talking about Dominik Hasek. Do you feel that you are having a great year?
 
DOMINIK HASEK:   It's only half a season. We still have to play 40 games. And then the Playoffs. The Sabres are playing well and I enjoy the game.
