 DOMINIK HASEK: Thank you. First of all, I would like to congratulate all the nominees.
I really appreciate this trophy, the chance to be here tonight to accept this award. These
awards are very nice and I really appreciate them. They are very important things. As a
father, I wish all those people who fighting to control guns, who fighting to control
guns, to make our streets and schools the safer place for our kids, the same success as I
have been so lucky to have in my hockey career. Thank you, very much.  
 
Press conference:

Q. Can I ask you about the speech you delivered there, where did that message about the
gun control come from?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: Why? Because it's something I think is very important. I was raised in
completely different culture, in different country. You know, I can say maybe USA is the
greatest country in the world. But what happened in the last couple months in the States,
in Canada, is something what really bothers me. I have Michael, he's here with me. I have
one more daughter. You know, I just hope it will never happen again. So I felt like I have
to say something like that. 
 
Q. You are a person who does not have a reputation of making statements like that. Just
talk about the decision you made to come say that tonight. 
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: It was very simple decision. You know, I was thinking maybe I can win
the trophy, and what I can say. It was already the fifth time, and I really appreciate. I
already said many times thanks to the Buffalo Sabres, to my teammates. I felt like, you
know, last couple months I felt like I have to say something really different. I'm glad I
said it.  
 
Q. Is there any disappointment that you didn't win the MVP for the third year in a row?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: No, not at all. I expected it. It's not surprise for me at all. I think
Jaromir, he had a great season. He had an exciting season. I remember he lost 5-4 in
Pittsburgh. He scored one goal, assist on other four goals. No, it's not surprise. I'm not
disappointed at all. You know what, I was thinking I will give up the Vezina Trophy to
have a chance to play again next season. 
 
Q. Can you reflect back on winning it for two years in a row, talk about what it meant
to you to win it two years in a row?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: It's a big accomplishment for me. What can I say? You know, I don't
think there is a goalie who won five times. I'm not really sure. It's something I never
dream about. You know, what never before the season I think about, "Will I win some
trophy? I won't win or win some trophy?" I think the hockey is only the game, you
know. My goal is to play well and win the game. That's all I think about. That's maybe why
on the end of the season I win again this trophy because I don't think too much about
other things, you know, I just want to play, play well and win the game. I think this game
is so simple.  
 
Q. Will you continue to be so philosophical and outspoken about issues that bother you?
Do you have any other issues besides the gun control?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: No, I don't want to be politician. I want to play hockey.  
 But it was something really what bothered me. I felt like -- actually, I talk to my
agent today. I didn't prepare any speech, but I want to say something. We talk about
three, four minutes. He said, "Dominik, it's not a good time to say that." I
said, "No, I feel like I have to say it." So he helped me to make a speech. It's
my decision. Even like twice he said, "Dominik, let's say something different."
I said, "No, I want to say that."  
 
Q. In the last season of Wayne Gretzky, can you reflect on your memories of playing
against him and him as a hockey player? 
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: I still remember I face him first time in 1984 in Canada Cup. What can I
say? If I say something, it's not enough. I face him many, many times. He score many goals
against me. He had so many assists. But I will never forget a game he play in 1987. He was
the captain of the team. Mario Lemieux played the right wing. We were up 2-1 in the half,
maybe like after 35 minutes. It was in Montreal. It was semifinal game. Wayne Gretzky made
two passes right on Mario Lemieux sticks and Mario just put the stick and hit the puck and
score the goal. This was something I will never forget it. What can I say? He was the
great. He was the best. 
 
Q. Do you find it strange your numbers this year were better than the last two years
when you won the MVP? 
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: I think first of all, Jaromir had even better season than he had one
year ago. Also I miss like about one month because of the injury. It was tough season for
me, you know. I came back after injury, but I never had so much fun because I couldn't
practice hard. I don't feel I was the same goalie. But fortunately my teammates played
great. That's why we made it to the Stanley Cup final. But like the second half of the
season, it wasn't really fun for me because I couldn't practice hard. I couldn't do what I
am used to do. So it was the reason why I couldn't win the Hart Trophy again. Like I said,
Jaromir had a great season. He really deserved it.  
 
Q. Besides your teammates, what do you attribute to your dominance in the last three
years especially? 
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: Let me think. You know, I don't think about these things so much. Like I
say, I just want to play and win the game. Probably I have some talent. I like to compete.
I like to win. I have great support in my family. It's very important. I don't know. I
don't have answer for these questions. I just like to play and win the game. It's very
simple. 
 
Q. Is the Cup still a big goal? How long do you figure you want to keep playing?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: I know I'll be back next season. Like I said, you know, I would give up
-- even I really appreciate it, I would give up the Vezina Trophy for chance to play the
game (inaudible). It's my biggest goal for the next season. I just hope, you know, we be
same team, hungry team like we were this year, healthy team. I believe we can compete for
the Stanley Cup again. 
 
Q. Do you know how much longer you'd like to play? Have you thought about that?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: No. Like I say, now I am glad the long season is over and I just want to
enjoy my summer. 
 
Q. How are you physically now that the series is over?
 
 DOMINIK HASEK: Physically, I feel good and I'm glad there is summer. I can heal my
injury. Like I said, it wasn't fun for me last couple months. I hope the summer helps me
to heal and I'll be back in good shape.
