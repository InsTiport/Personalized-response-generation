Q.  How important is winning Game 4?
 
DOMINIK HASEK: Because we don't want to go home and be down 3-1, but I don't want to talk about Game 4.  Right now we have to be focused on Game 3 and try to do anything to win the next game, and, you know, we know we have to play better.  We didn't play really great, neither game, neither the first or second one: I gave up too many goals, so we know we have to play better to win the next game. 
 
Q.  You were somewhat critical of your defense after the game the other night.  Have those guys talked to you or you talked to them?
 
DOMINIK HASEK: Not defense.  I would say overall, we gave -- not  defense, but overall as a team we gave them too much space through the neutral zone.  They were gaining very easy our blue line, you know, and after it came the problems, and so I think we have to play smarter.  Everybody has to know what to do, and we can do it.  Like I say, we cannot give Forsberg and Sakic so much space, because they are great hockey players.
