DOMINIK HASEK:  It's a great honor to be here again and win this trophy, since early in the season I didn't play well.  It was difficult. Being a goaltender, I had a lot of support from a lot of people, the confidence of your coaches and teammates.  It's not easy to stop the puck.

At the end of the year, when I wasn't playing as well as I could have, my teammates were behind me; my coaches gave me the reinforcement I needed.  I am here because of my teammates, coaches, Sabres Management.  They gave me the strength I needed to overcome the changes.  They helped me a lot, and I'm sure this trophy wouldn't be mine without you.  Thank you guys.
