Q.  Don't you need a few more goals and chances?

DOMINIK HASEK: These games are going to be close.  Sometimes to be up two goals, it's too much.  I think we dominated some parts of the game, but seems most of the time, when they need to score a goal, they have players who can score a goal.  I think we dominated the second period, but Sakic came with some speed, and he scored a goal.

Q.  Do you guys feel you need to improve a little bit on the power plays?

DOMINIK HASEK: They had power plays also, and we just didn't score the goal on the power play, however, of course, if you score one or two goals on the power play, it is easier to win the game.  It is hard to score on, because their defense is very good.

Q.  Do you feel that you accomplished what you wanted, at least getting one?

DOMINIK HASEK: I feel very disappointed after a game like that.  I think after the second period, we had a lot of confidence, but unfortunately Sakic scored that second goal, and that was a key for them.  We feel very disappointed because we were feeling we could go back to Detroit up 3-1.
