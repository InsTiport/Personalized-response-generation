   PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Come on up, James.  If you think about the great tradition in New Jersey, there's only one NHL player that's made it from there.  Do you know his name? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  Jim Dowd. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Where he's from? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  Brick, New Jersey. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Did you ever play there? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  Yeah, that's where I played growing up, the Brick Hockey Club.  So I heard a lot about him growing up, just how great a guy he was and how hard he worked to get where he is. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  When you got the call to go to the United States Development Program out in Ann Arbor, Michigan, what was your thought? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  That it was a one-time opportunity and there was no way I was passing this up.  So it was a no-brainer. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  You were sitting in the bench on Leksand, Sweden.  You heard Sam talk about it, you heard Karl talk about it.  You were playing for team U.S.A. you were watching Jonathan Toews and Peter Mueller go through the shoot-out.  What were you thinking? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  These guys are just amazing players and stuff.  And I would have liked to see the game end in overtime instead of a shootout, but it was an exciting finish to it.  It was just a great game all around. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  So you're going to go to the University of New Hampshire.  Are you going to stay there or are you going to turn pro? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  I'm going to stay there as long as I think it takes me to get ready to accomplish my goal of playing in the NHL. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  We know your dad is a huge Rangers fan.  What happens if you get drafted by the Islanders? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  I think I might not be his son anymore in his eyes. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  One other trivia question for you.  No, I won't ask you, it's unfair.  You want me to ask it?  No, I won't ask it.  That's okay. 
 We talked about Jim Dowd and what he meant.  Was there any thought in your mind in potentially going to another school besides New Hampshire, or is that where you wanted to go all the time? 
 JAMES VANRIEMSDYK:  It was pretty close in the end between Michigan and New Hampshire.  It came down being close to home and going to New Hampshire.  I'm very happy with my decision to go there and really excited to step on the ice next year there. 
 PIERRE MCGUIRE:  Well, congratulations.  You've talked about Peter Mueller, who is a draft pick of Phoenix Coyotes, a first-round pick, and you also talked about Jonathan Toews, who signed with the Chicago Blackhawks.  It shows you, like we were talking about before, how there's so many young players coming in that will influence the quality of play for a long time.  Thanks a lot, James.
