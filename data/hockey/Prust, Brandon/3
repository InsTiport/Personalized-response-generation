Q.   Did you notice it lagging earlier in the series?
BRANDON PRUST:   Well, yeah, there's been some games for sure where, you know, it just wasn't there for us.   So it's something that you learn from and you correct and it makes it better in the end.

Q.   That mindset you guys talk about, is that something developed during the course of the regular season?   It wasn't there last season?   Is that just part of the growing process of the team?
BRANDON PRUST:   I think it's just part of the growing process.   We learn‑‑ you continue to learn as a group and we've been growing together for a couple of years now.   And I think that's‑‑ through your losses and stuff, you build that scheme.

Q.   How much of a factor do you think home ice is tonight?
BRANDON PRUST:   I don't think it should be a factor at all.

Q.   Obviously talk about mindset.   Seemed like this was a loose team the last couple of games, the last couple of days, practice yesterday, the morning skate today.   Is that a fair assessment of how you would describe the mood around the team?
BRANDON PRUST:   Staying positive.   It's something that we've done all year and have done a good job at, even through‑‑ when you're going through tough times, you're going through some‑‑ just sort of rough patches. 
We've always stayed positive and it's helped keep us successful.

Q.   What's been the secret?   You mentioned you guys only had two, three losing games in the season.   And one was the first three games of the regular season.   What's helped you guys avoid those long stretches?
BRANDON PRUST:   Exactly what I just said, just the staying positive.   Don't get down.   Everybody encourage each other.   And we have a tight group in here, so we battle a lot of things together.
