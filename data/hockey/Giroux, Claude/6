 Q. Claude, do you guys feel like this was the best second period you guys have had all Playoffs? You guys really dominated them, and you talked about rebounding and learning from what happened in Game 3. Do you feel like the second period it was your best all Playoffs?
 CLAUDE GIROUX: Yeah, I don't think the first two games, in the first period, we didn't play the way we played against Boston in the last four games. And I think I went back to keep it simple, work hard, and start winning battles. When we start working, I think we had more chances, and, obviously, they didn't have a lot of chances in the second. But, yeah, if we keep it simple and work hard, good stuff's going to happen.

 Q. Can you walk us through that goal? What were you looking for as you were coming down?
 CLAUDE GIROUX: Kimmo passed to me, and I didn't see it. But I heard Gorges' skate guard or something got broken. And I was going wide, and he didn't really have speed. He was standing still. So I was able to get a little breakaway, and I just tried to put it high.
