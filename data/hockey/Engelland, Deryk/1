THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
Q. When we hear Turk talk about how your team has to play to win all the time, it's a repetitive message.  It was underscored last night with the way you played, would you agree?
DERYK ENGELLAND: Yeah, I thought our five-man forecheck, we kept it simple.  Got pucks out at the blue, in at their blue.  Got into our forecheck, everyone was involved.
Q. Your speed is a real weapon for your group.  They have it, too.  It looks like this could be a real back-and-forth affair.
DERYK ENGELLAND: Yeah, definitely.  They got a lot of speed up front, a lot of skill.  Their back end, as well.  It's back and forth a lot of times.  Usually it's best when you keep it simple, just get pucks deep.
Q. Is it fun to play in or a little bit nerve-wracking at times?
DERYK ENGELLAND: Oh, playoffs is always fun.  A seven-game series, it's a battle.  We're in one now.
Q. How big is it to really take advantage of home ice?
DERYK ENGELLAND: It's huge. We have a great atmosphere here at T-Mobile with all the fans.  We got to feed off that.
