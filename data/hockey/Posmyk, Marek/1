Q.  How do you feel to be drafted by Toronto? 
 
MAREK POSMYK: I'm very -- I'm very proud to be picked by Toronto, the Canadian team, the great team.  I've been to Toronto, I really like Toronto, and I'm proud to be picked by it. 
 

Q.  When was he in Toronto?
 
MAREK POSMYK: When they went to Boston for the World Junior Championships.  Because I think so, if I work hard all summer, if I train hard, I couldn't see why I couldn't make the team next year. 
 

Q.  Does he have has family with him?
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: His father is with him. Yeah, his father is with him. 
 

Q.  What's his name?
 
MAREK POSMYK: Stanaclou (ph). 
 

Q.  Tell us with about where he's from.
 
MAREK POSMYK: It's a smaller town. He's a driver of a big truck, I guess.  Not really a truck driver, but -- not like a North American style.  They drive big trucks, like a big  field truck.  They do plowing and farming and that kind of stuff. 
 

Q.  What does he know about the Maple Leafs?
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: Yeah, he says I don't know very much about Toronto Maple Leafs because I'm new here looking at NHL league, and it will all come in time.  And I'm sure I'll know more than I wish. 
 

Q.  Did the Maple Leafs talk to him very much, have an eye on him at all?
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: They talked to him back home in the Czech Republic, but as far as having any idea whether they would pick me or anybody else, he didn't know, because the last couple days he didn't see them at all.  He does know them, he knows their names as far as his friends, but I'm very good friends of his, Marek Malnofski (ph) last year, and they're very good friends from the same town. 
 

Q.  Did Marek tell him anything about the league?
 
MAREK POSMYK: He missed the draft last year, he wasn't here for the draft, so he doesn't really -- he didn't really say much because he wasn't around. 
 

Q.  How much do you weigh now?
 
MAREK POSMYK: 209 pounds. 
 

Q.  Do you think the language problem will be difficult for him at camp? 
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: He says I don't think so, I'm going to work my butt off all summer learning a bit of English before camp starts. 
 
MAREK POSMYK: He's like, I don't know, a few, like ten.  I know the hockey language. 
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: The swearing is what he knows. 
 
(LAUGHTER.) 
 
CAROLINE THE INTERPRETER: The universal, exactly. 
 
MAREK POSMYK: Thank you.
