Q. Scott, are you pleased with your pick today?

SCOTT HARTNELL: I'm very pleased. Going into any team, especially Nashville, it's a
great deal for all our draftees here, anyone that's involved with the Draft. I'm just glad
to go Nashville, and it's a great deal for all of us.

Q. How much do you know about the Nashville organization? Did you have much of an
inkling they would pick you?

SCOTT HARTNELL: I had no clue coming into today who was going to pick me or where I was
going to go. I was surprised when they called my name, and I'm just pleased to go there.

Q. Were you expecting to get picked first overall?

SCOTT HARTNELL: No. I had no clue where I was going to go. I'm just happy I went where
I went.

Q. Can you just describe your playing style.

SCOTT HARTNELL: I think I play physical. I make the big hits, get the guys going off
the bench. I play a very good defensive game; I take pride in the defensive zone. Just
working hard out there, it's the name of the game. If I don't work hard, I'm not
effective. So that's the name of the game, is hard work.

Q. Why are you happy to go to Nashville? Are you a big country music fan?

SCOTT HARTNELL: My brother, he has a lot of CDs. So I'll probably have to steal some
and make some trades with him so I can get some. (Laughter.)

Q. You were a leader in your junior club in Prince Albert. Do you expect to take those
leadership skills with you?

SCOTT HARTNELL: Just growing up, I was a leader with them. My parents taught me how to
be a leader, a good person. I guess when I move to the next level, I guess we'll see it in
the next few years here.
