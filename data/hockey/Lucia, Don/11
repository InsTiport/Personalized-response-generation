MODERATOR:   We are joined by coach Don Lucia, Zach Budish, and Jake Hansen. 
Opening statement, Coach.
COACH LUCIA:   First, I'd congratulate BC.   They played very well.   Converted on the chances that they had.   And they're a good team. 
Disappointed for our players.   Like I told them in the locker room after, disappointing on the outcome of the game, but couldn't be happier for the year that they had. 
I thought we came out and played a real good first period.   I think they scored really in the only scoring chance they had.   And even in the second we had some good play, and really the game got away in about a two‑minute span when we tried to do a little bit too much on a couple of plays, and it went from 2‑0 to 4‑0, and that was basically the game. 

Q.   Jake, it seemed like Parker made a save on you and you were sort of shaking your head.   What was going through your head at that point, and did you sort of feel like he was just seeing the puck so well that it was going to take something super human to get it past him?
JAKE HANSEN:   No, I mean, that one, I think‑‑ I know the one you're talking about, where I put it right in his chest. 
Warning was coming down, and I didn't know if he was going to take it or not.   I kind of rushed it.   I had way more time than I thought.   And after that I just regret that because that's a grade A scoring chance right in front of the net.   If I scored there, I think it would be 2‑1 and we'd be right back in the game.   And they end up scoring the next shift, I believe.
So just kills ya.

Q.   Zach, how good was Milner against you guys?   He made a great save I think in the first period when you guys could have taken the lead.   You were outshooting them pretty severely for about 30minutes?
ZACH BUDISH:   Yeah, I mean, you gotta give him credit.   He's a good goalie, only given up one goal in the NCAA Tournament, and so he's obviously doing something right.   And I think their defensemen did a good job of limiting our second‑chance opportunities.   I think a lot of guys in our locker room would like to have back one chance or two chances here and there that every line kind of had, and BC capitalized on theirs.

Q.   You talk about capitalization.   It seemed like one of those nights where just every little mistake that your team made wound up in your net.   Did it feel that way to you, and how did you react? 
JAKE HANSEN:   Yeah, definitely.   We had some chances and we just didn't score.   Obviously that one, Bjugstad made a great pass to Mats and he just couldn't get it up and just put it right in Milner's pad, and we couldn't really get things going on our side.
And then the mistakes that we made.   That one that just jumped over Parenteau's stick and they go on to score a goal.   And the other one, I don't know if it was Carey, he's shooting into a wide‑open net. 
It just sucks because we felt at times we were putting the pressure on, and we're outshooting them.   We just needed one to go on.   And that just didn't happen.   And they just clearly took advantage of their opportunities.

Q.   Psychologically, does that wear you out when it feels like you're dominating the game and everything is going their way?   What did that do to you in your heads?
ZACH BUDISH:   Like I said earlier, their goalie made some big saves.   I don't think we got that frustrated when they got an early lead.   Like Coach said, we thought we played a pretty solid first period.   And they capitalized on their chance through the first and took a 1‑0 lead, and part of our game plan was to jump on them early, because they're a team that scored the first goal out.
And obviously we wanted to score first, and that didn't happen.
JAKE HANSEN:   It wears you down, because we felt we were playing all right.   But when you give a team like BC with such hot offense 2‑on‑1s and open nets, eventually it's going to break you down mentally.
But I felt like we didn't quit.   But when you get down 6‑1 like that, it just really wears on you.

Q.   Jake, you guys, you had a successful year, a successful season getting back into the NCAA.   How disappointed are you guys the way things kind of just totally snowballed tonight and went against you?
JAKE HANSEN:   I mean, it just hurts so bad, because such a great team.   And obviously won the MacNaughton Cup and getting to the Frozen Four and playing a team like BC, you couldn't ask for a better stage. 
To have our year end like this where we were playing so well and just played so sloppy at times and lose 6‑1.   It's really embarrassing, because it just got out of our control.   It's like you don't want to quit.   It's to point where you don't want it to be 7‑1.   And, more than anything, it just hurts so bad.
MODERATOR:   Thank you. 

Q.   We've talked all season about your youth on defense.   And it's never really showed itself.   And tonight there were just mistakes we hadn't seen all year. 
COACH LUCIA:   I think that's a fair assessment.   Kind of gotten‑‑ it's just one of those nights for a couple of guys that had played so well all year long.   And tonight we had a couple of guys that didn't play the way they've done most of the season. 
And that's going to happen.   And it gets hard in a game like this because you know‑‑ you don't get another chance tomorrow night to come back and play.   We've been pretty good all year long.
I mean, we've been in basically every game we've played.   And I thought we were in the game even tonight.   Then late in the second period when they scored those two quick goals and it's 4‑0, that's a pretty tall mountain to come back, but up until that point I thought we deserved a little bit better.   But BC's a good team.   And what separates BC is they have all three lines that can score.
Maybe you play a different team and they don't have those finishers and they're not going to convert some of those chances, but they're able to do that.

Q.   Obviously this team has won 18 games in a row.   They just kind of took the game over in the third period.   How good is BC? 
COACH LUCIA:   I think they took the game over in the second.   When it went from 2 to 4 in a minute and a half, two‑minute period that was the game.   And we talked about they're a team that can come at you in surges and they're not going to overwhelm when they can outshoot you 40 to 20 or something like that, when you look at their shot differentials and things like that.
But they have the ability to, when you make a mistake, to convert on their chances, and they're a very good transition team.   They do a great job applying back pressure coming up the rink.   You have to play a real fast game. 
And we just didn't have enough guys that played well enough tonight.   I thought Boyd's line was really good tonight.   They might have been our best line tonight, with Nate and Travis or Nate and Taylor.
But you know what, I'm still proud of our guys.   They played so well and so hard all season long.   You know one team's happy‑‑ like I told them one team's happy at the end of the year, that's it.   Everybody else is disappointed. 
But you know what, there's about five great things you can do in a season.   That's win your league, you can win your playoff, you can get to the NCAA's, Frozen Four, and win a national title.   We did three of them.   And that's something for these seniors to feel good about, where they were last spring and the work that they put in to get themselves back in this position and this stage.   So for that I'm really grateful and really proud of this group and what they're able to accomplish all year.
It's always a bitter pill when you lose your last game, but that doesn't take away of how much enjoyment I think we all had during the course of the season.
MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
