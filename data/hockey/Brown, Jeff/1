Well, it feels great.  The team's got such a tradition, good basic ice, so it's a good feeling. 
 
I wasn't surprised.  I was expecting to go, I just didn't know where or when, so it was a good feeling, once again. 
 
My game?  It's fast physical style, real grinding, hard nosed and aggressive-type game. 
 
Quick foot speed, quick acceleration, that quick burst of power to get started, get moving.  
 
Oh, it's much different.  To be picked first overall is a good feeling, but to go first round in the NHL, that's even better. 
 
The Rangers are a great club, great organization.  When I went down to New York on a weekend, I was -- nothing but positive feelings about the team, so somebody who won the Cup a few years ago and still one of the best teams in the league.  It's a great team, great tradition, great fan base, so it's great all around.  My best asset is I'm there every game.  I give it my all.  I am willing to learn, develop and I just want to win. 
 
For me I've got to work on foot speed, quick acceleration. 
 
I know Eric Bolton (ph).  I've played with him over the last couple of years, and he just signed with the Rangers, so I know one player Dan Calotchay (ph) not personally, but I know know him from playing against him the past couple of seasons. You know the big names, Brian Leetch, Mark Messier; you've seen them on TV, and it's nice to play with them. 
 
A little after Chris Chelios, I would say. 
 
Yeah, a little mean. 
 
I'm planning to get a little.
