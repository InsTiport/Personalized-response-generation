  Q. What was the difference between this and the games in San Jose?   
 SCOTT HANNAN:  Well, in that first game I thought we played really well except we made a few mistakes defensively which cost us.  Second game we just came out flat and there's no excuse for that one.  I thought we just got back to basics in these last two games and played really well.   
  Q.  You must be going home with great confidence with this team now?   
 SCOTT HANNAN:  We have always had confidence.  It's just another thing to build on.   
  Q.  What home ice disadvantage, what is that like?  Any explanation for that?   
 SCOTT HANNAN:  Not really.  Who knows.  Maybe a little more relaxed on the road, maybe a little tight at home, I don't know.  But we're looking to take advantage of our home games now.   
 STEPHANE YELLE.   
  Q.  Talk about the goal tending.   
 STEPHANE YELLE:  We're back to zero and we know what's ahead of us and we have to build on what we did good and get ready for tomorrow.   
  Q.  You're 7 and 2 on the road, maybe that's a good thing to get away for awhile?   
 STEPHANE YELLE:  Well, we got -- we need four wins.  And if we can get those on the road we'll get them and we definitely have to be better on the home ice.
