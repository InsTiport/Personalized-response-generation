Q.  Describe your game. 

SCOTT HANNAN:  I think I am more of an offensive defenseman the way I play my game.  I am a defensive defenseman, like I am not a liability on the defensive side.  But, I think I am more based on my offensive ability.

Q.  Isn't your reputation as being a defensive defenseman?

SCOTT HANNAN:  From most of the scouts, I heard that I was an offensive defenseman, but there is a few people that say that I am a solid defensive defenseman, too. 

SCOTT HANNAN:  Yeah, we had a few confrontations there in the end. 

Q.  Who got the best?

SCOTT HANNAN:  Seattle had a really good team.  They gave us a tough go during the year.  They were a good team. 

I need to work on my foot speed and my strength and just getting in shape and ready to step into the camp and do what I need to do. 

Yeah, I like the way Scott Stevens plays.  He is a solid defenseman and not afraid to take the body and I also like Ray Bourque, Paul Coffey.  They are great offensive defenseman, they can skate and they do everything well. 

I was involved in the power play and the penalty kill a lot.  I was mainly second line, first line on the power play I jumped in between, but I was always out there for the penalty killing too. 

I know in the next few years that if I play well, it will come in time.  It is all how I play. 

Q.  Do you think this is a big draft by San Jose?

SCOTT HANNAN:  Yeah, I think there is a good opportunity there.  I think they need defensemen and they are an up and coming team, so.....

Well, when we played against Patrick Marleau, the big thing about him is speed and the way he sees the ice.  He sees that open guy all the time.  He lit us up a few times during the year.  He is just a great player. 

Definitely be great to play with Patrick Marleau.  He is a great player and he can only help any  team he is on.
