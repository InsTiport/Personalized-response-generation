  Q. This a case of you guys doing a better job handling the initial serve, and having too many bounces against you?  
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, I felt like the first period was, they come off really hard. And you know, skating, and I think we just kind of testing the water a little bit. A little nerves and excitement. And that second period we played much better. They have a couple of breaks and the first two goals there. And, you know, it tilted their way. I felt we just need to stick to our game, and I think definitely we can beat them.   
  
  Q. Their experience in this building seems to pay off when it comes to dealing with hard shots off those boards, doesn't it?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, actually, it's a novelty for us. It seems like it's coming off so hard, we just need to adjust and be more careful.  
  
  Q. How about the timeout? That seemed to be a good play at the time, but it seemed to backfire unfortunately for you guys?  
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, you know what, we just need to bear down on that on the face-off. And we need to make sure we get the puck on out. And we'll definitely address that the next game.  
  
  Q. Face-offs an issue?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: No, I don't think so.   
  
  Q. Aside from the breaks, you guys did what you wanted to do out there against them?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, especially in the second period. They felt we get back to our game, and we played pretty solid. We're trying to hold on to the puck offensively, and create some chances. And I think we just need to find a way to have better quality shots. And, you know, crush the net.  
  
  Q. Do you guys find yourselves playing full 20-minute periods? Is that goal disappointing that they were able to put something on the net in the end of the period?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, obviously disappointed. But I felt like we just need to find a way. It's what the playoffs are all about. And we just need to find a way to bounce back.  
  
  Q. Would you call this a bad luck loss?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: No, hey. Whatever you want to call it, you can call it. But they have a couple of bounces. But still they played well. You know, they scored third goal, and it seems like they played well defensively. So just give them the credit, too.   
  
  Q. The first line that will be a typical kind of goal to score against Osgood, to make sure you beat him in this series?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, always it's hard for a goalie. You know, if you have a pretty close shot and to control the rebound, you know, I just got lucky. Got there first to the puck and put the puck in the net.   
 But I felt like we just need to find a way to get better quality shots on on them. I felt like we didn't really test them as much. I think we just, you know, on the outside, so I think we just need to penetrate the defense better, and create some more offense that way.   
  
  Q. On a personal level, last time we heard something like that was in the playoffs. You feel the same right now?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah. I'm pretty excited, you know. Feel pretty good, and felt like we have a pretty good team here. So I think it's a good sign.   
  
  Q. Skilled as these two teams are, are you you surprised of the amount of big hits?  
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: No, not at all. I feel like it's playoffs. Everybody's not going to skate by if they have a good chance to finish the check or set the tone. Whatever it is, it's all about playoffs hockey. And it's not surprising to me at all.  
  
  Q. Does that show why you guys came out tonight against a team like this, and fall back in their trap and they sit around and wait?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, I mean, they're a good team. You know, you want to say sit in the lead or not. But they are still when they have a chance to go offensive. It's not like they really sit on it. I felt like we just need a way to produce more goals and come back.   
  
  Q. He played pretty good for most of the game?  
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about the officiating. I'm sure they overall did a pretty good job. I felt like when the puck was on Osgood and somebody put -- they put their hand down. I think that should be called. But they didn't see it. And you know, they're human, too. So I felt like overall it was pretty good.   
 As I said, I'm not going to comment on it.   
  
  Q. Guys talked about the experience factor and knowing what to expect. Did it feel different today when you guys got on on the ice than a year ago?   
 RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: It was hockey. So I'm lost about your question.   
  
  Q. Did the team just feel relaxed? Do you feel relaxed out there? Are the guys relaxed?   
  RUSLAN FEDOTENKO: No, not in the first period. I felt like just nerves and excitement. And not really to
