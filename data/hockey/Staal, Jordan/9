  Q.  After all the speculation the last couple of days about being traded to Carolina, how does it feel to finally be over with and selected by the Penguins?   
 JORDAN STAAL:  It didn't really matter where I ended up.  This seems to be a great organization.  I'm real proud to be a part of it.   
 We've got a really young team, and again, hopefully I can make an impact the next couple years.  I'll be working hard, and it should be a blast.   
  
  Q.  How about playing with Sydney Crosby, what do you think that's going to be like?   
 JORDAN STAAL:  Well, I'm not there yet.  Again, I still have to work hard to get there.  He is a great player.  I'm sure I'll be putting up some numbers playing with him, if I do get a chance to play; I'm sure it will be a lot of fun and I'm very excited.   
  
  Q.  Do you think you have what it takes to make the NHL next year?   
 JORDAN STAAL:  I don't know.  I haven't had a chance to play against his kind of calibre.  I've watched a few games and I've watched my brother, and I don't know if I'm quite there yet, but I'm going to be working hard.  I think I can make it; if it's not this year, hopefully the next couple years.
