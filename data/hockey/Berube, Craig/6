Q.  Given how much emphasis you guys put on this Game 3 and to lose another 1-goal game, another close one, how much more frustrating is this loss for you guys?

CRAIG BERUBE:  It is tough.  Tied it up there, you know; we had a chance.  We didn't come out in the first period very well.  But we weathered the storm and thought we played pretty well after that.  Just didn't get the job done again.


Q.  Can you just scratch your head?  Seems like you guys are doing everything, but getting the win in the end.  How can you guys explain what has been happen to go the team?

CRAIG BERUBE:  I don't know, inexperience I guess, maybe, they are the champs, they have been there the last five years in the Final.  They know how to win.  We don't know, that is the difference.  It is not a matter of effort. It is knowing how to win.  It doesn't just come to you.  You have got to learn.  That is about all I can say about it.


Q.  How do you shake this loss to get ready for four?

CRAIG BERUBE:  I don't know.  I really don't know. I mean, all you can do is go to Game 4 and try as hard as you can.  And if we come away with a win, great, go back to Detroit.  It is not over 'til it is over, right?  That is about all you can do.
