CRAIG BERUBE: I think, you know, obviously we want to come out with a win, but we got a lot of positives from that game.  I think in Game 2 we have got to come out stronger. At the beginning of the game, we can't sit back and wait like we did.  We sat back and waited a little bit and they put two goals in the net and sometimes that is enough for that team, they play good defense.  So, we want to come out stronger and play solid 60 minutes.  I think all year we proved that we can run and gun with teams.  We have got a fast hockey team.  I don't know why people don't think that we can skate.  I think that we are one of the fastest teams in the League, with Zednick, Bondra, Juneau, Oates, these guys are fast and can make good plays and we have proven in the third that we can play with them.  Actually held them in their end for quite a while; had some good chances.


Q.  Your coach was saying maybe that because layoff he found you guys to be a little bit rusty?

CRAIG BERUBE: I think so, but they had a layoff too.  The first game after a layoff like that usually isn't that good.  I think we are going to see more intensity in the second game, better plays, better passing just because we have got the first game out of the way.  Guys will be more loose and ready to go.


Q.  How about shots on goal --

CRAIG BERUBE:  We got to get more pucks in net.  I think that game we were gaining the blue line and kind of looking to make plays rather than just putting at net.  We have done that in the past in the Playoffs, too, but we went back and in the next game and got a lot of shots on net.  So we are hoping to get 30 or more shots next game.
