  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Carl Hagelin. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CARL HAGELIN:   It's time for us to have a good start, get some forecheck going, gain some moment and get some confidence, realizing we can play in their zone, take some pressure off our D.   It's not easy for our D to spend 15 out of the first 20 minutes in their own end.   When that happens, it's going to be a long night, they'll get tired. 
For us, come off strong, get some shots, contain the puck down low.

Q.   When it's tough to get goals in this series, is there a fine line between pushing and forcing stuff?
CARL HAGELIN:   Yeah, you don't want to force too much, try too much stuff around the blueline, because you know they're going to knock down pucks in the air, cost you turnovers.   They're a quick team.   Once it happens, they're all gone. 
So, like you said, it's important not to force anything.   I think it's important for us just to hold onto the puck, maybe be a bit more patient.

Q.   Is there confidence in this team knowing you've been in this situation before?
CARL HAGELIN:   Yeah, I would say so.   We have a lot of strong character in this room, a lot of guys that are willing to pay the price to win games like this. 
Whatever happened in the first four games doesn't matter right now, it's a best‑out‑of‑three series.   We're going to start all over and hopefully have a strong 60‑minute game. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
