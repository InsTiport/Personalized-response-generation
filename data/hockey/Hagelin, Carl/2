Q. Do you feel well enough to play?  Is it a healthy scratch sort of thing?  Or is this your way to get back at full strength to be available?
CARL HAGELIN: I can't comment on that.  We'll see tomorrow what happens.
Q. Is there anything, just watching the game last night, that you can take away if you do get back into the lineup?
CARL HAGELIN: I think we kind of knew what to expect.  They play the way we expected.  They're a really sound defensive team.  They don't take many chances.  They're solid in their own end.
So I think we've got to be patient and let the game come to us.
Q. Do you feel like all of your speed is there?
CARL HAGELIN: Yeah.
Q. Do you feel as fast as you normally would, I guess is what I'm asking?
CARL HAGELIN: I'd say yes.
Q. Frustrating process?  How often do you develop an injury?
CARL HAGELIN: Never.  It's definitely been frustrating, but that's part of it.  Want to be out there with the boys and help out as much as you can.  You can see the positives, right?  We're in the Conference Finals, and obviously we're down 1-0, but a lot of games to be played.  Hopefully, I'll be back there soon.
Q. Mike said it was a couple minor injuries, injuries plural.  Is that just an accumulation of stuff throughout the season?
CARL HAGELIN: I'm not going to comment on the injuries.  We'll go over that after the season, I guess, you and I.
