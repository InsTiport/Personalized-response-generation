   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Shawn Thornton.  
  
  Q. Somebody has to break the spell and win one on the road, how important is this one?   
 SHAWN THORNTON: I'd love for it to be us, but there's no guarantees, right? It's simple mathematics, if we're going to have success we're going to have to win one in this building, so I would prefer if it's tomorrow, yes.  
  
  Q. What's different playing here for you?   
 SHAWN THORNTON: You know what? I didn't play the first two games so I don't know. I was up in the press box and the game looks easy from up there. So I probably have a million answers but none of them are the right ones.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 SHAWN THORNTON: I've been with him for four years so I know how well he can play and when he's dialed in how good he can be. I saw it two years ago when we were at a point in the Presidents', and when he's on, he's on. He's an unbelievable talent, for sure.   
  
  Q. Seems like you brush things off well and that he's able to keep his attitude where he's able to be?  
 SHAWN THORNTON: Nobody has scored on him, yeah, that goal wasn't his fault. There was a lot of things that led up to that.  
  
  Q. I'm not saying that --  
 SHAWN THORNTON: No, yeah, mentally he's strong. He's good at brushing things off and he's good at not reading into too many things, either.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like he can frustrate the opposition just because he can't be rattled, basically?   
 SHAWN THORNTON: I don't know. I can't speak what's going on in the other rooms. I think he gives us a confidence in our room to be able to play our game because we have him in the pipes.
