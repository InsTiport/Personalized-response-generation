   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Shawn Thornton. 
 SHAWN THORNTON: It was the league's decision. We'll go with it. Loosing a player like Horty is a big loss. He's been unbelievable for us. A lot of key goals. He's an unbelievable teammate. 
 It's not going to be easy, but guys are going to have to step up and do more now, everybody in the lineup, and everybody that has been playing is going to have to step up. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 SHAWN THORNTON: Everyone came together and did a little bit more. I think you need that this time of year whether you're healthy or somebody's down. I think the guys did a pretty good job. 

 Q. Is that one of the main reasons you are where you are?
 SHAWN THORNTON: I mean, it's part of the reason. We've been through a lot of stuff in the four years I've been here. Been a pretty resilient team. I think experience helped a little bit, too. 

 Q. When did you know you were going in? 
 SHAWN THORNTON: I mean, every kid wants to play in the Stanley Cup finals. I found out just before warmup. 

 Q. Do you think the series is going to continue to have this nasty edge?
 SHAWN THORNTON: It should. It's the finals. Both teams want that trophy. Everyone's going to do whatever they can to try and make that goal a reality. That includes playing physical, I'm sure. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 SHAWN THORNTON: Yeah, no, we're focused on Game 4 now. All this other stuff, we turned the page on it. We have to have at least the same effort, if not better, for Game 4 because we know they're going to be better. We'd like to go up there 2-2 instead of 3-1, that's for sure. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 SHAWN THORNTON: Personally my whole life. It's not that difficult. It's not hard to get up for these games this time of year. It shouldn't be hard to stay disciplined either. Everything is on the line right now.
