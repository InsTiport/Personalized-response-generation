  SHAWN THORNTON:   He's been like that for probably his whole career, but the whole time he's been here for sure.   He definitely sacrifices his body in a lot of ways to help the team win, so he'll be missed.

Q.   I know you want to win, but is it a rallying point or something you try to do for him?
SHAWN THORNTON:   Yeah, you can definitely‑‑ I wouldn't say rally, but we talked about it.   We don't want that to go to waste.   It takes a big step to lay down in front of a slapper like that, and obviously you saw him play on a broken leg for 45 seconds.   You want to play well for him after that, that's for sure.

Q.   Is it just playoff hockey?
SHAWN THORNTON:   I mean, it is, but it's not even just playoff hockey for him.   That's the way he plays day in and day out, whether it's blocking a shot, or on the other side during the seasons he's stepped up and fought a lot of guys a lot bigger than him to try and change momentum.   He's taken the pressure off me sometimes doing that, and that's not really his role.   It doesn't matter what it is, he's been the ultimate teammate since he's been here.

Q.   Knowing how much he loves the game and loves this time of year, have you talked to him?   How is he doing?
SHAWN THORNTON:   I mean, I'm not sure if I've ever played with anyone that spends that much time at the rink.   He loves it.   He grew up with it, and he does love it.   So I'm sure he's a little down in the dumps, but he'll be positive when he's around the guys and help out anyway he can off the ice I'm sure.   He's still a big part of this team, whether he's on skates or not.
