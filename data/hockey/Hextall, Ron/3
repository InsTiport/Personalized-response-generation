Q.  This is where maybe pride is going to come into play a little bit in this game?
 
RON HEXTALL:  Well, it has to.  Obviously, we got dominated by a hockey club that played a terrific hockey game. And, on the other end of things, we were very bad. 
 

Q.  Is this the kind of game you just got to throw out, forget about, go back, one more shot?
 
RON HEXTALL:  We have no choice.  I mean, we have got to make some adjustments.  We need to play better.  And, we -- obviously we have a tall task ahead of us.  We have to look at the next game.  We have got to go out with the attitude of just winning one game.  And, if we do that, we go back to Philly. So, that is how we need to approach it. 
 

Q.  Did you feel you had a chance to stop any of those last three goals?
 
RON HEXTALL:  They created some good chances.  Their offense was really rolling tonight.  They used their speed. And they used their skill and they did a hell of a job. 
 

Q.  One of the toughest losses for you?
 
RON HEXTALL:  I think it is tough for all of us.  When you go out and play like that this time of the year, obviously, it is disappointing.  I don't think there is a guy in our organization who is not disappointed right now.
