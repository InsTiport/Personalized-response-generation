RON HEXTALL:  The first goal two guys cut across in front of me.  I kind of looked up to try and see the puck and I saw the puck, but I was up and I couldn't get down quick enough.  We all have a responsibility to our hockey club and I am not going to stand here and point fingers you need to time to reflect, but I mean, it is so disappointing right now and I can tell you I gave it everything I had.  And, I came up real short.  And, I think, as a team, we did a lot of the same.  We just didn't get it done. 
 

Q.  Do you think the team reacted well?
 
RON HEXTALL:  I am not going to start pointing fingers.  We win as a team and lose as a team.  I will be the first to admit that I came up short.  I gave everything I had, but it wasn't good enough.  And, probably the way a lot of us feel, we didn't get it done.  Yesterday is no excuse, absolutely none.
