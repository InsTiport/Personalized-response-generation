Q.  You guys had a meeting.  What did you guys talk about at the meeting?
 
RON HEXTALL:  I don't discuss things that we talk about at meetings. 
 

Q.  Why did you have a meeting?
 
RON HEXTALL:  I think that is rather obvious.  We are down 3-nothing and we need to get it going. 
 

Q.  How do you guys do it?  What do you have to do, take it one game at a time?
 
RON HEXTALL:  We need to focus on tomorrow night's game and getting a good start and playing the type of hockey that we are accustomed to playing as opposed to the way we have been playing recently. 
 

Q.  Will you do something different, how will your focus be?
 
RON HEXTALL:  It is a matter of being ready to play and going out and doing it when the time comes.  We haven't been playing good hockey.  We are fully aware of that.  And, we are not here because we are a bad hockey team.  Right now we are playing like a bad hockey team and we need to get back to doing some of the things that we were doing when we were playing like a good team. 
 

Q.  Are you frustrated right now, Ron?
 
RON HEXTALL:  We are all frustrated.  I mean, we are down 3 to nothing, but we have got to carry on and, you know, again, we have got to get back to basics.  It is a simple game and we are making it complicated right now. 
 

Q.  How much is that a function of how well Detroit is playing?
 
RON HEXTALL:  I thought they played great last game. We need to play great to compete and we didn't.  We were far from the top of our game and we need to get back to it. 
 

Q.  Will you be goalie tomorrow night?
 
RON HEXTALL:  Yes. 
 

Q.  Good luck to you.
 
RON HEXTALL:  Thank you.
