 Q. The scoreboard says you lost the game, but basically you guys did everything you needed to do to clinch first place. So you have to take a positive out of the game, don't you?  
RIKARD GRONBORG: Yeah, always when you step on the ice, you want to win the game, but obviously mission accomplished. We took the first place in our bracket, and it felt like mission accomplished. I knew it was going to be a tough game. Three games in four days. Obviously mission accomplished.   
   
 Q. Coach, are you going to watch the later game? Does it matter to you who wins?  
RIKARD GRONBORG: Yes, of course we're watching it. We're scouting every game, scouting every team. We'll take whatever team we're going to play.   
Obviously we're extremely happy to be in the semifinals. Obviously it was a big goal of ours to win the bracket and be in first place and move on to the semifinals.   
   
 Q. What are your thoughts on the performance of Filip Forsberg? You're going up against a team full of young stars.   
RIKARD GRONBORG: No, it's a tremendous game. I think it was nice for me to see him score, too. He had great opportunities. I think he had five shots on that last game and couldn't get a goal done, so it was nice for me to see him actually get a goal. I think that will be huge not only for himself but also as a team. We need him to produce. He's that kind of a player.   
   
 Q. Coach, Lundqvist made more than 80 saves within the last two games. How would you evaluate his game?  
RIKARD GRONBORG: Obviously he's a tremendous goalie. He kept us in the game last night and he kept us in the game tonight when they had all those breakaways and penalty shots. Obviously that's why he's called King Henrik, because he's that good. Obviously he gave us a chance to win.   
This is a tough, tough schedule with three games in four nights. We've been doing some traveling and stuff like that. We needed him to play big, and he did, and he gave us an opportunity to play in the semifinals for sure.
