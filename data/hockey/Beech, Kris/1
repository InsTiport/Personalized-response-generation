 Q. (Inaudible)? 
 
 KRIS BEECH: Actually, I did. I had an interview with them in Calgary a couple weeks
ago. It went really well. They wanted to have another one with me on Friday, 9:00 in the
morning. I thought that went well, too. I guess I got the vibe from the interviews, you
know, that they were interested.  
 
Q. When you think of the Washington Capitals, just some general comments. Growing up,
did you ever keep an eye on them?
 
 KRIS BEECH: Not really. You know, I know who they are and I know all the players on the
team. I'm aware of who the GM and the coach are. You know, they've been a good team in the
league for a long time. I'm very, very excited to be a part of the organization.
