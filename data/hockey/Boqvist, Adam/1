 Q.  How does it feel to be in this moment?  
ADAM BOQVIST: Unbelievable.  I'm here with my family, so, yeah, unbelievable.   
 Q.  Your brother was drafted last year, was he not?  
ADAM BOQVIST: Yeah, second round.  I was there, too, in Chicago.  So I know the city pretty well now.   
 Q.  Did that kind of give you an idea what this could be like for you?  
ADAM BOQVIST: Yeah, of course, he told me, be yourself and enjoy the week, and you cannot do so much now in the off-season.   
 Q.  Did you have any sense about the Blackhawks?  Did you have any idea what was going to happen?  
ADAM BOQVIST: No, I just talk to Jonathan Toews.  He was happy to have me.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   
 Q.  At the Draft Combine a couple weeks ago, you said you were a few years away from the NHL.  What do you have to do?  
ADAM BOQVIST: I think I need to improve my defensive play and need to be bigger and stronger.  Of course, my hockey stick can be better, too, so all those other things.   
 Q.  What do you know about the Blackhawks and how you'll fit into their style?  
ADAM BOQVIST: I know they have lots of Swedish defensemen, and they like to have the puck, you know, Kane.  Yeah, I like it.   
 Q.  Did you ever see the Cup, did Hjalmarsson or Oduya, any of the guys bring it back to Sweden?  
ADAM BOQVIST: Yeah, I know he played there for ten years but I haven't seen in real life.   
 Q.  There's a lot made of Rasmus Dahlin going first, Swedish player.  
ADAM BOQVIST: Yeah, of course, I'm happy, Swedish.  I'm very proud for him and his family, and dream come true.   
We played in 15 games together.  We know each other good.  Great guy.   
 Q.  Karlsson, is that the model now that everybody wants to be?  
ADAM BOQVIST: Yeah, I think so, a little bit.  Yeah, he's pretty good player and yeah, I don't know.   
 Q.  Do you expect to be going back to Sweden next year to play?  Is that the plan or do you have any idea?  
ADAM BOQVIST: I don't know.  I signed a new contract with BrynÃ¤s, so we'll see after this weekend.   
 Q.  How long is the contract for?  
ADAM BOQVIST: One year.
