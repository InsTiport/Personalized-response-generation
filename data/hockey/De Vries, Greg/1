Q.  (Inaudible.)
 
GREG DE VRIES:  I'm not sure if we were tiring.  I mean, we just didn't skate tonight.  I mean, they just had the puck all night, it seemed like, played in our zone all night and took the play to us and got the win. 
 
Q.  What happened on the third period goal?
 
GREG DE VRIES:  The puck was right in and went right to the net and got a piece of me with it. 
 
Q.  Waived opportunity on the four, they had the double minus and you didn't capitalize on it early?
 
GREG DE VRIES:  I think actually we were up 1-0.  We got to get that next goal, and we haven't been able to do it all series, and we got burned on it. 
 
Q.  On that particular play when you came over the blue line, it seemed like you paused, holded, hesitated a little bit and in the second period you had a wide open slot.  Was that the case?
 
GREG DE VRIES:  We didn't get many shots tonight, obviously didn't throw enough pucks to the net.  They had at least double of what we had.  It worked out for them. 
 
Q.  Were they taking away your open ice, your space?
 
GREG DE VRIES:  I think they pretty much had the puck all night, and the second and third period, they were really skating well with it.  They played in our zone a lot. 
 
Q.  Did you guys try to sit on this one too much, try to sit on your lead?
 
GREG DE VRIES:  Yeah, during the series we haven't been able to get the two-goal lead, and we have to find a way to do it.
