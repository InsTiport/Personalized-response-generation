THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Tippett.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH TIPPETT:   It was disappointing the way it finished.   I thought we certainly started better.   I thought the first four or five minutes of the second period we had four or five very good chances to score to get the game back to even.   We weren't able to do that.   
They got that second one.   We ended up putting ourselves in a lot of penalty trouble.   
First period they had a lot of shots from outside.   The first period I thought was a better period for us.   Last game, it was one of those games we were hanging around the game.   Needed to capitalize on the chances.   Unfortunately, the penalties took the game away from us.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
COACH TIPPETT:   Well, it's frustrating not winning, not being able to do the things you want to do.   That's for sure.   
   
 Q.   How much does it hurt right now that your top two offensive guys haven't been able to get anything going the way they did in the Nashville series?  
COACH TIPPETT:   We need everybody to give a little more.   Those guys aren't excluded from that, obviously.   When you're looking to make those opportunities count, your margin for error is very slim.   
When we do get chances, and the players that are around the chances, you know, that's the difference where we are right now compared to Nashville.   They went in in Nashville.   Here we haven't been able to bury anything.  
   
 Q.   Mike Smith said today he doesn't know if it's feeling like the team was just getting to the Conference Finals was good enough, but you haven't shown the kind of team you are in the first two games.   Do you agree with that?  
COACH TIPPETT:   You know, I think there's sometimes we play, I think you have to give them credit, how they're playing.   I certainly think that we can show better than we are right now.   
Like I say, I like the first period, first part of the second period.   We got to find a way to sustain that, obviously keeps some pucks out of our net, be more disciplined, capitalize on a chance or two.   At least give ourselves a chance where we feel like we're competitive in the game.  
   
 Q.   Down 2‑0, facing the possibility of losing two players, worrisome?   
COACH TIPPETT:   Well, I'm not going to worry about the discipline.   The league will take care of that.   I don't know what will happen there.   But obviously being down 2‑0, that's not the results we were looking for at home.   
We got to regroup tomorrow, go in there and try to steal a game on the road.   
   
 Q.   They've got size on all of their lines.   It's not like you're a small team.   What is the difference with them being able to use their size against you guys?  
COACH TIPPETT:   Using there are size?   They're throwing a lot of pucks at the net, you know, crashing the net.   We're trying to do the same thing.   We just haven't got as many pucks there.   
The games are competitive.   Like I say, I thought for stretches tonight we were much better than we were in Game1.   I think in Game1, if you look back, we were a team we weren't sure how it was going to go.   Took us a while to figure out that the bar goes up every round, so...   
Like I say, I think there were some things we could grab out of tonight's game we can build on and there's some things that are going to have to come out of our game or get out of our game if we're going to have a chance to be successful.   
   
 Q.   When it looks like you lose your cool, especially in the second, how do you get that back for Game3?   
COACH TIPPETT:   Losing our cool over there?   The Doan penalty was a little frustrating because that's one, you know, it's a slash, these sticks break like they do.   The Yandle penalty, I don't know why only one guy was taken there.   I still felt like we were around a little bit.   
The Doan penalty is an interesting one.   It's a dangerous place.   A player can't put himself in that position either.   I'm not saying it was a good hit.   
Anybody who's played the game, you're in that position, the guy is beside you, he turns his back to you, you can't stop.   You can't stop.   You know, that's the way I saw that hit.   
I don't want to comment too much on it.   Obviously that was a big factor, spending that much time down five‑on‑three.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much, coach.
