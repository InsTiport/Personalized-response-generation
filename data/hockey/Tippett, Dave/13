THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Coach Tippett.   
   
 Q.   Looked like the Kopitar line had a pretty aggressive game tonight.   Did you try various matchups against them?  
COACH TIPPETT:   I didn't see it as just the Kopitar line.   I thought their whole team was better than our team.   
If you like Kopitar's game, he was a lot of them.   We weren't close in that game.   We got beat in every facet of the game.   Hopefully we take some lessons from it and we can be better next game.   
   
 Q.   That Brown/Kopitar line has been in sync all season.   
COACH TIPPETT:   I'm worried about our team.   We got players that I have to worry about getting playing better, not worry about Kopitar.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts, they came out and set the tone, big shot differential in the game.   Do you feel the energy and effort was there from your team?  
COACH TIPPETT:   I felt like our execution was so poor, I bet you there was between 25 and 30 shots that they got in the game or attempted in the game, and early was a lot of it, that we had the puck on our stick and it ended up on their stick and a shot in the net.   
The execution and the will to get things done is going to have to improve greatly if we're going to have a chance in this series.   
   
 Q.   Dave, looked like early in the playoffs you've had a couple games like this and you were able to sidestep it and win games.   What was the difference for you?   
COACH TIPPETT:   As the playoffs go on, the bar gets higher and higher.   You have some players that can rise with the bar and we didn't have enough guys rise with the bar tonight.   
We had some games like this, but not to the point where we got out‑competed as bad as we did.   
   
 Q.   You go into the second intermission obviously with a big deficit but tied on the scoreboard.   What did you have to say to your team?  
COACH TIPPETT:   We're fortunate to be in the game.   It's a winnable game.   If we start playing, we might have a chance.   
   
 Q.   How much of your lack of execution was your own team and how much of it was L.A.?   
COACH TIPPETT:   Like I say, I'll start with our team, and we'll start there.   Once we get that cleaned up, then we can find some other areas.   
   
 Q.   Coach, do you leave this game frustrated?   Obviously, this wasn't your team's best effort.   Or are you encouraged because you were still in it and had a chance to win it even though you didn't play your best hockey?   
COACH TIPPETT:   We leave this game just like we did against Game1 after Nashville.   We know there's some adjustments we have to make.   We know there's some parts of our game that have to be much better.   The only difference is we didn't get the fortunate outcome we did against Nashville.   
Let's be honest, there were stretches in that Nashville game that could have went the other way, and tonight it didn't go our way.   There's some areas we can be much better at.   
I give them credit, they played a strong game, but I think our team is going to have to be better if we're going to have a chance.  
   
 Q.   Some of the penalties looked undisciplined.   
COACH TIPPETT:   You know, it's one of those ones where you got to be aware.   If you see what happened, Hanzal gets cross checked, just before that, he gets up and slashed.   You have to be able to grit your teeth and take that.   The retaliation is going to get called more times than not.   
That's the way the referees use to keep control the game.   If you're not willing to take those whacks and take a number, then you're going to be in the penalty box and ultimately hurt our team.   
   
 Q.   Your team has never trailed in a series.   Are you interested to see how they respond to this adversity?  
COACH TIPPETT:   You're always interested.   I'm interested to see how we come back and play better.   We have to play better if we're going to have a chance to win.   I recognize that they're a good team, but we're going to have to play better if we'll have a chance to be successful.   
Thank you.
