MARK TINORDI: It happens.  The same thing happened in the third period in the last game, I mean, we played probably 16, 17 minutes in our end and when you do that, obviously you are not going to score.  That first period was pretty easy.  You are -- pretty easy period for their "D". 
 

Q.  20 minutes between shots, what are they doing specifically to keep you guys from getting shots?
 
MARK TINORDI: Obviously, I think they are the best backchecking team in the League.  Everyone of their forwards from Fedorov to their grinders, I mean, they all backcheck hard.  That is one of their strengths, but on the same hand I think when we forecheck, sometimes we go in there coasting waiting to see what happened.  We have got to get in there with some speed, make some good dumps and we said at the start of the season, we have got to chip it by the defensemen; skate to the puck and obviously our forechecking was -- (inaudible) -- 
 

Q.  How good do you think Osgood was?
 
MARK TINORDI: Second period he stopped 2 on Bondra. Obviously we need some momentum.  We had a bad first period. If we get some some momentum right there, maybe our crowd can carry us and we can get another goal, and get going, but just didn't work out.
