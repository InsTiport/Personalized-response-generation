MARK TINORDI:  Obviously it is our biggest challenge yet.  Every series seems like the team is supposed to beat us easier and easier and (inaudible) you have just got to play, played 82 games (inaudible) if we worry about Detroit or don't think we are going to have much of a chance, we are in trouble.  We have got to play just like our other series. There is got to be a point somewhere in the first game or second game that can really swing the series.  So far, this year, we have got the break and we just have to hope it continues. 
 

Q.  You have had success and confidence gross, if you are ever going to be a confident hockey club, it is now.
 
MARK TINORDI:  Yeah, when you get to the Finals you can't -- the biggest thing is not let the excitement of all the media and the bigness of the games get to you.  You have got to play the same game.  Because when it comes down to it, it is what you do on the ice.  All the guys know that, so we have to worry about what we have to do. 
 

Q.  The guys in particular, any particular concern about Yzerman, Shanahan, Fedorov, --
 
MARK TINORDI:  When you look at the defending champions, you know, as much as they score and they can score, they are just as hard to score on.  So, I mean, they are pretty balanced team.
