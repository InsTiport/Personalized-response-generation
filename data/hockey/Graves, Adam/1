Q.  Down 3-1, with everything that is going on now, how hard actually is it to keep the confidence?

ADAM GRAVES:  I don't think it is that difficult at all.  It is it breaking down, it is a 60 minute hockey game. We can't go any further than the first shift on Sunday afternoon and go from there.  I think they obviously played well.  But I thought that we played extremely well too.  But that, is hockey.  I mean, the shots were pretty even.  The chances were pretty even.  And could have gone either way and they happened to score just before the buzzer.
