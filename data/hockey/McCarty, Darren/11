Q.  How important to get that early goal in the second after the Flyers dominated the second half of the first period?
 
DARREN McCARTY:  Yeah, they did.  We got ourselves IN a little bit of penalty trouble and with the great power play that they have, you can't really rely on your penalty killing 100% all the time.  We felt they got some lucky bounces and some goals.  They showed what a persistent hockey club they are.  We just kind of showed that we are not going to back down on anything.  It was nice to get that early one. 
 

Q.  Hardest hitting period of the Finals so far.  The hate might be developing between these two clubs.
 
DARREN McCARTY:  I don't see why it shouldn't be. This is the Stanley Cup Finals.  There is a lot of pride on the line and you are playing for the Championship of the world, so, you know, if there is no hate there, that is when you start to worry. 
 
Q.  Shjon, an early long goal.  Goaltender situation Philadelphia.  Was it tough to shake that off and get right into it?
 
SHJON PODEIN:  No.  We have confidence.  We just know we are not taking or giving up a little bit too big a gap.  We think we got to get on them a little bit quicker and if we start doing that, take away some of their scoring opportunities and maybe turn it around a little bit. 
 

Q.  Game 2, a lot more familiarity.  It looks like it is getting a little more nasty out there now.
 
SHJON PODEIN:  I think we know we got to play the body more.  We got to do it every chance we got.  Play the battles on the boards.  I think if we start doing that a little bit more, we are going to have more success.
