DARREN MCCARTY: Bottom line is we won, but we are not going to be fooled by the effort we put out.  We played a good first 20 minutes and we are happy with that, but the 40 after that, we really didn't play the way we were capable of.  We didn't skate.  We didn't take the play to them.  They really hung in there, showed a lot of leadership and character.  They are a good hockey team and we can't continue to let -- to give them opportunity.  They are going to muster some with the talent they have themselves and we don't need to help them out anywhere. 
 

Q.  Scotty talked about the fact that he criticized himself for some of the line changes.  Do you remember him criticizing himself at least publicly?
 
DARREN MCCARTY: No, never have, and you know, it is a team game and the coach is a part of the team but you are not going to put the total blame on him or the total blame on anybody.  But, we got caught with too many men penalty and we can't let that happen.  Little things like that could mean a big difference in the game. 
 

Q.  What do you think will be different at all tomorrow night?
 
DARREN MCCARTY: Well, I think it will be maybe a little bit more of an exciting game.  First game when you play the other conference you are a little tentative and it is a feeling-out process, but we know what a good club they have and we know they are going to go better and I think they expect us to go better to.  So hopefully it will be exciting for everybody.  And, as long as we win, it doesn't matter.
