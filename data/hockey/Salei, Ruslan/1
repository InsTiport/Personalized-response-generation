Q.  Did you like the fact you got a little bit of open ice in the 1st period?
 
RUSLAN SALEI: They play hard.  We play hard.  And there was a little open game in the 1st period.  I think we got more chances than they did.  Hopefully we will capitalize on one of them and get a chance to take the game over. 
 
Q.  Your team tends to win a lot of faceoffs.  Does that mean as a defenseman that when you're in the offensive zone you can jump a little bit?
 
RUSLAN SALEI: It's so important for us.  When you win a faceoff, you play with the puck.  And that's what you want to do against New Jersey is play with the puck.
