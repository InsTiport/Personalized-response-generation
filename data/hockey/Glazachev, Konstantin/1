Q.   Who is your favorite NHL player right now?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Right now it would have to be Jerome Iginla. 
 
Q.   If you had to pick Gretzky versus Forsberg who would you pick?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Probably Gretzky. 
 
Q.   Favorite team?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Edmonton Oilers. 
 
Q.   Favorite movie?
 
SHAWN BELLE: I don't have one.  
 
Q.   Britney or Christina?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Probably Britney.  (Laughs). 
 
Q.   (Inaudible)?
 
SHAWN BELLE: I guess really was involved with camp  through the NHL's diversity program so I got an invitation and kind of met up from there with Jerome. 
 
Q.   First time meeting him?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Yes. 
 
Q.   You were maybe highly regarded early in the season, maybe didn't have as good a season, is that the way you looked at it?
 
SHAWN BELLE: I didn't feel like I had the greatest first half of the season and I know that after that, my game started to really pick up.  I got a lot more confidence when I was out on the ice.  That's when it really started to turn around for me.  
 
Q.   What player do you kind of pattern your style after?
 
SHAWN BELLE: I try to pattern Rob Blake in a way.  He can play against first lines every night and banging their bodies and shut them down.  At the same time he's able to chip in offensively.  
 
Q.   Do you have a hard shot?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Pretty hard shot.  
 
Q.   You are an all-arounder?
 
SHAWN BELLE: Right in the middle.  
 
Q.   Kevin, is this where you figured you would go, did you have first-round hopes or did you have a feeling you'd go higher in the second round?
 
KEVIN KLEIN:  There were plenty of speculation, I guess.  A lot of people are going to tell me late first round, early second and I was just glad to get it over with finally and go to a great team and I have been here for a couple of days so I know what it's like, and the pride that they have, the fans, so I have a little bit of knowledge about their franchise and organization, so I am happy to be picked by Nashville of course and I am just glad I got a chance to be drafted. 
 
Q.   This really for both players could you guys just describe your own playing styles a little bit and your own words?
 
KEVIN KLEIN: I am two-way defensemen, I think I skate pretty well.  I need to add a little bit of size but I think I can benefit the team.  
 
KONSTANTIN GLAZACHEV:  I am a very skilled player, play very well all-around the net and I am a scorer.  
 
Q.  Konstantin, what are your plans for next year? 
 
KONSTANTIN GLAZACHEV: I would like to play in Russia (INAUDIBLE) level.
