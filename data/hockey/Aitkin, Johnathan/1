Well, I played against Kyle Mack Claire and he was a great person to and make maybe to have a channels top play with him in the future would be an honor and Ray Bourque.  I've watched Ray Bourque my whole childhood and I'm pretty impressed with his work ethic and level of skill, so, it's a great act to follow. 
 
I had a really good interview with them yesterday afternoon and, you know, they're doing really well.  All my interviews went really well ^ except for Boston and it's real, including Boston and it is really great to be here.
