  STU BICKEL:   I played a little bit when I was younger, and then a little bit in Junior Hockey.   But just for part of my first season in Junior Hockey.  
   
 Q.   When you lose a guy like Prust before a game, it just means that everybody has to do whatever it takes?  
STU BICKEL:   Yeah, I mean, like I said before, I'm not going to comment on tonight and the lineup and things like that.   You guys can ask Torts questions about that.   
But, sure, it's important for everybody to elevate their game.
