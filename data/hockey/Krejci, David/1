THE MODERATOR: Questions for David.
Q. Bruce was saying earlier that he thinks your line is going to have to make some adjustments, maybe change the way you're playing the game a little bit.  What do you think you guys might have to do to get a bit more offensive production going?
DAVID KREJCI: Yeah, I think the effort's there every single time.  I don't think we worked as a unit together.  I wasn't really happy about the way we played last game.  We need to talk about it, keep talking about it.  Talk is cheap at this time of the year, so...
We just got to look at ourselves in the mirrors and do the things that we talk about doing.
Q. David, in the past you've played through some pretty tough injuries.  What is it about this time of the year that guys want to do that?
DAVID KREJCI: That's got to be an easy answer.  You play for something that you dream of as a kid.  You have the opportunity to, you know, do that (indiscernible).
There's not many injuries that is going to stop you from trying to accomplish what you want to accomplish.
Q. If you should be without both Griz and Z tomorrow night, you've seen during the year you've been able to overcome those injuries, can the group collectively elevate at this time of year when everybody is playing for the Stanley Cup?
DAVID KREJCI: Yeah, I think it maybe help a little that we had lots of key injuries throughout the season.  Other guys had to step up and play more minutes.  We would love to have Griz and Z back, not sure what the status is, but if not there are other guys that can step up their game.  They've done it before.  It shouldn't be anything (indiscernible).
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, David.
