  KASPARS DAUGAVINS:   It doesn't look pretty when somebody is hurt out there and battling through, which is good for us, good for our team, a guy like him made a great couple plays there on one leg, but it's never pretty to watch from the top, somebody getting hurt.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts about coming back in the lineup now?   
KASPARS DAUGAVINS:   If I go in, I'm excited.   I'll be ready to play, and this is what you want to do, right, play instead of watch.   It's been a long time, but I'm excited if I go in.  
   
 Q.   How hard has it been to keep yourself getting ready without game action since Game 1?  
KASPARS DAUGAVINS:   Well, it's not that hard.   Obviously we have extra guys here so we all work hard, and this is what we do.   We're professionals.   We're in a position where you might be going in any time, so you have to be ready and get some bike rides, some skates, and you're good to go.  
   
 Q.   Obviously a possible opportunity excites you, you lose Gregory, but have you thought about it?   
KASPARS DAUGAVINS:   Well, just have to play hockey.   If I go in, no matter where they put me, I'm going to try to do best for the team and try to do whatever coach tells me to do and play to the best of my ability and hopefully score some goals and make some big plays on defense.   It's just a hockey game, and you can't really tell what's going to happen.
