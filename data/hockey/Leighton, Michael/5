 Q. Michael, it seemed to be a different game out there for both goalies tonight. How did it go for you? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: Yeah, it was a little bit more defensive game than it was last time. It's probably a more realistic game than the last one. The last one was pretty wide open. 

 Q. How tough is this situation you guys now face? I know the odds are stacked against it. The confidence level now? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: They won their home games. And that's what we have to do. We have to go back home and win our home games, and we'll come back here and go again. But we've been playing good at home. Hopefully that will give us a little boost. 

 Q. What about the Eager shot? What happened there? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: I think we had a turnover at the blue line, and he used the D as a screen and made a good shot. 

 Q. Were you screened at all on that shot? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: Yes, I didn't see him release the puck. Obviously, I seen it when it went through my D man. That's not saying he's an Alex Ovechkin. That's how he scores a lot of his goals. He drags it and uses the D as a screen. 

 Q. That's obviously a tough thing. You pulled it together. Was it a difficult thing to do? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: It was just tough giving up two goals that quick. We thought we played well in the first. Boom, they scored a good goal. And we gave up one right away. It kind of took the wind out of our sail a little bit. 
 But we came out the third period and we played, I think, the third period the way we can. At least that's a positive. We're going back home. I think we played a good third period. 

 Q. How big of a difference do you think the Wachovia Center will be? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: It's definitely going to be a difference, you know. We've obviously done well at home. We're looking forward to being back home. 

 Q. Michael, do you feel this was a bounceback game for you confidence-wise? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: I didn't give up five and didn't get pulled, yeah. But we didn't win. Obviously, I'm not too happy. 

 Q. (Question off Microphone).
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: We're still confident. Like I said, we played the third period like we should. We dominated the third period, and we just couldn't get a bounce and get a goal. 
 So we put 60 minutes together, we can beat any team. We're going back home and looking forward to it. 

 Q. Michael, how frustrating -- a couple bounces here you could be up 2-0 this Series or a split. How frustrating is that? 
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: It's frustrating. We know the first game we didn't play our best hockey. Tonight we played good, but third period was our best period. We just need to carry that over. 

 Q. (Question off Microphone).
 MICHAEL LEIGHTON: Obviously, a big-name guy. He was the first goalie coach I had in pro hockey. I learned a few things from him, and it just carried over.
