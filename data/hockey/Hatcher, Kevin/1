Q.  Do you have a favorite player? 
 
KEVIN HATCHER: Yeah. I mean, I always liked a guy that played quite a few years.  Bobby Orr was a player that I really think was a hero.  As far as now, a favorite player -- it is kind of hard to have a favorite player because you play against them and, you know, they are all great. 
 

Q.  How frustrating has it been this season?
 
KEVIN HATCHER: I have never experienced anything like this.  It is something nobody is really especially enjoying themselves right now.  I think as a teammate we got to fight through.  I have seen a lot of good things happening in the last couple of weeks, but we are still unable to win, and that -- bottom line is you got to win. We don't like the position we are in right now.
