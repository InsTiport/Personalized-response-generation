COACH HAKSTOL:   Our guys will be down in a few minutes.   As you might imagine, it's a tough time for our group in the locker room, especially a group of seniors that for four years have led our program and for many of them maybe done it from unexpected circumstances.   
I'll let the guys have a seat here.   No one better than our captain and our leader in Steph Pattyn through the past four years.   As you all might imagine, I've said it before, because I've been in the situation, it's impossible to put perspective on a season.   So I won't try and do that.  
I'll be happy to answer any questions about the hockey game tonight and do it as specifically as we can.   So let's go ahead and do that.   
MODERATOR:   Questions for the players.   
   
 Q.   Troy, could you take us through your goal, please.   
TROY STECHER:   Down on the penalty kill, down 4‑1, needed a goal, so I pressed up ice.   Lucky bounce I got, and hopefully we try to build off that.   Can't really put it into words.   It was just a lucky bounce.  
   
 Q.   Luke, can you talk about the second period a little bit, and just what your thoughts were to play as well as your team did to get that goal and still wind up down by 3 when you go into the locker room there?  
LUKE JOHNSON:   I thought it was a step forward for us, obviously, with a slow start we had, it was a step in the right direction.   I thought we played to our strengths in that period, and even going into the third we weren't feeling down on ourselves or anything.   
We were confident and just step in the right direction for us, so...  
   
 Q.   Stephane, can you take us through that penalty late in the game, what happened?  
STEPHANE PATTYN:   No, that's okay.   
   
 Q.   Troy, second period, what's going through everyone's heads when you guys do put that strong push on and then they come down and score those two goals?  
TROY STECHER:   We've kind of been the same team all year, led by our seniors, obviously.   Never had any doubt in our minds or any quitting.   It's just a game of hockey.   Times you're going to get presses, we're going to get presses, and we need to understand that was their momentum and it was our turn to counteract that.   
We knew we were doing the things the right way and we need to continue to our strengths and good things were going to happen.  
MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach.   
   
 Q.   Obviously special teams had a huge impact in this game.   But until the frantic finish, if you will, was there anything that they brought to you, what they did best that was maybe difficult to figure out in the game, because it's the third period?  
COACH HAKSTOL:   No, I thought overall I liked 50 minutes of our game.   I didn't think we managed the puck very well in the first eight to ten minutes of the game.   Believe me, they played a good game.   They made plays.   I want to make sure I give them a lot of credit.  
They're an outstanding team.   But I always kind of look from within.   And I thought we didn't manage the puck real well in the first few minutes of the game.   We ended a few of our own cycles rather than grinding and making them defend.  
And honestly, you know, I thought bounces were a little hard for us to come by in this hockey game until Troy got the one bounce on the shorthanded goal.   So if I could change one thing, it would be some of our execution in the first few minutes of the game.  
Beyond that, I'm not sure there's a whole lot more that we can ask out of our players tonight.  
   
 Q.   Did you have to kind of rebuild your team after 40 minutes to, having played as well as you did there for stretches in the second, still coming out down by a couple?  
COACH HAKSTOL:   No, I think this group I've used the term "resilient."   No question what our third period would be like, I mean, that's a deep hole to come out of, let's be honest.   But I don't think anybody‑‑ I don't think there was any second thought about it.   Put the next shift together.  
And I thought that's what we did as we rebuilt our first period a little bit.   From there, we didn't need to rebuild anything.   It was just put your next shift together.   And our guys have been resilient and done that all year long.   
I had no question in my mind that we would tie this game up as we got into that last minute, minute and a half.  
   
 Q.   Do you have a take on that penalty late in the game?  
COACH HAKSTOL:   Be specific on it.   What are you looking on for that?   The four‑on‑four penalty?   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) Pattyn, unsportsmanlike conduct?  
COACH HAKSTOL:   I didn't see what happened after.   I was looking and drawing on the board.   But it was a long, drawn‑out thing after the play.   I'm not sure exactly what the official saw, but two guys going at it, two guys go to the box.   
I'm not sure what you're looking for there.   Does that answer it for you?   
   
 Q.   Not to discredit Zane's game, that third goal seemed uncharacteristic for him.   Looked like a long shot.   Did you say anything to him on that, or is that not what you've seen from him this year?  
COACH HAKSTOL:   No, you know what, Zane's been a rock for us all year.   It's what you do when things don't bounce your way, it's how you respond.   Zane's response was excellent.   We got to that point in the game.   Nothing else could go in the net to give us a chance, and from that point I thought our group did what they always do.   They stick together, went out and tried to do the best job they could, and we came up short.  
MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
