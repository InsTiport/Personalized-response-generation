Q.  What do you know about Jack Lemaire; do you remember him from his Montreal days? 
 
P-MARC BOUCHARD:   Yeah, I know he's a good coach.  I know his game-playing is based on defense, but I'm not afraid about that.  I'm pretty anxious to see him.  
 
Q.  You have another young offensive player in Marian Gaborik and he scored a lot goals last year, does that encourage you? 
 
P-MARC BOUCHARD:   Yeah, for sure, when you see an offensive player that was coached by Lemaire and have great success offensively, it's pretty encouraging.  I played during the summertime with Gaborik, and I'm pretty anxious to see him again. 
 
Q.  Do you think that you can continue your offensive style that you've shown in the question beck major junior league when you go to Minnesota?  You are a free-wheeling hockey player, can you continue that as well, with the Wild? 
 
P-MARC BOUCHARD:   Yeah, I think so.  Even if the game plan is more defensive, I think you can go there and have success in offense.
