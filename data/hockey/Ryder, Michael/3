   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Michael Ryder. 

 Q. (Question about getting traffic in front of Luongo.) 
 MICHAEL RYDER: I think it's pretty much on us, making sure we get there, battling to get to the net. Each team has the same rules and they can only do so much to you when you're going to the net. I think it's all more on what we have to do, getting in those areas to get those pucks. 

 Q. A lot has been made this year about him playing deeper in his net. Do you notice that? 
 MICHAEL RYDER: Well, he's a big goalie. He plays a little back. When he's down, he's a big goalie. I think he's done a good job for them. I'm not sure if he's back, I don't know. Don't see him that often. 
 If he's back in his net, we have to try to get some shots, get the puck up on him and get it by him. 

 Q. How anxious are you to get back on the ice again?
 MICHAEL RYDER: Excited, you know. Two days off sometimes is a little different. You get to think about things a little more. We didn't practice two days ago, but yesterday we did. We got our legs going, got into it. 
 Especially after a loss, it was disappointing the way it ended. But we've had two days to regroup and we're ready for tonight, try to get that first goal.
