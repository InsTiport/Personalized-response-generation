  Q. Guy, I know you like to talk about a team game and that everybody contributes, but in a game where Sean Bergenheim wasn't there, you got such contributions from Marty, Vinny and Stamkos, I was just curious what kind of responsibility they put on themselves in this game and how they came through it.   
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: I was expecting a big game from those guys, but what I disagreed -- I disagreed that they didn't have big games in the last games. Looking at the scoreboard, there's more to the game than just scoring goals and having points. They had very good games before. It just wasn't going in for some of them, and for some other guys it was going in.   
 So for me, they just get the result of their previous games' hard work. So I don't think it's an on and off switch. It's something that you build every game, and they got what they deserved.  
  
  Q. You said after last game, if only you could solve the enigma that is Tim Thomas. After tonight, would you say you've solved that or most of it?  
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: I guess we solved it for tonight. But every game is an opportunity for them and for us. And I'm sure he's going to come up big. He said they were going to win for sure. So I'm sure he's going to come up big in the next game. So we're expecting that.   
 And we know he's a very good goaltender. So today is today. But the next day is going to be another story that we have to figure him out.  
  
  Q. Claude Julien seemed pretty unhappy with the calls tonight. In reference to what you said today, just your reaction to that? He seemed to think maybe there was a connection.   
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: Well, first of all, I was asked that. I didn't bring it up myself. So I was asked. And people put numbers in front of me.   
 And those are the facts, the numbers. If you're asking me, power plays are 5-4 for them tonight. And they were 3-0 for them the start of the game in the first period, and it was 4-1 for them before we got our other power play. So I don't know who got the advantage today. We got less power plays than them.  
  
  Q. What was the difference on the power plays for you tonight?  
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: First of all, more poise. The last two games, one of our power plays had a lot of poise and the other one didn't. And I think today both power plays had a lot more poise. And we got the results out of the poise that we had with the puck, managing it a lot better.  
  
  Q. Could you talk a little bit about the development of Teddy Purcell. He says when he first got here that maybe he didn't quite understand the intensity it took.   
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: No, he didn't. He didn't. But you know what, that's the beauty of this game. And working, I think, with individuals, individuals figuring out with great leaders around him, I think he saw Vinny and Marty, just like Stammer figured it out also coming in, he's a great hardworking guy, when you see those guys and what they go through and how hard they train and how much they pay the price on the ice every night, you know, you gotta learn. And I think Teddy's certainly one of those guys that's learned a lot this year.  
 He's put a lot of effort into it. It's not something that just happened. He's worked really hard at it. He's been through a lot. We sat him one time in the stands. After that, had a little tendency to understand faster.   
 But we always knew he had the skill and always believed that he was a really good player. And I think he didn't know how good he was.   
 So I think when he figured that out, he started to control the puck a lot better. He started to figure out that he's got a lot more speed than he thought. And then he's six-foot something, and he can certainly manage himself on the ice against the big boys.   
 And certainly I'm part of a group of people that's very proud of him right now.  
  
  Q. What's your assessment of the way Roloson played tonight?  
 COACH GUY BOUCHER: We won. That's all. That's what we're asking. We're asking him for a chance to win, and that's what we got.
