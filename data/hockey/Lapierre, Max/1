   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Max. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MAXIM LAPIERRE: I think the whole team, everybody did great last night. We would not have the chance to score that goal unless everybody played that way. 

 Q. Can you almost taste it or are you trying not to think too much?
 MAXIM LAPIERRE: It's going to be hard. Boston is going to come really hard at home and we're going to have to be ready for a big challenge. 

 Q. Too much time to think about it?
 MAXIM LAPIERRE: It's exciting. It's good for us. We need a little rest. Going to give us a chance to come out hard. 

 Q. What are you going to do different this time in Boston?
 MAXIM LAPIERRE: Play the same way we did last night. We were patient, stuck with the game plan, we were confident. That's what we're going to do.
