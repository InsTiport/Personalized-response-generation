 THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Henrik and Ryan, you guys have talked about how you played pretty well, but you haven't got a lot of points. Did it feel good for you and Dany to produce offensively? 
 HENRIK SEDIN: Yeah. I mean, it's good to score goals and produce. That's tough to do in the playoffs. I think a lot of games we played well, we had our chances. But pucks haven't gone our way. Tonight we started out being minus one after the first two. That's a tough start. But we battled back. 
 RYAN KESLER: You know, those guys always lead by example. They were playing well for us, they just weren't getting the bounces. It all evens out in the end. I couldn't be more happy for Hank to score that goal. He's been working hard, doing all the right things. For him to finally get one, it's good. 

 Q. Max, talk about your line's contribution. 
 MAX LAPIERRE: Yeah, I think those two lines are huge for us every night. It's fun that we're contributing tonight. We tried to keep it simple: put the puck deep, cycle the puck. That was a big goal. 
 HENRIK SEDIN: It gives us huge momentums in games where we can throw those guys on the ice, they're buzzing around. For them to get a goal tonight, playing the way they did, it's great to watch. 
 I mean, it's guys that work extremely hard, so fun to watch. 
 RYAN KESLER: Yeah, those guys were unbelievable tonight. When you can throw that line out there and they play in the offensive zone all night, that wears the D down, that makes them really, really hard to play against. 
 Those guys were great all night tonight. It's been one of the best games I've seen that line play. 

 Q. Max, on your goal, it came early in the second after San Jose scored. Did you feel that was a particularly important time to score from a momentum standpoint? 
 MAX LAPIERRE: I think every line is thinking that way. We want to stick with the game plan, wait for our chances to have a goal. It was a great play by my winger, so I just have to tip it in. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 RYAN KESLER: I just think we finally found our legs. We were a little rusty in the first period. I thought we played well, but I think second and third period we found that extra gear and we continued. We forced them and we put a lot of pucks in the net. We generated most of the offense. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 HENRIK SEDIN: We rarely read the newspapers or watch the hockey coverage on TV. I mean, we come to the rink. We know when we're not playing well. We don't have to hear that from anyone else. There have been games where we haven't been happy with our performance. There's been other games where we've been happy with the way we played. 
 Still, a few of those games we've ended up being minus a lot in the game. That doesn't help in the coverage. But, like I said, we're a group that doesn't really get bothered by that stuff. Everyone has been positive in the room. That's been helpful. 

 Q. Ryan, what have you heard? 
 RYAN KESLER: To be honest, I think we're all used to it. We're a close-knit group in there. We have each other's back. No one plays a great 82 games. It's pretty much impossible. 
 You know, playoff, for Hank's defense, he's been playing really well. I think some of that negative energy has been directly wrong at him obviously. They're here to produce. Sometimes the puck doesn't go in the net. I've gone through stretches, too. I've had that negative energy drawn at me, too. 
 I was really happy to see him get that one. You know, he played extremely well for us tonight and he won us the game. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 RYAN KESLER: Yeah, I think so. Obviously, there was an unlucky goal there at the end of the first. You know, we didn't play our best, but we still generated chances. We still threw a lot of pucks at net. That's motivating when you don't play your best and you're still getting chances like that. 
 We just fed off that. We continued to get better. I thought as the game went on, we continued to get better and better. It's a good sign. We need to keep getting better. 

 Q. Henrik, you haven't missed many games. How long have you played over the years through injury and when you're not 100%? Do you let it affect your standards? 
 HENRIK SEDIN: Well, I can't really remember all those games. But it hasn't been too many times. Of course, it's not nice when you're not feeling 100%. That happens to everyone. It's a tough sport, and that's what you have to battle through. 
 You still have to have high standards. I mean, otherwise, if the other guy plays 80% or 90%, he might as well sit in the box. My thing, if you're out on the ice, you should be a 100%. 

 Q. You are not the schedule makers, but you have to wait till Wednesday to play another game. Is that in your favor? 
 HENRIK SEDIN: I don't think it matters. There's been a lot of talk about sitting and waiting or playing every second night throughout the whole playoffs. You look at Detroit. They had a lot of time off before their second round. They lost three straight to start the series. 
 We're professional hockey players. We prepare the same way if we play one game in 10 days or two in three nights. It's not going to change. 

 Q. Is it an advantage for the home team, though? 
 MAX LAPIERRE: Every game is the same. You just have to find a way to find a way and get ready. Doesn't matter if you play one every 10 days or one every night.
