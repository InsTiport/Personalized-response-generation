Q. In the scouting report, the words they used to describe you were,
"Intense" and, "Punishing." Is that true?

DAVID HALE: I hope so, yeah.

Q. The Devils have a recent history of taking some gems late in the first round and
stepping in and contributing pretty early in their careers. Are you expecting to --

DAVID HALE: Actually, I'm looking forward to my career at North Dakota. I have a goal
to get a degree, hopefully, in Business, but I'm not sure yet.

Q. You're going to a team that has developed a reputation for big, tough defense. A guy
like Scott Stevens, obviously, is he kind of a role model of yours?

DAVID HALE: Yeah, definitely. I loved watching him play in the playoffs. I love his
style. He's a huge role model for me, yep.

Q. What about getting to work with Larry Robinson?

DAVID HALE: What about it? Oh, I definitely look forward to it. Larry Robinson seems
like a great coach. I'm sure he can bring out the best in me. So I'm definitely looking
forward to it once the time comes.
