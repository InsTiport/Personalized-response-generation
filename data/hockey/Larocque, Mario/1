Yeah, I saw Tampa Bay yesterday and it was a very good interview.  She said, we hope you will be there at the 16, and I was there, so they drafted me.

If I will be there in Montreal, I think they will draft me, but I was gone 16, so they couldn't. 

Well, I don't care.  I don't care.  I like Tampa Bay, and I would go outside, not play hometown.

Yeah, I want, but I don't care going in Tampa Bay.

Not next year, I don't know.

Next year or? --

Oh, no, no, no, I never said that.

I don't think next year, but in two years, yes.

I just have to lose pounds and after that I will be okay.

No, just take ten pounds this year and the other year ten others, so after that I will be 190.  It will be okay.

Yeah, I like that.  I like to play hard.

I can play defensive.  I play offensive.  I can play on the defense play, power play.  I can hit, I can do -- I am, yeah, two-way player.

In the junior league, yeah.  I was drafted in first round last year, and I played this year.

Yeah, rookie, but I got a lot of ice, so I could do what I want to.

Maybe 18, 19.


Q.  19? 

Not this year, but at the end of the season and some here, and I went to someplace to do something and --

No, I can't because -- yeah, because I'm good.  I can state all that.  I'm tall, but physically I'm not too big.

But I -- if I lose ten pounds this summer, I could.

It's a good place.  I've got to work hard and in two years do --

No, it's just nothing -- just I mean, I would say just -- improve a little bit on each part of the game.

I think, yeah.
