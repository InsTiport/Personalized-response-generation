Q.  I just want to ask you a couple questions about the Olympics, how you feel about your chances. 

SAMI KAPANEN:  Well, obviously, we're not the favorite team, but there's five, six teams lucky to make it through the qualifying round, they having a solid offense.  It's a matter of time, whoever gets hot.  Good goaltending, special teams, is having a shot to win whole thing.  Obviously, I think Canada, Czechs, US.  We're doing the best we can.  We're having a chance.


Q.  Are you looking forward to the experience?

SAMI KAPANEN:  I'm looking forward.  It's only once in four years.  It's making the season quite hectic, playing every other day, having the All-Star Game.  I just played West Coast Canada, four, five games, now playing back here.  Going back for one game.  Then coming back for Anaheim, San  Jose.  That means a lot of travel.  It's once in a lifetime, so that's all right.
