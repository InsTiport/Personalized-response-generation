   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Patrice Bergeron. 

 Q. How do you slow down their offense?
 PATRICE BERGERON: I think it's about playing our system, staying tight, obviously not giving them time. When they do have space and time, they're a great team, also great players to find their teammates on the ice. 

 Q. How are your nerves right now? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: Well, obviously they're there. But I think it's a good thing. I mean, it's just normal. 

 Q. Two really good goaltenders. Do you feel like you got the better one? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: Yeah. I mean, we're very confident in Timmy. We know he can do the job. At the same time, you know, they're both great goaltenders. We're going to have to make sure we have a lot of traffic in front of Luongo. 

 Q. Is the anticipation different for this game? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: It could be similar. We're in Vancouver. There's a lot of hype, a lot of media attention for the finals. Same things with the Olympics. Yeah, I think it's similar. You just got to be in your own bubble and worry about yourself, take it a game at a time. 

 Q. How were you able to spend last night? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: We were as a team for a bit and then we went on our own for dinner. That was it. Just try to relax, hang out, make sure you're ready for today.

 Q. First couple of series was all about redemption. Do you still feel there's redemption to be done here? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: I mean, I think it's about making sure we're ready and we're taking it a game at a time. I think we have a goal in mind. Obviously it's four wins, and it starts with one. 
 We have Vancouver in front of us. 

 Q. Do you need the disciplined effort you got in Game 7 against the Lightning? 
 PATRICE BERGERON: For sure, I think that's going to be the main key, discipline. Especially against a team like Vancouver, they have a lot of firepower, a lot of offense. 
 Yeah, it's going to be important. 

 Q. Do you expect you'll have to weather a storm at the beginning?
 PATRICE BERGERON: I expect them to come out hard. They've always done that at home, the games I've watched. 
 Obviously, like us, they'll have all the excitement, the whole city on their side. We're going to have to make sure we're ready to weather the storm. 

 Q. As a Cup first-timer, are you starting to feel the nerves as we get closer to game time?
 PATRICE BERGERON: Yeah. I think it's a good thing. You have to make sure you use it to help you. 
 But, yeah, I'd be lying if I said there's no nerves right now.
