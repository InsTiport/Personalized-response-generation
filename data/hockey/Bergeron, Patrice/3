  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
PATRICE BERGERON:   Exactly.   I didn't know.   But it's good to hear. 

Q.   Having skated with Tyler for a long time, you know him.   How do you feel he played last night? 
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, no, I thought he was skating really well.   Had some great looks, especially in overtime.   He had some very good chances. 
When he's on his game, when he uses his speed like he did last night, he's really tough to defend. 

Q.   Thoughts on the Blackhawks, after not having seen them for a while. 
PATRICE BERGERON:   I guess it's what we were expecting.   Tough to get to the net.   Good transition game, a lot of speed, a lot of skills up front. 
We know that.   They're definitely a great team.   That's the reason why they're here. 

Q.   Are you able to appreciate how good a hockey game that was?
PATRICE BERGERON:   Probably not like a fan.   It was hard, physical, clean.   Like I said, battling for loose pucks.   It's hard to play in those situations, but fun to play in those games. 

Q.   If Nathan is out, what kind of an effect do you think it would have on your team?
PATRICE BERGERON:   I mean, he's definitely a big part of our team.   But we'll see.   Like I said, I don't know what's going on. 
Hopefully he's fine.
