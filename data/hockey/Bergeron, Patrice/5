  Pittsburgh   1, 2 OT 
   
 Q.   A rough night in the face‑off circle for you.   Was it difficult to envision a win the way the regulation time went?   You guys were much better in the OT.   What went on with that?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I mean, we found a way, I guess.   That's the only way you've got to look at it.   It wasn't necessarily our best effort in the first 60.   But I thought we regrouped well in overtime and we had some really good chances in the first overtime, and we kept battling and we said that we have to find a way somehow, and we did in the second overtime.   
   
 Q.   Almost 32 minutes of ice time for you.   Are you tired?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, pretty tired, but it's rewarding when you get the result.   We have tomorrow to rest, and we've just got to think about Game 4 after that.   But we've got to rest tonight and tomorrow.   But I thought it was a big effort by both teams.   It was really a hard‑fought game, and we found a way.   
   
 Q.   Just if you could take us through the overtime goal.   It seems almost natural Marchand to Bergeron?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, it was first of all a great play by Jags to take that puck on the wall there and just fighting and getting the loose puck to Marsh, and we do that chemistry where we know where we're going on the ice.   I knew he was going to try to find me there if I was driving the net, and I just went to the net and tried to have my stick on the ice, and he found me.   
   
 Q.   Just to go back to the first part of that goal and like you were talking about with Jagr, how impressive is it to see a 41‑year‑old guy come up in a 95‑minute game and make a play like that?   He seemed to have a lot of energy and playing his best in that second overtime.   
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I think he's got that experience, I guess, to always be at the right place on the ice, and on that play it's just a perfect example that he's buying in and he wants to help in any way he can, and that play right there, we don't get a goal if he doesn't make that play.   
   
 Q.   Tuukka's performance?   He was fantastic in net.   
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, he was great.   Again, we should say he's been great all Playoffs, and he's really given us the saves that we need and the energy, the momentum that we need in order to do the job in front of him.   They had some really good looks that we should have done a better job defensively, and he bailed us out.  
   
 Q.   You've obviously played overtime times before.   Can you put into words how it feels physically at this point?   Is it the legs?   Is it the back?   Is it the dehydration?   Is it all of the above?   Can you put that into words for us?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I think it's a little bit of everything.   It's also mental.   You've got to stay sharp and find a way, but I think it's all in your head.   As long as you don't feel tired in your head, your legs are fine.   But you're right, your body is cramping up and you've just got to find a way, just keep battling, because I think everyone is in the same situation.   But obviously as it goes on, the more cramps you get, I guess.  
   
 Q.   Is this the most weathered your face has looked in a while?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I guess, but it's all good.   We go in there, we're all buying in for a team, that's fine.   
   
 Q.   How big was the penalty kill tonight and you guys go 6 for 6 and you got a lot of momentum?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, it was huge.   We know the offense they have and the firepower and the plays they make, and you've really got to‑‑ it's a five‑man unit I should say with Tuukks in net on the ice, on the PK and we were really good to make sure we had our heads on a swivel and we were talking a lot, but definitely the penalty kill was huge tonight.   
   
 Q.   We've seen this team rally around guys that are injured.   Campbell tonight.   How did that play out?   
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, it was a huge play by him.   Again, we're talking about details, we're talking about little things that goes a long way, and that block was super.   That's the way he is.   He sacrifices the body always for the team, for the better of the team.   Obviously we tried to rally behind that and do it for him because he's a big part of our team on and off the ice.   It was great, but at the same time we‑‑ it was a tough game, we've got to make sure we're ready for game 4.   
   
 Q.   Jaromir Jagr set up your goal with some good work among the boards.   He's been known forever as a skill guy.   Does that kind of illustrate what his time here has been like and what you guys have come to expect from him?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I think it just explains that everyone is buying in, everyone is doing everything in order to get the success and to get the wins, and it doesn't matter what it is and who it is, and Jags is a perfect example.   He's pretty much a legend, he's a guy that's going to be in the Hall of Fame at some point, and he's doing the little thing right there just to fight for the puck, and you notice that as a teammate, and it goes a long way, as I said, and we all need to do that.   
   
 Q.   Do you have the impression at all that you took the Penguins' kind of best punch tonight and still came out on top?   To what extent do you think this can give you some kind of mental advantage going forward?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Well, I really believe that Pittsburgh has been through it before.   They have the experience, so we know it's not over.   We've really got to make sure we're even better in Game 4 and we know they will.   They're a great team, and we respect them, and we've just got to be in the moment.   We can't get over‑excited both having three wins because you need four.   
   
 Q.   Sticking with the Penguins a little bit, it seems like in three games, guys like Crosby and Malkin would have something on the scoreboard and they haven't.   Does that surprise you that they haven't gotten on the board yet?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Well, I think they're amazing players but we're trying obviously not to just go one guy to defend these guys.   They're really good obviously.   We both have five guys on the ice.   We've got to obviously tie it up in our zone a little bit more, but Tuukka has made some huge saves, also, but it's about everyone buying in.   But like I said, it's three games.   There's a huge one.   It's all about Game 4 now.   That's the way we've approached it all Playoffs and now it's all about that next game.
