   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Patrice.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you have control of the series?   
 PATRICE BERGERON: No, we haven't accomplished anything yet. The last two games have been the way that we wanted to come out and great games, but that being said, we can't get too high and too low in the playoffs, and we've seen that before.   
 It's the same thing here and we are expecting a huge game tomorrow and we want to make sure we're ready.   
  
  Q. You guys were able to establish your game at home how difficult is it to do that on the road?   
 PATRICE BERGERON: Yeah, it's huge, too, we need to do that, make sure we're bringing the same energy, the same emotion that we've given at home. And obviously, it's going to be a tough game. We know that Vancouver's crowd is real loud, and it's tough to play against. But that being said, we need to make sure we're able to do that.   
  
  Q. Question about Rich and Chris in particular, looking at their numbers through the playoffs as opposed to when they joined you in the regular season, it feels like they've hit their stride. Have those two guys been absorbed into the system?   
 PATRICE BERGERON: Yeah, sure, obviously takes some time to adjust to the system, to a new system in all, but I think they've done a great job right away. They fit in right away. And Chris in the playoffs has been awesome with his game and he's been contributing offensively.   
 And Rich has been filling in the spots for who we are missing. Now we are missing a key guy like Nathan, but he filled in and he's been great. Those two players have been huge for your team right now.
