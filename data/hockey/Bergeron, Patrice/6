 Q.   Can you just talk about how big a lift that Marchand goal was at the end of the first period after you had just given up one?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I think it was good to get that shift right away where we scored, because obviously their goal probably gave them some momentum on the bench, so we had to come back with a strong shift at the end there.  
   
 Q.   What do you think, time again we've talked about how you guys are able to roll all four lines but tonight was just another example of it.   How important was it to get the win in this game?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, no, I think it's very important.   I mean, we've been relying on four lines all year and throughout the Playoffs and the same thing right here, they have a lot of depth as well.   
So we need to make sure we're ready for what we're up against.   And every line is responsible and talks a lot on the ice to communicate.   And they're establishing‑ we all have some good chemistries, we're linemates, so we've gotta keep that going.  
   
 Q.   The passing seemed to be on tonight, is that because of the sharpness and focus of the team here?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yes, I think so.   I think everybody contributed, and everyone was on their game.   And we win the puck well and crisp and sharp and we need that, and they're obviously a great team.   If we don't to that, they're going to burn us.   So tonight was the way that we need to play in order to have success.  
   
 Q.   What do you expect from these guys in Game 3, given that they've been in this situation before?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, they have a lot of experience.   They're a team that we know that they're going to try to bounce back and we need to make sure we're ready.   They're a really good team, we respect them and we know it's not over.   We need to make sure we keep it going and stay in the game and take it by moment.   And we've been doing it so far, and it's all about Game 3 now.  
   
 Q.   It looked like Jagr from the press box might have been in higher gear than he's been in.   Did you feel the same thing?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, I felt the same way.   He really was on his game.   I tried to get open, and he was finding me and March and made a huge play on that goal, actually late in that first, on the wall, and it goes a long ways.   It's a little detail but it goes a long way, and I thought he was awesome for us tonight.  
   
 Q.   I know you take so much pride in the defensive aspect of the game but how much was it literally every forward helping out on the ice tonight?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   It's very important.   Something we talked about.   Like I said, their depth up front is something special, so we need to make sure we're always ready and we are always talking.   And it's a five‑man unit on the ice, and it's not just about one guy.   We all need to, I guess, to talk and to communicate and collapse in the slot.   And tonight that was a good example of that.  
   
 Q.   Just a continuation of Steve's question from earlier, Marchand actually had two really big significant goals for you tonight.   What did you see in his game?   He of course had the opening goal and the answered goal?  
PATRICE BERGERON:   Yeah, he had, I guess, a jump on his step tonight, and when you see that you can tell the way he shoots the puck, also.   He finds every loose puck, and that first goal was obviously huge.   They had a good shift before that break‑away, and it was important to get that first one.   And carried that along with that second goal, which was a huge goal again to keep going.   
So I thought he was great.   He was turning the puck well and he was first on pucks and finding loose pucks all the time, and that's what you need from a guy like him.
