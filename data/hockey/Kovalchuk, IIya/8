Q.  Ilja, most people felt the last couple of days that  Atlanta would take you, but until they called your name, was there any question in your mind, any uncertainty about it?

ILJA KOVALCHUK: Yeah.  For sure.  It was thrilling anyhow.  We was worried a little bit, but like you knew that but for sure.  There was still questions, but you knew, you really weren't worried about it, but it was thrilling anyhow.


Q.  You talked about this a little bit yesterday, about playing for a relatively young team.  Can you just address that?  How you approach it playing for a third-year team playing, for a third-year draft choice that's been struggling.  How he looks at that as opposed to if he had been joining a more established team.

ILJA KOVALCHUK: I understand it's a young team, but I will do the best I can to make this team a lot better, a lot stronger and I understand and I want to do that. 


Q.  Do you expect to be on the opening-day roster?

ILJA KOVALCHUK: There are a lot of great players who want to be on the roster, but I will do whatever I can to be there.  I really want it. 


Q.  Was that your parents there with you?

ILJA KOVALCHUK: Yeah.  My mother, my mother and my sister are here.
