TORONTO   3
  DETROIT - 2

Q.   What was it like when you guys first walked into the big stadium in front of the fans?
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   It was awesome.   Didn't really know what to expect, how many people are going to be there.   And it's pretty cool to see the amount of both teams' fans.   And I know a lot of us have family members and friends in town, so there's a special moment for sure.

Q.   Can you talk about the roles of the fans in today's atmosphere?
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Well, definitely it was something really special that as hockey players you're never going to forget that, and having 105,000 people screaming and yelling for us is really amazing.

Q.   What was the visibility like with the snow coming down?
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   First there was actually‑‑ I thought it was pretty bad.   And I'm sure you guys could see, it was really slow, but I thought the pace picked up in the second and third, and the second period was probably the worst with the wind coming at us but the snow wasn't as bad.

Q.   Tyler, I guess this is a question‑‑ it could be applied to JVR as well‑‑ what was the hand‑eye coordination like to get the goals you did in the conditions you played in?
TYLER BOZAK:   We knew going in there wouldn't be too many goals, pretty snowy, pretty fast.   Did a good job keeping it clean.   But JVR made a great play on his, and I was lucky enough to get a stick on it and keep it low enough, and lucky enough people went into us.

Q.   Jonathan, we saw you on the NBC broadcast in the second period stick your hand in the back of your pants.   Did you have any warmers down there?   How were you keeping warm?
JONATHAN BERNIER:   Yeah, actually my blockers really had trouble keeping warm.   My trainer was giving me hot packs, and I put it in my pants as well to try and keep it warm.

Q.   Tyler, is it overwhelming a little bit to be out for so long and then suddenly come back and right away you have a game like this?
TYLER BOZAK:   Yeah, I think that I was able to play one game before, it was huge for me.   Definitely would have been crazy, just coming back into this game.   So I think being able to play the one before really helped me a lot. 
And, I don't know, it was pretty fun, though, I think.   Everyone had a good time.   Like he said, we're going to remember this one forever.

Q.   Jonathan, what made you decide to go with the (indiscernible)?   Did you try it out first?
JONATHAN BERNIER:   I did try it out in practice the day before, and I felt obviously with the holes that we get on the helmet is actually keeping me warm.   And I thought it looked good, so...

Q.   Jonathan, did the shootout experience against this team ten days ago help you here today?   Did it have any bearing?
JONATHAN BERNIER:   You know, I try to play the odds with the ice.   The advantage probably as a goalie, I try to take away the angles and be more aggressive a little bit and hopefully they go for the D team (indiscernible), and that's what happened and won the shootout.

Q.   Either one of you, or both of you preferably.   Without oversimplifying it, obviously really a special event you've gone through, but talk about what winning it means.   Because obviously if you lose this, you lose with a different feeling, but winning it, you'll probably remember it that much more specially probably?
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   Yes.   It's a tight conference for us.   We haven't been playing our greatest lately, so it was huge two points for our team.   So I think that was the main thing.   We had to take it as a regular game.   Obviously there were some distractions, but we needed these two points back, and we're happy we got them. 

Q.   Jonathan, when this game goes to a shootout like this, a game like this, do the conditions play in your favor, then, that kind of thing?
JONATHAN BERNIER:   I think so.   But didn't look on our side, I guess, scoring two goals.   Scored a big goal and got the game‑‑ we got the two points. 
And obviously, like you just said, coming back and coming into this game and obviously we needed the two points, and kind of hard to stay focused at the same time.   You think it's going to be a fun game, but at the same time for us we wanted to come here and get out of here with two points.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER:   I mean, I was thinking I was going to shoot.   I didn't really want to (indiscernible) the puck on the ice.   I didn't want to have to deal with that. 
Just glad they scored.   I thought maybe I should shoot.   I just tried to come in with a little speed and push them back to the net, and luckily saw an opening and I went in.   That's all.
