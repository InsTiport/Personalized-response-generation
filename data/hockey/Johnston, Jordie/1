Boston College   4
  Ferris State   1

MODERATOR:   We're joined by Ferris State, head coach Bob Daniels and student‑athletes Chad Billins, Jordie Johnston and Taylor Nelson. 
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach. 
COACH DANIELS:   First of all, I want to congratulate Boston College.   What a terrific team they are, obviously.   19 games straight.   And hate to be a victim of that, but I certainly appreciate what a quality opponent they are and what a quality team.   And they're very deserving of a championship and very representative of what college hockey is all about.
In regards to the game, specifically, I thought it was a perfect game for us.   I liked the way it unfolded.   Certainly didn't like‑‑ when they scored early in the first five minutes, I know that if they can get up on you and they get running pretty good, then there's problems. 
But believe it or not, coming out of the first period, when it was 2‑1, I felt pretty good about it.   I felt as though, okay, we can play with these guys, and we're certainly not out of place whatsoever.   And I felt very comfortable after the second.   It was a 2‑1 game.   We're in those all the time.   Seemed to be our kind of hockey. 
And then certainly, even going through the third period, I looked up, okay, we're under seven minutes.   We've got this down to a seven‑minute hockey game.   This is a good spot for us to be in.   And I felt as though we were generating some chances and certainly had some opportunities.
So the goal by Gaudreau, certainly a very good individual effort and a wonderful play on his part.   Was certainly a big‑time goal by a big‑time player. 
But I don't want to shortchange our kids or our players.   I have zero regret about this, other than the fact that I would have liked to obviously had the title for the players.   But I have zero regrets in how they played and how they performed. 
Last but not least, a lot of times after a game like this, you kind of look back and you say, oh, well, so and so didn't really have a‑‑ kind of had an off night or it would've been nice if he was humming.   And truthfully, I felt all our players played great tonight, and I'm exceedingly proud of each of and every one of them.

Q.   Talk about the second period, the two power plays.   That seemed like your opportunity to cash in and you guys couldn't pull it there. 
JORDIE JOHNSTON:   We definitely didn't take advantage of the power plays.   In any game, that's going to kill you.   And it was at a crucial time in the game, too.   Probably would have changed the outcome quite a bit. 
But we did get some pucks to the net.   We made some plays and it just didn't go in.   They're a good team. 
They knew how to get in lanes and they knew how to shut down.   They weren't just an offensive team; they were a defensive team, too.   And they came to play tonight, and we just didn't capitalize. 

Q.   As seniors, can you talk about‑‑ I know this is tough right now, can you talk about what this season has meant to you guys and the Ferris State hockey program?
TAYLOR NELSON:   What a year.   What a year we've had, and I'm extremely proud of every individual in that locker room.   And I can honestly say I can look at each player in that room and know that no one left anything on the table. 
And I think that's what's really special about this team.   All season long, we sacrificed for one another.   We bled for one another.   And as far as what it means to the program, I mean, I think in our minds, it's made history.
And we probably won't see‑‑ well, we most likely won't see what happens because of this, because, you know, we're done now.   But I know that each individual in that room has gained a lot of experience and a lot of valuable experience.   And like I said, I couldn't ask for a better group of guys to play this season with.
CHAD BILLINS:   We're happy with the season.   We're not going to try to hang our heads or anything like that.   Obviously it's a tough loss. 
And BC came to play tonight.   And I think as a team we came to play tonight, too.   We just didn't get the outcome that we wanted.

Q.   You mentioned you move on now.   What a special team it was this year.   Does this have a feeling of one of the teams we've seen in recent years that comes and makes one run and then maybe you don't hear about them again?   Or does this kind of have the feeling that it might be the beginning of something big for Ferris?
JORDIE JOHNSTON:   I don't think so.   There's so much leadership in that room.   I don't see this team being a one‑and‑done kind of thing there.   There's a lot of guys that will step up, even more next year.   I'm sure of it. 
We saw Bonis, how he played this weekend.   He's a machine.   He's going to be unreal for them next year.   And Motte's quite a goalie.   He'll step into Nelly's role pretty well.   They'll be a great team next year.
And that's what we're so proud of is we were able to be on a team that kind of started the ball rolling, I think, for the program, because there's going to be kids that want to come to Ferris now.   And that's something we're really proud of. 
And I think those kids in that locker room are going to make this a special next few years.

Q.   The state of Ferris State hockey moving forward. 
CHAD BILLINS:   I don't think it's going to be a one‑and‑done type of thing.   I think now that the guys have some experience and some confidence, we're honored to be able to be seniors in the dressing room and hopefully taught them, I guess, how to play the game and how to play Bulldog hockey as some people call it.   I think it's a special group of guys in that room, and I think it will keep going when we're gone.

Q.   Chad and Jordie, can you talk about the play of Taylor after the two goals?   The way he played over the second period, seemed to really lift you guys. 
CHAD BILLINS:   Taylor's been a rock back there all year for us.   And he does‑‑ he raises, I don't know, the momentum of the game when he makes a big save like that.   He made a few big saves and really kept us in the game. 
So it's unbelievable to have Taylor back there to make those saves and give us some momentum.
JORDIE JOHNSTON:   You know, even including their first two goals, Nelly played unreal.   He has all year for us.   Those are two pretty legit goals.   And he's always found a way to make a big save at a big time to spark us, and he's done it all year.   And tonight we just didn't pay them back by going down and putting one in the other end.   But, you know, that happens. 
And I just can't say enough about Nelly.   He is one of the biggest factors of this year, and he definitely took us, in the last couple of weekends, he definitely played some of the best hockey I've ever seen him play.   And like Chad said, he was a rock for us all year.

Q.   Taylor, this is now BC's third championship in five years.   Do you guys feel that you left everything out on the ice, and it still wasn't quite good enough.   Is there something beyond just the talent level that they've got, some intangible they have that make them a little tougher to beat? 
TAYLOR NELSON:   I don't know what you want me to say on that.   They're a good team.   There's no ifs ands or buts about it.   They're a good team.   I thought we stacked up well with them.   And like I said, we don't deserve to hang our heads.   They're a great team. 
I don't know what‑‑ I don't know what you want me to say there.   Sorry. 
MODERATOR:   Thank you.   Questions for Coach. 

Q.   Coach, what did you tell your players, especially the seniors, in the locker room right after you guys got done?
COACH DANIELS:   Sure.   If I could just go back a little bit to the one question about the one‑and‑done.   And I think it might even pertain to the three out of five years. 
College hockey really is so hard right now.   There's so many good, quality teams.   And I almost feel like talking about one‑and‑done short changes, what this team's done in the past few years.
I think last year we had a bye in the first round of the Playoffs.   The year before we had a bye.   And we've been a good team for quite a while now.   It's just not on the national scene, maybe.   And that I think speaks to where college hockey is right now. 
I think Boston College is special.   And for them to win three out of five is really‑‑ I mean, that's something.   That says a lot.   I believe Jerry York deserves all the credit for that and his staff.   It's wonderful what they've done.   I think it's somewhat unprecedented.   It's going to be hard to duplicate. 
But for our own selves, I feel we've been pretty good for a while and I think we'll continue to be good.
Now, this is a lot right here, and we'll gladly try to do it again next year.   But it's hard.   It is really a tough‑‑ our conference, just to get out of that, it seems like it's a monumental task.
And at certain times, I get very emotional.   Seems like at the very end of every year I get very emotional.   You get in the locker room, and even the teams that have struggled, everyone goes through the trials and tribulations, just a million things that happen throughout the course of the year.   And you tend to get emotional in the locker room.   And I refused to get emotional‑‑ well, not even refused.   It was hard to get emotional because the kids have taken us to such high for so long, it's almost like it's drained the emotion out of me.
I just told them that I look forward to, I think in 10 years, maybe a reunion at a Hall of Fame induction for this team.

Q.   Same question I had earlier about Taylor giving up the two early goals and really seemed to bear down after that.   Some of your thoughts on his play tonight?
COACH DANIELS:   Those first two goals were great goals.   The one was redirected on the power play.   Our guy was in the shot lane.   I think the shot was probably going wide.   And it was tipped right in front of him.   That was the second goal on the power play.   The first goal, I don't think he had anything to‑‑ like he needed to get settled down.   Those are just good goals.
But then from there, both him and Milner both played exceedingly well, I thought.   We had numerous opportunities.   A few breakaways, a few really good chances.   So I thought he played solid from start to finish.   I don't think there was a goal that went by him that really you could have said wow.   Even the third goal, I believe our defenseman probably got a stick and it redirected on 'em.   So he played a great day and so did their goaltender.
I think if we were to play the Boston College again, though, in another few games, I'd like our chances.   I don't know if we'd beat them, but I certainly thought our guys have nothing to hang their heads.   I thought they played right with them and were very capable of winning a game like that tonight. 

Q.   From what you saw from recent tape as well as what you saw tonight, what made BC's penalty kill so challenging?
COACH DANIELS:   They're so aggressive and they're so quick.   It's kind of a twofold problem for you.   They're able to pressure you, and at times maybe even be a little bit opposition.   Because of their speed, though, they're able to regroup really quickly.   It doesn't give you an awful lot of time to set up.
The other issue you have with them is on any turnover, they're looking to score a goal.   So even though you're on the power play, you've got to have your head up, too, and you're almost back on your heels at times when you're on the power play.

Q.   Do you think it's fair to say that your team gave the best shot they could tonight?
COACH DANIELS:   I think that's very fair.   There's nothing I'm disappointed whatsoever.   And I think that's a testament to Boston College and how good they are.   But that was as good as we can play.   And that's coming from each of the guys that was out there. 

Q.   Can you talk about what the team has meant to you and this year has meant to you?
COACH DANIELS:   Sure.   It's really blazed a trail.   Not only this year but this class will leave with straight winning years, three really great seasons, and the team itself did break some new ground for us.
And I think it will give us confidence moving forward that we can be successful on a national stage, and with that hopefully we'll continue to grow.
The last thing I'd like to say, though, is I'd like to thank the organizing committee.   This is our first Frozen Four.   I'm not sure they're all like this, but I'd be hard pressed to believe they are.   This has been terrific. 
From the moment we touched down till probably the minute we leave, people couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.   And thank you for helping build the memories this weekend.   We greatly appreciate it. 
MODERATOR:   Thank you, Coach.
