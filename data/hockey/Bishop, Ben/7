Tampa Bay   6
  New York   5

Q.   Ben, how stressful have these past two games been?   I'm sure it feels better that you've won them, but just the high‑scoring games, what's that like for you? 
BEN BISHOP:   Tonight was a little different than most postseason, but it helps when you score six, so it makes it a little bit easier on me.

Q.   How do you just stay positive in a game like that? 
BEN BISHOP:   Well, I mean, we had the lead for most of it, so it was kind of easy to stay positive.   Obviously, we were giving those leads up, which isn't good, but I thought we just did a good job.   We never got down.   Every time they came back, we kind of kept pushing.   Even going into overtime there we were pretty confident in the locker room, and obviously, a great shot by Kuch.

Q.   Are you surprised anymore of what Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov have done? 
BEN BISHOP:   We're kind of getting spoiled, kind of getting used to it.   Obviously, the three of them have such good chemistry the way they feed off each other, and it's good that everybody else is getting a chance to see them play on the big stage, because we've kind of been spoiled down here and been able to watch them play all of this year and most of last year.   So there are three great players and you put them together and they're pretty unbelievable.   So, hopefully, they can continue this pace.

Q.   As far as the Rangers, they seemed like they were pinching in on the crease quite a bit tonight.   Is that when they've been the most effective when they've been screening you? 
BEN BISHOP:   They do a pretty good job.   They have some big bodies that get in front.   I have to find a way to find the puck and I have to make some of those saves. 
Penalty kill, we've been doing pretty good all year.   The last two games have been good.   Your goalie has to be your best penalty killer.   So I need to be better on the penalty kill and we'll figure it out.
