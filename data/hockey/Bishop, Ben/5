THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Cedric and Ben. 

Q.   Ben, Jon said he wasn't sure till he spoke to you before the game and looked into your eyes whether you were going to be good to go.   Talk about the process today of getting ready to play, how close maybe it came to you not being able to. 
BEN BISHOP:   Yeah, we talked a few times today.   We made a decision there before the game.   It's going to take a lot not to play in a Stanley Cup Final game personally. 

Q.   Ben, it looked like you labored more in the first period.   As the game went on, you looked more comfortable.   Is that accurate?
BEN BISHOP:   Yeah, it felt the same pretty much the whole game. 

Q.   What is 'it'? 
BEN BISHOP:   I'm not going to get into that. 

Q.   How did you feel you played? 
BEN BISHOP:   I felt good.   The first period, probably a few too many rebounds there.   As the game went on, the guys did a great job of clearing those out. 
As the game went on, I felt better, more comfortable.   Some big blocked shots there at the end.   Just a good team win all around. 
Obviously probably wasn't our best first, but I thought we got better as the game went on. 

Q.   Did you have any doubts as you were playing whether you were feeling well enough to stay in there?
BEN BISHOP:   No. 

Q.   Is this something that you've been told you couldn't damage any further by playing?   Is there a risk of a long‑term problem?
BEN BISHOP:   I don't know.   Personally, I really don't know. 

Q.   Ben, a lot of talk about how well Victor has played through the first part of the series.   Are we just now seeing something that you have seen pretty much all season?
BEN BISHOP:   Absolutely.   I think the last two seasons.   Last year I think he was just as good.   We have quite a few players on our team they probably don't get the recognition they deserve playing in a smaller market. 
But it's fun now that you're going into these playoffs.   A lot of guys are getting recognition they deserve.   We have a lot of good players on this team. 
Victor, probably a guy that could have made that Olympic team.   I think he's showing why. 

Q.   Cedric, can you take us through your goal?
CEDRIC PAQUETTE:   Hedy got the puck at the blueline.   I just go to the net, he give it to me.   Wait until the goalie couldn't see the puck.   I think I had the opening. 

Q.   Cedric, can you talk about Ben's game, what it meant to you guys to have him in there, to see him play the way he did. 
CEDRIC PAQUETTE:   Well, he played well all season.   I think it's no surprise right now.   He held us in the game in the first.   I think he did it all all year. 
BEN BISHOP:   Thanks, Ceddy. 

Q.   Brian Boyle said in training camp he noticed what kind of player you are.   Have you made that your game right from the beginning?
CEDRIC PAQUETTE:   I didn't know if I was going to make the team at the beginning.   I was there to make the team, right? 
I did everything I can to make the team, but wasn't enough.   I think we had a good balance. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
