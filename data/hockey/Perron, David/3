  Q.  Nice to have David Perron from the St. Louis Blues joining us.  Little fatigued are you?   
 DAVID PERRON:  Yeah, of course.  Long day so far.  But it's a great day.   
 It's fun to be here.   
  
  Q.  Did you ever anticipate something like this?  Working your way into the NHL at this stage of your career?  I'm sure a player doesn't really think about it, but when you do get a chance to actually be here, what does it feel like?   
 DAVID PERRON:  Oh, it feels great.  I've looked forward to playing this, even though I was a rookie this year.  I've tried to make my spot on the roster, and even though like yesterday I was able to play with my team.   
 But I'm looking forward to coming back and being part of the team every night.   
  
  Q.  You've had so much success at the Junior level with Lewiston.  What have they had to change within your game?  What's Andy Murray trying to do with you to round you into an NHL player, I guess?   
 DAVID PERRON:  I guess he's working a lot with me defensively.  Probably being consistent every night.  I think that's the toughest thing for a rookie to be consistent every night.  When I'm going to be able to achieve to do that every night, I'm going to be much more dominant out there.   
  
  Q.  But you can slip into some bad habits on Saturday night and have fun with that.  You're not going to feel too much pressure from the coaches.   
 DAVID PERRON:  Exactly.  I think it's going to be for a fan, as players, we're going to try to give a good show.  There's going to be plenty of skills out there.  So we're going to try to win that for our conference.   
  
  Q.  Good stuff.  Enjoy it.  Get some rest beforehand.   
 DAVID PERRON:  Thank you very much.
