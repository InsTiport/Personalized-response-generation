  Q.  What was the difference out there tonight from games one and two for you guys?   
 FRANCOIS BEAUCHEMIN:  Obviously, they came out really hard.  They played physical and I guess our undiscipline cost us a lot of momentum tonight again, and bottom line, they wanted it more than us.   
  
  Q.  What did you think of the offensive line?   
 FRANCOIS BEAUCHEMIN:  I guess they said that he kicked it after it bounced off his skates.  It happens in playoffs, and those things can make a difference in the series.   
  
  Q.  (Question about head injury)?   
 FRANCOIS BEAUCHEMIN:  I didn't see what happened actually.  I was on the bench and I was looking up on the play when he was still in the zone so I didn't see the hit.  I can't really say anything about it.   
  
  Q.  Are you worried that you might (indiscernible)?   
 FRANCOIS BEAUCHEMIN:  We don't want to think about that right now.  We just want to think about what we did wrong tonight and get better for Monday.   
  
  Q.  How much did that overturned goal change your momentum?   
 FRANCOIS BEAUCHEMIN:  Little details happen, and we want to refocus and we got some bad bounce against us and they played real well.  They came out hard.  They came out physical on us, and bottom line, we want to forget about it and get better on Monday.
