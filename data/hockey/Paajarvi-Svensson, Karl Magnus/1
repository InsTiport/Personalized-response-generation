   KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: I don't know, just got shaky and started hugging all the people I knew, and that was very proud moment for me and all my family. I just can't thank all my family for all they have done and all of the people and all of the trainers and all that.  
 Now I'm coming to a club who is very much hockey history with Messier and Gretzky and I'm proud to be a part of that organization. I'm pretty shaky right now.   
  
  Q. How many interviews did you go through and did you get a sense it might be Edmonton?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: Actually not. They held it pretty well for me. I talked to a lot of the clubs and I don't know what to say. They held it pretty well.   
  
  Q. What would you say is your best asset?   
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: I want to make a great impact and a lot of speed and want to drive to the net all the time and want to do -- want to do things with the puck all the time and try to make plays and try to make goals and just be offensive impact for the team, absolutely.   
  
  Q. Who are a couple of Swedish stars that you looked up to growing up that you patterned your game after?   
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: I don't know if I patterned my game after but I sure looked at Forsberg and kind toe nil son and now I'll look at Ovechkin and all that just to see what they can do. But I don't think I patterned myself after a particular person.  
  
  Q. Do you think you're ready for the NHL?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: Yeah, why not? I think I am.   
 But my plan right now is to play with Timra IK next year but you never know. Just going to have to take the talk with Edmonton and see what we go along with, and that's where I'm headed.   
  
  Q. With so many Swedes taken, can you talk about the renaissance that your year has brought to Swedish hockey with all of these players coming to the NHL?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: There's a lot of Swedes right now. I know everybody really well and it's all a great bunch of guys, and I think all of the guys developed a lot, especially in the league lead right now, and I wish them all luck as they really deserve it, and hopefully we can do something well in the NHL.   
  
  Q. Is there an explanation you think for why there's so many this year?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: I don't know really. We have a good age, as I said, and we are pretty successful in the World Juniors right now and hopefully we can take the gold in Saskatoon.   
 But I don't know the reason, maybe it's something in the blood, I don't know.   
  
  Q. Was it hard sitting there watching the names get called and did you think you might get picked a little bit earlier?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: Actually I had no idea, because I didn't know what to expect for the draft. It was just a great moment to see all of the audience and all of the media.   
 But I didn't get to wait that long.   
  
  Q. Were you nervous, anxious?   
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: Yeah, I would lie if I said I wasn't nervous. When I got up, I just got shaky, and I'm just proud to be a part of the Edmonton Oilers for sure.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to be going to a team of such a rich heritage?  
 KARL MAGNUS PAAJARVI-SVENSSON: They have a great hockey history with all of the Cups and autumn of the names with Gretzky and Messier. It means a lot to me to be part of a Canadian team, for sure, just with the audience and all of the media, I feel great to be a part of Edmonton Oilers. I want to do my best for them.
