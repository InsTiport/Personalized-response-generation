Q. How does it feel to be drafted in your hometown?

KRYS KOLANOS: It's an unbelievable feeling. Being here in Calgary with all my fan
support and friends here, I couldn't ask for anything better. It just feels great.

Q. And a great day for you and your teammate, Brooks Orpik. What a special feeling to
be drafted so close together.

KRYS KOLANOS: Yeah, it's an unbelievable feeling. I'm very proud for Brooks to go to
Pittsburgh and myself to Phoenix. I think we were both very deserving of this opportunity,

Q. Tell me your thoughts on having Wayne Gretzky as your boss?

KRYS KOLANOS: Oh, it's unbelievable, you know. It's the Great One. So him being part of

conversations you would have, did you think you'd both go in the first round?

KRYS KOLANOS: It's kind of hard to say back then. As we got closer and closer to it, it
