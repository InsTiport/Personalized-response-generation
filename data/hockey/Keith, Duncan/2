  Anaheim - 3

THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Duncan, Jonathan Toews has this incredible ability to score goals in huge games at big moments.   Have you ever seen anyone or played with anyone like that?   Jonathan, where does that come from? 
DUNCAN KEITH:   Well, I really haven't, actually.   I mean, I think playing with a guy like Johnny, and I don't want to lump them together, but Kaner, as well, there's no two guys I'd rather have on my team coming into a big game. 
They have that ability to rise to the occasion and just find a way no matter what, whether it's just that belief, but always just knowing, you know, they're going to get it done, they're going to find a way. 
I think that rubs off on a lot of guys. 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Well, I think that's definitely high praise.   I think you definitely feed off the confidence that it gives you.   You want to consider yourself that type of player at the end of the day.   But it helps when you're alongside guys that have those same intangibles. 
The guy I'm sitting with right here, Kaner, Sharpie, Hossa, the guys that have been around for years and have had the experience down the stretch in the playoffs, we feed off each other. 
Coming into tonight's game, whether we had a good start, got ourselves in a tough spot, there's always the confidence in the group that someone is going to step up and we're going to find a way to make it a game, give ourselves a chance. 
We got ourselves to the seventh game.   We always say, Anything can happen.   Tonight we came out flying as a team.   We had contributions offensively across the board.   But I'd say it was our best game of the series just continuing with that pressure, knowing they were going to respond, as well. 

Q.   Duncan, I know you and Brent haven't played together in quite a while.   What is it about him, another big goal tonight, what is it about the post‑season that the offense comes to complement the defense so much?
DUNCAN KEITH:   Well, I think a lot of it is just the desire and the will to try and win.   I think teams check so well now that it's important that the defense help out offensively.   Seabs has a great shot.   It's a heavy shot.   We saw that so far in the first three rounds where he can shoot the puck and he can get it through. 
But just like Toews and Kane, he's a big part of this team's success.   He's a big reason why we're going into the Finals.   Like I said, his passion, his commitment, the will to get it done is what stands out. 

Q.   Jonathan, the feeling about getting back to the Finals and the fashion in which you did it, being down in the series, also having to win in this building? 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Yeah, there was no easy games.   There was nothing given to us.   There was no moments in this series where there were any lulls that maybe Anaheim didn't play their best hockey and we got away with it.   We had to earn everything against that team. 
It was an incredible test for both teams.   I think everyone watched some pretty entertaining hockey with the talents, and the offense, going back and forth.   Sometimes it's the goaltending that was unbelievable. 
So, yeah, we're excited.   It's a great feeling to have found a way to close out a series against a team like that.
On top of it, give ourselves a chance to go back to the Stanley Cup Final.   It's a great feeling.   It's a great thing that we're excited about.   We'll definitely enjoy that tonight, enjoy this win.   But it won't be long before we move on.   We'll be ready for the next task here. 

Q.   Jonathan, two months ago Patrick Kane was hurt, you were in a wild card spot, lost a bunch of games to non‑playoff teams.   Was there a doubt that this wasn't going to be the year?
JONATHAN TOEWS:   I don't know.   I don't think so at all.   I mean, I think what this group does incredibly is when things don't look so good day‑to‑day, maybe we're going through a tough, rough couple weeks where we're not scoring goals, or we're on the bubble for a playoff spot, I think we always do a great job of looking at the big picture and realizing the potential of our team. 
We don't need to go on a long stretch of wins, win the Presidents' Trophy, have the regular season of our lives, to have the confidence that we can go the distance in the playoffs.   We know we've just got to get there.   Regardless of who we play in the first round nowadays, it's going to be a tough test.   We believe in ourselves.   We just take it one day at a time. 
I think we have that feeling, we come into a playoff series against a tough team, we have that idea of, Why not us?   We find ways to win. 

Q.   Jonathan, yesterday you said you take Game 7s as challenges to show people what you have as a hockey player.   Did you do that tonight? 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Well, I hope so.   For at least one period.   I think across the group, our leadership group, we kind of want to own up to each other and be accountable to each other.   I think that's what Dunks was talking about a minute ago.   We have a great leadership group that everyone responds to, everyone knows they want to contribute and step up and bring their best game. 
As an individual, that's all you can ask for.   You let the chips fall in the end. 

Q.   Jonathan, it seems like the decision to put you with Patrick Kane seemed like a bit of a turning point in the series.   What type of chemistry do you think you had this series, playing with Brandon?   Seems like the Ducks never had an answer for your line. 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   My job was easy.   I had to win draws, play smart defensively, watch those two go, create space for those two guys.   I think for the most part, we were smart against their top line when we had that matchup.   We were patient enough to wait for our chances.   When we had them, we found ways to score. 
It was a nice spark for us and a nice spark for the team. 

Q.   Have you been able to watch much of Tampa?   What kind of series are we going to see? 
DUNCAN KEITH:   I think we've all watched games in the playoffs with Eastern, Western Conference teams.   I think the thing that stands out to me is their team speed and their skill level up front. 
I remember playing them I think it was in March, towards the end of the season, and they beat us pretty good.   You know, I think as a team we've got a lot of respect for them.   They're there for a reason.   Like I said, they've got a lot of speed up front.   They've got big defensemen that can move the puck and skate, and a big goalie who can stop the puck, too. 
I think we're confident in our team, but at the same time looking at their team, you know, I think those are the things that stick out to me. 

Q.   Can you talk about the importance of getting off to the quick start, what it meant.   What did that do to change the tone of the game? 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   Well, it's Game 7.   It's winner takes all.   At the same time we maybe referred to Game5 a little bit where the start we had in that game arguably could have been the difference for us in us losing that game.   Tonight we wanted to have a big start, whether we took the lead or not was a big part in us trying to take away their energy, letting them dictate the game for 60 minutes. 

Q.   What does it mean to get to this point?   You want to win the Cup, but to get to the Final. 
JONATHAN TOEWS:   No doubt, like I was saying a minute ago, tonight we'll enjoy this accomplishment.   I mean, we know how rare and how much hard work goes into the long season, getting to this point, how many little things have to go right to get to this point. 
It is a tremendous opportunity. 
That being said, we want to enjoy this tonight, but it won't be long before we move on.   We'll be excited for the next challenge. 

Q.   Duncan, it was their intention to wear you down.   How are you feeling after seven games?   You look pretty spry. 
DUNCAN KEITH:   What does 'spry' mean? 
I feel good.   I'm excited to move on.   Anaheim has a great team.   Let's face it.   They're at the top of our conference for a reason, with big guys that can skate, with a lot of skill. 
It was a really tough series.   But at the same time, you know, I think we're moving on for a reason, showing a lot of character, using our speed and skill.   I don't think anybody's tired anymore this time of year right now.   I think we're just excited to move on and be able to beat a great team like Anaheim and have the opportunity to try and beat another great team in Tampa Bay. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, guys.
