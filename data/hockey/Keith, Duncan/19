   DUNCAN KEITH: Makes the matchups you want a little bit easier. I think we found in the playoffs, because we're at home, doesn't make it any easier. It's something we've seen before, when players and lines jump on the ice and off. That's just part of trying to get the matchups you want, trying to deal with it. You just deal with it.   
  
  Q. Will you be able to pull that off more here or was it different on the road?   
 DUNCAN KEITH: I don't know if it's really any different where you're playing. Just trying to be aware what they're doing, whether they're staying out there and playing or whether they're off.   
 I think the quicker you realize they've changed, the better off you are.   
  
  Q. I know you're on the ice a lot. Does Joel tell you to go?   
 DUNCAN KEITH: Haviland runs it back there. He's the guy telling us to go. We're trying to listen to him. You know, they've got a lot of things going on.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding too many men on the ice.)   
 DUNCAN KEITH: I think that's why we've seen too-many men penalties this post-season, guys trying to get the matchup, guys trying to change, when normally it wouldn't be the best time to change. We think that's just something we need to be aware of, when we need to change, change, but at the same time change when it's the right time.
