  Flyers - 4

 Q. Duncan, you knew this was going to be a tough game, a must-win for Philadelphia. They played pretty desperate hockey tonight. 
 DUNCAN KEITH: Yeah, I thought it was close, though. Could have went either way. Give them credit, though. They played a solid game. 

 Q. Every single one of the games so far has been one-goal games. This is the first time you guys have lost a one-goal game. Is it going to be like this, do you expect the whole Series, this tight? 
 DUNCAN KEITH: Yeah, I would think so. We've played with a lot of one-goal games throughout this year. So it's not something we haven't seen before. What can you say, they made a nice play at the end. 
 I'm not sure what happened there off the rush, but seemed like they had an odd-man rush. When you have those players like Briere, he's going to make a nice play. 

 Q. How important is it for to you try to steal a win here? 
 DUNCAN KEITH: It's huge. It's tough to lose, but at the same time, you know, we got another game. Hey, you know, we like our position. At the same time, we're not happy about tonight. But we got another game next time, and hopefully we can be better. 

 Q. Duncan, the last two games you guys have been -- (Indiscernible) in the third period of the last two games. Is that a bit of a disturbing trend? 
 DUNCAN KEITH: I don't notice. When I'm playing I don't think about things like that. You're playing in the moment. Seemed like we had some chances too. I thought I had one right at the end there. I mean, they get some shots, but I don't know -- Antti is seeing them. It's a different story. 

 Q. Can you do anything differently on the power-play? You haven't scored one yet in the Series. 
 DUNCAN KEITH: Yeah, we could do a lot of things differently. We just need to shoot, keep it simple. And that's about it.
