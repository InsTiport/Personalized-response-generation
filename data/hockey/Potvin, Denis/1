DENIS POTVIN:  The deadline is February 1st, so although they will build a building in the next few years.  I don't know who the owner is going to be.  That is about it.  We just have no idea.  I don't think that South Florida cannot recognize that it is a great hockey hot bed down there.  So, the building will be built, I think, no matter what.  I had a couple of guys lined up.  I can't play if I can't hit.  It is not a fun game.  I had Cash all lined up; then I thought maybe he'd turn around and go crazy on me.
