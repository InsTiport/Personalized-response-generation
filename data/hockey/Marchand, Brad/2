 Q. Sid, great win tonight. What would you think is more magnetic, your goal in 2010 or Brad's goal tonight? What's more important?   
SIDNEY CROSBY: No, just crazy the way everything worked out. I mean, when you get a penalty that late in the game, you're just trying to force overtime, and then Marchy comes down and buries one like that, pretty unbelievable feeling, considering how hard we had to work to get our chances here tonight. It wasn't easy.   
They blocked a lot of shots, made it tough coming through the neutral zone.   
And came up big for us.   
   
 Q. Is there a way to put into perspective what another trophy like this means, what another MVP like this means coming off of what you did? What's this like for you, this run that you're on?   
SIDNEY CROSBY: No, it's special. I think I don't have to look too far to think about how tough it was a year ago starting out the season. I think I appreciate this a lot. It's not easy.   
Everyone wants to be playing for Team Canada. There's a lot of expectations. We play here, we understand that. But it's an unbelievable atmosphere to play here at home, to be a hockey player playing for Team Canada and be with this group of guys has been a lot of fun. To be able to win it is special for a lot of reasons, but yeah, it's just been a great month.   
   
 Q. Sidney, I know it's fresh, but if you can give it some context, the back‑to‑back best‑on‑best tournaments, going 12‑0, running the table within two and a half years against some quality, quality competition, what does that feel like to be part of that?   
SIDNEY CROSBY: It's pretty special. I mean, it's not easy to do, and for a good chunk of us, a lot of us were together there in Russia, and then for guys who weren't, everyone just kind of gelled right away.   
I think everyone understands playing for Team Canada, you're willing to do whatever it takes to win. Just to see the way that the team has come together, to see the different challenges you have to overcome to win‑‑ I mean, on the big ice in Russia, that was kind of the big challenge. Here we faced some different challenges, but a really stingy defensive team that seemed to capitalize on every mistake here the last couple games. So they were tough to play against and they tested us big time.  
   
 Q. Brad, this has been quite a tournament for you, scored the game‑winning goal, got a new contract in the middle of it, too. What have these two weeks been like for you playing on the line with Sid and Bergeron, and also being able to have that part of it, as well, with the contract and winning the whole tournament?   
BRAD MARCHAND: Yeah, I think the whole thing has been a bit of a whirlwind. When you come into a tournament like this, you're just trying to take everything in. It's the biggest stage in the world right now, and to be a part of it is an incredible honor.   
You know, and then to be put on the line with Sid and Bergy is another big honor. A lot of pressure that goes with that, but it's been an incredible experience every day with the guys in the room and off the ice. And like Sid said, the things we had to overcome, it's been a dream come true. I'll cherish every second of this for the rest of my life.   
   
 Q. Sidney, many wondered if Brad was‑‑ how he was going to fit in on this team when he was named. What did you think of it then and what do you think of what he's been able to add now?   
SIDNEY CROSBY: I was pretty confident. I mean, we obviously skate together in the summer, and this summer we had the opportunity to skate all three of us together in Halifax, myself, Bergy and Brad, and it seemed like there was chemistry there right away. And I know it's summer, but usually you can tell those things pretty quickly.   
I think we came into camp and it seemed to gel right away. And definitely when you can get a good start, it builds confidence, and that's a big part of it. So we were able to get a good start there in the first game. Yeah, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and you have to juggle. I thought right from the start it felt like we were able to generate a lot, and it's fun to share this with them. Being from the same area, never really having a chance to play together, and then to play together on this kind of a stage, playing for your country, it's pretty special.  
   
 Q. Sid know, I know you guys pride yourselves on being process‑driven, but when you get into the final minutes of the game down 1‑0, does any part of you think about a Game 3 or that this one might be slipping away?  
SIDNEY CROSBY: Yeah, that you don't want it. We don't want to go to Game 3. Anything can happen in one game, especially the last 10 minutes we were really pressing. We had some really good chances, and regardless of getting the power play or not, I thought we had one good push left in us. To get that power play goal I think was definitely big, but then we ended up getting shorthanded there for the last two minutes. So you're thinking, all right, let's just get this to overtime, see what we can do, and Marchy comes in with a big goal, an unexpected one but much needed. A real change of emotions there pretty quickly, but made it exciting and definitely special.   
   
 Q. Brad, shortly before the game winner, Carey Price had Marian Hossa on the doorstep, made a big save. Do you think it's a real thing that the goalie makes a big save and it lights a fire for you to go down the other way and get it back for him?   
BRAD MARCHAND: Yeah, you think you need to see the emotion in the whole arena when he made that save. I think everyone, especially after the goal, was unbelievable, very electric. And when he made that save, they kind of brought it to another level. And we feed off of that energy, there's no question about that.   
You could tell the boys were confident, and you definitely want to help him out when he makes a save like that. You've got to play your part, too, and fortunately we were able to return the favor.   
   
 Q. Brad, just wondering, five years ago, you're standing up at the White House, and the President of the United States refers to you as a little ball of hate. Five years later, you're probably the most beloved hockey player in this country right now. Can you talk about the change of feelings? You've been booed a lot in your career, but to have a whole country cheering you on at this moment.   
BRAD MARCHAND: Yeah, you know, even when we had our exhibition game in Ottawa and started camp here, got booed here, too. That just shows how great the fans are here where there's a lot of loyalty to their team.   
But to be on a team like this and to have success and to win with a team like this is an incredible feeling. I think all of Canada kind of gets behind that, and they all feel the enjoyment of that, feel the success from that, and we all enjoy it together. It's not just our team, but all of Canada will be celebrating tonight.   
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
SIDNEY CROSBY: Well, yeah, I mean, any time you can represent Canada, I've had some great experiences, and looking back to the two Olympics I've been able to go to, it's been unbelievable. The hockey has been unbelievable, the experience has been great.   
I can only speak for myself. I'm not going to try to convince anybody. Everyone has got their own opinion. But speaking just on my experience, to represent your country, to be a hockey player and play the best of the best is pretty special and not an opportunity you get all the time.   
Obviously the Olympics are every four years. We'll have to see what happens, but it's been a great experience for me and then hopefully will continue to find a way to go there.   
   
 Q. Brad, if you could take us from your point of view, he jumped off the bench on that goal and just the way that Toews seemed to create a parting of the red seas for you. Can you talk about the way that play developed?   
BRAD MARCHAND: Yeah, when I got off the bench, I saw Toewser. He was able to back everybody off. I think he was going up against a couple forwards and a defenseman, and the forwards were a little uncomfortable. I think he wanted to try them out, and he made a great play to open up a lot of space. And when I came in, I just wanted to get a shot on net. But he made a phenomenal play to back everybody in and make a great drop pass, and luckily the puck went in the net.   
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
BRAD MARCHAND: You know what, yeah, it was a little bit behind, but luckily it was because there was a stick in the way, too. If it was any forward, the guy probably would have got it, so perfect placement by Toewser.   
   
 Q. What were your emotions like as the flag was being raised there at the end?   
BRAD MARCHAND: You know, it's tough to describe when you're standing on the blue line, you're looking around, you see your family in the crowd and how proud everybody is in the whole arena. When you watch that flag go up and all these emotions are going through your head and you're representing your country and your team just had success and won for your country, you know, that's something that you can't describe. It's an incredible feeling.   
Again, I'm a bit lost for words right now because it was just‑‑ you're just trying to take every moment of it in because you know you're going to look back on this and wish you could do it over and over again. But the fact of the matter is this only happens a few years, and it hasn't happened in a long time, so we're very fortunate to be here.
