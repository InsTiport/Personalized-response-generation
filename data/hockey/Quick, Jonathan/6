  JONATHAN QUICK:   You have to take your time and enjoy it.   At this point we're already getting our workout schedules for the summer in order, starting to prepare for next year.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JONATHAN QUICK:   I don't think anyone expected him not to.   
He's been great for our group.   Obviously, he wants everybody to enjoy it, he wants to enjoy it.   At the same time start getting prepared for next year.   
   
 Q.   Speaking of next year, would you rather have your next contract done before next season starts or...   
JONATHAN QUICK:   That's obviously a different side of the game.   Right now, I know today it's about the players here.   Just trying to enjoy this for the next couple days.   
   
 Q.   You have to be pretty excited about the future?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   Absolutely.   You look around the locker room, you think about the guys.   Everyone is fairly young.   So you just hope and pray that everybody stays together and we keep this group together.   
   
 Q.   What do you need to do to keep rolling right into the next season?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   I think you just go about it the same way you prepared last season.   You're not going to take as much time off the ice as you usually do.   When the time is right, you start preparing as hard as you can, start fresh.   
You put this season in the rearview mirror and start focusing on the next season.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
JONATHAN QUICK:   That's not really what I was thinking.   Afterwards, I'm not surprised that it did.   It is what it is.   All the support I've gotten from the team has been great.
