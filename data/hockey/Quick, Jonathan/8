  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jonathan Quick.   
   
 Q.   Devils were saying one win was enough to give them enough of a lift.   On the flipside, is there any doubt in your room?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   0‑0, it's a matter of coming off a win, coming off a loss.   Obviously it's disappointing anytime you lose, no matter what the situation is.   
As of yesterday, as of today, it's 0‑0.   You're trying to win Game1.   
   
 Q.   The fact you already played two games in this building, is that enough familiarity going into tomorrow?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   Familiarity with?   
   
 Q.   The whole arena, the crowd.   
JONATHAN QUICK:   No, it's like any arena.   You've got about 18,000 people that want you to lose no matter where you go.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen any replays of the goal?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   As a matter of fact, I did.   It was pretty patchy video, couldn't see it pretty well.   I'm assuming it hit the stanchion.   That's a tough break.   I think that's happened to everybody one time or the other.   For it to happen when it did in overtime, it's tough.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel for the guy, though?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   You got to feel for the guy.   There's off‑sides, too, on the puck.   Part of the game.   It's the way it happens sometimes.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel they're taking more of an effort to crowd you than they had in the first few games?  
JONATHAN QUICK:   No.   Same thing as first few games.   Traffic, bumping me, stuff like that.   That's every team's plan, for the most part.   
   
 Q.   Frustrating when it directly leads to a goal like the first one in Game4?   
JONATHAN QUICK:   You know, you'd like to see the calls go both ways.   Sometimes they don't.   It's a quick game; stuff happens.   Move on.   0‑0 series right now.   Trying to win Game1, that's all it is.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, Jonathan.
