THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jeff and Jonathan. 

Q.   Jeff, the goal you got late in the second period, from a psychological standpoint, how important is that? 
JEFF CARTER:   It was a huge goal for us.   To be honest with you, I thought we were a little flat heading up to that goal. 
We got a bounce.   The guys worked hard to get to the net.   It gave us a little bit of life.   Gave us a little bit of extra energy going into that third. 
Guys did a good job. 

Q.   Jonathan, what do you remember from the save you made in the second period on Seabrook?
JONATHAN QUICK:   It was a two‑on‑one.   I forget who he was with. 
I just passed it across.   Seabrook is a right shot, so it was a different angle than if it was a one‑timer opportunity.   Just trying to get it over the post.   Fortunate to get a piece of it. 

Q.   Jeff, would you call that the best period of hockey you ever played? 
JEFF CARTER:   I didn't really have to do too much for them.   Stood in front of them for the first one.   Greener and Tanner made a great play on the second one, so... 
It was a good period, but didn't really have to do too much. 

Q.   Jeff, what did you see on the goal that Toffoli scored where the puck popped up?
JEFF CARTER:   Crawford made a good save.   I don't know if they thought it hit the netting, above the glass, or what.   It seemed like everybody kind of stopped.   Tanner and Tyler made a great play to keep going.   There was no whistle, so... 

Q.   Jonathan, is this something you guys can build off of?   Do you really feel like you'll take some momentum off this into Game3? 
JONATHAN QUICK:   I mean, it's tough to say whether momentum carries over from game to game.   But obviously it's just from the series standpoint, you know, being tied going home as opposed to being down 2‑0. 
You know, so obviously we did a lot of good things.   There's stuff to build on.   But at the end of the day, it's 0‑0 when we take the ice for the next game.   You just try to win 60 minutes. 

Q.   Jeff, you have had a lot of in‑game comebacks during this playoffs, during the Cup run a couple years ago.   Obviously you go back and look at film.   How many times is there a save like the save that Jonathan made on Seabrook somewhere?
JEFF CARTER:   A lot.   Obviously we all know what Quicky brings to our team.   We're down 2‑0, 2‑1, he's making saves like that.   If we don't go out there and give it our all, try to get that next goal, we're letting him down. 
He saves our butts a lot.   I guess we're happy that we could help him out tonight. 

Q.   Jeff, does anything change?   They're up 2‑0 at one point.   Are you making adjustments or are you sticking to the game plan?
JEFF CARTER:   Just sticking with what we need to do.   You know, we got a good group of leaders in our room.   We've been through comebacks and whatnot a lot lately.   Obviously not something we want to do.   But we stick with it, grind it out, get the job done. 

Q.   Jeff, was there anything different about the power play?   I think Darryl mentioned you wanted to get more shots on target, but... 
JEFF CARTER:   Their penalty killers do a great job of getting in lanes.   Their D front a lot of pucks.   It's tough to get them through. 
We got two pucks tonight all game and they both ended up in the net.   It's still something we need to improve on, but it's a good start.
