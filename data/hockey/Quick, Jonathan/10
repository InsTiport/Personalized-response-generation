THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Anze Kopitar and Jonathan Quick. 

Q.   Anze, can you take us through the goal there. 
ANZE KOPITAR:   Well, the battle was just inside our zone.   I think Brownie chipped the puck out to Justin and I kind of just wanted to make sure I stayed in the middle. 
Worked out pretty well after that. 

Q.   That kind of goal is something you probably dreamed about growing up.   Talk a little bit about what it means to score a goal like that in the Stanley Cup Finals. 
ANZE KOPITAR:   It feels great.   Every time you get the chance to finish it off in OT, you know, to face a world class goaltender like Marty is, it's definitely a good feeling. 

Q.   Justin said he kind of threw the puck into space hoping you would be there.   Did you have an idea he was going to put it there or where you hoping as well?
ANZE KOPITAR:   Like I said before, I saw those two on the boards battling.   I wanted to make sure I went through the middle.   I don't know if he heard me or not.   I yelled for the puck.   He chipped it obviously perfect, right on my tape. 
You know, it happened pretty quick.   I was able to finish it off. 

Q.   Can you talk about the impact the line of Fraser, Richardson, and Nolan had, the hits they had?
ANZE KOPITAR:   You know, they probably had one of the best games in the playoffs so far.   You know, they had some really good ones before.   Tonight they capped it off with a nice goal.   Definitely got us going in the first period. 
Seems like we came out a little slower than we wanted to.   The way they came out and established the forecheck, had some cycles in their zone, gave us a huge boost. 

Q.   Jonathan, this is the first time you had to face Brodeur on a stage like this.   How difficult was it for you to match him step for step?
JONATHAN QUICK:   I'm not looking to match him step for step.   I'm not trying to score on him.   He's not trying to score on me.   I'll leave that to the forwards and D.   I'm trying to make saves and help my team win a game.

Q.   There weren't many shots in this game?   Did that surprise you? 
JONATHAN QUICK:   Last series I played a handful of games where I'd see around 20 shots. 
You know, I didn't really know what to expect coming into this game, seeing as we haven't played them in so long.   Watching Ranger games, they had anywhere between 40 shots and 20 shots against Lundqvist.   I was just going shift by shift.   If the team needed me, I just wanted to make the save. 

Q.   Either of you explain your team's road success this year? 
JONATHAN QUICK:   I think we've out‑worked teams.   I think whoever wins this series is going to be the team that out‑works the other. 
ANZE KOPITAR:   Yeah, I mean, every time you get on the road you need a team effort.   It showed again tonight.   We had four lines going, six D.   Jonathan was great at net for us again.   We got to continue doing that. 

Q.   Anze, it seemed like there was more of a feeling‑out process for the two teams for the first two periods.   Was that an unfamiliarity with these guys?
ANZE KOPITAR:   Well, that was really not the plan, to feel them out for two periods.   You know, you want to get out as hard as you can.   Especially on the road, you have to have a good start. 
Tonight maybe we didn't have the start we needed.   We got the first goal, which was huge for us.   After that we kind of got legs underneath us and we were able to generate some chances. 
You know, they don't give up a whole lot.   You have to be careful going through the neutral zone, that you don't make any turnovers, because they got some speedy forwards, some forwards obviously that can finish.   You have to await turnovers and just make sure you make strong plays. 

Q.   Jonathan, the little tussle you had with Zach, was that a matter of him getting close to you?   Was there something you were particularly annoyed about? 
JONATHAN QUICK:   Well, I don't know how he may have got tripped up a little bit.   He ended up, you know, right at my knees there.   I don't know if they were trying to get to the net.   He kind of grabbed me a little bit.   Just gave him a little shove back.   That's all it was.   Nothing big. 

Q.   Jonathan, can you talk about what you saw, if you saw anything, on the puck that got by you?   Matter of bad luck?
JONATHAN QUICK:   It's a bounce.   That's part of the game.   Felt like I played it the right way.   I was trying to get it into the corner, over the glass, get a whistle.   The way I directed it, it ended up, I don't know who it hit, but it hit somebody, then it ended up in the back of the net. 

Q.   Anze, what made you go backhand against Marty? 
ANZE KOPITAR:   I went forehand (smiling). 
I guess that goes back a few years when, you know, we were in the shootout in L.A., and I went backhand on him.   Maybe he thought I was going to do it again.   Tonight I just wanted to mix it up a little bit. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
