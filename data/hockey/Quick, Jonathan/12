THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jonathan. 

Q.   There was a period of time there early in the second period where you had to make several back‑to‑back stops.   The game is still 1‑0 at that point.   You get the goal.   How important is that sequence for your game? 
JONATHAN QUICK:   Obviously I wanted to get off to a better start than I did last game there.   You know, in order to win on the road, you need your goalie to make a few saves. 
For the most part we did a great job of keeping a lot of the chances to the outside, clearing out rebounds and stuff like that.   When they needed me, I was able to make the save. 

Q.   Early in the game, fans were yelling, Shoot, when Morris got close.   Did you hear that?
JONATHAN QUICK:   No. 

Q.   Coach Tippett said his team looked a little bit better in the start of the first period, a little more energy than in Game1.   Did you see it that way?
JONATHAN QUICK:   They certainly created a couple more chances than they did Game1 first period.   That's the way the game works sometimes.   We outplayed them Game1, leave the period tied. 
Today it was a little more evenly played.   You leave the first period with a 1‑0 lead, it's the way it happens sometimes. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JONATHAN QUICK:   You know what, that's part of the game, time of the year.   There's going to be some chippy stuff going on.   It's going to happen both ways.   It's just part of the game. 
I don't think we got under their skin or anything like that.   These guys won two rounds.   You don't win two rounds this time of year being able to get rattled easily. 
We know what to expect here coming into Game3.   We know they're going to bring their best.   That's all we're looking at right now. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Jonathan.
