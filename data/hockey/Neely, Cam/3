Q.  Has does it stack up -- (INAUDIBLE.)

CAM NEELY: It's a little more exciting being in Boston.  It was a great game, especially for Ray.  Ray finished it off.


Q.  It was like you were excited for him as he was for himself.

CAM NEELY: Absolutely.  I haven't jumped off the bench that high in a long time when he scored, so it was nice.  It was great that it happened for him, and especially here.


Q.  You had a nice assist.

CAM NEELY: Yeah, Brendon came back to the bench and said that's an oatsey pass.  So, I guess I learned a little bit playing with him as long as I had.


Q.  (INAUDIBLE)?

CAM NEELY: It was great.  You're not willing to go get a bad line out there.  So whoever you're put with, you're playing with some great players. 


Q.  (INAUDIBLE.)

CAM NEELY: Probably a combination of both.  No question about it.
