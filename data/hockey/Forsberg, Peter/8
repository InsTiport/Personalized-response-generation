Q.  What was it like to be playing with Mats Sundin?

PETER FORSBERG:   I played with Mats in the World Championships in April. We played on the same line; he centered and I was the wingman. He's an excellent player, and I really love playing with him.


Q.  What do you think of Marc Crawford getting hired by the Vancouver Canucks?

PETER FORSBERG:   I think he's a really good coach and I think they're going to do well.  It's good for him that he got a job. We all thought he was going to get a job at the beginning of the season. It's kind of weird that he didn't get a job at the beginning of the season. I'm sure he's happy to be back. And I'm sure Vancouver's happy to have him.


Q.  (Inaudible) .

PETER FORSBERG:   We had a good time with him. There were four straight years, and we won the Cup with him, and he's a really good guy. It's almost too  good, isn't it?  I think Vancouver's going to do good with him.


Q.  Are you concerned that he's in your conference?

PETER FORSBERG:   Yeah, we've played them a few times this year and maybe he knows some tricks. Pretty good, eh?
