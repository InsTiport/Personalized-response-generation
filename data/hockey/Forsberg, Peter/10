Q.  Do you remember any instance during that series last year that you thought this is what Mark Messier is? 
 
PETER FORSBERG: Not really like that.  You know, he is a great player and, you know, you have to have great respect for him when playing against him, but I don't know what to say.  Sure I want to be like him. 
 

Q.  Anything you take as a young player that you can say, you know, geez, this is I want to do, this way because this is the way he does it and he is so successful?
 
PETER FORSBERG: Sure.  He has got that, you know, attitude that he wants to win every game, and that is what you got to have; especially -- you got to be there every night in the playoffs, you can't take a night off.  I didn't really take a night off last year. You got to really hate to lose, you got to win the Cup. 
 

Q.  Any thoughts about the possibility of the shootout in this game with you obviously scoring probably the most famous shootout -- 
 
PETER FORSBERG: No.  I am just going to try and go in there and score.  It is going to be hard.
