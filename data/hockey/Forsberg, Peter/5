Q.  Was there or is there ever any chance that there was a Game 7 you would play?

PETER FORSBERG: I always had hope that I was going to going to be able to come back.  The doctors have said I am not allowed to play,  but I am totally out of it kind of (inaudible) but hopefully there will be a Game 7 anyway. 


Q.  I know you have been watching with the Avs' video guy.  In your opinion what is the key to the success to win this Game No. 6 to force 7?

PETER FORSBERG: Jersey is playing real well.  We need to get a lot of shots and need a lot of chances. We need to get the puck in deep and not let Martin Brodeur handle the puck too much and get a lot of traffic in front of him. 


Q.  I know they wish you were in there with them.  Good luck to you, Peter.

Q.  Any chance of you returning for Game 7?

PETER FORSBERG: No, no chance.  The doctors told me not to play.  It doesn't feel good enough for me to play. It is going to be, but hopefully there is going to be a game 7.


Q.  Is that a result of what took place or game conditioning or just the fact that?

PETER FORSBERG: Just what happened it was (inaudible) made the surgery so it is going to take a while to get back.  Of course I had hoped to get back but it didn't get good enough to be able to play.


Q.  You are such a proud athlete as we all know.  It must be killing you to not perform?

PETER FORSBERG: It's really hard to be watching.  Like I said, the St. Louis series was fine because we were up the whole time.  Now we are facing a little tough time.  It's tough to watch.  You get so nervous.  You just want to get out there and play but I know it is not going to be possible but I hope really the guys are going to be able to do it.


Q.  Patrick Roy has already made 11 saves.  He has been terrific?

PETER FORSBERG: Well, Pat has been unbelievable through the whole thing and you know, we have a big anchor back there.  He has to play good to be able to win.
