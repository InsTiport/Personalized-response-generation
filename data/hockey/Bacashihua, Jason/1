Q.  Jay, you looked a little surprised when they started to call your name.  Did you expect to be picked in the first round?

JASON BACASHIHUA: I was actually expecting to go a little bit later, late first round or somewhere in the second.  But I'm excited that it was first round with Dallas.  Great team.  Great organization over there.  So I'm excited.


Q.  Growing up in Chicago obviously, I don't know how much interest you had in Dallas.  Probably a Rebels fan, just explain what your affiliation was just growing up as a kid.  Anybody you idolized and what did you know about the Stars?

JASON BACASHIHUA: Pretty much when I was younger my favorite player was Belfour, but I mean over the years I kind of start to like Patrick Roy.  Patrick Roy is one of the greatest goalies in the history of the hockey game, but I mean just Patrick I pretty much idolized.


Q.  This is an organization that has really developed young goaltenders in the last couple of years, looking at the League and all the players that have come out of this organization.  Is there a place you can really go and develop your skills and improve.  Looks like a great place for that.

JASON BACASHIHUA: Yeah.  Guys like Belfour and Turco are great goaltenders over there.  I'll go over there and I'm sure I'll get some tips from those guys and be successful like they were hopefully.
