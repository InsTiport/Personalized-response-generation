  LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think we have given 20 to 30 extra runs when we bowled first. It was a good wicket, but 280, 290 would have been really terrible in this ground. But I thought we didn't field well, so that cost us.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think this is just one game, so we have to come back strongly. We have Afghanistan in the next match in Dunedin. I think boys are doing really well. I think sometimes this can happen, but it's just one match, so you have to come back strongly.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: Yeah, I don't think this is Lasith's best bowling effort. We believe he'll come back strongly in the next few matches, but I think he bowled really well in the death overs. That's a positive for us, so hopefully he'll be back with good performances.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think we have to take the extra effort to ‑‑ I think as a team we have to put that extra effort because sometimes crucial catches might cost end of the game. As a team we have to put our heads down and do the extra work.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I don't think it ‑‑ because we have been playing here two months now, so we are used to these conditions. I don't think it was a problem.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think he bowled eight overs, roundabout 40th over. After the 40th over we thought Corey Anderson was there, so he might clear the boundary easily because he ran the board, left spin, so that's why we bowled fastbowlers.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: Yeah, I think myself and Kumar batted like on the board. So at that moment the game was nicely set for us, so I think my wicket and Kumar's wicket that cost us the game. So he bowled brilliantly, I think, that spell, so credit goes to him.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think we had a plan for the McCullum, I think, because he is always trying to step out and play the fast bowlers. So that's why we bowled Angelo and Nuwan up front, not giving him pace to hit a long shot, so that's why Suranga bowled after 15 overs.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: Like I said earlier, it's just one game for the World Cup, in the World Cup. We can't think about this game. We can't think about the past. We have to move on. I think we have Afghanistan next match and Bangladesh in Melbourne, so hopefully we can do much better in these two games and come back strongly.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think you should ask from the selectors that question, but I'm happy the opening innings because that set me ‑‑ that gives me time to settle down and score big innings, but unfortunately I couldn't make that 60. Very disappointed about that. But very happy about my role.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think I haven't been used to these situations now in quite a while, since I've been playing up to No.8, I guess, and now I've been used to this situation.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: Yeah, I think they are one of the favorites in this World Cup, but any team have the chance to do well in this tournament. That's how the conditions and the setup in New Zealand and Australia are, so I think they have a good side, very balanced side. I think it might be ‑‑ they have a couple of good matches coming up, so we'll see how it goes.    LAHIRU THIRIMANNE: I think bowling, probably bowling and fielding. Those two has to improve for the next game.
