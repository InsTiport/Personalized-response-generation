  EOIN MORGAN: Yeah, perhaps, which is disappointing. We did ourselves ‑‑ probably the most frustrating thing is that we made errors that we haven't been making this trip, and again, Australia played well, but we had opportunities to take the game to them, and we didn't take them.    EOIN MORGAN: I think certainly today they were the better team, and they played ‑‑ they outplayed us in every department right from the start, which is disappointing. Again, we showed glimpses of what we can do, but again, frustrating things that we've been doing for this last month let us down.    EOIN MORGAN: There's probably about three or four, and each batsman varies. It's certainly not easy bowling at the end. The main objective is to restrict them scoring and to take wickets. Taking wickets is the ultimate. If you do that, you tend to halt momentum, and again, we're ‑‑ I think our plans were reasonably good. The execution of it I thought was poor.    EOIN MORGAN: No, absolutely not. We're not a precious squad. We spoke before the tournament and said that we will have to adapt at certain stages, and we played ‑‑ we changed the balance of the side, but we played our best 11 for that balance.    EOIN MORGAN: James Taylor batted probably closer to his natural position in the batting lineup than he's ever done. Batting 3 was a bit strange for him, although he did it well. Batting 5 or 6 is probably his best position, and Gary has had a fantastic maybe 12 months of test match cricket, maybe a little bit less, batting at 3, and has looked in magnificent touch since he's been here.    EOIN MORGAN: After that dismissal, I don't think so, no. I toe end a pull which probably held up a little bit in the pitch, no way of getting out and getting naught, but no.    EOIN MORGAN: We're still waiting on clarity. We're going to speak to metro free. In fact, I've come straight from shaking hands, so again, my understanding, I can't say it, because again, it can't be ‑‑ I'm not sure if it's right is the best way to say it, so we're waiting on clarity.    EOIN MORGAN: Geoffrey tends to be critical 24/7, and I actually don't know if people ‑‑ well, certainly people within the team, it falls on deaf ears.    EOIN MORGAN: Well, again, it's not a big challenge. We said the first two games of the tournament would be the toughest in our group, and to come out of them with results would give us huge confidence, and we're still at that stage. We're still focusing on getting to the quarterfinals, and again, building the further we get into the tournament. As regards to Friday, we'll regroup, assess what we've done wrong and can improve on before then, but certainly first protocol is to turn to senior players and ask them to lead from the front.    EOIN MORGAN: I'm hoping there will be a higher level of skill produced. I think our strategies are pretty solid and pretty basic, as are everybody's. There's no magic formula. It's a matter of going out and executing those plans.    EOIN MORGAN: I don't think it's been upheaval. I think every game you want your senior players to lead from the front, especially when you play against a side who have been on a bit of a run. So again, Friday will be no different.    EOIN MORGAN: Again, the guys are quite optimistic about things in the group stage. As I said earlier, our first two games are the toughest in the group, so again, we'll have to be reasonably close to our best or producing our best as individuals to beat these sides.    EOIN MORGAN: I think I'm quite honest with things normally, and if I was ‑‑ I'm a nick‑off candidate massively, and if I was nicking every ball that I got, I'd be worried, but I'm not, I'm getting out in different ways. Again, moving forward I'll be trying to spend as much time in the middle as possible.    EOIN MORGAN: Yeah, absolutely, it does give me confidence. As I said, I'd be really worried about the last four dismissals had been nick‑offs or forming some sort of pattern.    EOIN MORGAN: Yeah, I mean, at the risk of repeating myself, the first question I'll relate back to that, things we've been doing well for this last month let us down today, and again, we got two chances really early, which is frustrating more than anything else.    EOIN MORGAN: Yeah, he was outstanding. Typical James Taylor. He got himself in, scored in different areas, and managed to take advantage of being in, and again, these are qualities we're looking for, guys who can not only get 60 or 40, guys who can go on and potentially win a game for us.
