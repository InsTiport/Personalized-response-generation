England - 158/7, Pakistan - 116
Q. What was the difference between that poor performance tonight and the excellent performance you put in against the West Indies a couple of days ago?
ALIYA RIAZ: No, today we made mistakes in fielding and dropped some catches. That's the difference between our team and the England team.
Q. When you started your run chase, did you you believe you'd still be able to chase down that target, given how well you chased the target against the West Indies?
ALIYA RIAZ: Yeah, the innings started well and Javeria played well, and we had some more partnerships. I'm trying the best, and I tried to hit the ball and get the maximum score.
Q. Can you explain why the catches were dropped? We've seen quite a few dropped catches today. There were quite a few in the first game before you played. There were quite a few tonight. Is it quite a difficult ground to catch on?
ALIYA RIAZ: Yeah, some -- I think some catches were dropped by our fielders, and I think this has been our team's shortcoming. Inshallah, next time we will overcome this.
Q. What things from this match have you learned to take into your next one?
ALIYA RIAZ: We learned that we need to build more partnerships and reduce our errors in fielding and bowling.
