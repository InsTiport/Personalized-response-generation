 Q.  You haven't played yet in this city.  You've seen the ground, and you've seen the big stands.  How do you feel about it?  MASHRAFE MORTAZA: Yeah, we've seen yesterday and today as well.  It looks to me to be a good wicket.  We have seen India, South Africa match as well.  Looks to a good batting track, and it will be fine.  It will be nice. We have been fielding practice yesterday as well, so we are looking forward to playing here.   Q.  Yesterday Rahim got injured.  How is he feeling now?  MASHRAFE MORTAZA: He's totally fine now.  He had nets today as well, so he's good.   Q.  So far in Australia you've enjoyed a lot of support everywhere you've played.  But this is for the first time maybe you'll have to face some adverse fans.  Do you think it will be challenging?  MASHRAFE MORTAZA: Not really.  I think Bangladesh supporters will come as well.  I heard that a lot of Bangladeshi supporters are coming as well from Sydney or from Melbourne as well.  So hopefully it will be nice to play in front of them as well.  We always expect from other supporters as well.  But hopefully we'll play well and make them happy.   Q.  You got some of the Sri Lankans on your coaching staff as well.  How are they viewing to prepare for this clash against Sri Lanka?  MASHRAFE MORTAZA: Yes, we are very prepared for tomorrow, and, yes, we have some Sri Lankan coach as well, and as far as they know, they're trying hard to make a plan, and hopefully we'll execute tomorrow as well.
