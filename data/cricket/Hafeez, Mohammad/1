Pakistan - 348/8, England - 334/9   
 Q.  Do you think England were maybe a little bit complacent against you, especially having beaten you 4-0 last month?  
MOHAMMAD HAFEEZ: I don't know about them, but I know about myself and I know about my team.  We were very confident to coming into this game.  We know in the last series we played here, we were not where be but we should win a couple of games, but we lost in the crucial stages of the game, and we know in this format, we can score 340-plus on this track.  It will be a very difficult score to chase on because the ball and the pitch was supporting the seamers and also it was not coming on to the bat.   
 Q.  What did you make of the pitch?  
 Yes, it's a good, good pitch, but still, there was something for the bowler, also, and especially for the spinners.  So I believe we got that runs in our mind we really wanted to achieve, and then the bowlers did a good job to restrict them.   
 Q.  How do you explain the turnaround from 105 all out against the West Indies to 348/8 against England in the space of two matches?  
MOHAMMAD HAFEEZ: Well, I can only describe like it was total self-belief.  Everyone was really looking forward to doing something in this game.  Yes, we played a bad game the first against West Indies, but we knew as a team we are very much capable to win the matches for Pakistan.  So we really had a good meeting the day before, we really expressed -- we expressed some of the good things for each of the players -- we really gave confidence to each of them [each-other], and that really worked today, and we could see everyone really expressed themselves, and that really worked for Pakistan today.
