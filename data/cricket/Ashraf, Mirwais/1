 Q.  Talk about your expectations around tomorrow's match.  MIRWAIS ASHRAF: Inshallah we will play a positive game tomorrow.  The Sri Lankan side, a senior side, a full member nation, inshallah will be good game tomorrow.   Q.  You've seen Ireland and the UAE play pretty well in their respective games.  Is it a case of trying to match those other qualifiers and maybe do yourself a bit more justice tomorrow?  MIRWAIS ASHRAF: First game a little bit of a struggle against Bangladesh.  Five matches more left.  Inshallah in that games, we try 100 percent and shall do the best performance.   Q.  What's your general feel of the tournament so far, and how are you looking forward to the next matches, particularly Oz and New Zealand?  MIRWAIS ASHRAF: Yeah, full member nation playing against a full member nation, tough games, all five matches, consecutively, so inshallah we'll be trying to do our best against all full member nations to play positive cricket and a good fight.   Q.  There was a couple of instances against Bangladesh where you could have used the DRS and didn't and maybe that impacted on the result.  Has there been a discussion within the team about how you go about using DRS because you're obviously not used to it when you're playing normally?  MIRWAIS ASHRAF: We are new, especially in this big event, so the last game was a debut game against Zimbabwe in this big event, so inshallah, the next game we will be wellprepared for that decision.  The last game was our first game, and it was a little bit disappointing, that decision.
