Yeah, it got a little scarier than they wanted, I guess. When I'm rushing around the changing room trying to check the pairs on it, it means we might be in a little bit of trouble. But, yeah, in the end we got the points and we got the job done, so, yeah, pretty satisfying.   I don't think so. Yeah, I reckon the Scots bowled really well. They came out there and gave it everything, and knew they could try to defend us, and, yeah, put some decent pressure on us. So I don't think it will be two phases of batting in it. We got the job done, like I said, and we got the points. Let's move on to Friday.   Yeah, I said in the post-match before that we felt it swung around really nicely, and some good assistance from the wicket as well. Yeah, as a unit we bowled pretty well. I thought we got the ball to swing and got a decent score. So bowled out for 143. We knew there was some batting to be done, we got put under some pressure by some bowlers and eventually got there.   Yeah, I'm not sure. Brendon could probably could answer that better than me, but we saw there was some grayness in the wicket. We knew it was going to swing, so why not put them under pressure? So we started nicely, and they kicked back nicely and got through to 143. But like I said, we're happy we got the job done.   It's just nice to be out there assisting or contributing to a bowling performance and to the ones. As eye unit we stuck together pretty nicely, and it's nice that everyone put their hand up and helped in some way and got that win.   It was pretty exciting. You can imagine sitting around a computer screen with a couple of your mates and not really knowing what was going to happen. Yeah, it was pretty exciting there for a couple of minutes. I'm not too sure if it's settled in with me yet, but, yeah, pretty exciting opportunity coming up.   Yeah, like I said, it did swing around nicely and just managed to get the line right, and asked some good questions of their batsmen. Yeah, kicked off with a bit of a bang there. And I thought Timmy bowled well to chip in with two wickets and that set us up pretty nicely.   Q. How do you rate your bowling performance today?  TRENT BOULT: It was okay. Like I said, a good start. Had some good questions throughout my spell. Yeah, like I said, very happy to contribute to the team performance overall. So, yeah.   With the bat or the ball?  Yeah, well, seven, yeah, it put us in a position that we didn't really want to be in. But like I said, a lot of credit is due for Scottish for asking the questions of us. And yeah, it shows you the way the game can go. If you build the pressure in the right areas, you can upset anyone on any day. But like I said, we got there in the end and guys are really happy, and we'll move on to Friday night now.   I don't know what the confidence level was. It was a unique experience, and something I felt I had no control over. Yeah, put my name into an auction almost a couple months ago and then you just let it happen. So myself and Tim, and Ronch and Kane were actually sitting around. Yeah, obviously it seemed to happen pretty quickly, and like I said it was exciting.   No, the guys were pretty elated for me. Everyone's pretty close and tight-knit in the group. No, it was pretty special to share with a couple of mates and to go through something like that because it really is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It was exciting, but I guess the focus is still on the World Cup, there is no doubt about that. There is a lot of cricket to be played between now and then, and that is definitely my focus.  Yeah, well, I suppose everyone knows that cricket is my passion and there is no doubt about that. There's nothing better than winning a Test match and a Test match series with the black cap on. Yeah, this World Cup was always going to be a big goal of mine and something I'd love to be involved in. I felt like I put a lot of focus into the white ball and the game with the white ball in the background. So it's nice to be contributing, like I said, and to get some accolades like I have recently is something that I wasn't necessarily expecting. But yeah, we'll focus on that when that comes.   It's hard to say. It's going to be a long tournament, and like I said, there is going to be a lot of cricket to be played. The great thing about our group is we have four guys on the sideline that are hungry to be out there. And they've definitely got the skills to be out there, so anything can happen. I'm confident that any of the 15 can step up and jump into a role. But, yeah, to field the same side two outings in a row and get the job done is obviously very satisfying for all of us.   Yeah, we know that if you have a bit of success at the top and give wickets the amount of pressure they put on the opposition. And running in and trying to bowl yorkers and trying to do all sorts is not really the ingredient to doing that. It's about putting pressure and myself in turn trying to keep it as simple as possible. When we get conditions like that where it does swing, and we get that little bit of assistance out of the wicket, then, yeah, the wickets kind of come. So, yeah, that's the focus. We know what wickets on the top can do.   I got asked the question about invincibility the other day and I didn't really understand it. I'm not sure how to answer that one. Yeah, we just went out there to put pressure on them. Yeah, I don't really know, actually. That's a tough one to answer. Like I said, we bowled well and set the game up and got through with the bat and got the result we wanted, so, yeah.
