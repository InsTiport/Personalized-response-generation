New Zealand - 237/6 (50), Pakistan - 241/4 (49.1)
Q. Babar, you've had a lot of criticism in the past about not taking the team home, about not scoring centuries when Pakistan needed them most.  Do you feel that that has now been changed and the fact that you've achieved a century there in a winning cause?
BABAR AZAM: It's in my mind that I'm not finishing the match.  In the middle for Haris and I were batting, and we have a plan that we have to carry on the innings, and we would have done the century.
Q. Babar, at the beginning, you didn't seem as fluent as usual.  Was it the pitch that had something to do with it?
BABAR AZAM: Difficult pitch.  Yeah, it's difficult to bat on this pitch.  It's spinning a lot.  Hafeez and I have a plan that we have to play off the spinners over, and we will attack the fast bowlers.
Q. Now that the tournament is wide open for you guys, like now the next two matches are very crucial, how confident are you beating Bangladesh and Afghanistan who are lower ranked than you?
BABAR AZAM: We are very focused on this thing.  Hafeez, Babar, Shaheen, everybody contributed a lot.  We are confident we are taking match by match, and hopefully we will qualify.
