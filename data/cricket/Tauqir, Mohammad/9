 : Yeah, we had a couple of games in New Zealand, also, and two warmâ€‘up games in Australia, and if I look back, except for Australia game, the rest of the three games we have scored around 300, almost 300 runs, so yeah, batting is good, is strong.   : We respect Zimbabwe's side. It's a good side. If we bowl first we will try to restrict them from as many as possible, and if we bat first, we would like to put up a strong total.   : Yeah, I think it's a great win for Ireland, and I think most of the associate nations are doing well, and we would like to prove a point, also.   : Yeah, I think there's one reason for being mature character. They know how to handle a pressure situation and be calm on the ground, don't get overemotional.   : Whenever we see it's 300 plus runs, so yeah, it's a good ground, a good batting wicket. I think we are also expecting 300 plus, yeah.   : I think it's an honor for me and for the whole team to represent the country. Yeah, it's long back we last played World Cup. Everybody is excited and looking forward to participating in this event.   : See, every individual in the team has his own target and goals. Collectively we are looking forward to at least having a couple of wins against Test nations. That's what we are targeting for.   : Predominantly it's an expat game in the UAE, a lot of Asian, a lot of English, Australian people play there, but I believe our participation in the World Cup would inspire many more Emirati nationals to follow the game with passion.
