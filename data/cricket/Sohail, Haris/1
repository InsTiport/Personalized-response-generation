THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Haris Sohail. Questions?
Q. On the eve of what's a very important game for the team, how is the squad feeling?
HARIS SOHAIL: Which one?
Q. The game tomorrow.
HARIS SOHAIL: We've kept it very simple.  We are going from match to match.  They have quality spinners and we've seen a lot of videos and we've worked from them.  And hopefully we'll see a good match tomorrow.
Q. Just yourself, you've come back into the team the last two games and have made a great impact.  You must be delighted with your form.  Tell us about your role on this team and what Sarfaraz and Mickey have asked you, the role they've asked you to perform in this team?
HARIS SOHAIL: From the last series against Australia I have been playing very well, and this time they've given me the different role, whether I bat at 4 or 5.  I'm going with my plan and we have to assess the situation and I will play accordingly.
