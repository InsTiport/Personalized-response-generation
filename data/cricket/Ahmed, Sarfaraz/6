West Indies - 108-3, Pakistan - 105
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think first of all the start is very crucial here.  You know, with the 10:30 start, as I told you before in the last press conference, the start is very crucial for our team.  That is why we wanted to bowl first.  I think at the start we lost too many wickets.  That's why we didn't come back into the game.
Q. Are you surprised at the way the batters went out?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think we expected the hard game that was coming to us but we knew we have what it takes to play and win.  But we lost so many wickets up front when we were batting because of those couple of short balls. The result was not good.
Q. Talk about the way that your team bowled today.
SARFARAZ AHMED: We definitely bowled well. From our bowlers, it was good to have Mohammad Amir back in the form we know he is capable of and it will be good for us for the next matches as well.
Q. You have the small matter of a match against England in your next game.  Can you say what you're going to do between now and then and what you can expect in that match?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think first we have to back ourselves and not think too much about what happened today. That match is gone, so inshallah we have the type of players who can win the next match for us.  Inshallah we will bounce back in the next matches.
