Q. Captain, obviously, it doesn't have much consequences in this outing, but I'm sure you'd like to finish on a high.
SARFARAZ AHMED: Definitely, we're interested in finishing on a high note.  So we will try our best in tomorrow's match.
Q. Pakistan have beaten Bangladesh last time in 2014 Asia Cup.  Four matches you have played, and the winning team is Bangladesh.  Do those stats create any kind of pressure, or how do you see these stats?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think, if you talk about the previous matches, yes, Pakistan lost four matches, but it is a World Cup match.  So both teams look stronger, so hopefully we will do well as a team.
Q. Sarfaraz, just wondering, obviously, there have been things decided about who goes into the Final Four.  Wins comes into it.  Net run rate comes into it.  Do you think there could be a better way to actually decide that in the future?
SARFARAZ AHMED: Yeah, it is very difficult.  316 runs is a big margin.  Only if you're batting first, if you score 600 runs or 500 runs.  So I don't know what the study is behind this, but I can't do anything.
