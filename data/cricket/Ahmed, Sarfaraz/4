THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Sarfaraz Ahmed.   
 Q.  The review where Wahab Riaz got out at the end proved quite important.  Do you feel like it took too long for Australia to make that review when you were out there?  
SARFARAZ AHMED: I don't think so.  You know, I'm not see what is the timing right now.  But looks like they are late but it's umpire call.  I can't say anything.   
 Q.  Sarfaraz, you had great support today and you'll have obviously great support against India at the week end.  What's it like coming to England having so many fans behind you?  
SARFARAZ AHMED: If you see, whenever Pakistan team come to England to play cricket here, so always big support, Pakistanis always come to the ground.  They have good support (indiscernible).  Thanks for the crowd.  They support all the time whenever Pakistan came here.  Hopefully they'll support against India as well.   
 Q.  Sarfaraz, the bowling performance of Mohammad Amir, is that the big positive that you take from today's game?  
SARFARAZ AHMED: Definitely if you take a positive in this match, definitely Mohammad bowled really well.  And after that, Wahab Riaz played really well.  He made a crucial inning.  And definitely these type of things you take positively into next matches.   
 Q.  Sarfaraz, how disappointing and how important was the fielding lapses from your team today?  
SARFARAZ AHMED: Definitely I think fielding -- fielding is not up to the mark, fielding (indiscernible).  We work together again, and we work hard before the India match.
