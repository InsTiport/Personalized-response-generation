Q. It's the first time in a long time you've had all of your players fit.  What difficulties does that present you with choosing an 11th?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think definitely, for the first time we all are.  It's very difficult to make the playing 11, but as we make the playing 11, we all are very clear what team is playing tomorrow.
Q. Hitting a lot of really big scores in recent times.  You're facing a team that has particularly disruptive batting.  How can you try to contain them with the bowlers you have?
SARFARAZ AHMED: You know, if you contain any teams, you have to take wickets.  If you're not taking wickets here, so you can't -- you've got to stop runs.  Whether you play England, either you play West Indies or Australia, you have to take wicket if you stop any team.  So however teams play any other teams, any teams takes wickets, then they will respect them, any team it's possible to have 70, 80 runs.
Q. Quite a few of the legends last night at the opening party were putting the West Indies up as the unpredictable side of this World Cup.  What do you make of their chances coming in, especially with that performance the other day?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think it's good to be unpredictable.  All teams are scared because of Pakistan.  At the end of the day, Pakistan team is very dangerous.  So it's good to be for the World Cup very unpredictable, so it will affect the whole outcome, inshallah.
Q. Obviously results haven't gone your way the last few months, but will you be keen to remind yourself of what happened two years ago in the Champions Trophy?
SARFARAZ AHMED: I think we are not thinking about the result previously.  We didn't play well as a team.  If you see (indiscernible) things, our batting is performing well, so we don't think about it.  We are very focused and we are very hopeful as a team that we will do well, inshallah, in this World Cup.
