 Q.  Tell me about the composition of the squad you guys have for this World T20.  
SALMA KHATUN: I'm happy with the composition, and we've shown various improvements from what we've had in the last year and a half. I'm very hopeful.   
 Q.  What are you guys aiming to do differently in this tournament?  
SALMA KHATUN: I'm hopeful we're going to score. I think it's a challenge for us playing at this level and to play consistently well, but still, I'm hopeful that we'll get to this before.   
 Q.  Which team do you guys see as the biggest threat in your group?  
SALMA KHATUN: I think India. I consider India the strongest team. But all teams are good here. All teams are very competitive, but I reckon that India is probably the strongest in our group.   
 Q.  How would you describe your preparation before coming to the World T20?  
SALMA KHATUN: Over the last three months or so, we're playing good cricket, starting from the Asia Cup to the qualifying, the Ireland series, and then coming over here ahead of the tournament. I think by this time we've adapted to the conditions and the weather, and the big issue is the change of timing, and we haven't already adjusted to that.  That will come, too, ahead of the tournament. I believe that we've had good preparation.   
 Q.  Have you been researching of what might be favoring you as a captain?  
SALMA KHATUN: We have just arrived yesterday and yet to get to the ground, so I don't know exactly the conditions tomorrow. We are going for our session, then we'll know the conditions better.  And from there we'll think about a strategy or whatever. But only tomorrow will we know gradually about the conditions, and that's it.
