 Q. Brendon, firstly, the team for tomorrow, have you decided on it? Are you going to release it?    BRENDON McCULLUM:  I haven't had a chance to speak to the boys not playing yet, so out of respect to them, we'll keep our cards close to our chest, but we've comfortable with the team that we've decided on, and yeah, it's going to be exciting for those guys to get the first opportunity.       Q. And the pitch, your assessment of the pitch?    BRENDON McCULLUM:  It looks good. It looks like it's pretty well prepared. It should have good pace, good bounce, and it should just be a nice even cricket wicket, and that's what you want in World Cup games with so much on the line is you want a wicket that has a bit in it for both parties, and we're going to have an even surface so the team who plays the best cricket will come out on top, so I think it's been a good wicket that's been prepared.       Q. What's the feeling within the team, the wake of expectation, preparation, everybody G'd up, ready to go?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Yeah, everyone is excited. It's been a great buildup from our point of view. I think the management staff, the selectors, the coaching staff have done a brilliant job getting us to this point, and now it's a matter of how we seize the opportunity. Look, we've come in, we've had great preparation, we've been playing some good cricket, but we know that the slate is clean when we start tomorrow. We've still got a lot of hard work that we're going to have to put in over next to the wall, continue to progress as a team, as well, make sure we can continue the confidence and the momentum and I guess the type of cricket we've been playing recently and do it in pressure situations, as well. Yeah, guys that are enthusiastic about it, we're going to get a great crowd tomorrow, as well, and it'll be great to actually kick the tournament off. Last night was a good event, I thought. I think the guys really enjoyed that, and now it's a matter of getting on with cricket.       Q. Do you think this is the best New Zealand team that you've played in World Cup?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Well, certainly the ones that I've played in. Yeah, I think it's the best prepared team, and I think all‑round team. I think we tick most boxes, and I think the style of play which we've crunched down over a period of time is something that we're comfortable with. We've had different personnel come in and out over the last little while, but the game plan has always remained the same, and that's a good strong ‑‑ well, it's a good sign for a team that they're able to replicate the same game plan, even with different people. But I think overall we've got a nice mix of youth and experience. The youth sometimes they bring the experience on a little bit in terms of getting some enthusiasm out of them, as well, and the experienced guys can paint the way for some of the younger guys. So I think it's a nice mix of a group, and yeah, it's a team I'm really comfortable taking into the World Cup, and we'll give ourselves a good chance.       Q. You had a very good six weeks in 2015 and equally good 2014. What was the turning point?  BRENDAO McCULLUM:  Well, I think individually it was a pretty good year, but ‑‑ well, my focus was very much on how our team progressed during that periods of time, and I think we see the emergence of some young guys on the international scene. There was many people that stood out throughout the calendar year, and it was nice to make some contributions along the way. I think the development of our team over that period of time can be attributed to a number of things, I think some guys feeling confident within the group. I think our attitude and culture, which is a not so much used words, I think we've got that right. We've got it right. That gives us our greatest chance of success when we're in the right seats in the bus heading in the right direction. Yeah, I think there's many other factors. Players are maturing, as well. We've got some guys who are starting to put out world class performances, and we've got some nice combinations amongst the group, as well, with both bat and ball. You throw that in the mix, and guys are going to benefit statistically through the year. I think I was one of those guys that was lucky enough to be able to cash in on the back of some of the hard work of other people, as well.       Q. Can you ever remember entering a World Cup feeling as confident and ready as this team does right now?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Well, no, we haven't. We never have, not the ones that I've entered into anyway. You always hoped. You always hoped that things would work out well. Did you genuinely believe it? Maybe, maybe not. But we believe we are a good cricket team, and we believe that we have a chance in this World Cup, but geez, there's some good teams around, as well, and we're going to need things to fall in our favor at times when I'm going to have to see some key moments when they arise, as well. I think the structure of the tournament and the way you play quarter, semifinal, as well, if you make it that far, there's lots of pressurised moments during those few games, and there can only be one winner. There's going to be a lot of teams that come here with high hopes and some that leave, I guess, falling short of the mark. We're realistic with that, sits comfortably with me that if we play our best game, we stand out, we perform to the level that we know how, if we get beat, we get beat, but if we can do that, then I think we can walk away pretty satisfied with our performance, and it'll certainly give us the best chance in this tournament.       Q. Your form leading into this is obviously excellent and with that the expectation levels are rising. Angelo spoke with having to capitalise on that. How do you feel the team is coping with that rising expectation?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Yeah, some of it we probably mitigated against a little while ago. We knew if we were able to gain some performances leading into a World Cup at home that the expectation would rise, so we're able to deal with that a while ago and try and put some factors in ‑‑ put some things in place to be able to, I guess, deal with those, and one of the things which we discussed a lot within the group is being really stable emotionally. The game has its ups and downs anyway without having to add your own ups and downs to it, too, so we try and maintain a real stable emotional environment where guys work hard, you prepare accordingly, you go out there, you give your absolute best to the team, you try and replicate the role that you've been given, but you're not always going to get runs. Sometimes you're going to miss out, so it's just a matter of maintaining just that level of maturity and emotional level that you can handle that and then still go about your work and try and, I guess, prepare yourself for the next game. And that's the environment we've tried to create. You never know if it's going to work in the crunch situations, but it's going to give us our best chance.       Q. How much does Malinga's return change things for you, and have you done a lot of extra preparation on him?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  We've done a lot of preparation anyway on him before the series. We went through the plans against him and watched some footage of him. He's a world‑class bowler and he makes a significant difference to their bowling lineup, predominantly more at the back end of the game in terms of his death bowling. He's a phenomenal death bowler, and he's going to be a factor which we have to overcome if we're going to succeed in this game tomorrow. But if we can head into those final overs with a nice platform and we've ticked off a few of our other key ingredients along the way, then hopefully we're able to put him under a little bit of pressure, as well, but certainly Sri Lanka is a stronger team for Lasith Malinga's involvement in it, as well.       Q. Is it a relief that the tournament is upon us? It's been a long buildup.  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Yeah, it is, to be honest. It's taken a long time to get to this point in time, and even after the warm‑up game the other day, we sat in the changing room, and kind of said, great job on where we're got to, but now the real work starts. And that's great. It's great from I guess a management and coaching, selection and I guess leading players' point of view to know that we've done everything we possibly can to get the team in the best shape leading into the World Cup, but now it's about how we deal with what's in front of us over the next little while. I can say that the guys are excited. There's probably a few nerves and a few anxieties within the group, but that's only natural, as well, and then other guys are just genuinely excited about what's in front of us. We're going to have some times in the next little while where we do some good stuff, and there will be some times where we want more from one another, as well. But it's a long tournament. We need to remain really stable and just go about trying to perform our key tasks and play the best game that we possibly can.       Q. You'll sleep well tonight?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  I sleep well most nights. Not that long normally, but ‑‑ yeah, I'll be fine. You know, it's obviously a big game of cricket, but it is a game of cricket, and I love playing the game, and what's the worst thing that can happen? You go out there and you give yourself, and I'm pretty confident if we can execute what we know we can, then we'll be tough to beat.       Q. Will your family be here tomorrow, including your dad?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Yeah, I think so. I haven't spoken to the old man for a couple of days, but he'll be lobbing up for a free ticket, no doubt (laughter), so I'll speak to him this afternoon, but I mentioned that he'd be here, the old lady, and all my family. It'll be a nice atmosphere, and it's great to be able to play, from a slightly selfish point of view, now that I live here and seeing what the city has had to go through over a period of time. Last night's event was tremendous, and again, tomorrow will be pretty amazing, as well. It's great for the city, and it will be nice for my family to be there, as well.       Q. You obviously bumped into Richie last night at the opening and I know you're reasonably good mates. Have you spoken to him about World Cup, expectations and World Cup preparations?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  No, we had a bit of a handshake. No, I haven't really spoken to him about it. It was very brief last night. He was obviously ‑‑ what they were able to achieve winning a World Cup at home after being without the trophy for so long and the expectations that they dealt with, especially in rugby in our country, was amazing, and very, I guess, in awe of how they dealt with that and the result that they were able to achieve. Look, there will come a time, I guess, when you sort of lean on those sorts of people when you get the opportunity, and maybe later on in the tournament if we find ourselves in that situation.       Q. Brendon, anybody you talked to in New Zealand, everyone says we have Brendon McCullum, the form that he's in, he's the man for us. Does that put any extra pressure on you? How do you feel about that situation? And do you see yourself as that Martin Crowe figure of 1992, leader, performer, and strategist, everything put together?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  No, I've got a job to do. My job is I guess in terms of captaincy and leading the team and opening the batting and trying to, I guess, execute the strategy on the field. Is there extra pressure? I guess there's extra pressure on everyone, and just because of the nature of it being a World Cup. I'm excited about it, and I have high ambitions for what I want to try and achieve through this World Cup. Whether you achieve them or not is another thing, but I go in feeling reasonably confident, feeling secure in the fact that I'm surrounded with guys who I trust and who I believe in, and as a captain that's a significant thing for your own confidence. I hope to be able to make some significant contributions throughout the tournament. I believe we've got some very, very good players within our group, as well, some guys who are capable of topping the runs, scoring charts, and topping the wicket taking list, so it would be nice if I was one of them, but look, I'd take a World Cup win and having a bit of a low one in your own form any day.       Q. Brendon, you guys have been talking about playing at home, expectations, form. What other sort of people have people been reminding you that it's a home game, and has there come a point where you say, I know we are the home team, there's expectations, you don't need to remind me of all that?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Yeah, I guess when you go into a tournament as underdogs, dark horses, favorites, it's all irrelevant once the game starts, and it's great because it drums up energy and it drums up anticipation and expectation and following, and that's great. But once the game actually starts, it's back to the contest in its purest form, which is bat and ball and someone wins and someone loses. That's the mentality that we've got, and we know what works for us, and that's all we can focus on. We can't focus on, I guess, the fact that some people have an expectation on us or some people are writing us off. It's irrelevant from our point of view. We know what we need to do to achieve our best game, and that's what we'll go and do, and if someone else is good enough to beat us, then so be it, but that's what we can worry about.       Q. You mentioned there before about stability and maintaining things, but how much edginess have you noticed in the last 24, 48 hours, maybe guys starting to go into their shell?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  No, I haven't noticed anything just yet. Today's training will be interesting. I haven't seen the boys yet this morning, so it'll be interesting. But yeah, I guess some guys go into their shell when they are nervous, other guys go the other way and they're quite loud and bolshy. Neither is right or wrong, and it's natural to feel those sorts of nerves and anxieties, as well. We certainly aren't judging people if they're feeling nervous, and sort of try and help out whichever way you possibly can. But it is a big game, and we've got a lot of big games to play over the next little while if we're going to be serious contenders in this, so it's something we're going to have to learn or develop some feeling of comfort with it, I guess, as well.       Q. Will you be keeping a close eye on the weather forecast over the next 24 hours?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  It's four seasons one day. Yeah, I think it'll be okay. Hoping that it'll be okay. It would be a shame if the rain sort of intervened and ruined what would be a great spectacle, but we'll just see what unfolds. But we have a little eye on the forecast. I think that could potentially play a part when it comes to making your decision at the toss, as well.       Q. Are you going to race to the curtains first thing in the morning when you wake up?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  I used to race to the curtains and pulled them back and hoped it was raining. But it's all right at the moment. Yeah, I guess you feel like that kid growing up, you race to the curtains, pull them back and you hope for a clear day so you can get on and get involved in the World Cup.       Q. Is that perhaps your biggest fear tomorrow?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Rain? I haven't thought a great deal about it to be honest. If it rains, it rains. We're used to that as cricketers, and some would say you never begrudge rain in this game, although it's mostly county players that say that. Yeah, we'll see what unfolds. I'm sure rain will play its part at some point in this tournament. Just the nature of the country that we live in. But yeah, we can't control it, and I think we've dealt with the rain pretty well in the last little while from a team point of view, just being able to switch off and then get back on the field and perform.       Q. Cast your mind back to your first Cup in '03. How different a person and a cricketer are you in 2015?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  Quite a lot different, I'd hope. I was pretty young. I was very naÃ¯ve when it came to ‑ well, I hadn't really traveled much, and I just didn't really understand my game, either. I sort of hope that I've become a more rounded, more worldly person who's developed a bit of an understanding for the team that he's playing in and his position in the side and position in life, as well. Yeah, I think I missed out that first game in 2003. I sat on the sidelines and watched, and I guess here tomorrow, get the opportunity to lead the team out, so it's been an interesting ride but one that has had its ups and its downs along the way. But learnt some good lessons, and I think ‑‑ well, I hope I'm a better cricketer and a better person now than I was back then.       Q. Have you filled in your World Cup chart? It looks like it's a three‑horse race in a lot of people's eyes. How do you see it?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  I think it's open. The nature of the wickets we're going to play on, I think the play that you expect from New Zealand and Australia, I think what it does, it brings in match winners. The likes of West Indies and even I guess England and India and those teams, they've got such strong match winners within the team that it can turn a game in the blink of an eye. I guess when you talked about major fears, that's probably a major fear is that you're dominating a game and you're in a position of authority, and one of those match winners comes out and takes the game away from you and you end up in a swing of momentum. Who do you see in the finish? Gosh, it could be anyone within the top eight nations I would think. Yeah, lots of teams come in with different form lines, but look, everyone is at the starting gates, and someone will be there at the end.       Q. Outside of the perceived big three, is there one side you think could be there?  BRENDON McCULLUM:  No, no, I think Pakistan can turn a match, whether it's Sri Lanka can turn a match, whether it's India can turn a match, whether it's West Indies, Chris Gayle needs 10 overs to turn a match, you go through all of those teams, and it's dangerous, or Morgan, now that he's captaining England, as well, very astute and strong leader. Yeah, respectfully looking at every team as a definite threat and make sure we do what we have to do.
