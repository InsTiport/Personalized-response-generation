Duke - 40, Baylor - 27
Q. Where you stand, how do you move forward would tell you a lot about yourselves, what do you think you learned from this despite of the outcome?
JALAN McCLENDON: We can't beat ourselves.  That is the biggest thing.  We just beat ourselves.  I mean, that was a really good Duke team, but I think for the most part we beat ourselves.
We just pretty much beat ourselves, so moving forward we know not to do that.  That's something we're saying in the team meetings in the locker room.  So we've got to move forward from it.
Q. You're somebody who has played in other games and other teams and seen some big games and had some experience, what do you tell the younger guys about getting over making mistakes not letting them fall into the quicksand when you make a mistake and compound it?
JALAN McCLENDON: As soon as Sunday and Monday hits, it's next opponent.  So that's probably what I -- that's what we're telling everybody to do.  Just next game, move forward, make the corrections, and we've got to keep going.
Q. How are you feeling physically?  Coach said it was an ankle in the first half.
JALAN McCLENDON: My leg, I'm fine.
Q. As far as the design runs go, I mean, obviously you said your leg is fine.  But was that something that you knew you had to do in the second half, or is that something that the coaches tried to get you all to do more of?
JALAN McCLENDON: That's something we pretty much planned or had in the game plan just by the coverage they played.  Like I said, we were going to keep doing what we were doing and needed to get back to us.  That was the game plan going into the game.  So just came out and just executed better in the second half.
