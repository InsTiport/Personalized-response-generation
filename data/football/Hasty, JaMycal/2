Q. JaMycal, you guys played really well until the fourth quarter, and then a couple of late mistakes.  How frustrating was it, knowing how well you played early in this game?
JaMYCAL HASTY: It's always frustrating, especially with it being senior day and you always want to get the win for those guys, the last game of the year.  So it was frustrating, but we'll keep pushing forward.
Q. How do you feel like you played?  Big runs, obviously.  How do you feel about your performance?
JaMYCAL HASTY: I think I did all right.  I feel like I could have did a lot more.  I think I left a lot of stuff out there.  Still feel I could have did more to help us win.
Q. Talk about senior day.  How tough was it to see a guy like Mo, guy like Taylor go down, not be able to finish the game.
JaMYCAL HASTY: It's hard.  I've been here for three years.  Seeing T.Y.  and everything he's been through, all the seniors, it's hard watching them, probably their last home game and you always want to get the win for those guys.
