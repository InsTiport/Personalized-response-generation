 Q.  What do you think about the way the team looked offensively?  Seemed like you guys got into a little bit of a groove.  Maybe nerves early on.  Jalan came in and you guys got in a groove and never looked back?  
JAMYCAL HASTY: When he had an explosive day on the offensive side.  The offense did a great job of moving guys out of the way, opening lanes for the backs to get the ball to guys like Hurd and Mimms out wide.  So pretty good day overall.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your performance?  I mean, you've got a bit of a smile on your face, and you've been dealing -- you've dealt with injuries in your career.  What are you feeling like right now?  
JAMYCAL HASTY: You know, you can never really get too satisfied because as a player, you always tell yourself what you could do better.   
But not a bad first game.  You know, we'll go in tomorrow and just evaluate the tape.  See what things we can learn from and what we can improve on.  Be better next week.   
 Q.  How much does a win help out this team knowing all the work you guys put in to get that payoff?  Even though there's a long way to go, but to get that payoff, how important was that?  
JAMYCAL HASTY: It was very important.  Like I said, just go starting the season off winning, it's a good feeling.  Young guys feel good about themselves.  They got their confidence up.  Just a good way to start the season.   
 Q.  How determined is this team to just keep on letting this ball roll along the rest of the year?  
JAMYCAL HASTY: Oh, yeah, we're very determined.  We've got big goals for ourselves, and we're looking to go out and take this thing as far as we can.  So there's really no letting up for us.  We're going to keep pushing and just try to finish out this season.
