<p>	Q.  Reggie, your thoughts, will this be a high scoring game, low scoring game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the diverse opportunities you have in Norm Chow's offense, what it gives you an opportunity to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and Oklahoma, you guys are so similar in a lot of ways.  What do you see as being sort of the developing factor that will separate either team from one another come game time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Norm was saying one of his biggest problems is finding those mismatches for us.  He said there's no place he can put you on the field where you're not going to draw two and usually three guys, so what do you do to get that advantage back?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and Matt have got tons of media around, guys like Shaun Cody.  Can you talk about some of the unsung guys on this team that might be known in LA but don't get much run nationally, who they are and your thoughts about them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you like your chances on Tuesday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is that?  Do you guys think without question you are the better team?</p>
<p>	Q.  How has South Beach been treating you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the things that stick out in your mind, some of the things you are going to take back with you when you go back to SC? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  When we were watching the comedians it seemed like Oklahoma was a looser team, dancing around, and you were chilled out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your best night here so far hanging out with the fellows that you'll remember when you go back?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you guys end up doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just playing a little bit of catch up, I know you've answered the question regarding Larry Birdine's comments and the hype and what he's trying to do and that he's not the guy who won the Heisman, that Oklahoma's quarterback should have won it.  I know you do your talking on the field.  Is that his way of motivating your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Larry Birdine. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys use that as any added motivation, or do you just say we don't need any motivation for the National Championship game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your nickname is "The President".  Is that something you like?  What do you think about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you into politics in any way at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the OU defense, what you've seen of them on tape and how impressive they are to you and what you need to do to try and get through them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of your teammates said that you have a shaking ability compared to Adrian Peterson, that you have got more shake.  How do you compare yourself to Peterson and what's the difference between you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you guys interacted at all this week with Peterson or at all or any of the other players?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to just expound on something I asked you before.  Was there a moment when you were playing football in grade school, pop warner or whatever, where you said I'm really good at this, I can do this, and that maybe launched your career?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a sense that you're not only playing for this year's championship but in a way playing for last year's, too, that people might, if you win, look back and say they were the more legitimate champion?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, how does what LenDale does make what you do a little easier or a little more effective?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you worry with his ankle the last couple weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the sense of history with these two programs that have been good for 75, 100 years playing for the big prize. </p>
<p>	Q.  Since the bowl games started, a lot of people are talking about the training of the PAC 10 and the teams that you had to play to get here.  Is it starting to bother you that people are starting to question what you had to do to get here?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible).  Talk about on one side the tailback and on the other side Adrian Peterson. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you elaborate a little bit about the Heisman Trophy finalist?  You yourself are a Heisman Trophy finalist and there are going to be two winners on the field.  What is it like to play with such high caliber players?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you've answered these questions five times already, but people are saying maybe ten years from now they'll be playing this game on ESPN Classic. </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you put that out of your mind?  You say there's no extra pressure. </p>
<p>	Q.  At the beginning of the season I'm sure you set goals.  Do you set this as a goal, training camp, we're going to be in the Orange Bowl and challenge for No. 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  So this is not the cherry on top but this is the orange on top?</p>
