		   COACH TROY CALHOUN:  Well, overall, I thought it was a great team effort.  That's really the way we played here over these last six or seven years.  That's the way Air Force Academy, you have to play.  Our play, it was quite evident today.  We'll never -- let's say never, we might maybe in four or five years down the years recruiting-wise but right now you can see size-wise and you can see how much speed-wise, there are not a lot of teams that are going to match up with us, at least one-on-one.  So what we've got to do is rely upon heavily the character, the fortitude of what has so well built in the young people at the Air Force Academy, that's the young men that are there.  I thought we did that. 
 You know, I thought we went for it on fourth down, 10-3, they took the short field and went 50 yards to score a TD.  You look back really the only time our defense relinquished touchdown drives were on condensed fields, one where we went 4-1 where we probably didn't -- so to answer that drive, right at the end of the first half, and to come out and knock it right out of their hands the second half, those were key. 

 Q.  What did you expect (of the quarterback) coming in? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  You know, I had a chance to watch him when he was in high school, and I just thought he was an extraordinary talented poised, bright quarterback, and ladies and gentlemen, just frankly, it's hard for a freshman, I mean, it is.  For a freshman quarterback, he's never red shirted.  What you see today is probably not what you're going to see in the future.  He has the ability and that's part of some of the growing pains that happens whenever you have the turnover that they had personnel-wise. 

 Q.  How well was your running game working? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  You know, really well.  I thought under the circumstances, that we had the two turnovers, which for us, both ended up being vital plays.  It would be interesting to see, I mean, you look, ever since the first October, we've had one guy that maybe has -- inaudible -- from anybody.  And there's some lanes that are happening up front where he's got some creases to run in. 

 Q.  Curious about the pass rush, you put a lot of pressure on. 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  One thing we do, we were very aggressive.  We're going to attack; we're going to blitz.  That's what we tried to establish from day one in spring ball. 
 It was effective today.  I also thought they did an outstanding job of pass protection.  And the reason I say that is there were circumstances throughout the game where they knew they had to throw, and I thought they still did a pretty good job of holding us down.  You know, that really helped. 
 Only thing I'll say, what we've got to do a little bit in college football is at some point we've got to get away from -- you know go out and kick off, and what's announced is this officiating crew is from Mountain West or this replay guy is from -- I think what we've got to do at some point -- and I'm going off a little but here.  We've got to get to a point where you go play a game that there's no residue at all.  There are no messages. 
 It's like last week, we played a game at home, and you know, we've just got to get out of that.  And I don't want to take anything away from the football team, that's why we're here, but at some point -- inaudible -- goes to play at Michigan, Mountain West conference.  I just think it would really help and enhance maybe the overall, just a little important integrity-wise. 

 Q.  (Inaudible). 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  Now, you know, early, they had a good game early.  I think with that structure that we utilize, I'm sure they had, you know, somewhere along the line they had some experience coaching-wise.  It was a -- that was a key play.  You look here, ever since October 13th, the first series of defense -- you can go right on down the line. 
 The next Michigan play, we played at home, and to have that happen today, we call those boomerangs where something happens one direction and not the other. 

 Q.  This is your first year after being in the NFL, kind of a bigger picture question, but is there a difference? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  Well, it's a -- at our place, it's easier.  Every one of our kids is going to make 18 extra hours.  They are taking classes that I can't even explain the name and I had a heck of a time getting through them, too.  So, you know, there's some balances here and there that has to be taken into consideration. 
 You know, and yet at the same time, our guys, playing football, some of you heard me say this a few times, we don't have a single guy that plays for board and room and books and tuition.  Each one of our guys plays football because they love the competition.  At our place, it is entirely different.  Our place is probably a little bit unique. 

 Q.  Watching the players -- inaudible? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  Well, any time you have an opportunity to come in, it's a special trip, and I wish there was a way I could -- Notre Dame is a phenomenal institution and I wish there was a way that down the road, you could schedule campus to campus.  We don't have to go play in professional football venues.  I love the NFL.  It's just that if there's a way where we could keep that treasured among the two schools. 
 Also, our guys have played pretty good, and really have played fairly well here over the last -- really over the last month and a half.  That was something and I thought these kids did a phenomenal job of developing with one another and growing a little bit closer and that's been fun to watch, the growth and development of our guys. 
 And the other part, we've won here before.  You know, I've got a bunch of assistants, and, you know, this is a game where we've had some good times.  We've had a few that weren't.  We don't have guys who are coaches who have gone crazy and doing cartwheels on some of the players. 

 Q.  Can you give us your thought process -- when that backfired? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  You know, I think part of it is when you try and develop a mentality amongst your guys, you take enormous pride, in those situations, if you punt it, sure.  You go back and kick yourself in the back side and I felt like really there was a very good chance we could get the yardage; and our defense, even if you don't, you have to be ready to respond.  In that case, we did not, but there's a little bit of it that's by and large, that's an optimum play -- the execution, yeah. 

 Q.  Talking about Chad Hall the last couple of weeks, your thoughts on his performance and also the plan going in? 
 COACH TROY CALHOUN:  Well, I thought coming in here, my hunches were this could be a low-scoring game.  They always turn out this way anticipation-wise.  He's our one -- that comes as no surprise.  I feel like the later you get into the year, you know it's his senior year and there are not a whole lot left.  He's wearing a little heavier harness and we are going to ride him a little.  That's something that we are aware of.
