Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Yes, definitely.  Most definitely.  Just with us going through all the things we did during the season, with all the injuries, especially in the linebacker crew, we definitely as a team, specifically as a defense, show we weren't worried about the injuries.  We could play at a high level regardless of who was playing at the time.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: It's definitely a challenge.  They're two great backs.  They play in the SEC, one of the top organizations in the nation.  Georgia is a great football team.
For us, it's a great challenge.  I'm definitely looking forward to it.
Q. You played against good runningbacks on your team.
RASHAAN EVANS: You have Bo, Damien, Ryan Robertson.  You have a whole runningback crew that can play anywhere in the world.  Just going against those guys in practice, they definitely get us ready for a game like this, for sure.
Q. Any big differences between their two runningbacks in terms of style?
RASHAAN EVANS: I feel like Nick Chubb is more of a pounder.  I feel like he likes to hit the hole a lot better than Sony.  Sony has a little bit more speed.  He is more of a slasher.  He likes to make moves like that.  Nick Chubb does show a little bit of moves, too.
Those two guys, they're a great duo.  They have a good split of power and finesse.  Once again, it's going to be a great challenge for us.  We're all looking forward to it.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: It's definitely crazy.  It just kind of shows you the type of athletes they are.  Over my career, I've faced so many different types of athletes.  Really nothing new to me, to be honest with you.  Even with the whole defense, I feel like we faced some of the top athletes in the nation.  This is one of those regular things where you're going to face another top athlete, possibly two, so...
Q. (Question regarding legacy.)
RASHAAN EVANS: Just being able to finish.  I feel like we didn't finish the way we wanted to for the seniors last year.  It would be a great achievement for a lot of the seniors to be able to go out like we wanted to.
I feel like now we have a great opportunity to do that.  This is an opportunity for us not to take it for granted.  Just make sure we do all the little things to prepare for this game.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, wow.  I kind of knew it would be something like this, but I never knew it was going to be like this.  I'm definitely blessed to be able to be a part of this organization, to be able to attend, once again, another national championship game.  It's just a rare moment for me.  I'm just soaking it all in.
Q. Testament to guys back in Auburn High School?
RASHAAN EVANS: Absolutely, to any high school player.  Let them understand that you going to face different types of adversity.  How you overcome those things is the most important thing.  For me, I feel like I hope that my whole situation at Alabama was a testament to show how hard work pays off.
Any time I can be a mentor to anybody, I feel like all the things I've done, just let those guys see those things, know the right things to do.
Q. Do you lick your chops at a freshman quarterback?
RASHAAN EVANS: You can.  At the same time you got to respect the athlete, regardless if he's a freshman.  We had Jalen Hurts, he was a freshman, ended up winning the national championship.  You got to respect the athlete.  That's one of the main things I've learned since I've been here, regardless if he's a freshman, junior, sophomore.  The guy can make plays.  I've seen it on film.  He does a great job of distributing the ball to all his athletes.
As a defense, we just got to be patient, got to be disciplined, and execute.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Just the fact that I've had to split most of the play calling with maybe two or three different dudes every time, it's a little difficult.  At the same time for me, Mack does a great job of calling the plays, as well.  I'm moving so much, it's kind of hard for me to be able to control the whole defense.  Most of the time I'm either in pass coverage, something different I'm always doing.  But Mack does a great job of just holding the fort down, making the play calls.
I think it's a great job for both of us to make sure we communicate throughout the whole defense so everybody knows their job.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: That kind of shows you the significance of the game, if the president decided he was going to come to a game like this.  Kind of shows you how important this game is.  Definitely don't take it lightly, for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Man, it's definitely going to be unique.  The fact that I've actually been coached and recruited by the guys is going to be something very unique for me.  It's just one of those moments, I'm definitely excited to be able to have the opportunity to go against them.
To be honest with you, he knows a lot about me, a lot about a lot of our guys on our team.  To be honest with you, I don't think there's going to be any type of trick plays, anything like that.  It's going to be straight-up football.  Both sides know each other very well.  I'm just excited for this game, man.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: For me, just knowing the significance of the game.  I always try to do the little things in preparation to get me ready for a big game like this.  Each year that I've ever played in these big-time games, I've always understood that anything can happen, but at the same time control what you can control.
Just with that, I try to do the best I can do, do my job.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I think that's the type of game we want.  We want a physical game.  A lot of times I feel like we've basically had more finesse games than physical games.  The last time we really had a physical game I think was probably Mississippi State, LSU.  Other than that, I feel like the physical game like this is something we definitely thrive on, for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Yeah, most definitely.  I feel a lot more comfortable now, just the fact that I'm on the inside now.  For me right now, I feel more comfortable than ever.  The fact I've had one year up under my belt, I know all of the schemes, I know everything you can possibly know as an inside linebacker.
It's just very unique and crazy for me to think I just started playing this position literally like a year ago, two years ago right now.  But just my whole career, learning this position, just learning the whole grand scheme of things on the defense, it just helped me out in the long run.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: No doubt, no doubt.  I think it's helped me become a more complete player.  I basically know almost every position.  I played almost all of them.
Just with that, man, I think that's any type of athlete a full rounded player, to be able to know most positions, to be able to kind of understand them, as well.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: The fact that he was the type of guy, he was family oriented.  He spent a lot of time with my family when I was being recruited.  He was one of those guys that was up front with me.  He let me know right off the bat what I was going to be going into when I got to Alabama.  The fact that I was able to have the opportunity to be able to be coached by him, just to get to know him in general was an amazing thing.
I was very happy for him when he got the job at Georgia.  Just from that, man, I know he's definitely a great guy, definitely a great coach.  You can see the results from the time that he got there till now.
Like I said, man, this is one of those rare moments, I'm just happy and blessed to be a part of this whole situation.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, man.  To be honest with you, you really don't know.  I think he pretty much lays it out there, whenever he's coaching.  What you see is what you get, to be honest with you.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: No doubt.  He definitely does.  You may not be able to see it from the outside looking in, but definitely when you're around him, he knows how to have fun, for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Just understanding that any team can get beat at any time, regardless of how good you are.  We've lost a couple of games since I've been here.  Each time that we have lost, it's probably been the most devastating things we've had in our own lives, you know, just being in college.
The fact that we've learned from each mistake, we never take any of that stuff for granted, is probably one of the main reasons why we're so successful.  Each guy understands the significance of being able to win and knowing how to win, as well.
If you take all of those things into account, you'll do better as far as going into each and every game knowing you're not so worried about winning but knowing how to do all the little things right in order for you to win.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Right now I feel like we're the underdog.  It's kind of weird to say that because we've won so many games.  Our record is crazy.  Sometimes you get into a situation where you got your back against the wall, the world is against you.  But I feel like this is motivation for us.  We love challenges.  I feel like that's the reason I came to Alabama, to be faced with the most hardest, the most craziest challenges in the world you could possibly face.  I just feels that builds character, makes you the best person you could possibly be.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Yeah, I would say.  Different things happen in college football, man.  So many things that go unplanned that you can't control.  The fact that we didn't get the chance to play in the SEC Championship, which was something like a ritual for us, it kind of sunk in deep for us, let us kind of understand that it doesn't matter how good you think you are, you know, results are results.
For us, we're looking forward now to this game, not taking anything for granted, man.  We want to be as prepared as possible.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Man, to be honest with you, at this point I really don't even -- it's kind of like you play in a way, knowing each play could be your last.  We've had guys get off the bus and get hurt, so...
Even the little things, man.  I mean, anybody can get hurt at any time.  For us, man, we literally take each snap like it's our last.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: At that point it was kind of like, This is ridiculous, man.  I've never had so many people get hurt in one season, in a short span of time.  Sometimes it's almost like it's in spurts.  I mean, we've almost done everything possible that we can to stay healthy, even the little things, so...
Man, I mean, once again, that's one of those things you can't control.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I thought you was crazy.  I would have thought you was crazy.  That is a lot of guys, big-time guys, that contributed a lot to our defense that got hurt, so...
To be honest with you, man, I'm just very proud of this whole defense, the fact that we was able to fight through so much adversity.  Most defenses would have folded, for sure, losing as many guys as we did.  We were able to hold the fort, get us to this point we're at right now.
It kind of just shows you the character of each player that was able to play.  I mean, we were fighting for our lives.  The fact that we were able to get some of the guys back, you saw the results.  They were a lot better.
Once again, the fact that we lost Anthony, one of our top guys, it's always something.  I mean, we've been through it so many times this season, man, we kind of know how to maneuver, know how to put the right guys in place for them to back up those guys.  It's nothing new, to be honest with you.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Anthony is a strong-minded guy, man.  I know he's taking it a little hard, the competitiveness in him.  I would think he would want to play in a big-time game like this.  Anybody would, to be honest with you.
Anthony, for the first time I feel like in his whole season, he was able to show what can he do when he's healthy.  The fact that he went down like he did, man, it kind of hurt me because I know what it feels like to be hurt.  I know how much time and effort he put into getting prepared for that game.  Not only that, but the whole season.  The fact he was able to fight through all the pain he did through the whole season, it hurts, man.
The fact that I was able to kind of understand how he felt, the things that he was going through, I mean, a lot of guys can really relate to that, to be honest with you.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: For sure.  He was one of those guys that he definitely prepared himself for each game, man.  You just see the results.  He does all of the little things right.
Anybody who does the things that he does, puts as much effort and hard work into football itself, sky's the limit.  That's the reason why he's so successful right now, for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: For me, just being able to go through all those things, man.  I mean, any situation that ever happens to me, it wouldn't be nothing new.  Regardless of how bad it is, I definitely won't fold.  I've literally had to work all the way from the mud to the top, man, to be honest with you.
But the good thing about all of that, it builds character.  It made me unselfish, made me the player I am today.  I feel like my grind is a lot harder than it's ever been, the fact that I know any play could be my last.
I know there was a time where I was sitting three deep in the depth chart, you know what I'm saying?  One of those challenges I had to face coming to college.  I was top recruit, whatever it is.  Coming in, wanted to play right then.  I mean, I didn't get that chance.  At the same time I look back on it all, I just take it and learn from it.  I know right now, going towards the future, I'll be ready for whatever it is that comes towards me.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: The fact that we've been in this game so many times, we kind of know to get rid of all of the bright lights, let everybody understand this is another football game.  Don't make it any bigger than what it is.  A lot of guys get out there, they get anxious, they get tight, do things they normally don't do.
For me, every time I've ever played in this game, I've always just tried to do my job.  I feel like the plays are going to come to you if you just do every simple thing you possibly can do right.  Coach Saban does a great job of telling us every little thing as far as preparation counts in this game.
To be honest with you, that started yesterday.  I feel like we've done a great job in practicing, meetings, all those things, just hitting the main things we need to do in this game, man.  I feel like we'll be ready.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Some of these guys could be superstars anywhere in the country.  There's so much talent on this defense.  Even now, a lot of people don't really even get to see the full potential of this whole defense because literally most of these guys are playing injured.  That's how tough a lot of these guys are.  Some of the injuries that some of these guys have, playing on other teams, they would never be able to do that.  They're not wired like that.  A lot of these guys are wired the right way.  I feel like the fact they're able to do these type of subhuman, abnormal-type things, it's crazy.  It shows you the character of these guys.  They truly care about not only just winning but at the same time playing for the next guy beside them.  This is the main thing we preach here.  It may not be so much how you feel, but what you need to do as far as getting the job done.  We've done a great job of that.  I think that's the reason why we're here, why we played so good in that game.
You can complain about how you feel right now, be hurt all season because you lost the biggest game of your life.  If you can kind of put those things aside, understand the task at hand, I feel like you'll be a lot better off in the long run.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Clutter?  Oh, man, things that don't matter.  Things that jog your mind.  I mean, it can be from the little things, what people say in the media, things that you can't control.
I feel like for us, we do a great job of tuning all of those things out.  There was a lot of clutter for us that we had going on during the season where people thought that we had lost our edge, we had lost all of our versatile guys, that we weren't the defense we were supposedly supposed to be.
I feel like we did a great job.  I feel like just from the results, the reason why we're here, we did all of the right things.  We basically got rid of all of the clutter.  But I'm just happy for most of these guys being able to fight through so much adversity, be able to be here right now, play once again for another national championship.
Q. What was the process?
RASHAAN EVANS: What was the process?  I mean, it starts from, like, the littlest things, from rehab, making sure you get all the sleep you could possibly get, eating right, watching film, getting prepared for each and every game.  All of those things count.
We've done every single thing that you could possibly do to be at this point right now.  I mean, to be honest with you, I'm very shocked the fact that we're in this right now, the fact that we've been through so much on this team.  A lot of stuff that we've been through, the media has never seen.  A lot of stuff has went down.  For us to be in this position right now, I'm just so proud of these guys.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Absolutely.  I feel like we've evolved as a team and mindset-wise.  I feel like our mindset is so much different now, the fact we've been through so many things, we know what it feels like to be at the bottom.
Not only that, but I feel like now we got some of our guys back, it makes our defense that much more versatile now.
Coach Saban has reiterated over and over again that this is an opportunity of a lifetime not everybody gets.  What you do right now, you know, will basically count in that game.
Right now our preparation is probably higher than it's ever been.  We truly have been focused so hard on doing all the right things.  I feel like that's going to count in the game towards the end.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: It means a lot.  My brother, he was one of those great athletes, as well.  To be honest with you, I feel he's more athletic than I am.  He's done track, swim, he's done it all, horseback riding.  Everything you can possibly think of, he's done.  He's a musician.  He can play the piano.  Just the fact that he's able to cheer for me, man, it makes my game go up even more.
I think it's very unique the fact that I have a brother on the sideline cheering me on.  Whenever I walk off the field, I always see him, give him a hug, the Walk of Champions, all those things.  That's one of those moments I soaked in.  The fact this is my last year, I loved every minute of it, to be honest with you.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Some of the guys have constantly told me to overemphasize everything, overdo everything, whether it's film, treatment, just doing a lot of those things constantly, over and over again.  I feel like sometimes the best thing is to be overprepared than underprepared.  That's what they constantly told me each and every day.
The fact that they were able to come back and be around us, that motivates us even more.  To be honest with you, the fact that we lost, I feel like we're still kind of carrying out that promise to be able to finish it off like we wanted to.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Do I have an opinion?  I mean, to be honest with you, that's how we have fun.  The fact that we were able to face, once again, another national championship, have a different type of challenge again, to be able to go against a great team like Georgia, that just adds more fuel to the fire, to be able to fight through all the things we fought through, be able to play the best game we could possibly play in this game.
One of those moments right there, man, that shows you how Scott is wired.  He wants to be the best, regardless of what it is.  I think that was the symbolism of that.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, yeah, definitely.  It definitely got us pumped up.  I feel like now we're focused, we're motivated, we are just ready for this game.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: How does he use fear?  Just being physical.  If you can be the most physical team on that field, I feel like most guys, they kind of fold.  They get to a point where they don't want to play anymore.  I feel like we do a great job of that, making sure we execute, which is number one, and secondly, be physical.  You add both of those right there, any team would have a hard time beating you.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: To be honest with you, we really haven't talked about it at all.  I mean, that's in the past.  We feel like we have a new opportunity, a new challenge, a new year.  We're just excited about the fact that we get to face another great team, just have another opportunity at playing another national championship.
That's really been the main focus.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: It almost was kind of like learning to see how good we really are.  I feel like we responded very well, just the fact that we faced so many things during the season.  Not only that, I mean, everybody just kind of banded together.  That was one of those moments where we got our backs against the wall, let's come together, have this great chemistry to be able to play as one.  I feel like that's the reason why -- I think somebody asked me about superstars.  I feel like the whole defense is a superstar.  They can play anywhere in the country and be a superstar.  We just got so many great talents on this defense, not only that, but great guys.  All these guys are wired the right way.  They play physical football.  They play tough.  They able to fight through any type of adversity that they're faced with.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, man, that was a great duo right there.  Just the fact that I had both of those guys in my living room, being able to see those guys, really see the type of person they are.  Sometimes you see them in media, you only see that type of aspect of the type of person they are.  They gave me a whole different perception of the type of person they are.  Coach Saban, Kirby, each one of them have a sense of humor, very funny guys.  I got a chance to actually see that.  Not all guys get a chance to see that.  That was one of those moments I definitely remember because right now that might never happen again.  That was one of those great moments, man, that I definitely remember for the rest of my life, for sure.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I think it's very ironic.  It was kind of like it was supposed to happen like this.  Kirby was one of those type of guys I felt like if he were ever able to get a head coaching job, he would be great at it.  Same way I feel about Coach Pruitt.  Great defensive scheme type guys, great in their play calling.  They're very smart as far as being able to put guys in the right place to be successful.  I think that's the reason why Kirby is having so much success.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: No doubt.  That's the usual.  I mean, Kirby does a great job of recruiting.  He's always been like that.  I think now it's going to be a triangle where you have Coach Pruitt, Kirby, Coach Saban.  They'll probably be the top coaches in the SEC.  I'll be looking forward to that, to see how that pans out.
Q. Looking forward to seeing Kirby this week?
RASHAAN EVANS: I would love it.  Definitely after the game, I'll give him a hug, let him know I miss him.  All the times we did have, I definitely enjoyed it for sure.
Q. Watching you Monday night, you guys put on a show.
RASHAAN EVANS: I feel like even right now, it's the same motto.  We came here to play a big game.  I think the guys now are more focused than ever.  Hopefully we have the same results we did last week.
Q. Great backs you're facing.  How do you make the comparison versus what you expect to see Monday night and what you have seen already in practice?
RASHAAN EVANS: What I have seen in practice, I mean, guys that can make big plays.  To be honest with you, the guys that we face in practice already, Bo, Damien, that type of duo, they kind of like the same thing:  power and finesse.  They're guys that can break tackles, extend plays.  We see that each and every day.
The things I'm expecting to see on game day is kind of the same thing, to be able to try to do all those things they do.  I feel like now with Kirby, the way he thinks, they're going to try to spread it out, get the players the ball, extend plays.  That's something I definitely expect.
As far as the defense, we're going to play our game, do all the right things, just execute.
Q. All season long as linebackers, it has been the next man up.  Talk about that mindset.
RASHAAN EVANS: No doubt, we faced so many adversities with linebackers in our crew.  Each guy that does step in place for the other guy, they always play very well.  You've seen the results with Mack.  Mack has done a great job in preparation for this game.  I'm just excited for him to actually be able to play in a national championship game.
I remember my first time playing in it.  It was probably one of the greatest moments of my life.  I just wanted something like that for him.  Not only for him, but other guys who may not be able to play, experience something like this, and not only that, but get a win, as well.
Q. (Question regarding the senior class.)
RASHAAN EVANS: Guys that not only have been patient, but at the same time have done all of the right things.  Just the fact that we have the record that we have, I mean, that just shows you all of the hard work we put in.
I still don't believe the record that they have on us as far as the winning and losing thing.  I think that's very unique, something that is going to be hard for anybody else to do for a long time.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Man, we're old now.  I mean, we're on our way out (laughter).
The fact we were able to have that experience, I feel like it's very unique and rare.  Me and JK have talked about it a couple times, just looked back, were like, Wow, not a lot of guys can say they've done this.
Once I leave here, look back on college, I'll know I had the best experience I could possibly have in college football.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Grimy, hard, physical, violent.  I mean, just what true football looks like.  They brought in the spread offense, nothing against that, I love it, but I think it comes down to just straight run the ball, defense stop the run, every now and then throw the ball.  I feel like that's what football is, man.
When I was growing up as a little kid, they ran the ball every time.  You just had to stop it.  If you could stop it, then that was good.  If you couldn't, then they would be running it down your throat each and every play.  That's the type of football you're going to see Monday night.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I love playing against SEC teams.  I love playing against great athletes that they have.  Each time I play an SEC game, I know what type of game I'm going to get.  It's going to be a physical game, I'm going to go against great athletes, it's going to be a great challenge.  It's going to fought for 60 minutes, for sure.
That's the type of games if you were wired the right way, you want to play in them.  That's the reason I came to 'Bama, to be able to play in games like this.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Just the fact that I know for sure, I know this in my heart, that a lot of guys on a lot of teams that would have went through the same things we went through, they wouldn't have been able to hold up.  There's so many things that y'all saw as a media.  You saw the injuries, you saw the little things, but you didn't really see the things inside of this whole thing.
I mean, just the mindset, being able to have to change your whole mindset, change schemes, change different players, change different types of ways we had to use players in the right way in order for them to be successful, as well.
I mean, it's so many things that went into each and every game.  I mean, it's one of those things that most teams can't handle.  Coach Saban, he's done a great job, Coach Pruitt, done a great job of just laying out the plan on how we're going to approach each and every game, have the mindset so we're ready to play the best game we could possibly play.
Q. This has been the hardest road?
RASHAAN EVANS: For sure, this has been the hardest road I've been on since I've been here.  Obviously we haven't had as many injuries as we've had this year.  Just the way we've done it is very unique to me.  Most of the time I remember just rolling through this, going through the SEC Championship, going through the playoffs, making it to the national championship game.  I'm not saying it's easy, but most of the time it's been the usual.
This has not been the usual.  This has been a straight dogfight, man.  Just literally having to really do all of the things you could possibly do in order to be in this position.
I feel like we've done a great job up to this point.  I'm just proud of these guys for fighting through all the things they did fight through.
Q. How are the coaches different?
RASHAAN EVANS: Those guys, just as coaches, man, to be honest with you, they're great mentors.  I feel like sometimes a lot of coaches get away from getting ahead of the actual player, letting him know he can trust you, letting him know you're going to coach him up, be the best coach possible in order for him to be the best player he can possibly be.
Any type of player that has that understanding, I feel like he's going to want to be coached the best way possible, he's going to listen to you.  Whatever it is you ask him to do, he's going to do it.
I feel like Coach Saban, Coach Pruitt, Coach Kirby, all the coaches that have come to 'Bama, they've learned those things.  You can see why they're so successful when they leave this place.  They know how to talk to players, do all of the little things in order for them to be successful and have success.
Kudos to those guys, man.  I could talk so much about just my time being here.  Man, those are one of the greatest coaches I've ever been able to be coached by.  They understand the players, man.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Man, I figured I was going to get asked that question.  To be honest with you, I just want to win (laughter).  I really want to win.  I mean, at this point I don't care who shows up.  (Indiscernible) can show up, I don't care.  As long as we win, that's the number one thing on my mind.
I think it is unique the fact that the president is coming to this game.  I think that shows you the type of caliber of game this is, the significance of it, the fact that a president is actually attending this game.
But just the fact that I'm able to be a part of it, be able to play in another national championship is one of those great things.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Most of time I shave it like three times a day.  You know what?  The last time we won, I actually had hair.  I'm not going to shave my head.  I'm only going to shave my head until we win.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: My favorite teammate?  I got to go with my roommate, man.  I got to go with my roommate, baby.  Cuddle up.  The fact we facing another national championship shows you we've been able to go through so much things.  It just shows you we ready for it, definitely.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: He's progressed a lot, man.  I feel like next year is definitely going to be his year.  He's a long, lengthy athlete.  He can run.  I feel like right now he's able to go through the things that I kind of went through, to be honest with you.  I think now he understands that next year, whenever he does have probably the biggest opportunity of his life, he will take full advantage of it, be ready for the task at hand.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Same thing.  I've actually talked to both of those guys, let them know all of the things that I've been through, kind of given them tips of things to do, what not to do.
The number one thing I've always told them is understand you always need to work while you wait.  Any opportunity can come at any time, but the best thing is to be prepared when the opportunity shows up.
I think those guys will be prepared regardless of what it is.  You might even see those guys in this game.  Craziest things happen in the national championship, college football itself.  I'm proud for those guys to continue to progress as they are, and the sky is the limit for them.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Minkah, just the most impressive thing about him, his athleticism, but his preparation is unique.  A lot of guys just play football.  They have success at it.  But Minkah does all of the little things right.  He watches film.  He takes care of his body.  I think now Minkah does a great job of just doing all those little things you will see in an NFL player.  I think that's the reason why he has so much success.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, man, I definitely embrace that.  I still think it's crazy the fact that I'm in another national championship.  It's almost kind of numbing to me, the fact I've been in so many of them, played in so many of them.  I've won and lost at the same time.
The craziest things have happened in each game for me.  The things that I take away from each and every game is just to do all of the right things you can possibly do, control what you can control.  The number one thing is to always be prepared just for anything that comes your way.
I've been trying to be as best of a mentor to a lot of these guys who have never faced anything like this, to let them understand whenever you come in this game, some of the things that you want to go as planned, they never go as planned.  For a lot of these guys, they've done a great job in preparation and practice.  I'm just excited for them to be able to have another opportunity to be a part of something like this.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I'm trying to soak it all up.  It's going by so fast, man.  It's almost like a blur.  I remember just the first time we played here was Florida State.  That's when I got hurt.  To be honest with you, I kind of want to redeem myself, the fact that I can actually finish a game here.  This is another challenge for me to be able to face.  Once again, I'm just excited, the fact I'm able to have another opportunity at another national championship.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: The seniors that went out last year, they didn't get a chance.  I have the opportunity to do that now with this senior class.  My preparation has been at its highest since I've been here.  I'm just ready to play the best game that I can possibly play since I've been here.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: Oh, man, I have not thought about that.  I've been so cluttered in this game, it's kind of hard for me to think about life after football.  I don't know how to react.  I don't know if this is going to be an emotional game for me, to be honest with you.  I don't know if I'm going to cry.
I'm just very humbled and very blessed.  Even though I've been hurt so many times, even though I've been in the depth chart at the bottom, been able to come up, I just enjoy the whole experience.
Q. (Indiscernible)
RASHAAN EVANS: I feel like we have to scheme it on the fly almost.  You never know what they might bring at us.  Both teams know each other very well.  I would expect for them to do something maybe a little different.  Other than that, I feel like as we can kind of continue to get prepared more and more, this game is going to really come down to who plays the best and who is most physical.
