Q. So I'm wondering, we all have this image of Coach Saban as kind of like a perfectionist on the sidelines and this whole thing.  What's he like during games in the heat of battle?
RASHAAN EVANS: He's intense as hell.  He's very, very intense.  If he was 007, he would be 007.  Yeah, he'd be 007, man.  This guy is focused, man.  You can literally be ringing a bell next to him, he would not even notice it.  That's how focused he is.  It's really tunnel vision.
When he wants to get something done, he's going to get it done.  So that's kind of how he is.
Q. How much is it that you're like the position coach interacting with him, how much is it you interacting with him during games?
RASHAAN EVANS: I would say my position coach interacts with me more, because he is my position coach.  Even then when we're in practice, he kind of pitches in his own thing of how I should do things.  He gives me a broader view of what should happen.  So both of them go hand in hand.  That's kind of how it's supposed to be anyway.  But he's a great coach anyway.
Q. Do you have anything from this season where he came over and said something to you that clicked?
RASHAAN EVANS: Basically, just have confidence.  He believes that I can do the job and get the job done.  Anybody that he puts on the field can get it done.  So the fact that he has enough confidence in you to get it done, you should have the same, if not more, for yourself.  So that's kind of what he tells me each practice.
