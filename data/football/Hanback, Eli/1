Florida - 36, Virginia - 28
Q. Eli, it's obviously difficult every time you lose a game, but can you talk about the approach that this team took, on a stage this big?
ELI HANBACK: I'm so proud of these guys, man. It's been an honor and a privilege and a blessing to be here and to play with these guys. We worked our butts off, two weeks, we played a very good opponent, very talented opponent. But we were right there. I hope for the guys who come back next year that they know where the threshold is at, they know how hard they need to work, and next time I hope they get it done. But we put our hearts in this. We just came up a little short today.
Q. After the Clemson game we talked about in a couple of weeks of preparation, you guys made tremendous strides. What sticks out to you about your preparation that produced such a competitive result out there?
ELI HANBACK: I think when we played Clemson, we saw the game. We didn't play our best game, and we knew we needed to bring our "A" game to compete with these guys. It's an SEC team and top 10, they're like 10-2. We knew we had to be much better than what we did last week. So we just tried, we worked, and we're right there.
Q. What adjustments did you guys make? They put up 24 in the first half. You guys really -- they put up three in the third quarter. You guys started to get to Trask more. Talk about the adjustments made at halftime really to be productive on D.
ELI HANBACK: I mean, I think the focus every time is to stop the run or limit the run game. That really makes teams one-dimensional. We knew this team liked to throw the ball a lot, get it to skill players, but I think we did a much better job in the second half of stopping the run and making them have to throw the ball.
