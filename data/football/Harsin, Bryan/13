 OLE MISS   35
  BOISE STATE - 13 
  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Fire away.   
   
 Q.   Offensively obviously missed opportunities in the first half.   Looking back how important were those couple of drives in the first half?  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, well, I think you start with the turnovers on the offensive side.   We'll start with that.   You know, you've got four turnovers there, it's hard, you lose those opportunities in drives.   But we had some chances for some big plays, and that's what you've got to do.   You're playing a good defense, and you want to move the ball down the field, change field position.   You saw that in the second half that they were able to do it.   You get some of those big chunks, it allows you to create some tempo with what you're doing.   You stay ahead of the change there and then you get some big plays.  
We've got to go back and look at it, and the opportunities are there.   It's cashing in on those opportunities.   We have guys to do that.   We just have to do it.   We've got to go out there and do it.   That's the bottom line.   
   
 Q.   What did you see from Grant tonight, a couple of interceptions, maybe some ill‑advised throws?  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, there were some things in there, like a lot of guys on the team on both sides, it's the first game, there's some jitters, there's some mistakes that are made.   He wasn't perfect, but I thought he played well.   I thought he settled in there in the second half.   He made some throws, checked the ball down, had some good decisions.   A couple of those throws might have been ill‑advised, a couple of those throws were going for big plays.   That's one thing with our quarterbacks is we want those guys to go in there and have a mindset of making that play, and there were some good plays made on the ball, too.   
We'll go back and look at it and clean those things up, but Grant overall without watching the tape, I thought he competed, played hard.   I liked his demeanor on the sideline.   It's a matter of improving what we're doing in that area.  
   
 Q.   Jay had 32 touches, Shane had 14 catches.   Are you still searching for options there?   
BRYAN HARSIN:   Well, I think if you base it off your statistics, yeah.   I don't necessarily feel that way.   I felt we had some guys in there that we were trying to get the ball to.   That's just sometimes the way it works.   Those guys being good players, and you're talking about check downs and things like that for Jay, those guys get themselves in position to have opportunities to get the ball, and we're trying to get the ball to some other guys, but ultimately until we do it, yeah, we had to establish somebody else other than Matt, other than Shane, other than Jay that can go out there and make some plays, and we didn't do that yet.   We've got to keep working on it.   
   
 Q.   What did you see from the defense tonight, first three quarters?   Obviously held them to seven points.   
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, I mean, those guys, I saw the D‑line‑‑ I'll say one thing, I heard a lot about the other D‑line.   I thought our D‑line played well tonight.   I give those guys a lot of credit.   I thought they played well.   I thought they played hard.   I thought our linebackers‑‑ defense looked good.   We gave up some big plays.   I think you go back, and that's what football is about, we gave up some big plays and it changes the game and the score changes and it looked completely different than what it really is.   We have to eliminate that, but at the same time it's a team game.   Both sides have to complement each other, and our defense for three quarters is doing everything they can to put us in position to go score, and we need to take advantage of that opportunity.   At some point the other side has to complement what one side is doing, and I thought they played well.   
I'd like to still see them finish regardless of what happens with anybody else.   You want to see them finish and play the whole four quarters like that.   
   
 Q.   You guys spent a ton of time preparing over the past eight months.   Seemed like they had a ton of false starts.   You guys seemed clean and prepared for this game.   What did you think of the way your team came into this game?  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, I think from all that, all those unnecessary penalties, I don't think we had many of those.   There's some holding penalties and some things on defense that I've got to go back and watch, but yeah, it was clean.   The operation was clean.   
You know, we had, I think, guys in position that we hoped we'd have, and like I said before, we need to take advantage of those opportunities.   
Our guys take a lot of pride in their preparation.   It showed up, and we need to continue that.   That shouldn't change.   But we need to find ways to keep moving the ball, especially from the offensive side where we can take advantage of going out there and having good operation but making those drives end.   A couple of those drives, we get down there on the goal line and we don't finish it, that's difficult.   Our team didn't deflate, and that's one thing about these guys.   They came back, they did it again, and that was one thing for me you still wonder as you get into a game exactly what everybody is going to do and how they're going to operate, and our team didn't deflate there and those guys kept battling.   But that changes it.   We're down there inside the 5‑yard line, we get two scores, momentum changes and that's what the game is about.   
   
 Q.   You just talked about getting close and not punching it in.   Was that a matter of not being physical enough?   Was it something that they did?   Were you a little upset with maybe not being able to move them on the line of scrimmage in close quarters?  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Well, yeah, I think that's a battle inside.   We tried to run it in there and tried to be physical, and they were physical back.   I mean, it was a battle.   I don't know where it broke down or what happened.   I couldn't say that right now.   But obviously we don't get it in and we're trying to run the ball, then you would assume that somehow, some way they out‑physicaled us in that situation there.   We've got to go back and obviously find a way to get it in.   You're on the 5‑yard line, you worked all that way to get down there.   We've got to be able to punch it in.   We just weren't good enough tonight to get that done.   
   
 Q.   Donte Deayon kind of came in and out of the game at times.   Seemed like he was trying to warm up on the sidelines.   Is he all right?   And obviously Tyler Horn came off the field, as well.   
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, Tyler wasn't able to go back in, and I don't know the extent of that yet.   Donte kind of dinged up a little bit, back and forth, trying to get himself going, had Brian in there, had Moxey in there, both those guys.   They played.   Both those guys have done a good job, so give them an opportunity to go out there and let them play a little bit.   I don't know if he could have gone back in or not.   I don't think there was anything saying he couldn't at that point, but you had a couple other guys that you were feeling pretty good about, so a guy gets dinged up, let them go play.  
   
 Q.   Knowing the caliber of Ole Miss, how do you leave here, encouraged, discouraged?  
BRYAN HARSIN:   Well, disappointed because we didn't win.   That's what we came here to do.   We came here to win, bottom line.   We're not going to sit there and make excuses for not going out there and winning the ballgame.   That's not what we do.   We'll find ways to get better.   I'm proud of our team.   I'm extremely proud of our coaches, how they operated.   The things that we emphasized showed up, and we weren't good enough to get it done tonight, bottom line.   
We'll go back and we'll go back to work, and the thing about it is whether we had won this game or lost this game, we needed to go back to work.   It's never good enough, and we're going to find ways to prepare ourselves when we play at home next week, we've got Colorado State which is a good football team, and we've got to find ways from now until we show up and play those guys on Saturday to get better, and that doesn't change whether we win or lose, that's just how we do it.   
   
 Q.   The offensive line tonight seemed like a little overwhelmed early, first quarter, and then second half seemed to do a pretty good job.   Did they play better?   What happened there?   
BRYAN HARSIN:   Yeah, I don't know even early on they were overwhelmed because we ran a couple plays now that I thought our guys as far as just shape and tempo and all that, you didn't see our guys laying on the field.   That's one thing about our team tonight that I saw.   I didn't see anybody laying on the field.   Nobody is out there gassed, nobody is out there holding their hamstring or anything like that like they're cramped up.   Our guys played.   
And so that tells me a lot about the type of shape we're in.   We came into this game, I think we were fresh, came into this game with the mentality, and ultimately it comes down to execution.   As far as how our guys played and played up front, I thought they did a heck of a job against a good D‑line.
