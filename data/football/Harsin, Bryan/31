  Q. Now that you've had time to look at the tape, talk about the game Saturday.   
 COACH HARSIN: Yeah, you know, I think in Garrett's situation there, we had that pick early on there that we made the right read on. The receiver needs to be in that position right where he threw the ball. Also on the second one we were taking a shot and that safety got deep there and we were trying to get the ball back behind him and the guy went up and made a good play. So those are all things that we've talked about and worked on in practice and those type of things.   
 But obviously the turnovers we've got to eliminate who matter who it is out there, and that was probably our number one thing we talked about on offense is eliminating turnovers.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)   
 COACH HARSIN: I thought Case did a nice job coming in. He provided a spark. We just were in that situation offensively. I always look at it, tight end, running back, receiver, if there's somebody we need to make a change to help us out in a certain situation, we'll do that. Case came in and I think provided some energy, and we got rolling a little bit and David was having his package and then started getting going with what he was doing and we were utilizing him more this last game, and those two guys I thought did a great job of executing their assignments and really just kind of their leadership, both those guys, in and out of the huddle, and how we had to switch them back and forth. That was something in the game plan that changed when we had that change in there, and those guys didn't flinch one bit. They kept battling, they kept hanging in there, and I thought that was a big reason why we were able to, at the end, finish the game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Well, you know, right now after the game, going into this week of practice, Case will go in there in the beginning with the ones. Garrett is going to continue to battle. Garrett has done a nice job, and in that situation there, we talked about it, we can't have the turnovers. That's obvious from any quarterback position. But I think Garrett has done a nice job. He's always prepared well, he's always ready to play. He did a great job in the first game.   
 This week of practice, that position is fluid, and those guys got to continue to compete like every other position, and that's just where we are offensively. It'll be a competitive game for every position, competitive practices for every position each game, and who practices well that week is going to be the one that goes out there and plays.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Yeah, it'll continue to grow. You know, in that particular game there was more in for him than there was the week before, and ideally there's more in this game for him than there was this last game. You could see he can throw the ball. He's done a great job with that. He's made some great decisions. He can catch the ball; you saw that out there.  
 We're just kind of bringing David along, and he knows that each week there's more and more for him, and obviously he's dialed into the entire game plan and ready to go play. So we'll just continue to build that way with him.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: You know, for the rest of the guys, they did great. We were rotating those two quarterbacks back and forth, but those guys, they're just executing their assignments regardless of who the quarterback is. I thought those guys did a fantastic job. They can't flinch one bit. Case was in, David was in, and those guys went out there and executed their assignments.  
 It really comes down to everybody doing their job regardless of who's in there, and they've got to do that, the ten other guys have got to take care of what they need to get done, and the quarterback, whether we rotate or not, that's kind of based on what I need to do with those guys.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Yeah, well, I thought we created some rhythm going back and forth. I mean, that's one thing. We switch a lot of personnels in there, and I think the quarterback position we're able to do that, as well, and those guys handled it, and it showed in the BYU game that those guys could do that. I thought the rhythm went well.   
 You know, we'll kind of work that more in the plan this week. That was an adjustment that we made during the game, and those guys adjusted during the game. I thought they handled it well.   
  
  Q. Your second halves have been better than the first halves. Do you think it's a matter of the coaches making (indiscernible)?   
 COACH HARSIN: I think a little bit of both. Just from the coaches' side, there's not a lot from that standpoint. I really think it's the players making adjustments of just what they're seeing out there from their opponent and those guys being in great condition to come out in the second half and finish a game. I think that our summer program, our conditioning program has showed up in these last two games with what we've done in the second half.  
 And speaking of that, just obviously our goal was to start fast, but we also talked about finishing strong, and we did that, and I thought it showed a lot of character about our team. We learned a lot about our team and were able to finish a tight game where BYU the last week was just in a tight game and pulled it out. So I think those guys will be confident from that standpoint of their conditioning and being able to finish.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Yeah, those guys are very good up front. I know that. Their D-line, their linebackers are very good. We're facing a front seven that's very solid. They like the corners. Their safeties get involved in the run game, their corners play one-on-one coverage outside.  
 So they're well coached and they're good players, so those guys are going to play hard, they're going to be at home, and we've got to expect that. It's going to be a physical game, and that's what we expect from UCLA.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: You know, each week is a little bit different just with the game plan and how we start the game and what our opening plays are going to be. I thought Coach Applewhite has done a great job of rotating those guys with Fozzy and Cody in there and Malcolm in there because at the end of the games we've had Malcolm at the end of the game where he's been in there running the ball and been strong and looked fresh when we really needed it.   
 You'd ideally like to be in those situations where you're pounding the rock in the fourth quarter, and he's done that. I thought that last play where he went to kneel the ball down, he ran the ball and he broke two or three tackles right there, and I think just because he physically was fresh and obviously his will got him to that, but that was part of it, just the rotation helped him.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Got no problems seeing him sooner. And that's, again, just kind of based off what we're trying to start the game with and what our plan is, and so whether he comes out and starts the game in the beginning and Fozzy finishes the game, Cody finishes the game, whatever that may be, that will be based off those early reps in the game for the running back. With Fozzy coming to take some earlier reps there, Malcolm was fresh, came in in the second half, finished the fourth quarter and did a great job.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Well, he's very smart. He's a smart football player. I think he's got some gamesmanship to him out there where he just kind of feels it. I thought the 4th down and -- I think it was 4th and 5 that he threw to DJ Grant, that was probably the most critical play in the game because if we don't make that there, we're potentially 23 to 10 if they go down and score. We had a little bit of an alignment issue on that one there and those guys kind of ad libbed the play there at the end; Case put it right on him. So he provides some extra confidence of making those type plays, keeping a play alive and executing like he did in some critical situations.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Only on TV. I know I watched them but I never got to analyze Colt and the way he played and all that. Obviously I know he's a great quarterback, but Case did a great job coming in. That's the one thing. The hardest position I think on our team is the backup quarterback position because you have to prepare and be ready to go when your number is called and know everything that's going on even though you're not in the flow of the game in the beginning, and he came in and did that. We didn't have to cut anything out. We used David a little bit more, but Case is capable of running that entire package.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 COACH HARSIN: Yeah, all those guys are. Every one of those guys in our game plan could come in there and execute the game plan. You know, David has got his role with certain things, but all those guys are capable of doing that. They can run those plays. David can run all those plays that Case ran and Garrett has run, and they're all prepared to do that. In a perfect world you have the scenario that we had where David has got his deal and Case was in there running what he was doing, but if David had to play, he would know what we need to get done with the rest of the entire offense.   
  
  Q. Talk about how Garrett reacted.   
 COACH HARSIN: Garrett was fantastic, he really was. You know, the one thing about Garrett, I'm really proud of him. I've been proud of him the way he's prepared for games. I was proud of him the way he responded, his leadership out there on the field. He was talking to wide outs, he was talking to the quarterbacks in the huddle, he was talking to Case, talking to David, telling them what he saw out there and reminded them of certain things. He was fantastic. I was talking to him on the headset, we were chatting back and forth and he's giving me some thoughts of what he's seeing out there. Just his maturity, his leadership really showed in that situation right there, and we talk about it being all about Texas; he really was. He was a perfect example of that, and we're proud of him for doing that.
