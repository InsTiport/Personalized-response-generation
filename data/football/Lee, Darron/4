Ohio State   42
  Alabama - 35

Q.   Talk about it. 
DARRON LEE:   I really think it's on the defense, man, I wouldn't take that‑‑ taking out the whole defense, our defense we stepped up, and we righted the storm, righted the storm that came out. 
I really appreciate it if you gave that to our entire defense, with all due respect.

Q.   What's this mean for the program and what do you have to do keep going forward?
DARRON LEE:   We're back.   We're back.   Those that thought we were gone, we're back. Be afraid, be very afraid.
