Kansas State - 42, Baylor - 21
Q. You guys were in pretty good position there at halftime.  What happened there in the second half?
ZACH SMITH: We just didn't go out and execute like we had to.  K State came out and executed and they played really great football.  We, offense or defense, we didn't execute coming out for the second half and when you don't do that, you lose.
Q. You had played pretty clean, hadn't thrown a pick, were those on you, receivers running wrong routes, what -- the three picks?
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, the first two were completely on me.  I just tried to force the ball and maybe fit it in too tight of a window.
The third one, I'm not real sure.  I think that Blake said the ball was in the sun.  I don't know if he could see it or not.  It might have been high.  I'm not sure.  But, yeah, the others were on me, for sure.
Q. What's just the mood in the locker room right now?  Obviously, you guys wanted to come out and do this for the seniors today.  What's just the level of disappointment right now?
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, we're obviously frustrated.  We didn't go out and send those seniors out at home like we wanted to.  But we still got two games to go out and win out and that's what we need to do.
Q. As far as having the first game under your belt and playing all four quarters, what was that experience like?  And do you already kind of pick up off of things that maybe will be differently next time?
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, went out there, played four quarters.  It was, obviously, a little bit more than I've done before, but I think it helps with my experience.  And next week I think I'll be able to pick up on some more things and maybe not be, maybe not try to force as many things as I did.
