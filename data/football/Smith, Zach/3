ZACH SMITH: I think everybody can see we lost week one here in the same stadium, and we came back and had the ball to get down and score.  Couldn't really get it done, but that was an exhilarating game.  It was really fun.  It really shows us who we are and how great we can be.  So we have to keep up the momentum.   
 Q.  Where's the line between liking where you guys are heading but being disappointed in the loss?  
ZACH SMITH: Yeah, obviously we're disappointed to lose.  I think we had some really great things in that game.  O-line stepped up, defense stepped up.  You know, receivers really, really stepped pup.  Backs played good.  So, yeah, we're sad that we lost.  We're happy to see some new things, but we're hungry.  We're hungry to go out and move on and play K-State next week.   
 Q.  Does the loss make it even hungrier?  
ZACH SMITH: Absolutely, yeah.   
 Q.  Offensive line struggled early on still.  Kind of a work in progress with moving parts.  But today it looks like they gave you more time.  How much did that spark you guys?  
ZACH SMITH: I think that helped a ton.  We've still got to get better in the run game, which I think is coming.  But O-line played their butts off.  Porter went down early, first quarter or something like that.  Josh Malin came in and played a great game.  He played a great game.  O-line for the most part had an outstanding game.  So can't give enough praise to them.  Without them, I couldn't be able to sit back and deliver the ball.
