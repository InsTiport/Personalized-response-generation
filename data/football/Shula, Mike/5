<p>	Q.  With your experience in the booth and pro football, what is your thoughts on instant replay?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the injuries Brodie has had overcome the last couple of years, how that's affected you guys if you think he's --</p>
<p>	Q.  Have had a lot of problems with people getting in trouble, you haven't had a lot of that.  Talk about just how you approach that and how you deal with it?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the plan with Brodie in terms of practice; will he get the full speed contact before the first time?  How are you going to handle it how you are going to get him ready?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your team always has high expectations, but how do you battle now, you talked about the depth and getting back from the scholarship losses, with the lack of depth compared to where you'd like it to be and the expectations seemingly getting higher how do you battle those two, especially the expectations?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your opinion on the BCS voting procedure and the new changes that have been instituted in that procedure?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have seen your name on the dreaded hot seat list in the preseason magazines things like that.  Is that fair do you feel like Alabama this year is in position to compete for the SEC title again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that the trials are over with even though the university had nothing to do with it, is that era officially in the past and ramifications continue to affect your program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously the way you called the game changed after Brodie went down last year.  What does he allow you to do this year that you weren't able to do with the guys last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Leadership on defense you talked about.  Specifically address with DeMeco Ryans has meant to your program on and off the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  With some untimely injuries last year and No. 1 defense in the nation, and really a play away from winning the LSU game, how close do you really think you all are this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You obviously understand that criticism is second guessing; particularly from us, goes with the territory and not to mention the fans.  Under the circumstances did you find yourself wondering if you should have pulled Brodie last year and will you look at a different approach this year based on his injury history?</p>
