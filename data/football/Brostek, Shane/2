 Q.  Talk about the game in particular.  How tired are you going to be of hearing about how good Alabama is from Saturday?  I mean, that's been the narrative for weeks now, really.  
SHANE BROSTEK: Yeah.  Well, I mean, they are.  So they deserve it, you know.  They're number one in the nation, so can't argue that.  But they're another team.   
 Q.  Have you guys been doing anything different in practice, in particular, to prepare for this defense?  Everybody talks about how fast they are, especially.  Is there anything you guys can do to sort of simulate that?  I know you guys' defense is fast.  Like swinging a weighted bat in baseball, do you do anything along those lines?  
SHANE BROSTEK: No.  We're just preparing the same all week, kind of just approach it the same.
