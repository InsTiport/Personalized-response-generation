 Q.  When you're trying to build a program as you guys get to this level consistently, how beneficial is it to see an Alabama who's been here for years and see how they work?  
SHANE BROSTEK: I think it's tremendous, you know.  You can kind of see what one of the top teams in the nation is doing and, you know, compare that to what we're doing and see, like, what we can improve.   
 Q.  The front, Alabama's front, what sticks out to you that says maybe we can control this part?  
SHANE BROSTEK: Well, they're tremendous athletes, first of all.  But they're human and I think they play really well.  They strike really well.  But if we do our job and like we do our technique, we can match up with them, I think.  We got really good guys in the front.
