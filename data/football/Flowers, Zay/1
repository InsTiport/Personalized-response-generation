 Q.  Welcome to college football.  
ZAY FLOWERS: Thank you.   
 Q.  Got comfortable quick, obviously. What was it like to kind of come in?  
ZAY FLOWERS: It felt unreal at first, but after that first run, I just like -- A.B. just told me to play my game after that, and that's what I did.   
 Q.  (No microphone) A.B. said it's always nice to have a new car in the garage.  
ZAY FLOWERS: For now, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and working hard, listening to my coach, let A.B. teach me new things, and keep grinding.   
 Q.  A.B. was just in here a little while ago, talking about how he's taken the leadership role on himself. How do you guys feed off him, especially the guy in his first game? Do you follow his lead on everything?  
ZAY FLOWERS: Yeah, I follow him. If I mess up on a play, he'll come pick me up and tell me, just play your game, man. You'll be all right. Just keep going hard. That's what he told me after that sweep, and I caught a touchdown.
