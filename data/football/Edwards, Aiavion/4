Q. To come up with that big fourth down stop that you did when they had it right down near the goal line, how were y'all able to do that being as tired probably as you were?
AIAVION EDWARDS: Yeah, we were pretty tired but I think we all stuck together.  It was all for the team, so we just wanted to focus on that.  The offense, with the position we were put in, we were just trying to just make the best opportunity we could and came out and ended up with a turnover.  It was exciting and just glad that everybody kind of stuck together, was on the same page and able to execute the game plan.
Q. Coach Grobe said that he has never had a team work as hard as y'all did tonight.  What does that say?
AIAVION EDWARDS: I think it just says a lot about the team and the guys on it.  We were extremely excited to get out there and just play for the coaches that are here, and we want to work hard for one another, so I think it's not really a big deal.  We don't see it as anything a little different.  It's just we are going to work for our brothers and the guy beside us.
Q. What was the coverings like when they kept converting on third downs and multiple series, had to grow frustrating but how did y'all keep it together?
AIAVION EDWARDS: We just talk to one another.  We try to keep our heads straight, just pushing towards getting off the field.  That's a big thing, we just knew we had to get off the field.  So everybody just paying attention to what they needed to and everybody just executing what the call was at the time.
