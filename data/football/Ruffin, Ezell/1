Q.   How does it feel? 
EZELL RUFFIN:   Feels great, coming off a loss and coming back home and pulling through and getting a win, feels great, always good to win. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   Getting the win, feels great, great feeling. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   You said the deep ball?   You know, practice.   We worked on it all week.   Coach said we was going to take shots.   We did extra stuff at practice to make sure we had good timing and I think it paid off pretty good.

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   Yeah, after we watched film and saw that they played a lot of man coverage, coach said we got to go out there and stop them, and everybody made plays from Larry to Lloyd, Judge, everybody stepped up and did what they had to do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   Yeah.   I mean, you know, just make plays. 

Q.   What this a showing of the progress that you personally have been able to make since you came back? 
EZELL RUFFIN:   Yeah, I'm getting back in the rhythm of things, being out six weeks.   You know, just working hard.   Coming out, practicing hard, and, you know, when an opportunity is given, just go out there and make plays.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   We called a defensive play call that we had all week, it was in the game plan.   We called it, I was up on the line, I dropped out, I don't think the quarterback saw me dropping on the coverage, I read that route, and he was looking down and he kind of threw it right to where I was dropping.

Q.   What was your last interception? 
CALVIN MUNSON:   Senior year, high school.   Wasn't as dramatic as that but it was all right. 

Q.   Did you return long on that one? 
CALVIN MUNSON:   I think it was 20, 30 yards, whoever does that‑‑ I think it was Damontae who had that block for me.   If without that I wouldn't have got it in. 

Q.   You held them to 160 yards under their average.   How proud of you guys are that?   You've done that against other teams, how proud of that one are you? 
CALVIN MUNSON:   I would say the last couple of weeks, we started off strong, we always came out and one of our biggest things was finishing and tonight we put it together all four quarters.   We knew they were going to run the we knew they were going to try to pound it right at us and we knew we had to stop it early and stop it the whole game.   Proud of our guys. 

Q.   The fourth down stop? 
CALVIN MUNSON:   That was one of highest moments for me during the game, I think it was Christian, and Largent came in, and eight more of us flew in there.   It was a great feeling. 

Q.   Was it fun playing against Pearson and trying to stop him?   You guys did a pretty good job. 
CALVIN MUNSON:   Anytime you play a team like that ‑‑ and our defensive scheme was four linebackers, so we knew we were going to be scraping over the top, we were going to have to get the run.   It was a big linebacker game, but a lot of credit to the "D" line, the front six did a good job, and the safeties and DBs did a good job helping out on the passes.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   Late in the game they were going to start passing more, and they started giving us passing situations, so we put more DBs back there to get a little more coverage, but earlier in the game we knew they were going to come out and pound the ball and make a statement for their offense so we knew we had to‑‑ we just tried to stack the box and make plays on the run.

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   Like I said, it's just practice.   We knew going into the week that we were going to throw the ball a lot.   Coach Toledo told us, come out, work hard this week, and you will get a lot of opportunities.   And he never failed me, you know, it was great to be able to go back out there, make plays for the team.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   I mean, not really.   Coach Long came in and said, hey we gotta keep going out there; we're not going to change anything.   We are just going to keep playing our ball.   I mean, they are going to try to change some stuff, we just gotta act accordingly to what they do, and we just gotta keep playing the football that we practiced all week and all the game playing that we did.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   I'm not sure if they were expecting it or not, or how they acted towards it, but, I mean, for me, I thought it was really effective.   I mean credit to all the guys up front, I came free on a lot of plays, a lot of blockers that we saw on film that were getting the second level, they weren't getting to me tonight, so the linebackers and the "D" line did a great job taking them to those blocks opening lanes for the backers taking them over the top.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   After the two fumbles?   Not really.   Toward the beginning they were running their triple option, like the power into the option, and toward the end of the game they were running the zone and shotgun, so, I mean, I guess from that standpoint I guess it was a little different, but other than that it was kind of back and forth between those two things. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   He said no matter how hard he tried he couldn't throw a spiral.   We practiced that a lot, I want to say we threw it five times in practice and every time it wasn't a spiral.   I don't know, I should have caught it.   I lost it in the lights and then saw it at the last second but, you know, it happens.   It went straight up! 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EZELL RUFFIN:   Like I said, we practice all week, young guys, Jemond and Lloyd and them, they know when they have to make plays they make a plays, and that's just how Coach Mac tells us, when you get an opportunity make a play.   That's what we preach, making plays, our receivers here have a reputation of making big plays and from the past wide receivers, we just want to live up to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CALVIN MUNSON:   I mean, first and foremost glory to God, I give all the glory to him and another big thing is all the seniors that have taught me throughout the way, led me this year and everybody on defense is‑‑ I mean, a lot of credit to them, the "D" line and other backers allowing me to make plays and I give credit to all those guys. 

Q.   What is your biggest area of personal growth? 
CALVIN MUNSON:   I would say this year is dropping the coverage, I worked on that a lot on the off season and kind of the switch we did with the defense this year, I knew I was going to have to drop coverage more and so I worked on that and it's been paying off. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you, gentlemen.
