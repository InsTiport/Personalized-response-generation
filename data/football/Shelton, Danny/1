  THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
DANNY SHELTON:   My job is to continue to represent our community, be role models for the younger generations, the Polynesian community.   
PAC‑12 has always been recruiting Polynesian players.   It's been great to hear that our Polynesian people are doing great.   
Marcus Mariota with the Heisman win.   That's just saying it's possible for our people to grow up and become these new leaders that a lot of people need.   
It's awesome to hear that the East Coast and the South are also recruiting Polynesian players.   I think I heard that Oklahoma State has some Polynesian players.   
   
 Q.   And their MVP, offense, defense, everything.   
DANNY SHELTON:   Honestly, man.   It's overwhelming just to hear that.   We're probably related, down the line.   Tonga, Samoans, Hawaiian, I see a lot of these people as relatives when I play them.   PAC‑12, we had a pretty strong connection with each other.   
We're going to play our hardest against each other, give each other the best looks.   At the end of the game, we'll maybe pray, talk stories together.   It's just awesome to see how far we've come and see how much we've grown over the years.   
   
 Q.   What do you see out of Oklahoma State offensively?  
DANNY SHELTON:   I mean, they have some great players.   The quarterback has stepped up.   I commend him, man.   He's really doing a great job with the Oklahoma win.   I also see a lot of skilled players, pretty talented.   
Honestly, we're just going to have to step up our game.   It's a bowl game.   A lot of teams like to kind of slack off.   Oklahoma State, they're a great program.   We're going to have to do our best to lock down these skill players and this quarterback.
