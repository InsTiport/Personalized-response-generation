  Q. Since you are coming back next year and you are into this Bowl game, what's your thoughts about playing this game and how does that attitude carry over to what could be your potential for next year?  
 TANK CARDER: Oh, I mean, there is a lot on the line this year. Right now we are No. 4 in the nation and we are playing Boise State. If we come and do our thing in this game, we could definitely be top 3 next year going into pre-season. That would be awesome because that puts us on the stage for the national championship. That puts us on the stage for non-BCS schools doing well and a lot of talk.   
 I mean, it is real good, especially because we're getting almost everybody back on the defense. Hopefully we can just finish off this year and start next year and see what happens.  
  
  Q. When you played them last year in a Bowl game and won by one point, how do you think they're going to react to you in the Fiesta Bowl?   
 TANK CARDER: They're definitely coming back for revenge. That's a given, because losing by one point, that's a tough loss. Anybody loses by one point has got to be coming back with a grudge, chip on their shoulder, and get ready to take care of business.   
 With the same token, we are coming back, too. We have a great team just as Boise State does. It will be a fight. It will be a man's game. They will come out swinging.
