 Q.  Will you ever go back to the old way of using quarterbacks?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: I don't think we'd ever go back the other way. One thing I do know is college football is getting a lot like pro football. You've got to have a quarterback (no microphone). I think that position is, whether it's Ohio State, whether it's Alabama, the position is the best. And they expect to play. If they don't, I guess they're going to make a move. That's just our society right now.   
 Q.  You were a quarterback?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: Yes.   
 Q.  When were you at LSU?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: '79.   
 Q.  You were with Charles Alexander?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: Yes, I was.   
 Q.  Were you a starter in Lexington in 1980?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: Yes, I was.   
 Q.  Did you score a touchdown?  
STEVE ENSMINGER: Oh, no, not in '80.
