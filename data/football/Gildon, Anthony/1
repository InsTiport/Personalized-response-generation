  ANTHONY GILDON:   It's a certain extent where they actually get into personal foul penalties and things like that, that I think become unsportsman like, I don't see the big thing now with the celebrations.   I don't see that too much as being unsportsman like, but, I mean, I understand where ‑‑ oh, I it's been pivotal for this team, because ‑‑ that's been the biggest turning point from when we first started to when we practice now.   
When I first started when we practiced, it was more methodical, the basic pace of practice.   And now we fly through practice, and I feel like we get so much done that in the game it feels so much easier, especially defense going against our offense every play, we have to be ready to go within 20 seconds, you know what I'm saying, every play.   And when we go against a slower, tradition offense, we get a lot more time to think about our keys and read everything, it's a big difference.   
   
 Q.   You guys‑‑ as a veteran that's been there, when you come out or some of the starters that come out, some of the guys filling in dropping off‑‑  
ANTHONY GILDON:   Oh, it's amazing basically, they have 22, 23 starters.   Anybody at any given time could start in the game and I feel like we would not be losing a beat because everybody knows exactly what they are doing.   
Everybody has the ability to play with us or they would not be here.   Once you get to know what you're doing and you can just get out there and play, and especially now with the young guys having as much experience as they have, it just makes it that much better and it's great to see.   Especially being a fifth‑year senior, seek the young guys perform the way they are performing makes me feel good.  
   
 Q.   So many of you guys play so many minutes, do you end up helping each other?  
ANTHONY GILDON:   Oh, yeah we always help each other out.   Whoever starts in the game, we'll go out, figure out the receivers, figure out whatever the offense is doing, we'll come back, the coach will tell us something.   
             And we'll also communicate with each other with what we are seeing and what we think we should do differently.   If I see anything going wrong out there, I'll try to help them.   If they see me doing something wrong, they will try to help me.   It's a really good relationship.  
   
 Q.   Curious, if it's so serious when you watch‑‑ trying to get your butt kicked and trying to kick somebody, how much do you just have fun?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   Oh, it's a lot of fun.   That's the best time of the week.   Everybody, we have been waiting for it all week, working hard so that we can get out there and play the game.   It's a game, you know what I mean, that's why we play the game, to have fun, and while it's hard work, you're still having fun doing it and that's the greatest part.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
ANTHONY GILDON:   It's a good thing‑‑ it's a great thing for USC.   He's a great quarterback and it's going to set him up for a great season next year.   I think it makes the Pac 12 that much more competitive.   So it's a great thing for the Pac 12 in general to have another quarterback like Matt Barkley back to compete against every week.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I mean, just from what I've seen, he has some things he wants to accomplish.   I mean, felt like he had not reached to where he wanted to reach yet and he wanted to be able to go to ‑‑ he has not been able to go to a Bowl game or has not had a chance to maybe go to a National Championship or anything like that.   
Maybe he wants to win the Heisman.   There's a lot of things that a lot of different things that go into it that he says he's not ready to go, and I guess he wants to try to come back and reach those goals and see what he can do.   
   
 Q.   You don't really talk about it?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   Andrew Luck did it last year, and I mean, there's always that danger of getting injured and that's what people always hype up.   But as a football player, that's not what you think about.   He's thinking about his teammates and the goals that he set before he got into college.   I totally understand where he's coming from, and I wish him the best of luck.   
   
 Q.   You're talking about how you're able to be a leader‑‑  
ANTHONY GILDON:   That's the plan.   
   
 Q.   Eddie said‑‑ inaudible.   
ANTHONY GILDON:   Yeah, I mean, because he did have to go through his shoulder and everything like that.   Just anybody that‑‑ I know people that have been out with neck injuries and things like that, and I've talked to them and seen what they did and seen how‑‑ anything extra that I could do that I wasn't doing in the training room or what to do while I was at home, anything extra just to help me out.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts‑‑  
ANTHONY GILDON:   I feel bad for the team.   (Chuckling).   
   
 Q.   You guys talk at all about anybody else‑‑ circle of life?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   It's really crazy.   I actually have not even had time to sit down and think about that.   It's just been‑‑ we have been kind of in go, go, go mode.   Just now that you bring that up, it's amazing to be able to come back home and play in front of your family and friends, kind of a couple miles away from where went to high school, where we played our high school games.   
Actually we were practicing where I played in my last high school game at The Home Depot Center, so it's crazy to see where I ended one era in high school, and now I'm ending my college era in the same area.   It's just great to be able to have your family come out and watch you play your last game.   
   
 Q.   Playoff game?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   Yeah, the State Championship Game was played in there.   
   
 Q.   That's a good omen.   
ANTHONY GILDON:   Yeah, hopefully.   
   
 Q.   The experience two years ago, has it helped you at all?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I mean, just having any kind of experience helps you.   Once you've been there and done something, you know what I'm saying, you can kind of draw back on the experience.   
But it's more of just like things like this, media and things like that, and going to all those things.   When you go to practice, practice is practice; getting ready to play against another great team.   So we have to prepare the same as we prepare for every team.   They really are a great team, so it will be a really good game.   
   
 Q.   Is there a high confidence level, on defense the results‑‑ can you take any confidence?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I mean, different years, different teams.   So it's more of how we played the last game.   So you know what I'm saying, we've been playing really well this whole season.   But I feel like we have been gelling as a team and especially as a defense.   We have been gelling and I feel like we were talking about the young guys today earlier, and they are coming into their own.   They are flying around, making plays and just playing Ducks defense.   
That's the biggest thing, we just want to play Ducks defense.   
   
 Q.   We have seen you every week to the last‑‑  
ANTHONY GILDON:   It would be terrible, but it is what it is.   So I mean, it's not like I'm going to go off the deep end or anything.   
I have full confidence in everybody else, and the thing is with me is with my injury, if I'm not 100% or close to it, I feel like I'm doing an injustice to the team by putting myself out there, because there's players that can play at their best at all times and they are great players.   
So I wouldn't‑‑ and I'm all about the win.   If I don't play at all and we don't win the game, it will be just like I played the entire game.   So I'm all about winning.   It doesn't matter about me at all.   
   
 Q.   Now, are you from Oregon?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I'm actually from the Los Angeles area.   I grew up in the San Fernando Valley.   
   
 Q.   So you've got a lot of family here today then?  
ANTHONY GILDON:   Yeah, my family is all over here.   So they will be at the game.   It's hard trying to get tickets for everybody.   It's good to be able to play in front of the hometown.  
   
 Q.   What high school did you attend?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I went to Oaks Christian High School in Westlake.  
   
 Q.   And what would you like to teach?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I have no idea.   Just the whole program and being able to teach kids that have‑‑ that don't have a fair shake, that's the biggest thing.   
One of the big things they need is early childhood development, and I was thinking about that, because if you don't get your education starting out and if you're not confident in yourself in school during your early education years, then that's kind of how you start to taper off.   And if you get a strong, solid base, then you'll be set up good for the rest of your‑‑ for everything else.   So that's kind of where I'm leaning towards right now.   
   
 Q.   You've probably investigated that, is it a pretty‑‑  
ANTHONY GILDON:   Well, first it's‑‑ you have an abdication at first and write a 500‑word essay, give them your resumÃ© and send that in, and hopefully they give you a phone interview.   And if they like you during the phone interview, they bring you in for a full day interview.   And depending on how that goes, if you get it, basically in June, you'll be training for getting ready to teach in August.   
   
 Q.   And you'll be able to teach anywhere in the country?  
ANTHONY GILDON:   Anywhere.   But they give you your choice of the top five region and cities, and they also have their highest‑priority places like the Mississippi Delta, like I think Phoenix is a high priority, Las Vegas is one.   So there's a couple.   
   
 Q.   What part of the country are you looking at?   
ANTHONY GILDON:   I was looking at like Arizona probably.   I think Arizona.   Obviously L.A. because it's home, and I've grown up experiencing that, so I feel like I would be able to give back to my hometown community and then I put Arizona, stayed kind of in the south west.   My mom actually just moved to Vegas.   Been going over some things and fine‑tuning it before I submit it.
