<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how you will establish the running game -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about defensively an emphasis on trying to create turnovers and that was something there was more of an emphasis in the preseason.  Is that something that you can continue throughout the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you talked to Matt about him getting back to practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  Knowing full well the circumstances surrounding the Notre Dame situation, struggled last week, how difficult of a challenge or how dangerous of a team might this be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Watching the tape and studying them on the road, how much more difficult will be with two freshmen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any sort of policy that an injured guy will get his job back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will Chad start this week, four on the depth chart -- will that come out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any extra pressure there -- can you talk about the similarities between the two programs?  How hard would it be to go through a battle like this every year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything unique or dangerous in playing at Notre Dame, as opposed to playing in Ohio Stadium or Michigan Stadium? </p>
<p>	Q.  Many have mentioned the fact they were impressed with Chad's composure in his first game and also his attitude and his swagger this summer.  He was here most of the summer; how much does that play into his early development, that he spent so much time early and impressing his teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see in Quinn that made you -- just in general? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you concerned about any injuries --</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned how impressed you were with Chad, is that the most difficult part of a young guy having to perform like that in his first game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that make the opener even more impressive? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you at all surprised after a week of no practice how Jerome played?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any memories of games down there?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's a rivalry you would like to see perpetuated but not played every year, played every two years or three? </p>
<p>	Q.  You can you talk about the secondary and what they did well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given position on the offense, how tough is it to have a David Baas out there to settle things down and take charge?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it almost a matter of fact or a foregone conclusion that there will be 12 teams, that that will probably happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Too much to turn down? </p>
<p>	Q.  If there were a 12th team, would you want it to be Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate on what you saw in Massey? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you worry at all about too much, too soon, pressure and all that stuff or is Chad different? </p>
<p>	Q.  From what you know of the nature of past injuries, do you think it's strictly a rest issue or is there more to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you be more specific? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said "shoulder" on the TV show. </p>
<p>	Q.  Before the game, did you know the change, did you see him in any pain?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  After watching -- do you think about reviewing the plays?</p>
