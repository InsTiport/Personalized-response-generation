<p>	Q.  When you go back and look at this game, what strikes you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked about -- Inaudible -- he graduates in October.  He plays better under pressure.  Does he get better in every situation he gets in like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you're a baseball fan -- inaudible -- do you have any of those moments with a fellow coach or official, thinking, man, what a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your mind, do you start to go over all the little things or big things that people contributed, like Brian Thompson or so many things that went into it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jake Long, could you see on film what happened?  Did he have to get the ball back from somebody?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- in terms of what they were able to throw at you, particularly offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people talk about other freshman, talk about Heisman (inaudible.)  Do you think it's only fair -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- how do you spend the night?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Larry has the reputation of being physical.  Now there are a lot of flags.  Looking at the film, talk about their positioning and how they played on Saturday. </p>
<p>	Q.  Comment on the officials.  And if you say something, do they call you?  How does that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  You watched Sports Center, how many times did you see the Braylon catches?  How good were those?</p>
<p>	Q.  One looks like it was stolen away -- inaudible.</p>
<p>	Q.  TV shot of Braylon saying over and over, "It's not over, it's not over," after one of those catches, does that carry more weight coming from him, his ability to make those pass plays in that situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- quarterback, but Braylon out there.  Have you told Chad Henne a different standard for what's open?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked about the chemistry of the team.  How does that play into the team's ability to come back like they have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where did they hurt you the most defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- have you seen that this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's your evaluation of pass protection right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Story about how guys have been treated -- inaudible.</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how Larry has played this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)  Team meeting?</p>
<p>	Q.  How often does that happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a problem with anyone ever fallen asleep here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it a compliment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you refresh my memory why Michigan doesn't promote players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wouldn't it be tragic if maybe the West Coast viewing audience doesn't get to see a lot of Braylon Edwards' games.  Would it behoove you to send video clips to voters on the West Coast?</p>
<p>	Q.  You call the shots. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  If you were voting tomorrow, who would you vote for?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible?)</p>
<p>	Q.  Was it unusual for you -- I don't remember you ever saying Charles Woodson was the greatest player in college football, and he's come out and said Braylon is. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had that conversation with Edwards?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you had practice tomorrow.  Are the players going to have time to get out and vote? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you always told your guys to go out and vote, or after what happened last time, have you made it a point --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you pleased to see what happened with the SCC deal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- talk to you about it before?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- did you listen to the whole thing?</p>
