<p>	Q.  With the running game better, how does that improve you do offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  What makes David Baas so effective, and is he as good as the great linemen that have been here over the years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is he one of the best singers you've had? </p>
<p>	Q.  People have criticized your half-time comments or demeanor again, do you wish you didn't have to do that?  Have you ever thought of not doing it? </p>
<p>	Q.  That you were too curt to them or something, I don't know. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does a coach really have to do that?  Some coaches don't do it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Scott McClintock, do you have an update on his ankle, and then also, do you think David Underwood will be ready to go this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Jerome still going to practice --</p>
<p>	Q.  But you learned a lot about Mike Hart on Saturday, enough to put on the chart, or a potential chart? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your other receivers have not caught as many passes as people thought they would.  Is it just that Chad is more comfortable with Braylon?  Why have some guys not gotten the numbers they have the last several years?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like every year at some point it comes down to line and plays, is this group really embracing that challenge right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  John had mentioned something about an ankle, is he okay for this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a chance to see any of Iowa's game against Arizona State?  Are you at all surprised by that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you try to put that into their heads, that you're starting over again?</p>
<p>	Q.  I seem to recall at some point early on when Ed Hinkel (ph) was struggling, I wasn't here at that time but I remember reading you stuck up for him.  You said, "Give the guy a chance, he knows what he's doing."  Do you remember just what you saw back then that maybe a layperson would not see and why you felt comfortable saying that? </p>
<p>	Q.  And they play the kind of football you like to play; is that fair to say? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Pierre's situation, are his injuries nagging? </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you like about getting Clayton early in the game and is that something that you want to do regularly? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you evaluate him --</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Leon Hall going to be starting at quarterback and if so, what has Leon done so far to impress you this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as Matt Gutierrez and that situation -- I know you said don't make guesses in medical situations, do you have a feel at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there an area or two where Chad Henne has gained the most through what he's experienced, and what would it be?</p>
<p>	Q.  Clarification, so on that play, he should have taken that knee right away; correct? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about things getting easier,  going against Iowa, Chad being a first-year guy, does he have that understanding of their defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last couple games against Iowa, you were doing something -- will you do different things against their style or personnel? </p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of a player is Matt Lentz? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, what do you like about him? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Chad, and also Mike Hart improving in the huddle -- inaudible -- have you seen that from him and is that a motivation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Recruiting, before Pat came, his dad wanted him to go to Notre Dame and his brother went to Ohio State --</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see in that -- inaudible -- and can you talk about the shorter hits Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there some sort of tighter formation, it seems like a lot of other punters line up deeper than yours. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Tim's play on Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the start for Jake Long and what he did to earn it and what you were hoping would he get out of it and how he performed?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have another young player in Chris Graham, linebacker, and with Prescott Burgess, what did you see?</p>
