<p>	Q.  Do you remember what the reaction was when you realized the jug was left behind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Braylon said he snuck on the field for those special team plays. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about true freshmen, why you put them in there on special teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have there been scenarios where you've played true freshmen just on special teams, not their position? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about your rush being No. 1. </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody else can talk about how effective they were last year on the ground.  How do you contain (inaudible)? </p>

<p>	Q.  I think it was last year you talked about Minnesota being a zone blocking team.  What does that mean for us that are not so football savvy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a rare scheme these days? </p>
<p>	Q.  How unusual is that?  Not a lot of people do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Hard on your defensive guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of blocking, the moves that you made on your offensive line after a couple of games together, how would you assess they're doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the blocks, the injuries that are involved on both sides of the ball.  Do you or any other coaches that you know of have any philosophical problems with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think in your defense could pose problems for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the sacks go, how much of that is with the offensive line and Chad learning when to get rid of the ball, basically throwing it away rather than holding it the half a second too long to create the sack?</p>
<p>	Q.  A bit of an old-fashioned football game.  They want to run the ball on you, daring you to stop them.  Do you enjoy that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a timetable when Jeremy might be able to help you out?  Can you talk about his ability to come back?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did he say anything about (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will that be more of a discomfort on the hands, though? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're not definite that he'll be in?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) starting corner?</p>
<p>	Q.  Their defense compared to last year?  Better? </p>
<p>	Q.  Big game for both teams.  Because of the Big-10 race, because of maybe who Minnesota doesn't play, is it maybe more critical for you than it is for them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about how the defense has to prove something, giving up so many yards last year.  Knowing they have to prove something, do you feel the game becomes more dangerous for Minnesota, feeling a little bit like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) first pass, first touchdown down to him?  What has he done for this team as a receiver lately?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did the officials tell you about the overturning? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the two freshmen, Henne and Hart? </p>
<p>	Q.  How are you determining who how are you dividing snaps and the backup? </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't mention Underwood. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  He's been averaging about 20 carries the last three games.  Is that the max you want for him?  You said he's durable. </p>
<p>	Q.  Keeping the ball away from Minnesota, are you able to practice sustaining the drive, eating up minutes, or do those fall into place if you're executing?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
