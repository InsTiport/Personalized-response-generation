<p>	Q.  On the first play they had, was there a mix-up in coverage?</p>
<p>	Q.  That first interception, was Jason where he was supposed to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you concerned at all about Chad's confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  He had a tough game. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  At what point did you all learn about the results of Wisconsin-Iowa?  What was the reaction to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How quickly do you want to put that loss behind you, keep working on your next game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a couple minutes ago this team has had great accomplishments.  Do you think in certain ways people -- you clinched a share of the title Saturday, you couldn't really celebrate because you had to look at Ohio State, then you lost and you got to the Rose Bowl, but you couldn't really celebrate.  Do you think because of the way things have fallen the accomplishment hasn't been acknowledged? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel it's a lot of motivation maybe to go to the Rose Bowl?  Will this be almost an angry team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you talk much about what happened last year at the Rose Bowl? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you change the hotel situation at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're sort of beating around the bush.  What did you feel was wrong?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, you feel something wasn't right in the preparation.  Did you peak too early? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if this is the right segway. </p>
<p>	Q.  You know what it means. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was the security issue a distraction, that there was a bit of a delay?  What was your take on that, a 10- or 15-minute delay?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it was gamesmanship? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the reason for the check? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look back at it, how long did the whole thing delay you?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) in a complaint?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did they make you actually open the bags or did they just have the dogs sniff them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a normal security check point that you have to go through? </p>
<p>	Q.  If they told you beforehand there was a concern, would you have as much problem with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned confrontation, that you feared that scenario.  Were players getting agitated?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you mention any of this to Coach Tressel before the game when you spoke to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did that rattle you guys at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  He said he didn't know anything about it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of confrontation, I'm sure you saw what happened in the NBA game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you ever concerned that something like that might happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like there was more of a police presence on the field after Saturday's game.  Did everybody get off okay?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you prefer the fans never rushed the field?  Would you say, "I would rather you not do it"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Jeremy, or any other injuries in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Between now and when you travel to SC, what does the team do for these four weeks? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is the PAC-10/Big-10 tradition with regards to the Rose Bowl important enough to you that you wouldn't welcome so much say a match-up against a top team from a different part of the country? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about struggling against the spread.  What do you think you need to do better, to get better?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does the Rose Bowl get better every time you go?  Is your experience different? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like Saturday was the worst tackling game of the year? </p>
