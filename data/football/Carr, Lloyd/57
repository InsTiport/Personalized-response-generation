<p>	Q.  The rushing game struggled do, you see as a result of Notre Dame's defense, how much are those easily correctable mistakes and how much is it a season-long project of getting better?</p>
<p>	Q.  The blocking, how much of it is working together and figuring out how to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you look at the line right now, if you were to look at them and look at where you were last year at this time, do they have a ways to go to get there? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned throwing the ball too much, is this a combination of being behind in the third and fourth quarter and struggles with the running game; you've had running backs -- that you were able to run and get back in the game and go on long drives and take a lead and that obviously wasn't the case. </p>
<p>	Q.  For Chad, What does it do for his confidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you were happy with Chad has progressed, seeing what he's been able to do against Notre Dame, are you more comfortable with him as starting quarterback? </p>
<p>	Q.  And is Matt still unable to throw?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the running back situation wide open right now, can you talk about what you saw from the other backs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a head injury then?</p>
<p>	Q.  Good try.</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you see him practice at all --</p>
<p>	Q.  Will it be a situation where this week when you practice the running backs, will you have one guy that gets 99 percent of the carries, or will it become a situation now where you have to spread it around a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  ... a back to you, from what you remember? </p>
<p>	Q.  The offensive line, does coming off the ball together, is that competition like the running backs, will that be something you watch this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel it was more lack of effort --</p>
<p>	Q.  The interception they had, that was a great break for them and unfortunate luck for you.  Braylon had both hands on the ball, did you get any insight on the film, was the ball just high and just an unlucky -- should Braylon catch that ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned special teams earlier, certain facets of it, seems like there's always a big special teams play, how disconcerting is that guarding? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about playing on the line?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now what about Gabe, what do you think --</p>
<p>	Q.  In reference to pass -- how much more important is that in evaluating this year with a young quarterback and how have Jerome and Mike looked?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does the quarterback make the decision that he's going to throw the ball more downfield, or as opposed to being easier to hit one of those checked downs as you said? </p>
<p>	Q.  The kickoff coverage, when a player seems to be really excelling -- inaudible -- and can you talk about him and what he's done?</p>
<p>	Q.  Saturday a year ago, Utah, they came in and gave you a really tough game --</p>
<p>	Q.  Pierre seemed to be out there less than last year --</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about the progress of Ryan in these first two games?</p>
<p>	Q.  If a player said he would come back an extra season to win a National Championship, what do you as a coach say to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two of the running backs -- inaudible -- getting a crack at the competition?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last week he said that he's done a decent job so far, but how is your assessment so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  How has he been handling that --</p>
<p>	Q.  After you went out, how do you go about deciding how to distribute carries when you leave guys out so early? </p>
