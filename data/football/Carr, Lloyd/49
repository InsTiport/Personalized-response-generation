<p>	Q.  Do you think Northwestern is a team that gets overlooked compared to Ohio State or Michigan?</p>
<p>	Q.  These games over the past weekend, does that re-emphasize the point, always finishing out and taking care of your own business?</p>
<p>	Q.  They have had success against Michigan unlike your rivals, why do you think that; that they have had as much success as Ohio or Notre Dame against Michigan?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you want to see from your defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how rare the combination is of the hit-and-cover from a corner perspective, to be as hard-hitting as he is and also athletic enough to cover people all over the place?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about what the bye week did for your team from a physical standpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  When the media starts talking about the Bowl picture, do you say anything to your guys about not paying any attention to that or is that understood?</p>

<p>	Q.  Marlin Jackson, what is it about him that the teammates look up to him?</p>
