<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you something slightly off topic.  I'm doing a story on Joe Paterno.  Have you pictured yourself coaching until you were 78 years old?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you marvel at what he has done?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned Brady's numbers, taking those for granted a little bit, yet after the game he was saying it was maybe the worst game he had played all year.  What does that say about his mentality?</p>
<p>	Q.  That leads into my next question about him being a little bit of a coach on the field and taking on your personality.  When did you see that start to evolve?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on what it takes to be a good edge guy like Chase yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  When did you recognize that Chase would have those qualities?</p>
<p>	Q.  With DJ missing the first field goal and then having the second one blocked, how do you not let that get him down but still let him know that you're not happy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about DJ, the kind of kid that he is, does he get frustrated or down?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly, you had said before that if at the end of the game it went down to you kicking a field goal and tying it or going for the win, you would probably kick a field goal to tie it because you feel you would be able to score.  Does that come from having so much trust in him as a kicker?</p>
<p>	Q.  I read somewhere where either Belichick said or somebody said about Belichick that to be a great coach you have to have a great quarterback.  Would you agree with that statement?</p>
<p>	Q.  You know you talk every week about you feel like every opponent you have is dangerous, can be dangerous.  When you're facing a team like Stanford, who is going to be playing for its postseason life and is coming off a very disappointing loss in what is their biggest rivalry game of the year, does that make them any more dangerous?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the disappointment with the breakdown in protection and the kicking game when DJ was attempting the field goal.  They have a couple guys who are kind of known for being able to do that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Early in the year you had difficulty with the blitz zone and then you seemed to straighten it out.  Was that the most pressure that Brady has faced in quite some time?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Brady, for better or worse, was becoming more like you.  At this point then do you back away a little bit or are you always kind of applying pressure and pushing him still?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you're a points and not stats guy; you mentioned that yesterday.  Your defense is now 37th in the country in scoring defense.  Can you talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you comfortable enough to ratchet up the pressure like you did yesterday against everybody, or does that depend on the opponent?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just following up on Chase, he seems to really embrace that role, and he's a kid that had more playing time at wide receiver in the past, returned kickoffs, but he really seems to buy into this role that he has.  How do you get a kid to do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of times after the game you talk about how you address the game in relation to that game and what lies ahead.  What were some of the things you talked about yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Playing in Stanford, being home for as long as you are, is that kind of foreign or are you looking forward to getting back out on the road?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a good sign when you talk about maybe not as good as a game as you're used to, trouble converting 3rd downs in the first half and you still have 30 points?  Is that a sign that offensively you played great except for those three points?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a second ago about one of the things this week, you finally talked to the team about or is that --</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you were paying attention to the field.  Did you happen to see the tortillas flying around?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any further thought on the oranges or the tortillas?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of us have noticed a different Maurice from last year to this year.  Since you got here a year ago have you noticed any changes in him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Besides the weight loss, have you guys had to do anything with him, work with him at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said yesterday when he throws up those passes that Maurice, the acrobatic catches, he has the best seat in the house.  What's it like for you to watch from the sideline?</p>
<p>	Q.  In follow up to that, you mentioned hands, and it seems like most of the receivers on your team have soft hands.  Is that something that can be learned or taught, or is soft hands just something that they have?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't look ahead to match-ups, but yesterday was rivalry Saturday.  Did you get a chance to enjoy any of the games after you were done?</p>
