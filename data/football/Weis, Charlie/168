<p>	Q.  I heard that you went into the USC locker room after the game.  Is that something that you do on a regular basis when you felt strongly about addressing your team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned after the game Parcells being the greatest -- don't be the one -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know what Rashon Powers-Neal's status is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any chance that Rhema will be back, looking at the possibility? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going over to the locker room, how does that whole thing work, do you address the whole team?</p>
<p>	Q.  And going into this week, you pushed a lot of buttons last week --</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people looking on the outside -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it make it a little bit easier, that they beat Notre Dame last year -- the intangible?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the kickoff return, you didn't have Hoskins or Harris rest on Saturday, you started with Grimes and he got things up, just what is your situation on kickoff return? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who will you be using in the kickoff return this week, do you know yet? </p>
<p>	Q.  From that standpoint, in regards to the physicality of the game, how would you rank that in terms of what was going on out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the punt ball went out of bounds, would you describe what you saw and heard and what kind of explanation was offered? </p>
<p>	Q.  To follow-up on what you said there, you said there wasn't one time where you thought the clock was off.  I thought I saw you at one point holding your arms up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would it be more like nine seconds? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot more people called it one of the greatest games they have ever been to. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much attention do you pay to the polls?</p>
<p>	Q.  I also wondered, I know you can't talk about individuals, but overall how the recruiting went for you it was a big recruiting weekend for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you use the BCS game as a possibility of -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've probably -- do you prefer a playoff or the way they -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you all right with the way they calculate it in the computer --</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie Bush being Player -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said on Saturday that he called a perfect game -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about going into the locker room after the game and seeing the faces, you talked about -- your team could not have played any harder than they did, but it just wasn't enough --</p>
<p>	Q.  You said before the game this would be a good measuring stick to see how far you guys have to go to be an elite team, what do you take from that? </p>
<p>	Q.  During the week leading up to the game, so many things had happened on campus, pep rallies, so many of the fans coming, the noise levels, things like that, being a Notre Dame grad, I got a feeling you expected that could happen, but were you proud of the effort of everyone on the Notre Dame staff and what they did?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, you touched on this a little bit there, when I look at the NFL, it seems like everything is business and while you were have a businesslike approach in college as well, how sensitive do you have to be to those subtleties, the pep rallies and that type of thing that make college special and different from the NFL?</p>
<p>	Q.  So in some respects you feel like you might embrace those types of things a little more as we go here?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think the implications would be if you said to the student body, fellas, girls, we are going to get more from having Fridays to ourselves before home games, we're going to move the pep rally to Thursday night and make it voluntary for the players to attend. </p>
<p>	Q.  If you were designing your proofing template for a home game weekend, would you rather have that Friday to yourself and the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  No. 2, very quickly, on the final Southern Cal touchdown when Bush pushed, had there been review --</p>
<p>	Q.  Could be postered.  Had it been reviewable, was there a remedy available and would it have been reviewable? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were -- Tom Brady being an NFL superstar, the offensive drive, four-for-four, is that the kind of play that can elevate him to the level -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Who is responsible for the design of the jerseys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was the grass left a little long in the stadium?</p>
