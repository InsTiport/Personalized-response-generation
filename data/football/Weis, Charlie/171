<p>	Q.  Fasano has 121 catches and tied for the team lead, in the NFL, the tight end is kind of the golden era right now; Gonzalez, what have you seen in the college game, has it caught up yet with the utilization of tight end or, does it still have a way to go because overall in college they are using it like they do there? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was it about Bill Lewis that attracted you to build your set? </p>
<p>	Q.  What does he do to get those decades of knowledge, what does he bring to the defensive backs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there any parallels there between the two? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any updates on Greenbriar and Horton? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has Graham (ph) him officially supplanted the second kick returner now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how Brady has improved over the first month of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a couple of guys on your offensive line that have been both tackles and guards in their career.  What do you look for when you're drawing that line between having a guy be a guard or having a guy be a tackle? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dan Stevenson's case, can you talk about what makes him a good guard and how you think he's contributed to the line?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Joe came into the Big 10, they called it "basketball on grass," the kind of offense that he ran and it was different than anybody else, but he really wanted to move closer to being a balanced offense.  Did you ever undergo a similar evolution in regards to your offensive philosophy in your career?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the intangibles that is Hoyte and Mays bring to the defense, and how comforting is it to have a couple of fifth-year guys in the middle? </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you signed 15 players, there's more commitments now than signed last year, does this surprise you or is that by design?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you started a trend with the coin toss call or is that people reacting to your offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Right. </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe Jeff Marshall's personality, it kind of comes off as a bit of a free spirit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Would that be accurate? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you were looking for somebody to help on the default, I saw that you had it in the back there, was he a natural choice because of his abilities? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is Darius Walker's running style and his approach, is that affected in any way by the fact that you don't have a lot of proof and doubt behind him; if he steps out of bounds a lot of time, would you rather that he not take that hit? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Brady a few minutes ago, he's had two big games at Purdue and both were losses, and some of his best games have been losses.  How do you change that?  How do you get it to that he can have big games and win? </p>
<p>	Q.  When he passes for less than 150 yards, Notre Dame is 5-1.  When he passes for more than 150 yards, it's 1-6.</p>
<p>	Q.  487 yards against Michigan State --</p>
<p>	Q.  And you mentioned the number of big plays, the number against Michigan State, too, you said that the good thing was that a lot of players in position make plays, they didn't make them.  How do you in one week change -- how do you fix that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it easier to change a player's physical fundamentals or the mental part of the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You do a lot of research and talked before about using text messaging and things like that to contact players, talk about how much technology has changed coaching since the time you got into coaching?</p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of started it so I'm going to see if I can get you to expand on it, you compared McCaffrey?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've got Purdue coming up at the end of the a string of five games, first four out of five on the road.  You blocked the season off a little bit and is this like a combination of that first block, you've got a week off coming up and this is the last of that four out of five. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you overall look at the next block and see that the next five or six are at home?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned Brady's game management, something that impressed you, he's improved in that area, can you talk about that and give some examples? </p>
<p>	Q.  After the game on Saturday, a lot of the guys on offense talked about how when they looked at the stat sheet, 560 yards, they were surprised because they said they felt like they made so many mistakes. </p>
<p>	Q.  So many times college players see 36 points, 560 yards, that's pretty good, but --</p>
<p>	Q.  Shifting gears, inaudible, talking about January enrollment is that an option that's going to be out there for you guys this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  And just to be clear, if someone did enroll, were they counting the scholarship from last year or this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to get your take on instant replay in the college game and whether you -- how would you compare it to the way it works in the pro game?</p>
<p>	Q.  The opening drive -- inaudible -- talk about how you feel about them and how much confidence that gives an offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  When McKnight comes back, you're going to have an abundance of wide receivers, how are you going to manage that kind of depth? </p>
<p>	Q.  Who will you be listing as your first two?</p>
