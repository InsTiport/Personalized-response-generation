<p>	Q.  What significance or importance do you put on the fact that you have two passionate head coaches going back to their alma maters and playing each other in the first game against each other on such a stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked Sunday about the practice on Monday was going to be intense, the players knew it; was it, and how did the players react to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Starting your legacy at Notre Dame, how important is that going to be just in your life, since you graduated here and coming back, and it's been a long time since now you've had the job and now you get to play your first game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are you most excited about for the first time and what are you most uncertain about?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked a little bit already off-season about the difference between coaching pros and college.  Going into this week, what has been the biggest difference between being offensive coordinator in the NFL and getting ready for your first game as a head coach of Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk, how important is it to get off to a strong start?  The past five seasons Notre Dame has scored a total of one touchdown in the first half the opening games.  How important is it to get off to a strong start?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think for all the experience your offense has, they are maybe going to have to carry you guys a little bit in the first game because they are a little more familiar with actually being in the game on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you share your impressions of their quarterback, Tyler Palko?</p>
<p>	Q.  How often do you show the team your rings, if at all, and how do you handle that as a motivation or your resume? </p>
<p>	Q.  How often do you show them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Coach Parcells and the tremendous impact that he's had on your life.  How are you different from him as a coach and how are you different from him from a personality standpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there anything along the way where you said, you know, if I'm ever a head coach in this situation, I wouldn't do it the way he did that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about being 0-0, has it been a little bit odd how widely heralded and popular you are for an 0-0 coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that at all a concern to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Text messaging is something that's gotten big in recruiting.  How much do you guys use it and can you measure the success? </p>
<p>	Q.  What types of things do you text?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've mentioned end-of-game situations and how you've been working on those, can you give an example of maybe a situation that you would put the team in to practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rebuilding confidence has been kind of a theme.  How big of an aspect of executing in those situations is having the confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked a little about your coaching and you feel confident about what you're going to see on Saturday.  What have you seen over the last three weeks that gives you that confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  You also said you felt like there's probably too much emphasis on the coach from a media perspective; how have you gone about trying to scale that back or get your message across?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the NFL, you always had four or five preseason games to evaluate talent and make decisions on depth charts.  What kind of challenge has it been to do so without the luxury of those preseason games against an opponent?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Dave Wannstedt as a defensive guru, and you've been called an offensive guru.  Describe how your styles go against each either as pertains to Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you like the fact that -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Other than what the score board tells you each week, what indicators will you be looking at to tell whether the coaching has taken hold?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you characterize the size and complexity of the playbook, and what were some of the initial reactions from players when they first received it? </p>
<p>	Q.  From a college student's perspective, college player, do you think it's an intimidating binder --</p>
<p>	Q.  I heard you talking about the schedule in terms of how much practice time you have, and I was talking to Dave Wannstedt and a couple of other coaches yesterday, would you trade a week of practice for one preseason game?  Do you think that would give you a better gauge as to where your team is at? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you can talk about what you've seen of HB Blades on tape and I know his father played safety, but when you saw his father in the NFL, do you see any similarities on tape between HB and his father?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if there was one trait through training camp that you learned about your team, what would be the most important thing you learned about your team through training camp? </p>
<p>	Q.  How long did it take them to sort of start to buy into some of the coaching? </p>
<p>	Q.  With you and Dave making your head coaching debuts this weekend, do you think it's become more accepted in the last five or ten years to go from the NFL back to college; and if so, why? </p>
