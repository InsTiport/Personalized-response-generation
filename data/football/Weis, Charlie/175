<p>	Q.  You talked about Michigan State's linebackers, but have your linebackers become the strength of your team now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mays timing on the blitz has been good.  Is that a gift of his or something you hone?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the coin toss, electing to receive.  Is there ever a situation where you would choose to defer if, say, your offense is struggling a little bit or your defense is your strength at that time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the kind of thing, when you were an assistant coach, you said, "Why do people defer?  If I'm the head coach, I'm going to take the football?" </p>
<p>	Q.  Has the secondary exceeded your expectations overall so far, met them?  How do you feel about the way they've done, considering their experience coming in? </p>
<p>	Q.  I realize they're two completely different situations, but the one thing Pittsburgh and Michigan have in common is perhaps the lack of second-half offensive productivity.  Is that a concern for you?  If so, what steps do you take to alleviate that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sunday you mentioned a home game brings with it a lot different distractions than a road game does necessarily.  Have you received any advice from perhaps Ara or Lou on that or from Rick Minter and Ron Powlus, who have been around here for these kind of things before? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Jeff Samardzija?  He seems to be developing a chemistry with Brady Quinn. </p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to the psyche of the team, what do you think is the benefit and pitfall of (no microphone.)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Biggest benefit? </p>
<p>	Q.  What has Rick Minter brought to this defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone)?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've said special teams is the area where you can make the quickest improvements.  Why is that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a lot about developing the tougher Jersey personality to this team.  I'm curious if you've seen that yet, if you're starting to see that a little bit in the results? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's always a lot made back home about your interest in the Rutgers job.  I'm curious if you ever thought what your life might be like if that had gone different for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Professionally? </p>
<p>	Q.  What, if anything, has surprised you so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you talked to or heard from Tom Brady since the weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  You won't share any of that at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the Jersey attitude.  Is that the nasty --</p>
<p>	Q.  The other part of the attitude you talked about was the Patriots team-first attitude.  How do you coach that?  Do you think the team is starting to adopt that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is one of the ways you show that, frequently on TV during broadcasts, they show the one-on-one conversation with the coach.  You haven't had one of those that I've seen.  By staying out of the limelight, you have these press conferences, but you haven't had as much press coverage as you could have.  Is that a message?</p>
<p>	Q.  But the pregame interviews? </p>
<p>	Q.  The issue of flying to the ball was one that Rick brought up pretty early in camp.  How do you evaluate how the players have taken that philosophy and run with it? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the offensive side the ball without Raymond, talk about if the dynamic of what you can do changes at all without him? </p>
<p>	Q.  The next guy goes in, is that a mentality you have to coach up in your players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Shelton, is he pretty much close to a hundred percent right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chinedum Ndukwe started as an offensive player here.  Can you talk about his development, his nose for the ball that he seems to have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Fasano, talk about your impressions of him, your hopes for him. </p>
<p>	Q.  It's the big anniversary for Notre Dame stadium.  Do you have a particular moment from when you were a student in this stadium that you could share, any fond memories? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the time of the home games.  These things can drag on forever. </p>
<p>	Q.  Much more than three hours. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Wade Iams, made a couple plays in the Michigan game, former quarterback from here.  Is he one of those guys giving the effort you were talking about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wade Iams, made a couple plays in the Michigan game on special teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  The Friday night pep rally, that's going to be something different.  You did it as a student.  Is that a positive?  Can that be fun for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bob Morton, you talked about in the pre-season what a nice kid he is, but you quickly added in there that sometimes the nice kids don't always make the best football players.  Bob has really stood out some this year.  Did you feel he was one of the players maybe that might have needed that mentality of nasty or toughness that you're trying to put in?</p>
<p>	Q.  I asked this morning about Carl Grimes and his development.  Can you talk about Carl's brother David and what he's doing for you on special teams, your expected development for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you noticed Carl at all when you watch the films of Michigan State? </p>
<p>	Q.  About Michigan State's running game, there's still some question about whether Jason will play this week.  Ringer was averaging 80 yards a carry, then Caulcrick was averaging over a hundred yards a game. </p>
<p>	Q.  When a team can do that, seems like no matter who they throw in, is that a commentary on their stable of runningbacks or is that more a commentary on their offensive line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ringer has been described more as a make-a-miss kind of player.  Caulcrick is straight ahead.  How do they differ style-wise? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you preparing at all or expecting to see any option this week from Michigan State?  They haven't busted it out too much in the first two games. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you noticed No. 27, Adams?  Plays the bandit position, hybrid safety linebacker.  What do you think of him and that position?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much have you used the history of Notre Dame since you've been there as a motivational tool? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were Quinn's lower numbers in the second half at Michigan because of lower efficiency or an excess of caution to sit on the lead? </p>
