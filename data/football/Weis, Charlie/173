<p>	Q.  Is the process of going back to the fundamentals, is that something that every team has to do every year, even the Patriots? </p>
<p>	Q.  McKnight, change in his status this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Prior to the Pittsburgh game, you talked about all the different offensive and defensive tapes that you studied, because of all the connections.  Who were the various teams that you studied this week with regard to Washington? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady Quinn seems really to have improved his play action fakes.  Did you hone in on that with him?  Did you emphasize that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said on Sunday that you felt you didn't do a good job dealing with the distractions based upon the way your team played in the first half.  Was it just based upon that or were there some other indications to you that they weren't quite as focused? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned having the play book.  Did you go back at all and look at last year's Notre Dame to get an idea?</p>
<p>	Q.  I meant, did you look at Notre Dame games to get an idea of what Kent Baer might be doing? </p>
<p>	Q.  I haven't seen Washington's offense yet.  Is it at all similar to what Notre Dame ran last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Jeff Samardzija.  He's made a number of touchdown catches.  Suddenly, he finds the end zone regularly.  What is the key there? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about distractions last week, said that was one of the things you were guarding against. </p>
<p>	Q.  How are you confident about that?  If it didn't work last week, how are you confident?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think just having -- whether we talked about it or not, having Willingham on the bench, on the sideline, it changes the dynamic no matter what anyone says, doesn't it, just knowing he's there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you be more specific, fundamentals is a pretty broad term.  Is there one or two things specifically? </p>
<p>	Q.  Offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  How about defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the wide receiver sort of as a whole, when you throw it 60 times, there's going to be a lot of different guys catching balls.  That's been a theme this year.  How much of a conscious effort to you put to spread the ball around in the passing game? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're willing to, as you build a game plan, if you need to throw it all over the field, you'll do that.  If the run is working, you'll stick with that.  That being said, how comfortable are you with 60 passes in one game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Maurice Crum had a lot of competition at linebacker coming into the season.  What did he do to kind of rise above everybody and secure that spot? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you go over film, will you say, "That's how it's done," with a certain play, or do you not get into that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the Maurice Crum question, can you talk about him as someone in coverage, someone who is able to cover a wide receiver or a back out of the backfield? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you evaluate your offensive line at this point of the season, how you think they played? </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay. </p>
<p>	Q.  Darius has had three 100-yard games.  What do you still want to see from him in terms of improvement?  How do you keep him, when he has success with his foot on the gas pedal? </p>
<p>	Q.  In the second half, there was some conversation about the fact that Michigan State's defense had been on the field for quite a bit, looked like maybe in the fourth quarter they were getting a little gassed.  If they were out there the whole second half, so was our offense.  Did you feel like the offense was getting tired towards the end of the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game you weren't looking for silver linings in a game you don't win. </p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that a lot of things that happened negatively in the game are things you can control by fixing them yourself, some solace in the fact the enemy Saturday might have been ourselves and we can fix that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two quarterbacks have committed to this class.  Is that something you want every year, the more quarterbacks you can, or is that more of a building depth-type thing for the upcoming years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of a different scenario, but when you had the Patriots, you had Bledsoe and Brady.  Did you feel like you were growing Brady at that time?</p>
<p>	Q.  To follow his question on recruiting, in a general overall sense --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- as you look at what's coming, how the process is going this year, are you on target with the plan that you set out for your recruiting for this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about finishing after the Air Force game that Washington had, Parcells talked about it last night.  How do you teach a time how to finish a game? </p>
<p>	Q.  State had a real big offensive line, you weren't able to get to Stanton as much as you would like to.  You mentioned the size of their offensive line.  How do you teach a defense how to get around people that are that well-fed and that strong?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you see Rashon Powers-Neal fitting in this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you see him really fitting in this week?  Like you said last week, he was being groomed for the backup tailback role. </p>
<p>	Q.  Darius averaged about 25 carries a game, 13 catches so far in the passing game.  Is that about the level you see for him? </p>
<p>	Q.  30 touches?</p>
<p>	Q.  Switching gears at the tight end spot with Anthony, he's been described by announcers as kind of that security blanket for Brady.  Do you see him as that or do you see him in a different way as he fits in the offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that he can do everything, do you foresee him having a decision to make at the end of the year? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Darius' development as a blocker, how has he improved and how much more can he do in that area? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is the biggest factor to becoming a good blocker is that desire to want to do it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have the playbook from last year, so you kind of know what Washington is going to try to do.  If they've got intimate knowledge of your personnel, they know your guys, which one is the bigger advantage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a bigger advantage for you to know the playbook or for them to know the personnel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even if you have so many of your own issues to deal with, these are essential college players who will be playing against their former coach.  How can that not be a factor, even just from a motivational standpoint? </p>
<p>	Q.  No, I wasn't. </p>
<p>	Q.  So you don't think --</p>
<p>	Q.  I read somewhere when you attended Notre Dame, you would sit in the stands, kind of do a play-by-play of the games.  Is that accurate? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's interesting.  Obviously a guy who would do that ends up coaching the team.  Was that ever a dream or goal of yours?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the highest level of football you played? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lineman?</p>
<p>	Q.  What made you decide to get into coaching then?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were at New England, you had a couple Huskies, Damon and Lawyer.  I heard they told you a lot about the Washington program and you might have even looked into being the coach here at some point. </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't really --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you script plays?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a number of players from Minnesota on your roster.  In particular, three kids from the same high school in St. Paul, Harris, Freeman, Powers-Neal.  Can you talk about what you like about these particular players. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, Ryan Harris, a lot of people are talking about him stepping up to another level of play, being one of the most talented offensive tackles in college.  Do you see him making that step? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tyrone Willingham said yesterday he had you come in while he and his staff were at Notre Dame to talk with them.  Can you talk about that discussion, what you maybe saw they were doing that you did like. </p>
<p>	Q.  For a guy that knows nothing about scripting plays, I've been interested in it.  When you script plays, could you give me an elementary explanation of how that works.  I always think third and one you have a deep pass called, that's not going to work. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it almost like mini scripts for each of the situations?</p>
