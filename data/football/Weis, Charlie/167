<p>	Q.  When you met with the team yesterday (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  Any thoughts of green jerseys? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as player reaction (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give us an overview of the pros and cons as far as the match-ups between the two teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Goals any different for the second half of the season as they were for the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Landry, (inaudible), what are you expecting from them in the opener and beyond?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a history of being with organizations that play well with a target on their back.  Can you talk about the mentality from a coaching standpoint for being able to do that well?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the scheme here.  One of the first things (inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  When you face a defense like this, they move a lot, they do a lot of different things to give your quarterback a different look.  How important is it for Brady this week to have (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  I probably should have worded that better. </p>
<p>	Q.  With that question, is it more Brady is going to have to check into the right play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Defense has been exceptional in creating turnovers in the red zone.  Talk about the mentality that has to happen for that red zone defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Way back in the first half of the season... </p>
<p>	Q.  You only lost a couple of people to injuries.  This past week, I don't remember exactly, long time ago, you have some more fellows in.  Is that when you want to wait to look for somebody that can step up?</p>

<p>	Q.  It's been a ceaselessly recurring theme since the pre-season about the weakness of the secondary, the porousness of the secondary.  With the season opener just over the hill... </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel those statements and that entry assumption is being somewhat invalidated? </p>
<p>	Q.  As the offensive scientist you are. </p>
<p>	Q.  I mean that with all sincerity. </p>
<p>	Q.  Aren't you looking forward to facing a gimmick defense on Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  BYU's offensive scheme, in last week's game against Colorado State, only one pass was attempted in the second quarter.  Given what their runningbacks can do, do you think there's a possibility they will try to use a similar type of ball control to keep the ball away from your potent offense kind of scheme that you have used in past seasons? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Ndukwe.  He came in as a wide receiver.  You have had him as a safety.  As far as the instincts go, is that something you've had to teach him?  He's become one of the hardest hitters on your team.  Is that sort of intrinsic that he had and you had to bring it out?</p>
<p>	Q.  After Saturday's game, he's been involved in seven takeaways this season.  Again, is that instinctive?  He really does seem to manage to almost always be in the right place at the right time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you have taken a look at Matt Leinart, can you give me your evaluation?  What did you see appreciate now that you didn't see on film?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms (inaudible.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.) </p>
