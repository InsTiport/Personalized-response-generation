<p>	Q.  (Inaudible).</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just wondering if at that point it was an issue as to whether he was healthy enough to continue kicking. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you figured out who you're cheering for this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you hoping things stay as they are?  Any suggestion as to what your thinking is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, where you're going to go. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it's a smart pick to pick you guys first?</p>
<p>	Q.  (During the season) you didn't want to talk about postseason awards.  Now that we're here, do you think that Brady is a good pick for the Heisman Trophy winner?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things you talked about recently was you felt the team played best at the end of the season.  Do you feel right now that your team was playing better at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Aside from Brady for the Heisman, there are a couple other players up, Fasano best tight end and Samardzija best wide receiver.  Do you think that they're good candidates, that they deserve those awards?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you and Brady make any specific changes at halftime of the Stanford game?  Looking at the stats in the first half, 9 of 19 with the two picks and second half 16 of 19 with two touchdowns and no picks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised by the number of Notre Dame fans in the stands on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering the problems that Notre Dame has had in postseason play in the last decade-plus, how important do you think it is to your program to end this season with a victory?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as Bowl practice, I think you might have addressed this a little bit earlier in the year, but a lot of college coaches say this is a good time to look at some young kids to maybe make some position swaps.  Do you look at it that way in addition to getting ready for the Bowl or is it all Bowl preparation as far as you're concerned?</p>
<p>	Q.  When do your practices start?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do they stay, though, on a pretty strict running and lifting type thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered what you thought of all the kind of whining and politicking and, oh, Notre Dame isn't playing a very tough schedule type of talk?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you think that since the USC game, where do you see your team having improved?</p>
<p>	Q.  I read this morning stories about Brady Quinn may be going pro, and I know that he's repeatedly said that he's staying.  What's your thought about these things come out and what's your thought about the reality of that happening?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last thing with me, in terms of injuries, are you optimistic that you'll get the Talley and Fitzpatrick?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit about looking at young guys during the Bowl practices.  Is that a time when you can look at guys who might be thinking about coming back for fifth years, also?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have any of those decisions been made yet and do you have a timetable set?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has anything been decided yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Brady Quinn had seven interceptions, I think, on the season.  Not many of those seemed to be the result of a poorly thrown ball. </p>
<p>	Q.  Like Saturday it seemed like the ball ended up going right at a defender.  Is that more a case of a misread or did they make an adjustment from what you saw in the film?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you came to Notre Dame obviously your background as a student and your association with athletes when you were here gave you a pretty good indication that no matter what the record was the previous year, you were going to find a certain quality of athlete here at Notre Dame, an intelligent, disciplined kid you would work with.  Was that part of the confidence you had coming in that you could get things turned around and have success the first year?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the start of the year you discussed wanting to install that Patriots model of team chemistry that is so important.  As you look back through this regular season, how much did that model impact the 9-2 regular season and how well do college kids take to that model that Coach Belichick used in the pros?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back now, what do you think has been maybe the biggest surprise for you from the beginning of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the defense on 3rd down.  What have been the keys to that?  Is that a mentality thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the end of the Stanford game they had the long pass play and you and Steve had one at the end of that game.  I think both times the announcers said maybe they would have been better off letting the guys score to give the offense more time. </p>
