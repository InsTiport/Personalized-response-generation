<p>	Q.  Are you concerned about the distraction last week --</p>
<p>	Q.  But you know that the players we asked about this week --</p>
<p>	Q.  I think at the beginning of the year, you said you wanted to see this team get better every week; that that was one of your goals.  Do you feel like it did overall, and where did you see progress? </p>
<p>	Q.  You also had some concern I think about playing in what you call --  playing in space with the defense.  Talk a little bit about that, and what you do to improve those situations. </p>
<p>	Q.  It was about playing in space. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last thing I have is Rashon Powers-Neal, was he not a good fit in that game or was he not able to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about teaching the team how to win, besides emphasizing fundamentals, what are the components of teaching the team how to win? </p>
<p>	Q.  After losing a game as a head coach compared to losing a game as an offensive coordinator, what are the differences in the emotions you feel in the aftermath of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it always a lack of focus with that many penalties, or is it trying too hard or trying to be overly aggressive? </p>
<p>	Q.  The last thing on punt returns, you've had a few punts bounce, do you ever employ two punt returners? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two separate questions.  One is about tackling and one is about Darius Walker.  You mentioned fundamentals and tackling as one of them, do you think the tackling intensity fell off a little bit after the first two games?  And also, could you tell us what you think of Walker in terms of play-action passes and how that's working? </p>
<p>	Q.  Walker and play-action seems to be coming together. </p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan State seemed to get you in a lot of second and longs, I think the average was about second and nine, what did they do to win that phase of the game and how does that limit you or affect you as a play-caller?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game a lot of players talked about how they felt like they were just one play away, one more positive play away from winning that game.  Do you have to teach them more to eliminate the four, five, six negative plays earlier in the game that put them in that situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You joked about being nuts -- inaudible -- in the fourth quarter, we didn't talk about the fourth down -- you were on the 37?</p>
<p>	Q.  The line of thinking there in that situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  The atmosphere you talked about that going in, I have to think you're pretty pleased with how the place was yesterday. </p>
<p>	Q.  We did talk a lot last week about the distractions and you talked about the impact the distractions had on focus, as you teach your players more this week how to deal with those distractions, is it good that you're going back on the road this week, does that help this process? </p>
<p>	Q.  I hope I'm paraphrasing it right from what you said yesterday, I think you mentioned that what Michigan State was doing defensively kind of dictated the change in your game plan.  Do you get to the point in the season where you can trump that, where you can do something offensively to trump what their doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  And then I also had a follow-up on the distraction question.  Do you address the team at all about going against their former coach, or do you just not mention that at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  There were a couple early in the game procedure penalties that you looked like you were talking to the refs --</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a couple of real warm weather games and a couple of games that have come in the fourth quarter; what have the guys said about conditioning and what are your thoughts about how they held up late in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fumble on the goal line, was that a case of maybe them, the referees, letting that play go on too much in the hopes they could fix it on the replay?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's early in the week, but how far along are in your analysis of Washington and what you've got to do, X's and O's next Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the overall progression of your quarterback since you took over there?</p>
<p>	Q.  One more thing on the replay, would you rather not use it, if that's going to be the thinking that they are kind of using that as a crutch? </p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
