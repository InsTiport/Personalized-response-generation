<p>	Q.  You just mentioned the seniors.  Can you talk about the class as a whole?  Some of these kids, the fifth year guys played for three different head coaches. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned, too, that at some point in the winter that there was kind of a breaking down period and so forth.  When did you -- were the seniors the first group that kind of pulled that and started becoming leaders and so forth in terms of your way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Robinson, you mentioned having faced him in the NFL.  What are your memories of him having gone against him and how has he adapted his schemes to the college game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that Brady mentioned being up for the Maxwell Award; no big deal, he's not even thinking about this.  Do you have any thoughts on him being a candidate for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a line there that you have to worry about as far as getting the team to play for the seniors but not have it be too emotional for the seniors?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked earlier in the season about making Notre Dame a tough place to play.  Do you bring in the fact that this would give you a home winning record, which they haven't had in the past couple years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Coach Robinson, do you know him very well personally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Robinson was talking yesterday about the fact that the things he's had a problem with at Syracuse is the fact that going from option style offense to the West Coast schematic change.  Do you think that you inherited a better situation here just because the West Coast offense --</p>
<p>	Q.  If that had been an option, would that have been really hard to change right away?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've worked very hard on keeping your team focused and on an even keel.  Can you imagine what Pete Carroll has to deal with with 31, 32 straight victories?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you think you would deal with that?  I mean, is that something that you've thought through?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you know Coach Parcells' father recently passed away?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've noticed a lot of New England Patriots doing a lot of commercials.  There must have been a lot of commercials during the off season.  For somebody that is so cognizant of distractions, do you think that maybe they've created a few distractions for themselves?</p>
<p>	Q.  This will be the fifth consecutive home game.  Is that beneficial in terms of continuity, in terms of not having to worry about traveling and all the things that go with it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is traveling a distraction when there is travel?</p>
<p>	Q.  I assume you're happy with the way this team has shut out home distractions?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Trevor Laws on Sunday as one of the guys that had a good game against Navy.  Can you talk about his performance this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned they made it easier for everyone else.  How specifically did they do that, by tying up people?</p>
<p>	Q.  He's got a wrestling background.  Did that help him kind of grasp the nasty mentality sooner than other people?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about DJ this year and the progression he's made in the kicking game?  His numbers appear to be up in just about every category. </p>
<p>	Q.  He came here as a walk-on.  Certainly walk-ons have a pretty good history here in the kicking game.  Talk about the walk-ons that you have on this team and the importance of the contribution that they make every day in practice even though we don't necessarily see them. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you came in you set some standards for the team as far as performance and work ethic and that kind of thing.  Do you feel like the progress has been to the point where you can be comfortable in preparation for Navy and Syracuse and Stanford knowing that they have it at a high level and they keep it there every week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up to that, you mentioned on Sunday that in a college game you had a little bit more time than you're used to.  Is the college game a little bit more difficult from the perspective of if you lose four, five, six games in the NFL, you can still make the playoffs and still maybe have a Super Bowl run, and here there's no margin for error?</p>
<p>	Q.  I also wondered, the last couple of weeks in the NFL you had a situation where John Gruden went for two when the ball was at the 1 and Dick Vermeel went for it from the 1 and even Pete Carroll.  Everyone is saying it's a courageous call.  Have you put yourself in that situation where if you were in there, it's just one yard, would you go for it?</p>
<p>	Q.  In college both teams get possession --</p>
<p>	Q.  At the pros there's a chance you might not get the ball. </p>
<p>	Q.  You're willing to take that chance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you have an ideal balance about what would be right for the overtime system between college and football?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've already made clear how much you respect the seniors on this team.  You've also made it clear the focus is on Syracuse Saturday.  With that in mind, do you do anything before or after the game to honor the seniors?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last few years Notre Dame home games have always been played, although sometimes a little rainy, in very pleasant weather.  Acknowledging long-term forecasts are not always accurate, it looks like it may be cold, a little snow.  At what point does weather become a factor in a game and when can you use it to your advantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  And what impact can cold have on you come Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the players or the way you call plays, what impact does it have?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were part of one of the most famous snow games of all time.  Did the snow have an impact on that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about what Bob Morton has brought to the offensive line this year, and has he really kind of emerged as the leader of that line?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you first came in here, did you look to him a little bit more because he's had all those starts?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rashon Powers, do you talk to him at all, and is there any chance that he comes back this week being senior week?</p>
<p>	Q.  I see you've done your homework on Syracuse; you were giving some stats there that I wasn't even aware of and I've covered a few games here. </p>
<p>	Q.  I just want to follow up on a question that you were asked earlier in terms of the transition that you've undergone as opposed to the one that Greg has undergone here, and that is conceptually, did your offensive line, for instance, understand the kind of teams that you wanted to run when you came in, or did you have to go back with them from square one and teach them how to block, for instance, or was it easier that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  And just to follow up, I see that you have three former college head coaches on your staff.  Did that aid you in any way in making the transition to the college game, and B, how has that worked out with so many head chefs in the kitchen now?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have a couple questions for you.  First of all, you mentioned that you were going to talk to your team about the 2003 game, and I believe it was Brandon Hoyte yesterday, somebody said (inaudible) crowd motivation for 2003, and you said no, that was in the past. </p>
<p>	Q.  As the coach, how do you balance how much you look back with how much you try to keep your team focus forward?  Where is the line there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you watch any Texas film in preparation for this week, given Coach Robinson last season was the defensive coordinator in Texas?</p>
<p>	Q.  And how much are you able to rely on Mike Haywood?  How much can he contribute given he was on the same staff with Coach Robinson?  Does it hinder his contribution, the fact that you run different types of teams, or can you rely on what Coach Robinson did in practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the passing defense and the improvements they've made.  It's parallel to the way your offense has improved.  What's the key to be able to come in and jump start a unit and make that dramatic improvement on either side of the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, Syracuse, what they've done on defense is similar to what you've done on offense, you've come in and really --</p>
<p>	Q.  How valuable has Jeff Samardzija been for you guys this season and why do you think there's such a marked improvement from the past few years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you attribute that to all his hard work?</p>
<p>	Q.  You just got a brand new ten-year contract.  Will the job security, knowing that you have that, make your job any easier, or does it even factor in when you're going out on game day?</p>
<p>	Q.  Then on that note, when you see Syracuse and you watch the struggles that you've seen the offense go through in working with Coach Robinson, do you ever feel for Coach Robinson, trying to get -- a new coach in the college game like you are, do you ever talk with him about that or anything of that nature?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about (inaudible) and why he does so well, why he has had the picks he has this year?</p>
