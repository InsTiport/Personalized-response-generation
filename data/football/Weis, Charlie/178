<p>	Q..  There's times where teams come off big wins and they go the other way.  You've had a lot of success with the Patriots having big wins and building on it.  From a coaching standpoint can you talk about the keys to doing that?</p>
<p>	Q..  With the special teams effort like that, will there be a change in personnel or will you be making adjustments throughout the week before you address any personnel changes?</p>
<p>	Q..  The overall play last night -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q..  Brandon was talking -- inaudible -- making a concern about what happened last night because it's a mature team, do you let guys like Brandon handle that or --</p>
<p>	Q..  Along those same lines, as you continue the transition, what kind of impact do you expect last night's performance to have as you continue the change in philosophy, believing in themselves, and now you have tangible proof, clearly they have proof that it's true?</p>
<p>	Q..  What does it mean or how important is it to get so many guys involved last night, some of those reserves, right away? </p>
<p>	Q..  Can you talk about the condition of your team, I don't know if you credit that to Ruben Mendoza; seemed like the offensive line was getting a lot of push?</p>
<p>	Q..  What was it like for you going out there knowing it's your program, and was it different than being an assistant coach in the NFL?</p>
<p>	Q..  To see seven different receivers getting tested has to be nice for them, too. </p>
<p>	Q..  You talked a lot last week about the opener; is that the opening play of the series or --</p>
<p>	Q..  Is the first play something to keep them off-balance?</p>
<p>	Q..  Talk about the overall play of Brady and the offensive line. </p>
<p>	Q..  You come off as a guy that has plan A, has plan B and a plan C; is there anything in the game that surprised you last night?</p>
<p>	Q..  Can you talk about Brown, how he played? </p>
<p>	Q..  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q..  What does it mean to allow -- losing eight starters last year, how was such a young squad able to come together so quickly?</p>
<p>	Q..  Last night you mentioned that even before you left the field that you were thinking about your next opponent, Michigan.  Does the toughness of your schedule give you some trepidation or do you think you can use that as a positive in terms of focus and motivation? </p>
