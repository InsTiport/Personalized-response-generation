<p>	Q.  Can you talk specifically about what Travis Thomas has shown you through the beginning, up to this point in the season, that earned him playing time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Because of Coach Sanders resigning, Coach Fulmer has a background in offensive coaching. </p>
<p>	Q.  A couple of questions about Brady Quinn.  What role does decision making play at the line of scrimmage in your system?  How do you assess Brady's decision making through this season so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said before the season started the most important quality in a quarterback was leadership.  Again, how would you characterize how his leadership has grown from your arrival to now? </p>
<p>	Q.  From the time you arrived until now, how if at all have you used Tom Brady as a teaching and coaching example for Quinn? </p>
<p>	Q.  10 and 11 as a starter before this season.  What would you say has been a key catalyst for his develop and growth in working closely with you and in the system?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your own personality in working as closely with him as you have from the start, how have you seen that influence him and manifest itself with the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned both Tennessee quarterbacks are probably going to play.  How do you go about preparing your defense for that system? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you designate a different scout team quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  A couple weeks ago you mentioned Hoskins, you were going to discuss the issue. </p>
<p>	Q.  Any update on Powers-Neal? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you define a trap game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about maybe some of the things you felt you were able to accomplish during the bye week. </p>
<p>	Q.  In talking to Brandon Hoyte before the season, one of his goals was to be a more complete linebacker.  He was pulled in the nickel coverage last year.  How would you say he's done in terms of being a really good linebacker against the pass and run?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had occasion or will you have occasion to just say hello to David (indiscernible) this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've had three games at Notre Dame stadium this season as well as the pep rally.  With 21,000 more seats than there were when you were a student, is it still the special place you remember it being?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think made it special when you were a student 25 years ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what you do in practice to work on those penalties at the line of scrimmage.  I don't think most of us or most fans would understand what you're trying to do. </p>
<p>	Q.  What would be the appropriate penalty?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about Tennessee.  What is it that makes that defense so effective?  Is it just that they have these tremendous athletes or is it the scheme?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because of that, because they can run so much, does that make this the biggest challenge for you going into the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever successfully run a two-quarterback system? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it almost like a mixed thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going against a team... </p>
<p>	Q.  When you came here, you said that Notre Dame was 6-6 for a reason.  You don't view Tennessee being 3-4 for a reason?</p>
<p>	Q.  When a team does it four times, isn't that more of a fluke, isn't it more of a trend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the message to the team this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned they have a hundred-yard rusher this season.  Do you take that as a challenge at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned something about Hoyte.  Do you think he's one of your hardest hitters? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked the other day a little bit about negative recruiting.  Has the amount of that stuff that you've heard since you've been here been more or less?  Has the message you've heard changed from the time you took the job until now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you expand on your theme for the week.  What are you going to try to do to try to get the players' attention?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much attention do you pay to what the opponent is doing offensively?  Do you leave that to the defensive staff?</p>
<p>	Q.  I asked you last week to compare the schemes you've seen defensively with what you're used to seeing in the NFL.  Could you do the same offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're a pretty good motivator.  When you come out, you motivate everybody.  What motivates you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about their defensive end, Haralson.  He's only 248 pounds.  What makes him so effective and so dangerous?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a guy you think has good enough skills that could transfer to the next level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Staying with the defensive line, against South Carolina, the defensive line had 10 tackles, but they also broke up 10 passes.  How were they able to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever faced a team quite like Tennessee that has this much talent and is this dangerous, sort of struggling as much? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any team that stands out for you that has been in this kind of situation, the record doesn't match up with what you think they can do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked in the past about having a plan for everything.  It seems like you have a lot of influence on every aspect of the program.  How does that influence help you to succeed in building a program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you noticed it already has helped you in your first year?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of game planning, I'm sure you go week to week.  Do you have other long-term plans that you think about, stuff you thought about once you were hired?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it true you got a 1600 on your SAT?</p>
<p>	Q.  Three or four years ago, you were pretty much off the radar in the eyes of Notre Dame.  You have a long-term contract, things are going well.  Is there a sense of accomplishment in that, a sense of, "I showed them"? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about since you've taken the job?  Have you had people out of the woodwork, ex- students, people you knew that have totally amazed you, "Where have you been all this time?" </p>
<p>	Q.  With regards to scheduling, having the two bye weeks so close together in the future, is that something you try to avoid?</p>
<p>	Q.  Considering how important your relationship is with the quarterback, when you recruit quarterbacks, are you looking specifically for a type of personality that's going to allow you to relate to that person even more so than any other person?</p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.)</p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone.)</p>
<p>	Q.  Part B of the urban legend about your academic credentials, with your 1600 SAT. </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you accepted into Harvard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why do you think this love affair will last for 10 years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Being that you are so involved in so many aspects of the program, how do you guard against spreading yourself too thinly?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you have a high standard for success.  What is that standard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Off the field, what's that standard? </p>
