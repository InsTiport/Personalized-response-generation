<p>	Q.  So after all that, Charley White played the game?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you break down your offense for me a little bit in terms of where you have seen improvement and where you would like to see continued improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has there been an area where you have seen improvement so far this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, if it rains Friday night, do you plan to have the field covered or does it matter?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about history between you and Pete Carroll, how often you have met and how those turned out?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you motivate players for a big game like this?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you do something special to motivate them, to get them really going?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, four times you went head-to-head with Pete Carroll in 1988, 1999 with you as the offensive coordinator.  Do you recall those games?  What do you recall about those games </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, you mentioned earlier about an even keel.  You said two things the same everything week.  This week is changing up a little bit as far as players and ability.  Do you worry that sends a different message to the team that this is a different week?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a few weeks ago about certain teams, the mind set.  This is a series that has been very streaky.  I think the last time a team won this one time only was the green Jersey game.  Since then, it's always been at least three games.  Any idea why seems to -- (inaudible) </p>
<p>	Q.  The things that seem to be in common among -- with USC, when they get into trouble, they go to the run game, that's where they overpower teams.  Is that something that you think could work to your advantage because you have got a pretty good team against the run?  </p>
<p>	Q. Lastly, can you talk about the play of your defensive front, especially Chris Rome?  </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned USC's success in the second half.  And you guys have success in the second quarter.  So it looks like both teams are good at making adjustments.  Can you talk about the process of making adjustments, how you get that communicated, how that works?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a matter of making the players ready for that?  Is it a matter of communicating it well what you want to adjust?  </p>
<p>	Q.  You are pretty much sticking to the here and now.  Part of the mystic of this place are games such as this and the No. 1 team beaten and the streak is ended.  Is that important this week within the team?  Is it something you talked to them about?  </p>
<p>	Q.  One other thing, you mentioned the second half scoring difference with USC.  As you study that team, is it just that massive talent eventually takes over?  Is it the ability of maintaining a level of play for 60 minutes or a combination?  </p>
<p>	Q.  One of your players mentioned earlier that he said when he watched USC on film, it seemed to him like sometimes the teams that playing against the Trojans don't know to do with themselves once they get a lead so they of tighten and get nervous.  Have you seen any evidence of that when you watch film, and if so, how do you guard against that with your own team?  </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that in preparing for USC you were going to go back several years and watch films.  When you look at their defense this year, they obviously lost six starters and Oberon (ph)leaves.  How differently are they schematicallyÃƒï¿½Ã‚  and -- you know, in terms of preparation for your players, how different of a defense will this be than the one they saw last year?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Final question.  I am wondering which bowl ring that is and if that has any significance in terms of which one you wear at what time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your quarterback is a different player than what he was last season, made vast improvements.  How do you account for that and how much of that has to do with your working with him?</p>
<p>	Q.  One other question.  Switching to defense, your team is ranked somewhere like 95 in terms of defense, and you are facing a No. 1 offensive team.  How do you succeed?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, obviously, you are hands on with your quarterbacks.  But how does Coach Vaas -- how does he compliment what you do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, with what happened to Coach Cutcliff (ph) in the Spring, did you spend more time with Brady because of what happened, and you do you think your confidence and your kind of Jersey brashness, as you like to say, has rubbed off?  </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm from New York.  It's all right.  </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)  </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, with Maurice Stovall, you mentioned earlier about him losing the weight and so forth, but he credited the coaching staff with really getting his motor running in terms of wanting to stay after practice and do extra things.  He talked about his transformation with the extra work and also being a more physical receiver.  </p>
<p>	Q.  You played 10 freshman.  You played some of them in critical spots.  Talk about your confidence in your freshman class and being able to put freshmen in big situations.  </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)  Comes with a certain amount of tension something like this week.  Do you find something out about yourself as a head coach this week?  </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as facing the game with this much heat to it, with the stakes so high, evolving in this job as the head coach and handling everything you have had to handle since February, is there something about this week that may be you haven't handled before that -- </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, you mentioned that you thought it was important to have your team acting and feeling the way you do with this team.  How did you get them to do that and was it hard?  </p>
<p>	Q. Charlie, given that, with the psyche of your team, how imperative is the good start in the game so they don't lose that confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about No. 3?  </p>
<p>	Q.  I assume 11 ranked higher up on the list.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, I was just wondering if you could talk about play calling and how do you acquire a feel for it, and how much does kind -- how much does intuition come into it as opposed to preparation?  </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess is there anything different that -- I know you haven't coached a lot of college games.  Is there anything you see that's different about USC, what Pete runs than, you know, what you have seen week in and week out?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, defensively.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Pete Carroll seemed to sense after about a year into his first -- his first year there that he was a better fit at college than he was in the NFL.  It just seemed to work very well.  Five games in, can you tell if it is a better fit for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel that your background as a teacher has helped you out in dealing with the younger kids, maybe more than in dealing with the pro's or can it have an affect at both levels?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, you mentioned David Cutcliff (ph)briefly.  Have you spoken to him recently and you know just his chomping at the bit to get back in the game somewhere, some way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Thanks </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)  </p>
<p>	Q.  No.  </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember Notre Dame -- (Inaudible.)  </p>
<p>	Q.  Charlie, just to get back to the whole idea of intuition and play calling.  How do you acquire your feel for play calling?  </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, you mentioned earlier that one of your biggest jobs last week was to get these guys to believe.  I would imagine there might have been scar tissue built up after the three results against Southern Cal.  Can you elaborate at all what you had to say or remind them of to get them to believe?  </p>
<p>	Q.  You made that impressive summary of all their strengths on both sides of ball.  I thought you maybe you glossed over their cornerbacks a little bit.  Might we expect Notre Dame to attempt to move the ball in front of those guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible )</p>
