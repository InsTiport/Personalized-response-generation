<p>	Q.  This is the first time you've had to prepare for two quarterbacks.  Have you learned anything about doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last game DJ limped off the field.  Is he okay?  Will he be kicking this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're preparing for Stanford or any team for that matter and you watch the tapes and their schemes throughout the season, do you ever get to the point where it's game time and they come out with something totally different, and if so, how do you adjust so quickly?</p>
<p>	Q.  At what point in the week are you normally confident you're ready for a game, whether this game or any game?  Or would you like to have an extra day or two to prepare?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you look forward to off weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Or any week that you don't play, a bye week.  In other words, to give you more preparation time for the following game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Out of context, what do you like about the Jersey Shore?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a lot in the past about position flexibility.  Is that something you look for when you look at linebackers as far as guys that can move from inside and things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the young guys, which ones that we haven't seen a lot of yet this year have stood out for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Saturday Darius was able to make a run of over 20 yards for the first time this season.  Is that a concern for you, that your running backs haven't been able to break off bigger runs this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're not looking for more explosiveness in the running back position?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the special teams you mentioned that wing, getting the blocked punt -- the blocked field goal and nearly having a couple others blocked.  Is that a scheme correcting thing, or how do you go about correcting that problem?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, and your blocked extra point. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you improve the protection, is that through a scheme, personnel or both?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Harris has really built quite a reputation as far as an instructor of quarterbacks and also as a play caller.  Your reputation also has been built on play calling, and Coach Harris has done it for a long time.  Did you ever see yourself one day maybe relinquishing the play calling duties, or is that something you feel you need to hold onto?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also, Coach Harris has combined many times his duties as an offensive coordinator with tutoring quarterbacks at the same time.  Do you feel that sometimes you need to separate the two or it just depends on the situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've got kind of a strange week this week with the holiday and the travel plans.  Any changes from what the road experience has been in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you think about -- you mentioned red zone and how efficient you've been throughout the year, but last week wasn't quite what you have been doing.  How do you go about fixing that, putting your team in the mindset that this is red zone and this is where we have to be the most efficient?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you agree yourself personally --</p>
<p>	Q.  How have you graded yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ronald Talley is looking kind of gimpy, as well.  Do you expect him to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about grading yourself.  Which game do you grade yourself the best on and which one do you grade yourself the worst?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would that be an undefeated season or being No. 1 or something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about what's left, have you ever felt that feeling or do you think you'll ever reach a point where you can look at yourself and say what have I accomplished?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you ever imagine just saying that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you're not talking much about post-season awards.  Do you avoid that at all with Brady to make sure he doesn't get caught up in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on players who play more than one position?  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) could you ever see yourself doing that on a regular basis?</p>
<p>	Q.  You raised the bar with your team, and obviously from the outside looking in, the bar has been raised on you guys, as well.  If you finish 10 and 2 this year, that becomes the bar now, and going into next year 10 and 2 from the outside looking in is not as good or insufficient.  How do you feel you will be affected by those outside opinions regarding putting such high expectations on your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Personally you yourself when you travel, how do you use that time?  Is that a relaxation time, or obviously the preparation for the game you're going to is already done.  Do you allow that to be a relaxation time for yourself?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little research about first year coaches and offense and so forth, where this one stacks up.  From your own perspective, did you go in and say here's where I'd like to be?  Did you envision this?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that you had the meeting with Notre Dame when you were still with the Patriots.  I don't know how much of that you did when you were with the NFL.  As a college coach now, do you stop doing that, sharing your philosophies?  And if so, how much do you share?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last thing is with Brady, when you were in the NFL with your long weeks and everything, other than when you came here to visit and look at their team, did you have an awareness of who he was and what kind of quarterback he was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about offense and 3rd down conversion and how efficient.  You're also a pretty good defensive team, top 30 in the country.  Is that a better reflection of the unit, secondary, linebackers, or just overall solid play?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned practicing 3rd down. </p>
<p>	Q.  On another subject, a lot has been made of the spring schedule this time of year.  How much do you pay attention to what happens after you guys play?</p>
<p>	Q.  If Tennessee loses to Vanderbilt you don't think it'll break their spirit?</p>
<p>	Q.  How has Landri improved from the past, say maybe middle of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Derek might be a little undersized for the middle, or does that help him?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you always kind of have a message for the guys.  What would be your theme for this week's forum?</p>
<p>	Q.  You touched on a little bit after the game getting Syracuse.  Would you address sort of the reason for the second quarter offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why has the 2nd quarter been so good to you guys this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just one more thing, if you had to describe this season in one word, what would it be and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bill Walsh has often said that he always liked to draft players from Notre Dame and Stanford because he said those kids were smart and they could execute what he needed them to.  When you prepare for a team like Stanford, when you watch them on film, is that intelligence level evident in the way they play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Second question, I've heard people talk about Tom Zbikowski and Jeff Samardzija as kind of the odd couple.  What kind of similarities do they bring to the way they approach the game and the way they approach practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  People are always in a rush to judge recruiting classes.  Can you talk about the art and the science of judging high school players, judging recruits, trying to figure out who's going to work for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've read in football circles that Steve Belichick was considered one of the best scouts of talent out there.  Did you ever get a chance to talk to him about that, about scouting talent and protecting and how he did it?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just got an email the other day from a fan who wrote me and said the last two or three recruiting classes at Notre Dame have yielded nothing.  In answer to an earlier question, you talked about the contributions your players have made and how they're responsible for the success.  Can you talk about what some of the juniors on your team have meant to the success of your class this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you play in a BCS game it's a big payout, a $14 million game versus a $2 million game.  Does that ever sort of creep in?  How do you sort of keep thoughts of that because the stakes are obviously very, very high when you're talking about the difference between a BCS game and a Gator Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do the payouts ever enter --</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you reconcile a Stanford team that loses to UC Davis and takes one on the chin last week in their rivalry game yet goes to places like Pullman and Corvallis and comes out with wins?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know Walt Harris at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's going to be some other things going on, stadium, 84-year-old stadium, last game.  You talked about sort of minimizing distractions.  There's going to be some extra stuff going on with senior night and the whole thing.  Do you keep your team sort of largely away from all that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you to expand a little bit on the one-word educational description.  I can't imagine you ever saying you're satisfied, but if you would have set your first season, could you say you're reasonably happy or reasonably pleased with what the team was able to accomplish?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the third PAC 10 team that you're going to play.  Is there a certain similarity to the styles out there or are each of them a unique challenge?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you in the turnaround that you've been able to effect at Notre Dame, what has been the biggest reason?  Has it been a change in the system or a change in the attitude?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a great deal schematically -- a schematic difference in the system you put in and the system they were running prior to your arrival?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said at the beginning of the season it was your goal to see every game played.  Have you watched all the games this year over the course of the season, the past few weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Saturday was a family time for you last season.  Where were you on college football last year?  Like a year ago would you have known which teams were in BCS positions and things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've mentioned the Michigan State game as one that was winnable --</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those lines, what was your evaluation of the block at the first half, for instance, Walker running out of bounds and saving the time out and gave them just enough time to score a touchdown at the end of the half?</p>
