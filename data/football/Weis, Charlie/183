<p>	Q.  When you were assembling the staff, what was your game plan in doing that?  What was the overall plan?</p>
<p>	Q.  Changing the subject.  This past year Notre Dame's rushing game was the lowest -- produced the lowest output that it had in I guess 50 years.  What are your plans in terms of striking the balance and reestablishing the running game at Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much time have you had to maybe study the personnel that you're getting back, that you have currently?  How much time have you had to prepare and look at that at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  That was going to be my next question.  How do you go about looking at what holes need to be filled,  that sort of thing, in recruiting? </p>
<p>	Q.  What about holes?  Specifically, where did you feel you needed to hit the hardest in terms of recruiting this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there common threads that you're looking for, common qualities of the recruits that you're going after?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also when you were talking about your staff, you said that you were looking for guys that were your type of guys.  What is your type of guy? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not a lot of staff have three former head coach (inaudible) you needed a little more experience in your assistants to help make sure there was improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this weekend kind of a crucial weekend because you don't expect to be around the next few weekends?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of a recruiting question, as well.  Given the state of the Notre Dame football program over the last decade or so, what can you or will you be able to sell and recruit other than just the name Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned that you were very up front about the fact that you can't establish these long relationships with recruits.  Along those lines, how do you feel like you've been received with recruits across the country? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of existing players, what's your philosophy regarding position switches?  At what point do you ponder that? </p>
<p>	Q.  During your student days here at Notre Dame, the heart and soul of team was comprised of guys from the Northeast, Midwest area, you mentioned Rick Minter's ties with Cincinnati.  Then when the program reached a higher level under Lou Holtz, people thought that the recruiting improved in Florida, Texas, "key areas".  Do you have a certain philosophy on where you believe that Notre Dame's recruiting efforts should be concentrated? </p>
<p>	Q.  Considering many of us saw the USC-Oklahoma game the other night, the speed that was on the field, do you have any assessment of where this team is at speed-wise?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much (inaudible) on recruiting for you?  You talked about tough guys in the trenches.  What about the skill position?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you bringing in a speed coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the current players who are already here, their assistance in helping you and the new staff with recruiting.  You often say the current players here are the most important component in getting new players. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the mindset of those current players?  You talked before about how these guys have been through a lot. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much were you on the road this week?  How have you been able to balance the two jobs?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the NCAA rules.  Do you have somebody helping you making sure that you don't violate anything? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have three recruiting weekends after this.  Can you give us a general idea how those will be handled?  Are recruits coming in even if you're not here?</p>
<p>	Q.  So there will be recruits coming in each of the next three weekends?</p>
<p>	Q.  After this weekend, after you get involved in the playoff games you have, how much time would you perceive spending on this job?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been a while since you've been on the road recruiting, has it changed quite a bit since the last time you've been out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about winter conditioning?  First of all,  do you expect Coach Mickey Moratti to still be with the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you changed a lot from the previous staff as far as how you will approach that? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you talk about your recruiting, do you approach it kind of like a draft board where you have a lot of different names up there, then you have targets, or is it a little more narrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about tomorrow?  It was announced you're going to be introduced at the basketball game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to talk to Justin Tuck yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  If he said he wanted to talk to Coach Willingham, would you mind calling him for advice on this? </p>
<p>	Q.  The fifth-year process involves the head coach and a lot of other people.  From your standpoint, where are you with the fifth-year guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  I've got a couple of recruiting follow-ups.  When recruits ask you how soon do you see Notre Dame returning to the elite program, what do you tell them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you share how many recruits are actually coming in this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  You going to be watching any NFL games Sunday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see some irony that you're facing Dave Wannstedt in your first college game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Which Super Bowl ring are you wearing?</p>
