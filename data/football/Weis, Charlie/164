<p>	Q.  And the kids and you have also talked about it being a process in acquiring that defense mentality.  Is it here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just based on your past comments, you did a lot of prep work for different teams in the summer.  But from a player standpoint, how difficult is it when you make severe style shifts in either offense or defense week to week, like you will this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you catch any interesting things on film specifically?</p>
<p>	Q.  There are quite a few players after the game that talked about the importance of a game like this psychologically where you have a lead.  I'm curious what you learned about watching the game and what you spotted. </p>
<p>	Q.  Tommy mentioned this after the game in terms of the secondary's improvement, and they said they felt like the defensive backs have a better understanding of where one another are going to be.  Do you see that, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just lastly, I think you opened with the backfield of Travis and Terry at the same time and didn't use it a whole lot but I'm sure there's something you liked about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you take them one at a time, but at this point every story, every newscast yesterday -- when do you start talking at any tournaments about bowls for the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you just see the BCS and know where you need to be in that, to be there?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the fact that you liked the way that when the game is close, they turn it on.  Is the next step to make sure that the other team doesn't get close? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the fumble, was that supposed to be a backward lateral or --</p>
<p>	Q.  Was Jeff aware of the rule or just didn't realize --</p>
<p>	Q.  The second series of the game right before Stovall's touchdown -- (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you draw the line between determining whether your team is being complacent or a team like Tennessee -- obviously nobody is disputing their ability, but what are the kind of things you're looking for?  What are the things you're trying to sense from your team when you're in that situation and you do lose a big game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has been your experience with teams where one side of the ball is performing better than the other side of the ball?  Have you been involved where you reach a point where the side that's doing better gets disgruntled?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about the defense, and you said that the fact that they didn't give up any points in the fourth quarter shows that the mentality of the team is changing.  Can you talk about that a little bit more?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about telling Bill how much you respected what the secondary did yesterday.  What do you like about how far they've come this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've answered a couple of questions today about the mental makeup of this team and the progress they're making in terms of when the game gets close, later in the game -- (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess my question is, is it sort of like we're never going to practice red zone offense?  Is it something that you might talk to them about or is it more result driven?</p>
<p>	Q.  A confidence factor.  Is it something you say to them, okay, guys, when we're in this situation you keep your composure and do X, Y and Z, or is it the fact that you've done it over and over again?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Maurice and you had mentioned about how big the blocks were that he had.  How do you instill that in a guy to say, hey, you're not getting the catch but we still need you to make blocks?</p>
