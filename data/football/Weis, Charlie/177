<p>	Q.  Defensive players making a tackle -- inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Early in the game, especially, Darius Walker seemed to dance a little bit, what is your philosophy, when there's no hole there, do you want him to just hit it up or do you want him to stop and reverse field and do some of the things he did earlier in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wood, not a very big guy, missed a tackle early in the game, are you concerned he's going to be able to hold up physically, No. 1, playing corner all year, and what are your options right now in terms of tackles? </p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you heard from Tom Brady at all yet this week and what kind of back and forth will there be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you compare and contrast Hart and Grady and what they bring to the table and what makes each of them difficult to stop defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  The backup running back, Grady. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you where you thought you should be and what are your thoughts on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about keeping an even keel, did you talk to the team about that, that you can't put too much into it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about Darius as a receiver, what kind of threat he is as a receiver? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel about the Michigan rivalry or do you view it as a regular game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you try to pass that along to your players, the businesslike approach?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you account for the fact that they may have been holding a little bit back?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you prepare for a game on the road, over 100,000 fans, is your approach any different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your impressions of the instant replay after going through it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much does it help to have that Pittsburgh game before Michigan, now that you have that one under your belt?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much did that help you as far as recruiting, too, just to have a win?  You've been talking to these recruits for a long time and now you have something to talk to them about. </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you heard or even spoken in the past, visited with Lloyd Carr, what were your impressions of the way he ran his program overall and what might have you learned? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going into a game and going out of a game, what do you feel are maybe the most overrated team statistics?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday in Ann Arbor, Lloyd Carr mentioned that the Big 10 will probably be a 12-team conference before too long, and that anything that helps the conference would be welcome.  Would a conference schedule -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Over the years coaches talk about the biggest advances people see in their team from week one to week two; if there is, where do you look for it, on special teams, offense or overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Tom Brady before, obviously I know his attention is on the NFL this week, but have you two talked about this game or have you joked about this game in the fast? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you detail it for us? </p>
<p>	Q.  And you talked a little about recruiting before.  Have you found that just because of the nature of the two institutions that you bump up against them maybe more than other schools? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Tim Massaquoi, can you talk a little about what makes him so effective? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now, Massaquoi is a former wide receiver.  Does that show up in his game at all, the way that he runs passing routes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk more about the offensive line and after watching more of that tape in the first game, what really did they do the best? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said they didn't play perfect by any extent, was there something glaring that you saw that really bothered you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the other day about being a game-plan coach, and then after the game you talked about the game was really won from ten yards after the line of scrimmage, not the secondaries.  Is that what you're talking about when you talk about being a game-plan coach, attacking what was their weakness, compared to their strength?</p>
<p>	Q.  On Sunday you mentioned penalties being something to improve on, over the next couple of days, how do you go about trying to coach these guys to be smart? </p>
