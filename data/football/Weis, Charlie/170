<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Travis Thomas coming in there late and running hard?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were able to get a lot of guys in the game late.  Talk about that and also did anybody jump out at you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the big plays by your defense this year, the (inaudible) turnovers also they had a pretty good third down percentage defense.  Where do you see this defense getting better, what would you like to see get better?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was a quote apparently attributed to you by Purdue about the days of losing Pittsburgh and Purdues are over.  Do you know where that came from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Comment on TV also was made that everybody has played zone against you except Purdue.  How accurate is that and what do you -- what kind of coverages are people predominantly playing against your offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  You outscored your opponents 75 to 19 in the second quarter.  How do you account for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at Brady's performance and you grade how he did, it seems every time they blitzed he made the correct read, and are you surprised how quickly he's picked up the offense and been able to make those quick reads?</p>
<p>	Q.  Travis Thomas, he's performing pretty well last couple of games.  Will he be getting more playing time with his performance this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  First third of the season behind you, what are a couple more pleasing things that you have had a chance to reflect on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Unrelated question.  What do you say to the -- your receiving core is playing pretty darn well.  Why not say, hey, Raymond McKnight, get better, see you next year, save your eligibility and graduation  -- (inaudible) --</p>
<p>	Q.  What approach do you take this week in the bi-week?  Is it a bunch of different things?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you expect this much improvement from the offense, from last year to this year; is that a surprise?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)--</p>
<p>	Q.  Early on someone asked you about your (inaudible) tag, the offensive guru, and you laughed at that.  Do you not think you are pretty darn good at it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your experience of being a teacher, how does that make you a better coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Giving up big plays, 10 plays from 300 yards.  What is a number you can live with there in terms of big plays given up?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game a lot of the offensive players talked about how they felt, like if they just did their job nights like Saturday should be common place.  Does that border on overconfident; do you like that attitude?</p>
<p>	Q.  The run-off for the next couple of times do you want the players to enjoy this moment or do you kind of go back to just treat this like any other game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what Peter Vaas has contributed to Brady's development?</p>
<p>	Q.  Defensive line had no sacks.  How much of that is attributable to the three step drop; how much is it having to contain the option and then how much is disappointment (inaudible)--</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about the ability to see Rashon improve week after week.  You seem to mention things picking up blitz zones, they get better and better.  (Inaudible) --</p>
<p>	Q.  People seem to be making a big deal about you having an extra week to prepare for UFC.  How much more prepared can you get a team in --</p>
<p>	Q.  Seen some video of the Patriots' game yesterday. One Brady's gain is another Brady's loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said exponentially this open week helps you.  I take it you like the open weeks in college now?</p>
<p>	Q.  We haven't heard a lot of critiquing from your son.  Has he kind of laid off that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seven beers.</p>
<p>	Q.  What is it like having Charlie there at a high stress time?  Having a kid at work at a high stress time could be difficult, what is it like having him there?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is it like having him there? (Inaudible) --</p>
<p>	Q.  Reason why you end up on offense is because of that job opportunity years and years ago. Defense, (inaudible) could you be equally successful on the opposite side of the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like there's been significant progress in the last two, three weeks maybe some individuals who really like gotten it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Another point I want to make was about the conditioning of this team.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) --</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) are you always in the back of your head about last year that maybe they have not taken out of the box --</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt Shelton, he had a big impact on Saturday night.  Is he finally starting to get back to full strength after being injured?</p>
<p>	Q.  Characterize the job that Rick Minter has done this year so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  General summary question.  Five games in, how would you asses your own performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you had one play or one sequence to get back this season, which would it be?</p>
<p>	Q.  Late in the first half versus Michigan State you got the ball back, the game was still tied.  I think there was a pass to Pisano for 24 yards.  (Inaudible)?</p>
