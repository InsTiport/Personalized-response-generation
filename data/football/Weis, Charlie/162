<p>	Q.  Apparently Darrin Bragg ran the quarterback last week.  What other players did you use?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think you only had nine possessions and you scored six touchdowns.  Is that about what you expected?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked yesterday after the game about how you were in an ornery mood all week.  How bad of a mood are you going to be in this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  After a while do the teams learn when Coach is in a bad mood, we're in pretty good shape?  Do you worry about them learning that mindset?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your general idea for both you and the team is forget it, it's over?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned also yesterday about one of the reasons why you looked to the running more was the weather could be bad.  Do you at this time of the week start looking ahead to the weather or just assume in November it should be bad weather?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk frequently about getting the team to improve as the season goes on, that that's a big goal.  Do you feel you took another step in that at home?  In your career learning from the guys we learn from, what are the keys to making that happen?  That's certainly something every program would like to do. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a little different for you now because you're coming from a background in the NFL where at this point in the season it's only half over? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  There have been opposing coaches saying how good your offense looks this year and a lot of credit goes to Brady and your tailbacks and receivers and tight ends.  Could you talk about how the offensive line has come together?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the offensive line, how important is the chemistry of the guys working together instinctively knowing what the others are doing, and when did you think this line might have that kind of chemistry?  Was it after a couple games where you start to think these guys can play together?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you are rotating, how do you make the decision about when to take somebody out?  Is it a matter of getting guys to rest or is it situational?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  For one person, if you're running somebody in and out, how do you make the decision when to do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about checking the weather and stuff for games.  What about this year, you have a full length of the recruiting cycle.  Do you plan recruiting week and say I'd like to get these guys in December rather than in January when the weather is really bad?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of recruiting, too, do you pay attention to how the guys that you've already got commitments from are doing in their high school seasons or are you focused on the guys you don't have?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's maybe you the most valuable thing you've learned about the college game this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the schedule and kind of winding down, have you at all had to do anything to make sure you were able to maintain a pace or not get burned out?</p>
