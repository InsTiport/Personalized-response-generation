<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any predictions as to what will happen a year from now and how will this process be different than the first time through? </p>
<p>	Q.  I talked to Evan Sharpley a couple of hours ago, he's very excited and he said that you guys told him that you wanted him to compete when he comes in; is that for him or for all of the guys coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of talk of how much you've been on the phone.  Have you been on the phone every day all the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if you felt like there were players who were lost because of your dual role, and maybe players you gained from the exposure of New England being in the playoffs? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've used the word "content" a couple of times when you've described this class now.  Just to get an understanding of what you mean when you say "content," would you still feel the same way a year from now if you had this same number and this same quality of kids?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same line, recruiting analysts who talk about what it means put Notre Dame in the mid 20s, when you're traditionally in the Top-10.  Do you think it was almost impossible to get the blue chippers coming in in mid-December, and is that the biggest maybe problem with this class is that you didn't get maybe the blue-chip players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel because of the time, you were short-changed?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about relationships.  Since you didn't have time to build a lot of relationships, what do you think it was that did put you over the top on some of these recruits?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at defensive backs specifically, do you talk to any of these young men specifically -- I know you're looking at flexibility and you don't know until you see them -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel like with this class you were able to address all of your needs? </p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't feel like you needed a running back at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk a little bit about Steve Quinn from Philadelphia?  I understand that he was offered last week -- inaudible -- changing positions, can you talk a little about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you envision him like playing linebacker or offense or what did you envision him coming in as? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your philosophy on quarterbacks, how many on the roster, and do you have some philosophy that you need to get at least one quarterback every year or how do you feel about that?</p>
