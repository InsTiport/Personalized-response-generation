<p>	Q.  The other day you said that in order to be a good coach, good play caller, you have to see the game through your players' eyes.  Because you didn't play college football or beyond that, did that take you longer to learn to adapt to?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the other day you don't think much about the bowls.  At this point your players have to know that they're favored -- they should be favored in the last three games.  Does that put more pressure on the players now heading into the last three games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same lines, this is a game Notre Dame has won 41 straight years.  Do you think that -- do your players think they don't want to be the team that lets the streak end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just defensively, triple option, is there any one area of the defense -- you previously had talked about the safeties.  Is it tougher on one area particularly than it is on the rest of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've heard you mention you watched a TV copy of a game; now you've touched on an end zone copy.  Do you watch different angles of all the games?</p>
<p>	Q.  And those are done for you and prepared for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going into the season there was some talk about rebuilding the confidence among the defensive backs.  I think Mike Richardson would be the first to admit that that was something that was bothering him, a lack of confidence after last season.  How have you seen him progress, and it seems like he's really made strides in that area especially?</p>
<p>	Q.  I noticed in the Navy notes that none other than Bill Belichick was quoted as saying over the last decade, best technique, sound running game that he's seen was Navy.  I was curious, did you and Bill actually study the Navy tapes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Years ago the option wishbone-type style was the rage in college football and the most successful teams --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you believe that the reason why colleges have moved away from that type of scheme is because players -- elite players are looking to showcase themselves more in pro-style offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your offense has been based so much on versatility and being able to change every week based on what the other team is doing, but Navy does essentially the same thing week after week.  Are you surprised at how successful they are at doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Gatorade shower you took after the Tennessee game, was that the first of your career, and if so, what happened in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've mentioned several times the 80- to 90-hour workweeks that you have.  You also indicated that your wife and son are your biggest critics.  My question is when do you have time to see them?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you bring in the big name Notre Dame stars of yesteryear, do you feel that's a positive motivator, and when they come in is it a surprise who they are, Montana or whoever might be coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  How often does it happen, every game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who do you have coming in this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious about your substitution thoughts in terms of second team, third team.  Let's say we have -- at what point do you put in the backups?  Let's say you have a 50-0 lead at half time.  Would you come out with a second team second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  With a team like Navy that will run the ball in just about any down, any distance, how imperative is it to really stop them on first down and try to dictate down and distance a little bit more than maybe with some other teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your receivers, once again, Mo made a nice catch for the touchdown the other day using that 6'5" frame to go over a short cornerback.  You've got that advantage again this week.  I guess the question is why don't coaches recruit bigger cornerbacks to go against the bigger receivers?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've touched on the kids from Navy being a special group and a special program.  When you were a student, did you have a sense of that kind of reference for Navy, and also, did you realize how much Notre Dame's history and Navy's history were intertwined?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mark LaVoir was a guy that came in here very briefly as a tight end, was a really good athlete in high school, played a lot of different positions.  Could you comment on what kind of season he's had and if that athleticism shows up?</p>
<p>	Q.  The type of offense that Navy runs a lot of times consumes a lot of time off the clock.  Is there a little added urgency about getting ahead and not watching the clock get burned up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about special teams.  They seem to have had ratcheted up in the last few weeks.  Is that something that took time, to get the system down that you wanted or people feeling more comfortable in their roles?</p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the game Saturday, you mentioned that you thought the secondary did a pretty good job based on the numbers and you wanted to have a chance to look at it on tape.  Were you as happy after watching the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seeing the game through the players' eyes, is that from a camera angle or is that input from the players when you watch film together and talk?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the size and speed correlation mainly with regard to the defensive backs.  A guy like Zbikowski, is he uncommonly fast for a big guy because against Tennessee he outran some pretty quick kids?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you watch any of the game last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can we talk about the timetable you had going into Notre Dame and if this year has surprised you in any way, and are you ahead of the timetable you had set?</p>
<p>	Q.  It appears there's a height disadvantage this week.  What concerns you about Navy's secondary?</p>
<p>	Q.  Regarding Belichick, a couple of years ago he spent some time with Paul Johnson to study this offense perhaps out of his own curiosity.  When you scout and watch them on tape, how much of what they do appealed to your curiosity or intrigued you as a play caller?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were asked about what you thought of service academies when you were a student.  How about in your professional career, the stories that you might have heard from Parcells about his experiences, or either Coach Belichick about their experiences around the Naval Academy?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible.)  Have you gotten to know him?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you can talk about how -- you mentioned that Navy averaging 20 yards per catch.  How has your secondary been able to come together this year and be effective when it needs to be, given the fact that you had three new guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of times when it's a coach's first year somewhere, you'll see a team struggle early on and they'll say they're trying to grasp the scheme or are growing into the new system.  What were you guys able to do when you came in?  What did you do throughout the winter, spring, summer, to sort of help these guys hit the ground running?</p>
<p>	Q.  That being said, does that mean that for instance maybe this year or the year after that we'll see the players doing perhaps more of what you want them to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has it been more difficult to get the kids to focus after a big win, or after like USC, which was such a disappointing defeat?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just one other thing.  The contract you signed, can you clarify to the community outside Notre Dame to those who follow Notre Dame in terms of where you're going to be for the next ten years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul Johnson told us yesterday he thinks the biggest difference between Notre Dame last year and this year is that the quarterback is executing better, is playing head and shoulders above what he played last year.  Would you agree with that?  I know you've watched film of last season.  And secondly, what have you done to work with Brady to get him to perform better, and are you working with him directly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Secondly, the biggest challenge I think each year for Notre Dame is convincing their players that a team like Navy that is undersized and doesn't have the same athletic ability can beat them.  Do you think that that's a difficult thing to do, and as you look as their personnel, do you see guys that can really hurt?</p>
