<p>	Q.  You talked last week about being in an ornery mood after the first one.  What kind of mood are you, more ornery mood or what exactly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Again, looks like you're ranked at No. 10, do you feel like you're a confident team right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel that your front and Brady handled their blitzes?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Notre Dame moving into the Top-10 or getting towards the Top-10, there's also a chance that you would have people matching for Heisman.  As a head coach, do you feel like it's your obligation to play into that a little bit or do you feel like you really need to focus on the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Scott Smith it appeared got into the game a little bit.  Can you talk a little about his progress? </p>
<p>	Q.  Outside the summer with the freshman, how did you guys get these guys so prepared to be ready to play; so many of them have already played this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you compare getting a rookie ready versus a freshman ready?</p>
<p>	Q.  Before these guys got on campus, did you have any idea who might be ready, anybody you thought would play early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you maintain contact a lot with people in the program, former players and such, wonder what type of feedback, if any, you received after the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people were saying Michigan would really be a test of where this team stood, and not even in terms of whether you won or lost, but how you were perceived; does that change your line of thinking at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned -- is that a concern -- inaudible -- has that been addressed enough?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to put a fine point on something you said about instant replay yesterday.  You said something about the officials are going to err on the side of safety and I'm not sure what that --</p>
<p>	Q.  How much more is it a part of your job to motivate people and be aware of the players psyche than it was, say, last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is doing this something that you've enjoyed so far, the challenge? </p>
<p>	Q.  First home game of the year, obviously very familiar with what a football week is like here, does this change anything that you do this week getting the team ready, as opposed to the last couple of weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  How will you try to prepare the players, especially the younger players, with what they have to deal with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week you talked about the great home-field advantage the Patriots have, and certainly Saturday, that stadium will be full of energy, electric.  How does a team positively channel that energy into success?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned last week that your favorite play from the Pittsburgh game was Darius's touchdown on the screen, not so much because of the score but the blockers and hustle on that play.  You singled out the play by Ambrose Wooden as the hustle play, almost seemed like it was just delaying the inevitable, but, do you splice together certain plays of the game and try to show to the team an example of hustle that can win or lose a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you pick your special teams captain yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the whole, has your defense exceeded your expectations so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know how soon we can expect to see Tom Brady with the hat? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday Brady Quinn faced a lot more adversity than he did against Pittsburgh.  What did you learn about him yesterday that you maybe you didn't know? </p>
<p>	Q.  And the secondary yesterday did a very good job of confusing Henne or having him look to his tight end first, what was the game plan going in there to kind of limit him? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a couple of times the passes your front four knocked down yesterday at the line of scrimmage, and I think from my count it was at least five, which most everyone seems to think is as high as we've ever seen.  Have you ever been involved in a game where the front four has gotten more balls at the line of scrimmage than yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  And the second question is, you said that there is more of an opportunity after the team wins, is there also more of an opportunity -- inaudible -- after they have seen the success they have had doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you see a freshman in practice, what are you looking for that convinces you can put them on big stage like yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was kind of curious that you're going to give guys kind of a history lesson on Michigan State, is that a departure?  Seems like that strays a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  The offense, we've seen flashes -- inaudible -- how big of a concern is that and what's is going to take to get a little more consistent? </p>
<p>	Q.  The offense has played very well in spots, but also stagnant in spots; what's it going to take to get that going for four quarters? </p>
