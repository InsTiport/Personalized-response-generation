 Q.   So far, what is your assessment of how the team has practiced?  
COACH KELLY:   Done a really nice job since we got down here two days ago.   Kids understand what this deal is.   When you get an opportunity to go to a bowl game, it's how can you improve and finish off the season the right way.   
   
 Q.   How can Carson help the team even though he can't suit up?  
COACH KELLY:   He's been a great leader for us.   It was unfortunate he's been hurt.   He's always been there with our guys, does a great job of making sure our guys understand what's going on.   
   
 Q.   How have you managed to have such successful seasons with firstâ€‘year starting quarterbacks?  
COACH KELLY:   We don't look at that.   Obviously Marcus had spent a year in the system before because he redshirted.   Darron Thomas did the exact same thing.   
We feel like we have a system that is quarterback friendly, and we also have an outstanding quarterback coach in Mark Helfrich.
