 Q.   Ryan, how tough was this loss to lose like this?  
RYAN KATZ:   It was tough a loss.   Whenever you lose it's tough.   It was a hard‑fought game and we just didn't pull it out.   
   
 Q.   Leon, in that last play, talk about the scoring drive?   
LEON McFADDEN:   Can you repeat that, please?   
   
 Q.   On the very last touchdown, what happened in terms of defense?   What did you guys see or not see?   
LEON McFADDEN:   Just we didn't pay attention to our technique, I guess you could say.   We didn't execute the defense as we're coached to, and that's what happened.   We were caught slipping.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you guys are capable of playing, I guess‑‑ from the defensive back standpoint, do you feel like you're capable of playing that kind of man coverage that needs to be played at this point?   
LEON McFADDEN:   Yes, when we are playing and honing in on our techniques and paying attention to our assignments, we're all good in cover.  
   
 Q.   So on the last two drives, as they're coming down, how do you keep repeating this over and over again?   
LEON McFADDEN:   Yeah, we have to give credit to those guys.   They were all good, but at the same time, we didn't execute to our best of our ability like I said, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   How would you grade the defensive ability this September?   
LEON McFADDEN:   To be honest with you, we haven't reached our potential yet.   We're waiting to do that.   We need to do ASAP.  
   
 Q.   Leon, it seemed in the first half they struggled with it, and then they turned it on in the second quarter?  
LEON McFADDEN:   It all came down to confidence, probably.   He's a good quarterback, and he has some good guys on the outside, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   Does it make you feel like it's just one of the better games that you guys have played?   How would you grade yourselves on how you did tonight?   
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   I think the offense played pretty well.   There are two times we have to convert on third down and long, and at the end of the game we have to try to finish.   But overall, we did play well?  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   Yeah, that's our identity.   We want to be a good running football team instead of the play action.  
   
 Q.   Adam, talk about that three‑yard punt?  
ADAM MUEMA:   Held the blocks, missed and scored.   That's what they need to do.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
RYAN KATZ:   It was fine.   He's a tough guy.   You break your hand, you have to snap with your other hand.   Not too many guys can do that.   He's doing fine.  
   
 Q.   What happened on that exchange?   
RYAN KATZ:   That snap, one snap of the game it was on the ground.   Things happen, so, just got to try not to make those mistakes.  
   
 Q.   How much of a galvanizing force was that you making the touchdown and in the end zone, how much of an energy boost was that?   
LEON McFADDEN:   It was a big energy boost.   It really got us going, and brought the morale.   We've just got to finish the game though.  
   
 Q.   Did they do anything up front or did anything that you hadn't seen on film or anything?   It looked like you were under pressure pretty much the whole night.   
RYAN KATZ:   No, they weren't doing anything that we hadn't seen on film.   We've just got to execute what we're taught to do.   Like Leon said, I think that goes for the offense and defense, and today we just didn't score enough points.
