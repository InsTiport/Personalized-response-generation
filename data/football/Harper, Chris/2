  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Do you think the uniforms are a recruiting tool?  
CHRIS HARPER:   Yes, definitely.   I mean, as bad as it sounds, if you're looking at the uniforms where you want to go play football and go to school at, it's a terrible situation.   You have to look at way more aspects.   When you get there, you're going to have so many more problems than what you're going to wear on game day.   
The young guys coming up aren't thinking about that.   That's something I would encourage the young guys to look at, look at the coaching situation, the school, the facilities, other than just the jerseys.   
It helps in recruiting because you want to get players, but I don't think that's a good decision.
