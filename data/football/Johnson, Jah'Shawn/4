 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: They're a good offense, running backs and receivers.  Quarterback, kind of mobile, both of them.  So they can extend plays.  Their running backs are really hard.  They're bigger, physical guys, so we'll prepare well for that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: Yeah, kind of a different team.  Similar to Houston, a little bit, but they have their own way of doing things.  But like I said, they've got some great skill guys, they can make some plays.  We just have to make sure we tackle well and play the ball in the air.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: Yeah, it was huge.  I mean not many teams in this program went down there and won.  I think it was six or seven teams in 90 some years.  That was huge.  And then the way that we done it was exciting.  But hopefully this time we won't make it close.  We were planning to extend our season and get to a bowl game and end it the right way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: Everything.  They've been through a lot.  A lot of them, I mean some of them that's been through a coaching change or maybe the first year, but we've had plenty of position coach changes.  They toughed it out.  They put everything into this program.  They've led the right way.  And that's what they deserve.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: It would be huge.  Just even for the extra practices for our guys that are red shirt go.  And any guys that's not playing a lot.  So those practices are huge for them, as well.  And it prepares them for spring ball.  And just being able to be in a bowl game, atmosphere is great.  Always fun to hang out with your team for some extra weeks instead of going home for Christmas break early.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: I wouldn't say it highlights it, but it's definitely something you want to do.  But just winning, period, highlights your season.  So like I said, just ending it with a bowl game would be the highlight of them all.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: Kind of.  Yeah, like I said, those extra practices help the young guys and the guys that are red shirting.  They get a lot of work during those weeks.  And just being able to get them out there and get extra reps a day you don't get during practices in the season helps.  Anytime you get a chance to play a game it brings more experience and more -- everything else to the team.  So, yeah, it will help.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: It will be a better feeling than waking up early every week.  This is a nice stadium.  The crowd will be electric.  I mean it will be fun.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: We're preparing the same.  We won't have an off day this week.  So we'll be practicing today.  We normally have an off day on Mondays.  But everything is still the same.  And excited to go.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JAH'SHAWN JOHNSON: They have a couple of big guys that can jump well, play the ball in the air well.  So you've just got to get your hands on them and be physical with them and kind of slow them down and mess up the timing of the routes and things.  They have a couple of shifty guys.  But they're kind of actually kind of bigger than the other guys that are shift I that we've seen this year.  They have it on all cylinders.  And their offense can get rolling and score a lot of points.
