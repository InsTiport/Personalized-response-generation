<p>	Q.   Donovin, talk about the play of Mike Bishop, was it what you expected?</p>
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  No comment.  No comment at all.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  They did a lot of things.  Blitz the quarterback, linebackers read well and they made plays.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  Did a great job.  Covered our receivers well.  They played plays.
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  At that time we were in a blitz. One of the safeties -- where I was the safety that came down.  It was a good play called by or defensive coaches. Just put us in a good position to make a play.  When the runningback came to me, you know, I wrapped him up and pulled the ball out in an attempt, knowing we were down, to strip the ball.  That was a legit attempt.  I believe they called it and they said that he was -- he was going backwards, where actually he was still trying to push forward, but I was trying to strip the ball.  I believe it was a fumble.  The referees called it their way.  You know, that's how it goes sometimes.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  Misjudgment on my part.  Should have protected the ball well, did not.  Fumbled it.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  He did a great job.  I didn't.
<p></p>KEVIN JOHNSON:  We felt we changed the momentum of the game.  We just didn't come out and execute the second half.
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  You say why was the flag picked up?
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  From my perspective, the wide receiver pushed off.  They called a hold on it.  If you would have seen on the film, you would have seen he could not hold him at all.  It was a deliberate attempt to push off.  That's sometimes how it's happen when you're on their sidelines, they get their calls their way, we get ours our way.  It was unfortunate that the play went against us and think scored.
<p></p>
<p></p>NATE TROUT:  I don't really want to look at it like that.  He's a great kicker.  But I just wanted to go out there and do the best I could and help my team to a victory.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen that way today.
<p></p>NATE TROUT:  I wanted to come out and compete with him to see how I stacked up.  My first couple kicks weren't too nice.  I stepped up and had the last two field goals, got the ball in the air.  I just wanted to come out and compete with him and see how I stacked up against the best.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  No, they did not.  Did everything we prepared to do.  Did a great job of it.  Got a good quarterback, made plays.  The secondary did a great job.  We just didn't capitalize.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  I lost three games this season. You can't say this is the toughest.  Fourth game we lost  this season.  That's how I look at it.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  You don't look at it that way. You look at the scoreboard, we lost.  You look at the film, you find out what you did wrong, then you go from there. You try to make changes.  So I guess we'll all watch the film, evaluate how we played, and then we'll just go from there.
<p> </p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  Anytime you have a match-up, the goal is to go out there and try to make the least amount of mistakes.  Today we made more mistakes and they capitalized on our mistakes.  That sometimes is the way in which a game is fair.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  When you look at a team that goes 10 and 1, you can't look at the tough defense and they things they rack up.  You have to look at the offensive side.  They did a great job on offensive, as well as on defense, as well as special team.  You have to tip your hat.  Won the game, did a great job, they're smiling right now.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  Not at all.  When I go out there, my mind is focused on what I have to do.  I block out the crowd.  I believe that my team does it as well.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  It was just bad judgment on my part.  I should have tucked it away.  We worked on it every day.  You know, while we're practicing, I always tuck it away.  I did not.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  It brushed on my pads and pants and fumbled.
<p></p>DONOVAN McNABB:  I mean, we lost it.  I mean, it went between the ref's legs and we lost the fumble.
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  I wouldn't say that.  I give Mike Bishop a lot of credit.  I believe today he made plays.  In all of our games we played this year, quarterbacks attempted to make plays.  I think today he just made a lot of plays.  It's not so much a rating of better quarterbacks.  I think today he did a good job of, you know, leading his team to victory. 
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  Actually, we were in the man-coverage.  We should have been all over that.  That was our mistake.  That's one of the things we're talking about in terms of mistakes.  They capitalized on one of our mistakes.
<p></p>DONOVIN DARIUS:  We prepared well.  We didn't execute as well as we would like to.

<p></p>

<p>	Q.   Do you feel you could have done anything better defensively?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>COACH PASQUALONI:  Well, I thought that we opened the game and the first drive we played pretty well.  Then I thought we closed the second half.  The last half of the second quarter, I thought we played pretty well.  But in between, we didn't play very well so we just tried to get the kids to focus on what we felt we had to do in the second half.  We just wanted to worry about who we were and get done what we felt we had to get done.  Go back out and play the second half, we felt we would be nine.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>COACH PASQUALONI:  Yeah.  It's very, very difficult  when you have to play the long field and you're in the field position game.  I don't know how many yards we had in penalties, but it just seemed to me that every other play was a penalty of one sort or another.  I mean, we lined up off sides defensively something like three times in a row.  I mean, it was just crazy stuff.  You can't play that way.  You can't play a game like that and expect to win.
<p></p>COACH PASQUALONI:  No, not necessarily, no.
<p></p>COACH PASQUALONI:  Either of those plays.  If we get the turnover and the touchdown, it's a 3-point game with about seven minutes to go.  Good Lord only knows what's going to happen there.  We lose contain, he throws a long touchdown pass, that's another big play.  Any of those.  We can go back over this game.  There's going to be a lot of plays in this game that we're just going to, you know, wish we had back.
