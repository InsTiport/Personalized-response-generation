  Florida State - 20

JIMBO FISHER:   Very proud of our kids.   Played hard, made plays when we had to make them.   Offense was a heck of a drive at the end.   Like I say, that team limited you possession wise.   We only had eight in the game, and they did a nice job of keeping things off balance, but we bent, still didn't give up but 17 points which I think is very critical in the game. 
Offensively we had the ball four times in the first half, scored three.   The other time was an interception, which we got through our hands, which I still want to see the film on that one a little bit, too. 
And then in the second half we hit a 1st down, got a penalty, had to punt, backed up, and then drive down, we missed the field goal, then we had another penalty and we had the ball at midfield there and got behind the stick and then we dropped a post route down there that we're open on, then we kicked the game‑winning field goal, and that was it on offense. 
Again, moved the ball extremely well.   When you get eight possessions in a game, that's not very many, and the dropped post and the holding were critical plays.   The guys don't do it on purpose, but you can't make those mistakes in a tight game like that, but that's what keeps it close. 
Great job our team, tremendous drive to eat the clock and the game at the end, Roberto hits a field goal, we centered it up just like we do a lot of two‑minute drills, and very proud of the way we used that. 
Defensively, bent didn't break, gave up a couple 3rd downs.   That was a critical 3rd down we gave up coming off the goal line.   They hit a power play and we got it bunched up and it bounces outside and they get it, but we've got to make that play. 
But still proud.   They played much better in the second half.   They did a good job, they an midline, they ran speeds, they ran counters, they ran powers, they did a really good scheming in the off week in the things they did.   But the quarterback scrambled a couple times, we lost contain.   We didn't lose contain, we had a spy on him and he got caught up inside. 
But Roberto even had a missed field ‑‑ we had a high snap which threw the timing off, and we got a missed field goal.   But games like that where you don't get many possessions, they're always going to be close games. 
Again, very proud of our team the way we competed in the game, played well and did a good job on 3rd down, scored in the red zone when we got down there, when we got chances to get down there.   I thought Cason punted the ball well.   I think we only punted once or twice in the game if I'm not mistaken.   Was it twice?   But proud of them.   Heck of a football game, fun one to watch, I guess.   That's the way they go.   Again, very proud of our team the way they competed and played very hard.   Got to continue to get better.

Q.   What happened with Rashad's arm?
JIMBO FISHER:   He got hit right there, and they were just scared he might have broken a bone right there in the elbow when he took that shot, so Jake ran in and did a quick x‑ray and saw he was all right.   Just hit him real hard.   Jake panicked.   Jake is like a parent.   Doggone trainer.

Q.   He seemed to still be favoring it. 
JIMBO FISHER:   He did.   That's a good shot.   He took a shot on that bone, so they went in and checked it out to make sure there was no damage and he could come back.   There was no breaks in it or anything.   It was just a good shot.

Q.   Does that show how tough he is?
JIMBO FISHER:   Oh, it's tough to come back.   Again, he broke the all‑time yardage receiving record.   That's lasted, what, since 1969 or '70?   That record is 40‑something years old.   The all‑time receiving yardage record tonight Rashad broke.   He has the catches now, he has the yardage.   The only one left is the touchdown.   That guy is a heck of a player. 
I thought our seniors stepped up good again, he and Nick and those guys up front, and the offensive line ran the ball at the end of the game, really had to run it.   Protected well except for a couple of those holding plays.   Had hands to the face.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JIMBO FISHER:   We did have a couple of critical drops.   That post route was a very critical drop.   A play that Bobo usually makes a play on, that was a big one.   That was a big one down the field.   Had the over route, and I couldn't see, I thought he had a chance to catch that ball.   But we'll look at it. 
Those all get magnified when you don't get many possessions.   Those get magnified.

Q.   Some fans thought it was important to have a game in the aftermath of the shooting because it helped the process.   What's it mean to you to win a game and sort of help that process?
JIMBO FISHER:   Well, I mean, again, a game is nothing compared to what happened the other day, and again, our thoughts and prayers and everything about Florida State, our condolences go out to everyone.   But again, I think it is a little ‑‑ athletics has a way of starting a healing process, and that's a heck of a one to heal on right there as far as the excitement and just watching battle and fight and scratch and claw and stay there. 
I think athletics is so big for your community.   I don't know if we truly‑‑ even me, who's been in it my whole life, I really don't know if we really appreciate how much athletics really holds a community, universities, cities together, because they rally behind them so much. 
I'm glad hopefully we can give a little comfort to some folks that were really suffering.

Q.   You mentioned your team with the pass protection.   How much does that help Jameis?
JIMBO FISHER:   It has.   We had a couple breakdowns.   They started coming all out blitzing some things, and that's going to happen.   But if he's feeling much more comfortable in the pocket, getting balls and driving the ball, getting it out of his hand.   It makes you read so much better because when they get clean you can get through your progressions, your decision making.   It really helps.

Q.   Two straight games Dalvin has had (inaudible)?
JIMBO FISHER:   Well, and we blocked well, and he just has that knack.   Karlos ran well in the game, but then Dalvin hit those big runs at the end.   We were checking it back and forth.   He let neither one of them have it right there, and Karlos did a great job blocking, being himself.   How about a senior doing that?   Hey, I don't care if that guy is running it, I'll block.   Again, it talks about our team.   Dalvin is going to be a heck of a football player and he's really developing into that.

Q.   Some people say he already is. 
JIMBO FISHER:   We'll see.

Q.   Rashad, obviously he gets a lot of recognition around here, but you don't ever hear about him for a Heisman. 
JIMBO FISHER:   No, it's the Derek Jeter syndrome.   I say that because he's not a boisterous, loud guy.   Think about that, we talk about Derek Jeter, and I say that, guy never won at MVP, never won a lot of individual awards, but you look at his numbers and all his teams did was win and he was a large contributor and made the plays at critical, critical times in the games.   To me that's what a truly great player‑‑ that's the greatness.   And he doesn't want that recognition.   He'd just as well‑‑ he just wishes he didn't have to come up here.   Not that he doesn't like you, he's just a quiet guy, he'd just pack his stuff, go home, get ready to play next week.   That's just Rashad.

Q.   He dropped a touchdown pass early. 
JIMBO FISHER:   Yeah, he did.   He shakes them off.   It was just a hair, that was just good timing right there and a good play, but when you have that much, as I call it, it's not false confidence.   Guys can get up and down with drops and catches when you're young.   I call it graveyard confidence.   I've got it, but thenyou ‑‑ he, and Jameis is like that, too.   Even though they make mistakes, okay, we're going to get this right.   There's true confidence in their abilities.

Q.   Can a game like this be just as important going into next week?
JIMBO FISHER:   Oh, no doubt.   We're going into battle.   These games are going to be dogfights.   People are going to try and be the one that knocks us out, knocks us off, got nothing to lose, we're going to play hard, but again, learning to play in a physical game, learning to play in a tightly low‑scored game, all those things, it definitely does.   Every time you're in those situations you learn. 

Q.   This team is a really tough match‑up just the way their style of play?
JIMBO FISHER:   It is, their style and getting the balls to the edges, and it's just a different‑‑ they were even running midline.   That's old bone stuff, the old stuff that you don't see very often but they combine all those things.   It's a tough challenge. 

Q.   You're going to hear the same talk about those‑‑
JIMBO FISHER:   I don't care.   We're going to keep playing ball, keep them in line, play Florida, and we're going to keep doing the same thing.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JIMBO FISHER:   Well, we've been doing a lot of no‑huddle, just getting tempo in the game, and then we did, and got a little rhythm and got going.   Got a good start.   I thought we got off to a really good start.   We've done that a couple games already, so just things that we felt comfortable with going into the game.

Q.   On the last drive, at what point does it become you're going to start setting up a field goal‑‑
JIMBO FISHER:   Once we hit inside the 30.   Once we got around that 25‑yard line or so.   I always say this:   The 42‑yard field goals that most everybody is very, very consistent, once you hit that 25, and then you've got the best kicker in the world, you're going to do that. 
And I felt very comfortable at the same time for two other reasons.   We were making yards in the running game, wanted to be patient and eat the clock and not give them the ball back.   It was a critical mistake at the end which actually I'm getting ready to call a time‑out and he gave me a time‑out.   That's what I said.   I wanted on with about four seconds so we didn't have to kick off. 

Q.   You said everyone is trying to knock you out and knock you off, Florida is going to be playing a must‑chance last game?
JIMBO FISHER:   They'll be emotional, they'll be ready to play.   They've got a very good team.   I mean, and a rivalry game?   That's what all teams do.   That's what any‑‑ I say any opponent should do.   That's what I would do.

Q.   Did you give an answer why (inaudible) snap the ball?
JIMBO FISHER:   Oh, he said we had changed a running back somewhere.   I don't know.   Never mind.   I'm going to shut up.   I'm getting a little perturbed on some of that stuff.

Q.   Jameis looked like he shooed him away. 
JIMBO FISHER:   He did (laughing).   Next question, please. 

Q.   With the way you guys won, kicking the field goal in the last three seconds, how do you feel about your team still remaining in the top four in the College‑‑
JIMBO FISHER:   Why wouldn't it?   We're undefeated.   We're undefeated.   We finish every game.   Everybody else in the country has not finished at least one game.   We've finished every one of them.   Isn't that the object?   Isn't that the object? 

Q.   Yes, sir. 
JIMBO FISHER:   Okay. 

Q.   I know you wanted to move on from Jameis, but is there any concern (inaudible)?
JIMBO FISHER:   Yeah, I don't think he realized it.   He was caught up in the excitement of the moment.   Hey, you get emotional.   You play.   He didn't realize, he thought he could snap the ball.   The kind of play we had was based off a quick run up the line, snap the ball.   That's what it was based on.   I don't know, we'll see. 

Q.   He didn't say anything to you when he got back to the sideline?
JIMBO FISHER:   No, no, he doesn't even remember.   When I yell at our players, five minutes later I don't remember who I yelled at.   You move on to the next thing.   He was just making a play and he knew that was his job, get out there and set hut and snap the ball and get the ball out there.   You know what I'm saying? 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JIMBO FISHER:   No, they did a good job on that from that standpoint.   I think they understood what was going on.   Those guys handled that part of the game.   They managed the game itself, that part, I thought very good.   They did a very nice job.
