Q.   Jimbo, first of all, how does it feel here this championship?
JIMBO FISHER:   Well, we knew the road was going to be hard any time you win the championship and our kids fought hard and overcame circumstances and our offense played a great first half, our defense played a great football game overall.

Q.   I want to talk about the end of this game in the fourth quarter in the NC State game, some other games your team didn't finish.   You finished it tonight. 
JIMBO FISHER:   We made the plays on defense.   We did.   Offense, we got enough first downs.   We had some chances to make points; we just had some uncharacteristic errors we got to get fixed.   Our kids battled.   What a play by Carlos Williams and that defense.

Q.   Talk about making the stop. 
JIMBO FISHER:   They did, and they got some momentum and we changed the coverage went to a zone coverage and Carlos saw it, and he burst it, man, he's so athletic.   He tipped it.   He had the ball skills to maintain and hold onto that ball.   What a play.

Q.   Offensively EJ looked like he was in control here tonight?
JIMBO FISHER:   He did.   He was in great control and in the second half we kept shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties, lined up wrong, we'd get a drive going and then we had a fumble down in there, but we did enough to win the game, and I'm going to tell you, we still won 11 games and won the ACC. 

Q.   You had some disappointments this year, but now you are going to the Orange Bowl, and this team seems genuinely excited. 
JIMBO FISHER:   It really does.   That first one, you've got to get over that hump, and once you get over that hump you know what it takes.   Hopefully from now on out, we can continue to play for the years to come and play great football.
