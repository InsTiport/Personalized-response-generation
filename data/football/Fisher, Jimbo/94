COACH FISHER: Proud of our team, the way we competed in the game.  Loved the energy, the enthusiasm, the fire.  They did what we asked them to come out and do.  I was extremely proud of that.  Not sulking, not feeling sorry for themselves.  They practiced well during the week.  The did some things.  I think they found out a little bit about themselves they could come out and do that.
