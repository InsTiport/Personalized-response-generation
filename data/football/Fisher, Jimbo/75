COACH FISHER: Hello, everyone.  From this weekend, extremely disappointed.  No sense in that happening, the way it happened, but it did.  We as coaches and players, we have to own that.  That's who we are.  That's what happened.   
We say that's not us, that's not us.  Well, that was us.  That's what we played, that's how we coached.  Now we have to do a better job of fixing those issues and moving on.  As you look at the film there's plenty of issues that need fixing in all phases of the game because we failed in all three phases of the game when you look at it.   
Didn't respond enough on offense.  Had good momentum early in the game.  Had a couple opportunities early.  Really hit some big plays, got some pressure.  Battled back to 14-10, felt good.  Gave up defense.  They were moving the ball very well, moving it well all day.  They're a very good football team, well-coached.  At the same time if we do what we need to do, how we need to do it, the angles we need to do it, there's a lot of plays to be made there in both phases as far as offense and defense.   
Get that score, we had that critical turnover.  Kind of just went from there.  I think our kids, one thing, they got shocked, no doubt.  I don't think they quit.  I think they were shocked at what was happening and how it happened.  It shows you how quick things can happen.  If you're not on your A game, I don't care who you are, where you are at, what goes on.  Anything can happen at any time.  It's very disappointing it did.  That's my fault.  We have to move on and do it.   
At the same time we have to look at those issues, correct them, make the adjustments which we need to make, and play the way we need to play.  Put a lot more passion and emotion.  Emotion and heart and all that stuff is good now, but what's going to win now is heart and emotion with a lot of technique and sound fundamentals of hat placement, hand placement, where we step, where we block, where we look, the fundamentals of how you play.  Then you have to play with great heart and passion.   
They did that a heck of a lot better job than us.  They did a real nice job, that's for sure.  There's a lot of guys that did some good things, a lot of guys that didn't do the things they needed to do.  We have to coach them, make sure we put them in better position, make sure we can do when we get on the field.   
Now it's time to adjust to that.  Let them see the film, adjust to those things which we got to do.  Move on and get right for a very good South Florida team.  Outstanding team, undefeated, averaging 50 points a game, playing really good on defense.  Last year, only last two games since our game last year.  Play very well.  Very dynamic.  Got good players, always have.  Have always had a great program.  Will be one heck of a challenge going down to their place.  Be a very big test for us to see how we want to respond, how we want to react, who we're going to be, who are we and what are we going to do.   
Whether you're banged or bruised or anything of those things, it's time to move on.  It's football season.  Must do a much better job of what we're doing, coaching, playing, all the phases of the game.  We'll go from there.   
Any questions.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: I mean, what we're doing was the same things we did in the Ole Miss game.  What's the difference in the Ole Miss game which was a very good team.  This team played really well.  We didn't play our A game.  We played in the Charleston Southern game.  We played against each other.   
You don't drastically change.  You make changes here and there.  They were there to be made in the game.  We made them.  We just didn't make them with enough consistency to execute.   
Like I say, everybody said there's bad plays.  Any play you don't execute is bad.  There's times we have executed and times we didn't.  We have to coach them better, put them in better position, make sure we're ready to get that done.   
 Q.  Did you feel issues were more physical or mental?  
COACH FISHER: Both.  I mean, we had (indiscernible) violations.  We had guys in position to make plays and didn't make them.  A few good calls they had.  They got leverage, we brought some pressure, which we were trying to create some things later in the game.  You're going to take a chance here and there.   
For instance, the time they hit our low back on the flair for a big play early in the game, we got a guy there, just runs right by him.  Two guys hitting the quarterback.  If he peels it, a sack.  That doesn't justify it.  We didn't execute.  They did.  There was opportunities there.   
Offense early in the game, third play of the game.  We have a big play that Travis made for 30 yards.  We made that same pass, were open, we just missed a block.  It was a physical thing.  Everybody knew what to do.  We were getting there.  Just didn't get there the right way.   
In a game like that, they found those inches, for those three, four, five plays.  Just like us at Clemson up there in 2013.  I mean, we win that game, what, 51-14 or whatever it was.  Usually never that big a difference in between.  Sometimes when momentum goes, execution goes, teams get hot, those things happen.   
What we have to do is respond back, look at why they happen, move on and make it better.  Do we have issues?  No doubt, or we wouldn't be in the situation we're in.  There's no sense to be in that situation.  But got to get better at it.   
 Q.  You hear guys talk about communication.  At one point it went sort of blank.  What do you do to fix that?  
COACH FISHER: It all happens in chaos, when you panic.  When things go, you start to feel things go, people, they'll go to say something.  When they have to communicate, sometimes it's not you don't want to make another mistake, so you become hesitant.  You get on your heels.  That's what momentum does in sports.  It's no different.   
What happens is I say it, but I don't say it loud enough.  Usually when I'm confident, things are going well, I'll scream it, holler it, I'm relaxed.  Things like that.  When you get in those situations, sometimes they don't say it loud enough.  All of a sudden here comes that play.  That's what I'm saying.  You got to get back to playing in those situations.   
We have a lot of guys that have and a lot of guys that haven't at that level, and we have to keep continue to doing that and reinforce it in practice, make sure you do it no matter what.  It's like you don't want to make a mistake, I don't want to make a mistake once it's starting to go bad.  You have to have more guys come to the rescue.  You can't wait to be rescued.  You have to rescue yourself.  By doing it, you have to stand up, make calls, do things no matter what.  And quick.   
Like I say, players don't want to lose.  They don't want to make mistakes.  They don't want to do any of that.  Coaches don't either.  At the same time you can't fear what the result is.  Have you to be ambitious.  That's sometimes where maturity comes in.  We have to get more mature in how we do things.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: No, it definitely does.  I think it most definitely does.  When you saw them afterwards.  Ranting and raving and yelling isn't going to do anything right now.  I mean, I'm mad.  I'll pissed off.  I'm pissed off at myself that we allowed that to happen.  I'm pissed off at our coaches.  At the same time, it happened.  But why did it happen.   
Yelling and ranting and raving now isn't going to do anything.  Now you have to fix it, figure out how to do it, you have to go back to work with passion and a purpose and drive and get it done.   
There's a lot of football left to play.  At the same time, we've got a lot of work to do to make sure we play good football.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Yeah, I mean, I was extremely mad.  There's a point once that goes, it makes no sense.  I mean, that's what people do, don't want to try to find solutions, they cover it up.  Right then is not trying to cover it up.  Right now it's trying to figure it out, be honest, at the same time be very direct, very accountable for myself, our coaches, our players in every way, and know we're all there together and we are all going to figure it out because we know we can.  We've proved it in the past.  We've proven it for six years.  We've proven it the first two games this year that we can.   
One game doesn't define you unless you let it define you.  It should drive us, not define us.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: No, it's not panic.  It's just when things don't go well.  I don't think we were panicking, I we were shocked.  You got shell-shocked, hit, I've never been here.  What do I do.   
There was not panic.  When you went to the sideline, there was still communication.  You just got on heels in momentum, and you got to change momentum.  We were able to do it in the Ole Miss game.  Like I said, it's very dangerous to keep putting yourself in that position.   
What I felt better in this game than the Ole Miss game, we had weathered the storm a lot better for the first quarter and a half when it was 14-10.  There was, what, 10 minutes to go in the second quarter, we each had the ball four or five drives.  The Ole Miss game, we were in good shape.   
You knew it would be an emotional burst when you first went up there.  Felt very comfortable.  Missed a third-and-five.  It was inches.  Went right over our guy's head.  He is looking down on a slant.  If he gets his hand up right there...  He was looking to this guy.  They were throwing it behind.  Guy threw it right over his head, which is very hard to do, very risky.   
But they had those inches for the day.  Then it was like dag gone.  Then we had the turnover.  It was like, man.  You got to change it back.  You got to go back and make it happen.   
 Q.  You talked about coming back and reevaluating things and fixing it.  Is this where you realize what this team is made of?  
COACH FISHER: No doubt.  You're going to find out what defines us, you know what I'm saying.  It isn't the scoreboard.  It isn't the national championship.  It isn't a Heisman Trophy, a watch list for this.  It's about playing football.  Going back to the process and remember why you play football and how you have success.  When you have success, you grind, you do the little things, which I thought we had done, but not well enough.   
We eliminate the clutter and go back to each other.  Sometimes you have to do that.  We need to do that.  It's like a lot of teams that faced that issue in the past.  I don't want to face them like we did.  It's very disheartening in a way.  But, hey, it's reality.   
 Q.  What is it about this team that you believe that this could drive you?  
COACH FISHER: I think the resolve and the look in their face and the comments coming back, I feel very good about.  Now, from the drive point.  Now we have to make sure we're fundamentally good enough football players to do it.  Wanting to do it and having the right comments is one thing.  You have to go back and execute on the field, belive, love, trust, believe in each other, what's going on, and do it at a high level consistently, consistently.   
 Q.  (Question about senior leaders communicating.)  
COACH FISHER: No doubt.  At the end of the day the players have to take ownership of the team.  They do.  We have some really good leaders.  Have had meetings, have done that.  They will do that.   
It's all part of that culture which you got to create, which we have created around here for a long time and we still believe we have it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Was supposed to play down on the dive, not come up and make a get.  We were scraping the back and the safety to play the two levels.  We were jumping outside.  At the end, most of the time we were good.  Sometimes we'd jump out.  We would want to go make the play.  See it, I want to go get it.  All of a sudden, you know, not enough consistency in what we did at times.  There were times we started crashing at him, changed it up, started crashing at him and going harder, taking it away.  A couple times our barkers took the play, went inside, it should have been going outside.  There was not enough consistency there in the safeties coming down.  We have played that look many, many times.  We have to do it better.  We have to tricker quicker, get down.   
Even the line.  Sometimes you don't think of the line.  It's what I call 40 back, inside (indiscernible).  Supposed to go to 50, another step.  There's a lot of times when a guy can get enough of you to touch you.  You know what I'm saying, you're one step away.  The inches and angles, we did not create.  That's what good coached football teams and well played players do.  And we didn't do that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: One was he should have sided and got out.  The rest of it, they were picking, you know what I mean.  Could have been picked up.   
Most of that happened more in the second half.  I take that back.  First two third downs, we had pressure.  Missed a field goal, made a field goal.  But the rest of it, he took some shots.  He stayed in there.   
At the end of the day, even though he missed throws, what I was happy about from his standpoint, even though he missed a couple deep balls later, but I thought a guy dived at him, wouldn't have mattered anyway in the game, but his decision making was still good for the most part.  He was still seeing the field.   
What that tells me, his mind did not leave.  You know what I'm saying.  He might have been pressing himself later in the game, which you normally would when you get down like that.  As long as your decision making is good, that's a very, very good sign.  He was still seeing what the right thing to do is, we have to finish and execute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: We've tried two or three things.  We have to get better, practice better.  Slid protection, got beaten out a couple times.  We have to keep honing it up and getting better, again, try to find our -- that's why you try to see us try to throw early downs and things like that, when it's not big blitz downs.  We got some third-and-longs which you had to hold the ball, then they're allowed to come like that.  We have to get better in third down situations, but have to learn to run a little bit better, too.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: He did.  He did.  That's part of it.  Been there, done that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Not as much.  I mean, I thought we wouldn't struggle quite as much.  At the same time there's some other things we need to do.  We missed some cuts early in the first game.  Missed some cuts on some big runs.  Even getting the ball out a couple times.   
What I'm saying is if those things happen, all of a sudden their confidence goes up.  You know what I'm saying.  Sometimes when they've done it right, we haven't done it well around them either.  I'm not saying we played great, but I'm saying it's a combination of a couple of those things.  We have to play better around them.  They have to play better and get confidence and believe what they're doing is right.  I believe we have good players there, I still think we got good guys.  We have to play better and coach better.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Everybody says that.  Dalvin is fine.  There's nothing wrong with Dalvin.  Normal bumps and bruises.  Probably healthier than he was a year ago when you get right down to it.   
The yards he got the other day, I thought he ran pretty dag gone good.  There were a couple, we missed on the kick-out block on their sideline, for some reason we turn up.  It's out.  We come on a sweep to the right one time early in the game, we get the kick out on the safety, the back, as we're going to make that cut, if he makes that block, it's an 80-yard touchdown.   
That's what I'm saying.  There's inches.  If we have seven different inches, I mean, we may still not win the game, but we're right there with it.  You got to fight for inches.  I know that sounds crazy.  There's a lot of things that can be really close.  But when you get 'em, it's the same inch.   
It's no different either way.  You just happened to make those plays.  That's what we're not doing.  We didn't do it in that game.  If we had the last three quarters, we would have done really well.  13 straight quarters, 13 straight drives and scored, Ole Miss game and that.  Defensively, the same way.  We got to find those inches.  We got to tackle better in space, better leverage, eye discipline.   
We even had a couple big mistakes, like I say, in man coverage.  You're covering a guy, all of a sudden you stop and look in the backfield.  Those things can't happen.  Once you're on man, you're on man.  You know what I mean.  We got to get those things ironed out.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Oh, he will.  Making promises, I think it comes from a super player.  What we need to do now is just go get ready to play.  I think it comes from a great heart.  That guy plays his guts out.  He played a pretty solid game in that game.   
What we need to do is just go back and just get ready and play.  If we play the football that we're accustomed to, practice that way, and create all the little things.  We got to find those inches in practice.  Like I said, this team is still evolving in its practice habits.  We did not practice poorly last week.  We did not practice poorly.  We got to practice better, but we did not practice poorly.  Obviously we didn't practice well enough for a team of that caliber who is good enough.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Felt good.  We didn't practice best I've ever practiced.  But felt that we would play better.   
It is.  But it's frustrating no matter how you practice or what you did.  You still went on the field and didn't execute at a level and things we thought we could have.   
 Q.  In the game it looks like on defense there's a lot of confusion.  Is there confusion?  
COACH FISHER: Well, we had one time where Sweat being injured, he came off the field.  He'd been one of our dimes, our pass-rusher.  In that game before, we had Sweat and Pugh being the guy in that position at regular.  Right before he was in the game with a young guy.  Not blaming it on him.  He came off, was running back on the field.  He hadn't been in that till Josh had his injury on Thursday.  You know what I'm saying.  When he heard 'regular', he came running off the field, then he realized, ran back on.   
That happens.  I say that happens.  It was a weird situation.  There was a couple times getting nickel and dime.  When people are matching their personnel, that's why they have to hold.  You know what I'm saying.  They get a call upstairs.  A lot of people, that's why the referee is doing a great job now.  One time they stopped them, didn't let them.  We matched it.  They ran off and ran another group on.  You have to get the call from upstairs.  You are always the second one to react to that.  You know what I'm saying.  The official saw that.   
Sometimes in your personnel group, they'll run them halfway on the field, bring them back.  It's not on purpose.  I've done that calling a play.  Blue, blue, blue for instance, for our personnel grouping.  No, I meant red.  That happens sometimes.  That causes your defense to do that.   
We've got to lock in and make sure we communicate well, make sure we get the right people in the game.  I think one snap they had us in a personnel grouping, they were in blue, we were in dime, we'd rather have been in nickel.  One situation in the game like that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Oh, lost, what, two games since we played them.  They're very good.  Physical up front.  Inside guys.  Big, strong inside guy.  We recruited a lot of their guys.  Dynamic.  Play-makers.  Long.  They're a good team.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Throws and runs it.  He can run it.  He can throw it.  He played at Miami Jackson.  I remember him in high school.  Really good player.  Good against us last year.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: The runningback?  He's a good player now.  Strong, hard to get on the ground at times.  You know what I'm saying.  Good balance.  Body control.  Strength.  I mean, he's a good player now.  He's a really good player.   
 Q.  You were saying you were mad at yourself.  What kind of conversations have you had?  
COACH FISHER: I'm mad at everybody.  You all got to be held accountable.  We have to make sure we dot our I's and cross our T's.   
When I say 'mad', we didn't have the success we wanted.  Let's look at why we didn't.  Was it a practice thing?  We do that every week if you win.  We go back every week, in this area we'll say we were deficient even if we won right here.  We thought we were going to be good, why.  We were efficient here more so than we thought could be, why.   
We do that win or loss.  It's no different in how we evaluate a game.  We actually do that.  Like I say, every team I had, there's a notebook that thick, our practice plans, notes, how we thought of people, how we go in.  We keep a running total of those things, making sure why did that happen, why did that happen, just reevaluating.   
But we do that when we win, too.  It's not just a thing we do when we lose.  I want to make sure I say that.  We do it win or lose the same way.  Just happened like that.  It's very disappointing.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Matthew Thomas is fine.  Went back in the fine.  Christmas should be fine.  Normal nicks and bruises.  They'll get treatment on stuff.  It's this and that and normal things like that.   
From what I can tell right now, everybody should be out there.  Maybe a couple guys you may hold a little bit today, go out there do a little bit.  You may rest them because they played a lot of snaps or something like that.  For the most part we should be ready to go.   
 Q.  (Question regarding offenses.)  
COACH FISHER: We got two spread teams that did very well.  We turned the ball over at Oregon.  The Oregon game, we were right in the game.  We were matching.  It was going to be a high-scoring game.  They were very dynamic, scored a lot of points.   
I think this team here is also a very, very dynamic offense.  They're on pace to do a lot of things.  I think that's a very good football team.   
But at the same time we got to make sure it shouldn't happen like that and we got to look at why we're doing it.  Got to tackle better, be more physical, do the things we need to do.  There's no doubt.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: They haven't done anything.  They've been very supportive, kind of been out of the way a little bit.  But for the most part no one really knows.   
 Q.  What do you think about the final product?  
COACH FISHER: Seemed good to me.  Good storyline.  Seeing our kids in a different light.  They're real kids, not just gladiators in a uniform.  They live a normal life like everybody else's kids.  They're still out there.  They still have moms and dads.  They got problems like everybody else they got to fight through.  They got to go out, do good in school.  I think it's very good to see that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: I mean, for instance, and I say this, if you're supposed to squeeze down, the ball is supposed to bounce, as I say long shoulder.  What that means here comes a blocker.  I put this shoulder in, I make it bounce, there's somebody here in leverage.  That guy who was supposed to make the ball bounce, if he doesn't do his job and he gets out, everybody else is out here, looking for angles waiting for the ball to come how it's supposed to come.  Then it gets cut inside, you run and dive.  You're out of position.  You're out of position because you were going to where your job is.  It's usually one guy inside.  Everybody gets displaced across the board.  Does that make any sense of how you're supposed to do it?   
Especially on those zone runs, when your quarterback is either handing it or squeezing it or running a zone option, where he is throwing it, you're pulling around the edge.  It's all leverage.   
When you get one of those inside guys out of there, it puts everybody else attacking at poor angles.  It creates missed tackles.  I say gap control and eye discipline.  I know that sounds simple, but it really is.  It's harder to do.  Your natural instinct is to try to go make plays.   
 Q.  Are there more missed tackles on this team than prior teams?  
COACH FISHER: I don't know off the top of my head.  I have that up there.  We judge lack of effort every week, things like that.  You judge everything.   
I can't remember the number of missed tackles off the top of my head right now.  But it was definitely higher than it was the last two games, for sure.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: It's not just trust.  It's just experience.  You got to be able to do it.  I mean, it happens at all levels.  It happens in pro football.  It happens in high school football.  It happens in how you play it.   
You say you want to switch teams, do that.  Okay, you switch it, but then you have to switch assignments for guys and how they got to play different things.  You know what I'm saying.  You mix it up.  You have to do that against good people.  We created bad angles.  A couple times we didn't trigger.  We spilled the ball, and a safety or somebody would be right there, have to, All right, I get my key that triggers me down.  I came two steps late.  Well, that two steps, you give a guy like Lamar Jackson two steps, that's, what, three yards.  All of a sudden an angle becomes bad.  When you play fast people, good people, you can't have the luxury of being back on your heels.   
If I'm looking at Gene, I'm supposed to be looking at you, I'm looking at Gene real quick, come back, that happens sometimes, it's the discipline of your eyes.  That's reality.  That's the way football is played.  You have to see it and, boom, you have to react.  You don't have time to think.  You have to react, be where you're supposed to be and make plays.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: I watch every film win, loss or draw.  How we played every play, why we played every play.  If I agreed with that scheme, if I didn't agree with that.  Looking from an offensive perspective, that wouldn't bother me, this would bother me more.   
But we had things that were right, a lot of things that were right.  We got to trigger better.  That's part of coaching too.  It's not putting it on the kids.  You got to coach them better to see things more, to execute.  It's on all of us.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Oh, yeah.  Go to work.  You go back to work.  Worrying about it ain't going to change it.  Going back to work, and knowing, trusting in yourself, trusting you know ball, how you do it.  Have bad games, people question you all the time.  It's easy when you're in charge, everybody is going to question you.  Everybody has answers.  You know what I'm saying.  Believe in yourself, go back to work.  As I say, eliminate the clutter.  You can't worry about it.   
Coach Bowden always said that.  He was famous for saying that.  You can't listen to that.  I mean, it's understandable.  Fans are emotional.  We're all emotional.  Hey, I want everything perfect.  I want everything perfect in everything.  That's not reality.  We have to coach and do what we do, know what we know, believe in ourselves.  I believe in him and our staff and what we're doing, and we'll go coach.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: You got to recruit.  You got Emmett and Dontavious.  They're getting in there playing a lot.  Josh is getting involved a lot on special teams.  You'll see him in some outside positions, too, how he's going to play.  You got to keep developing.   
One guy had an academic issue, one guy didn't get in that we thought would get in.  We're down two guys at a critical point.  At the same time, you got four very good players.  Those two young guys, you saw Emmett and Jackson, they're coming on.  Only been here three games.  I think they're doing nice things in the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: That's one we'll evaluate and see if anything needs to be done or not be done.  How he responds the next day or so.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: We played them last year with it.  I mean, the only thing Louisville did, they did it a couple times out of different personnel groupings.  Same group we played extremely well last year, the same team.  They threw the ball a little better.  They just did it better, were faster, were real good at it.  South Florida does a lot of the same things.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: I'm not concerned about that right now.  What I'm concerned about is playing football.  Listen, I've won two national titles as a coach, one as an assistant, one as a head coach.  Neither year you're supposed to win it.   
You got to control your team and play the best you can play.  I don't mean that that we don't want it.  Our goal is to win the national title.  There is no doubt, that's the ultimate goal.  But you can't dwell on those goals.   
It has to be to play good football.  If you play good football, those things come.  That's what we didn't come Saturday.  We have to go play good football.  The process of how we practice, how we watch film, how we coach, how we do everything.  Stay true to the process and just play good football.  That's all you can do.   
The rest of that stuff is out of your control.  That's all you can control.  It is.  People say you don't know.  We really don't.  The good programs I've ever been in, we never talked about national championships.  That was not our drive, that was not why we went out on the field.  We were there to coach good football, be with the kids, let them play good football.  All of a sudden you achieved a lot by how you played.  That's what you have to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Yeah, I think it's how this team defines itself, how it wants to respond, how it wants to play, the fight it has, how much you come back from it.  You have to do that.   
You got to let it drive you.  Whatever that means for this game, play better football, practice better, play better, be a better person from it and grow from it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: No, but Wilson has been banged up.  Had an ankle.  Also Dickerson played better than a while than Wilson has sometimes in games.  He wasn't all the way healthy.  Hopefully he'll be healthy this week.  Hopefully we can get Minshew back.  We need Minshew back, Kareem.  Dickerson, Bell, get four guys in there, let them play a couple series, pull one out, let them grasp what's going on in the game, slow everything down.   
Hopefully we can keep rotation and depth.  That's what our ultimate goal was anyway, to get those guys to be able to play at different times.  I think Brock is really starting to play good.  Ricky is doing okay.  But it's not that.  You want to keep as many of those guys you can play, keep them in there, those situations, do that.  Hopefully there's times we can rotate more guys as you can go.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: We didn't have enough depth.  Teams I've ever been on and we had depth, we did it a lot.  We did it a lot, oh, yeah.  We haven't had the depth.  Haven't had the depth or have had injuries or guys that just weren't quite ready to play.  That's what we have to do.  We did that a lot.  That was a big thing.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: Getting healthier.  Moving around.  Be a factor.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: He did some nice things.  He's developing.  Everybody thinks about the catches.  He made two nice catches.  He's getting much better.  I'm very pleased with his progress.  I told you, we're going to play him, get him in there, get him rolling in the things he did.  Try to get Keith going a little bit.  Try to get him in the game some.  Get some of those bigger guys in what we're doing.   
They also got to play in the field, block, do all those things, too.  That's a big part of it.  Because in football, as you see, your safeties and all that support, being able to block and get on those guys, that's critical.  We missed some blocks there, too.  At the same time I'm very happy with Auden's development and his attitude.  He's going to be a very good football player.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: About 270-pound guy standing right in front of him.  You're can say you're 220 pounds, you line up in there, it's (indiscernible).  You ain't never been in there, it's a whole different world now.  It's a lot easier to go inside-out than outside-in in what you do.  All of a sudden he's grabbing one of those guys.  That's a key block on one of your quarterbacks.  He's not ready for that now.  He's a physical, big guy.  But he ain't ready for one of those big guys getting ahold of him.  He ain't ever done it.  Been a wideout his whole life.  You see field guys that take a long time.  Who was the great player, I can't think, San Diego?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
COACH FISHER: He didn't play a lot of football.  There were a couple other guys.  Graham, they put him in there for a year or two, a big tight end.  Came off the basketball court, never played a lot of football, never been inside.  In college you never knew who he was.  In the pro ball eventually they do that.  They become better pros than they do college guys because it takes time to go down in there and really learn how to play.  Auden is definitely a receiver.  Doing a good job.  Very pleased with him.   
Thank you.
