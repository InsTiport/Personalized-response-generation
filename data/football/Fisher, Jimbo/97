JIMBO FISHER: I think you saw a tale of two halves in my opinion.  I think you saw what a team can do in the first half when it's not totally focused or it presses itself, and obviously focus was the issue.  I think it just pressed, wants to go out and show how it plays well so bad.  In the second half when the team relaxes, it played up to its capability, and still have it.  We had so many motion penalties, giving up 3rd and longs, not winning the field position battles, putting ourselves behind the 8-ball.  We did that against a very good football team.  That front seven on defense is really good.  Skill guys on offense, quarterback, we have to get better.  I mean, I'm excited how we competed in the game.  I'm excited we had the poise to come back, but I'm not happy -- we've got to learn to put those things away.  But we're getting there.
