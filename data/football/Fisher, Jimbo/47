JIMBO FISHER: Hello everyone.  We start year number eight.  Time has flown.  Excited to be here.  Spring is always an exciting time for me because I get to see a lot of guys, the jumps they make, the upperclassmen take new roles.  You're not in a press situation as far as a game coming up, so you get to see the guys really get -- they feel pressure but not as much as crazy pressure and they get to fall into their roles.   
So spring is a fun time to experiment, do things, fun to work, have a vision for your team and be able to adjust as they go, like if this team keeps developing it's identity and personality.  And, you know, we always say fourth quarter drills, but for the most part it went well and our goal for the spring if we keep finding it, it's the quest for the inches, at the end of the day that's what it's about, finding the inches.  You look at our seasons, the last seven, whether we won 'em or lost welcome you either found it or you missed those inches.  We were 78-17 in the last seven years.  And we're one of only two teams to be in the top-25 all seven years, one of the top two-winningest teams in the country.  Got a 5 year BCS streak, whatever those games are now, whatever you call 'em, keep changing on it.   
So we've had a lot of success, but at the same time you've got to continue on the success and you constantly have to remember what you do well, continue to tweak the other avenues and things you don't and adjust each of those things to the guys on your football team.  But each ear it's been a different thing that we've tweaked and turned and featured in different ways.  It's going to be a fun spring.  I'm looking forward to it, and, again, from what we've done in mat drills, fourth quarter drills, whatever you want to call 'em, pleased the second half, the guys have really gotten it and the young seven guys that have came in, fit in really well and our upperclassmen accepted them and showed them and some of those guys at the end were right there running and we didn't make a mistake on any of those guys.  That's for sure.  I feel very confident in the guys we've got.  The upperclassmen showed 'em how to work and pleased in that regard.  So we've got a lot of work to do, in spring as all guys do, 17 starters coming back, that don't mean you don't have a lot of work to do.  I am anxious to see the young guys and I'm anxious to see the old guys, how much they have improved, how many things they have tweaked and turned and some of them have fallen to different leadership roles and being the experienced guy in the huddle now or on the field or wherever it ay be.  It will be fun to go.  Get some of the guys that were injured last year.  We had quite a few guys getting them back and there are some guys that are banged up that will miss spring I'll talk about in a minute.  We'll be out for spring and other guys will have an opportunity to step up.  That's all part of football.  You get an opportunity and you take advantage of it.  We've been proud of things we have been able to accomplish and do here and at the same time you're either -- you're want growing you're going backwards in my opinion, doesn't work that away.  You've got to keep moving forward, so we'll tweak and turn and look at things we need to increase on and try to keep it going with the things we've done well, which have been quite a few things.  And we have a heck of a schedule coming up, so we'll get ready to go.  Questions?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: We've seen it from day one, first day fourth quarter drills start to weight lifting starts.  You see, guys know their roles.  They had a couple of weeks off they came in there and they expect it because they're on a sped-up schedule.  Today kids know that.  They're doing it in high school and all the way up and guys know the opportunities and what they see and guys that don't get passed by.  You start to see it from day one, my opinion.   
 Q.  How will this spring be different?  
JIMBO FISHER: It won't.  Everybody says House is going to be different.  Here is what I like to say, people say, Coach, you say the same thing all the time.  When the reason for success changes I'll quit saying things, because at the end of the day when the reasons for success change in football, things will change.  What I mean by that is:  You've got to be able to play the run, run the football, not have turn overs, create turnovers, got to be able to invent big plays and stop big plays and in the last seven years we're one of the top two or three teams in the country creating big plays and we are averaging over 36.5 points a game.  You have got to be able to score and do those things.  You have to have good red zone offense which we were number one in the country and have been for the last seven years.  On defense we ended up getting really good on red zone at the end.  We are a very solid third down team and we have to get off-the-field on the other end of it.   
So the things that make you have success, as far as those will still be the things that are emphasized, done over and over and over because they're the reasons that you have success.  But as far as different, practice schedule will be different, maybe we will tweak and turn a scheme on defense, schemes on offense, how we block things, new routes, new combinations, things that evolve coveragewise or blitzwise or we have to go against thing that we look at our opponents, things they're doing differently by what they're doing.  But drills and things won't -- but what they feature at times the blitzes that Miami had or Alabama or Florida had or Louisville or Clemson have or whoever that opponent may be, North Carolina State.  They all bring different things we have broken those down and we will feature those things and get guys introduced to those kind of things, but the base will be similar.   
 Q.  Did you tailor the practices at all based on reaching those goals?  
JIMBO FISHER: No doubt.  As you go, where you're deficient at and not deficient at, but at the same time when you work on the things you do poorly you get away from the things you do well and all of the sudden you don't do those well anymore.  You've got to continue to do the things you do well and gradually get better at the things you don't do well.  We will go fix that.  I can go and work on that all day and if I don't practice what we do well, well guess where that's going to go.  It's like cutting one side of the yard.  That side of the yard looks pretty.  Go work on that side of the yard.  Well, if you ignore that side of the yard what's it going to look like?  The same thing as the other side looks like.  So there is a fine line.  But things we need to tweak and turn we're definitely going to do that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: It's all about competing, competing, mental toughness and that's why I say, that's where the inches are found.  We talk about toughness, mental and physical effort and discipline and pride.  Those aren't just words.  That's how you get things done.  Like I say, the 54-yard field goal in a play in the Clemson game, two or three inches here and there.  Find the inches.  How you do a drill?  How do you make a cut?  How often can you sink my foot and round that thing without going outside the cone that far.  Maybe if I go inside that far now I've cut that guy off. Football is such a game of inches.  Everybody says it's clichÃ©.  It's not.  Go watch the film.  We were having success and undefeated, all teams are, when you watch there is a fine line between winning and losing is always those inches, and that's what we've tried to emphasize.  We changed how we did fourth quarter this year.  We always told them how they did.  We rate 'em every day.   
You come out in your guard jersey you are giving championship effort.  You come out in white you're averaging that may mean you took two plays off, boom, you're average and if you're not giving any kind of effort at all in things that we think is ridiculous you wear orange.  So that way you have to work out in that jersey that day.  Trying to point out what -- guys say, Coach, you didn't tell me.  I'm telling you every day.  This is this.  What you going to do?  How you going to do it?  It's not effort.  It's sometimes the hand in front of the line, hand behind the line, finishing every tweak and turn.  Finishing every play.  There's things we have always done and things we have never done.  We have done this in the past.  I think it's very good, especially with kids today, the more you show them -- kids at any age not at any time 25 years ago, I think that's what we do a better job of now we tell them it's all Kumbaya and eat s'mores by the campfire.  Back in the day they showed you when you were wrong, told you when you were wrong, that's what we're trying to do, educate the kids on the effort, the discipline, the toughness, all the things we want to do and how we want it done and define it.  Definitively.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Well, that's -- I mean, you look at it, that's not always a good color around here, is it?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Really good because they got called out by their peers.  It wasn't like, hey man, he's doing me -- no, what jersey you in?  I'm just doing that on purpose to mess with you.  Guys start watching guys and we have it on film, the videos, we watched the video and we did say, all right, show me good -- this is what effort is, this is not what -- this is what discipline is, this is what the proper technique is, this is what -- of the drills in which you do.   
It wasn't in football positions or anything like that.  It's was all effort, but this is what we're teaching you to do.  Whatever it is, do it.  If you do that you will create a habit of going out on the football field.   
 Q.  So the color jersey thing (No microphone).  
JIMBO FISHER: No.  No, they don't get no vote.  They don't know what they got.  It's coaches.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I've done it in the past.  I've done it in the past and I've done it with different teams I've been on and different schools I've been at and it was very helpful because it defined it.  And the kids -- you know the worst thing?  They'll argue with you, Coach is doing me wrong.  Wait a minute.  That guy is counting on me.  I'm in orange and he's in garnet.  You know how many friends you get in an orange jersey?  Or whatever that color may be?  You don't get many.  You know what?  Guys are here for business.  They can be friends, but on the field it's who you can count on, and I want to show the guys on the field who you can count on, every play.  That's something that's been done at every school I was at, brought it back all the -- I thought it was helpful in education.  Not because I think we will always do it.  I think because when you continue to show kids consistently that takes the guess work out of it.  What do I gotta do?  This is it.  At the end, we probably had, I'm going to say we had no oranges and I'm going to estimate probably 85 to 90% garnet.  And it went up each time.  It goes and we sometimes take a step back and that was the things it was worse on, because the worst thing for a coach, count on somebody, count on somebody, count on somebody and all of a sudden in his biggest moment he picked that day to take off, you cross the line you're going all the way back, end of story.   
That's the way it is in life.  How many people you count on?  You know every time you come and see me I am going to be there.  Do what you want to do.  That's what you do when you don't play hard or you don't have the ride -- or you don't lineup right or learn your assignment and you don't go to class.  Class and everything is involved in that.  What you do on the field off-the-field, everything you do is a constant educational process.  Don't blame anybody else.  I gotta tell them that.  You're not born a winner or a loser, you're born a chooser.  Choose what you're going to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: That mean means we got a long way to go.   
 Q.  Is there any concern that as you start spring -- you were unhappy --  
JIMBO FISHER: We're farther along now than we were then by far.   
 Q.  Why do you think that is?  
JIMBO FISHER: We educate 'em better.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Uh-huh, but I don't always cloud my vision and become tunnel vision where I can only see them because I want to see -- you've got to go out there and do it.  You know what I'm sayin'?  You have guys that you talk to, you want to put them into position to do it.  But I don't see things through a straw.  Keep my wide eyes and see other guys develop.  Don't take that off. You know what I mean?  And see who can process every day because sometimes the guys out there -- listen that doesn't mean you're a good player.  That means you have a chance, without that you have no chance.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Well, I mean it's good.  If he continues to grow.  That's why we said we said well does he take the next step?  Does he take the next three steps?  Whatever it may be.  How far does he keep progressing and that's in every position.  No matter how many starters you got back.  In fact, sometimes the worst springs I have ever been a part of in the past are when you had a lot of guys because they all think they can take it off; and spring, yes, it is.  We're not going to do that.  We're going to make sure we get better in every aspect.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Because that's in relation to winning.  That's the reason you have success.  Sometimes the coach has got to go back to day one and prove it.  Even in you're a guy that started three years you got to start day one.  Score of every game is 0-0.  They don't give you any points.  You got to do that every time and make 'em understand that and if they can understand that they're going to be more successful in life.  I truly believe that, and going back to individuals is good.  But if you have some individual great efforts that don't win you a championship.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Wide open, going to be going.  I will see real quick before we get into seeing who is out for spring.  I need my glasses or I ain't going to tell you nothing.  You did that, didn't you?  All right.  Dawsey, he had that spur taken off his toe.  Dickerson with ACL.  Eberle was a hip surgery.  Kerr with a shoulder.  Lewis with a hip and McFadden with shoulder will be out.   
As of right now, depending on how they -- probably not out for the whole spring, but Sh'Mar Kilby-Lane has a real bad turf toe.  Lane, he had surgery on his foot.  He may be back second half of spring.  I don't know.  Robbins pulled a hamstring and he's been doing extremely well and second half of last year we were very pleased with him.  Pulled a ham, so probably this week and next week -- he will probably be out the rest of this week.  But next week we expect him to be back the last twelve days of spring.  Torres with his leg surgery and that and Wilson Bell will be graduating.  Then transfer.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Uh-huh.  Right now who has had an outstanding camp, and I mean tremendous and, it's what I thought would happen is Ethan Frith, he is having a great time there.  Played really well as far as this off-season, in what he's doing.  He'll get a first shot there.  Ball, Jauan and then you got Brock, and you can move Ricky over there if you have to, you know what I'm saying, but Frith right now will start off there.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: As of right now, as of right now.  Wait and see.  But he played very well there, got comfortable, no reason to make him learn something all the way new, either.  In college football, everybody makes a big deal of the left tackle.  It's not the same as it is in pro football.   
Ends flip-flop, guys don't play right and left very often.  Like with Martin, you saw him on both sides.  You know what I'm sayin'?  They don't do it like they do in pro football.  Ball is not always in the middle of the field like it is in pro football.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Oh, yeah, Ermon, he's been wide open, he's been going.  Ermon is a full go.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Been good in offense, so we'll find out.  Again he's got to go out there and prove it again, too.  What he's done in the past, that's great.  Gotta go do that again, which I expect him to do that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Not really.  I don't think he is.  I really don't.  I mean, he may have, on his own, realized how quick things can go away.  You know what I'm sayin'?  You have to ask him that, but I haven't seen any changes.  He's been the same Ermon.  More mature.  Not that he was immature, but you see him growin' in his role as things are going on.   
 Q.  You said if you're not growing you're going backwards.  How have you grown as a coach from last year?  
JIMBO FISHER: About 5 or 8 pounds, outward, a little bit on the side, trying to get that back off right now.  I don't know.  We'll find out.  We'll find out.  Hopefully have better organization, hope you see your team better, hope you tweak things better, hope you handle your people better.  Hope you do a lot of things.  I mean, you're always -- like a player, you're always trying to look at aspects you do as a coach.  Whether it's offense, defense, special teams, a lot of things about everything.  How you handle your staff, how you do things behind the scenes, how you deal with recruiting, how you deal with personal situations, with your team, how you manage discipline, how you manage school, I mean, all those things.  Coaching -- not many people in the world wear more hats than we do when you get right down to it.  So there are things that you may not be seeing outwardly, but hopefully your organization is -- good thing about it is, are your players doing well, are you winning games, are you graduating your players are they going to school, and are you producing guys for the NFL, and doing the things you need to do.  And seems like we're doing all of those things in all aspects of our program.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: We haven't.  I mean, because they're all working hard, they're all, working their tails off, but they have to go out on the field and do it, and excited to watch J.J. and Bailey and Rizzo and see what those guys do in the spring.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: No.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Good, I mean, getting healthy.  He's right on -- he'll practice and go all the way, but I think he will have sore days, but he's right on that fringe to getting released and how he's healing up, but he's been doing good and in the off-season we would work him three or four days and give him a day to let him gradually heal, so great to get him back out there.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: He had a high ankle sprain that got him really bad, but that's finally healing up pretty good.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I said I was very pleased.  We didn't miss on any of those guys.  Happy with their athletic abilities, all are doing really well in school, I mean really well, great students, doing what they're supposed to be, dependable, reliable people and coming out there and working their tails off and outstanding young men, very excited with all those guys.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: All of them.  I'm serious, they all have.  They look like they've been there a couple of years, all fit in, running and drills, they had to learn early but they've done a great job adapting and fitting right in.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: But you got to remember how many guys you play list.  When you look at the list right here and when you really go look at it, at quarterback, Malique, of course Tarvarus is out.  You got Da'Vante Phillips and you got Kyle Meyers and you got Becker and you got Samuels.  I mean, that's another guy.  Becker, he long jumped the other day 25 feet in a meet, so he's going to be a heck of a guy right there in that group?   
Then in the secondary with Nate, Trey, Derwin, Ermon being out a little bit, A.J., Brewton and then Fagan.  I mean it's gonna be -- great numbers you got there.  Going to lose a bunch after this year, probably, but interesting battle, fun to watch.   
Also you're playing five, six, seven DBs at times now.  You've got to have -- I like a lot of different body types, abilities, you know what I mean, for quickness, length, size, outright speed, you can match-up pretty well so your secondary guys have to be pretty diverse, so I'm anxious with the depth we have.  It should be a very good group.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: For him, one, Nate loves ball and it's a shame he got hurt.  But you don't -- in today's time you don't get many fifth year seniors.  Those days are far and few between.  You go back and think about it, only 13 seniors on this team.  Only 13 scholarship seniors on this team, break it down, so getting seniors in general, let alone fifth year seniors.  That doesn't happen very often.  It's big, we're glad to have him because Nate has been a super player for us, and more important a super guy.  Glad to have him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Always going to be that way.  It's the way of the world.  When you are rolling your team over and rolling your three and out, all the things that go on.  That's just the nature of the world today.   
Back in the old days people say, I say this all the time.  Right now by the time most of them when their experience meets the talent, when they can really be that great, great, great player every play, instead of having those couple of knuckle head plays, anymore they leave.  You know what I'm sayin'?  That's just the way it is.  You gotta -- that's why I say off-the-field hires, off-the-field preparation, off-the-field development, and all the things -- and being able to have a staff of people that can do things, not doing anything illegal but doing the things you've got to do to develop kids in today's times.  The quicker you can develop them, you've gotta speed that process up, because they sped your process up.  A lot of those guys are great talent, they're still not ready to play great football, and I think that's where we get confused because the teams that have that group of people off the field.  I think it makes that much more cohesive for them to be able to fight in and play early and play well early.  That's the key, not just playing early but how well do you play?  Do you play well enough to win games or well enough to win championships, and that's the deal.  Becomes very tough.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Well, I mean, when you look at him right here, Sweat -- people don't realize Sweat can -- Sweat is powerful.  Sweat plays the run extremely well.  You got Burns in that group, Keith, Wilkerson, is a big end, Robinson is a big end and Kaindoh can go back and forth in that whole group.  So I mean Kaindoh, he's 240 pounds.  He's strong, going to be a big, big guy, so you got the ability to mix all those guys around.   
 Q.  You were high on Keith Bryant going into off-season.  
JIMBO FISHER: He's been hurt and off, and he's still been banged up.  He hasn't been in too much of the off-season workout, got a foot, unfortunately he's been banged up.  So we'll have to wait and see what happens.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Probably health.  As much as anything.  You got to remember at the beginning of the year he was banging and bruising.  He had that surgery.  That's in week three and you keep playing.  That's what you do.  People say -- no, you're always going to be banged and bruised in football, so you start combining the moves with the health and feeling good and getting the burst and playing all the assignments and growing.  And Josh is a sophomore.  Second half of his sophomore year, he started processing it out and banging it out.  Very pleased with him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I am.  I think it's good.  I mean, I love -- I didn't mind it where it was, but at the same time, all those kids come to your spring game and have a recruiting deal, you're not on this campus.  I mean, there is a negative to that, too.  But it's also great in that spring game when they get to your campus and they get to see everything.  There is a big advantage to that, especially when kids come from far off.  That's the only chance they get to come.  You miss out on that.  You miss out on recruiting process.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: All of 'em do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: They should have.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Yeah, because, again, it was education.  It's funny when you really see it on film and you see that -- it may be one -- guys, don't account like it was every play.  It may have been three or four plays but you can't -- three or four is as detrimental as every one.  Because you don't know what play changed the game.  And that's the thing with young players, finally when their mental maturity matches their physical skills, then you are a great player, and it's not their fault when they don't do it as a young group, because they're not mature enough.   
They don't always understand that, guys!  They're kids.  They're 18, 19, 20 year-old-kids, and people don't understand, and it's part of the growing process in everything you do.  Every play, every second of everything you do, and once you educated them and show 'em, then they see it, because you know why?  He's a great kid, he is a very intelligent guy and he is a very caring guy, and be a heck of a football player.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I question myself every day.  I question my methods -- because in today's times why do you think you bring in so many different speakers in a preseason camp?  Why do you bring in different people to send a message.  Just like now, when I talk to y'all, y'all interpret it all differently, because y'all are writing the same story.  Y'all take one part of it you heard and write it in your own way.  You go one way, you go one way, you go one way, you go one way, whatever serves what you need.  Players are the same way.  They have selective hearing.  They hear what they want to hear.  They got 38 people in their ear at home, and they got -- all kinds of -- and they're on Twitter and they're on Facebook and everybody is telling them this!   
You guys don't think that all matters?  You're crazy!  All these kids get this information ten times it's not always good.  Being able to hear one voice and understand it, so you say things the same way, three different ways, cuz maybe it resonates in different ways, you have somebody else there.  How many times you told your kid to do something, and they don't do it, and a neighbor comes over and says do it and they do it?  Why is that?  What's the difference?   
There isn't a difference.  So I'm saying, okay, obviously that didn't get through to them, so how do I get through to them?  Not mad at 'em, I'm not -- how do I get through to you?  You know what I'm saying?  Like some of y'all, still don't get the message, still hard-headed, you're as hard-headed as the doggone players, but I say that jokingly, but it is, think about it.  When we leave here everybody will right a different article.  You heard something different.  When you talk to a group of people -- you ever hear a speaker talk?  Usually there are a couple of points that resonate, but everybody takes something different from it.  You know what I'm saying?  That's why you've got to say it over and over and over, and I always say it from my dad.  He never thought I listened to him at all either, and now everything I do, what would he do?  He would have done that in that situation.  It echos back, and the more you pound it in, pound it in, pound it in, and that's why today's times, again I'm preaching again, but when you are playing so many young players and you're holding your team over in so many ways, that's why coaches have sleepless nights, because are they really getting it?  You know what I'm sayin'?   
At our level, when you are playing at the level for us one game is the difference of a season or not a season, you know what I'm sayin'?  So you're constantly trying to question everything you say to them and that's why your constantly on these kids.  Have other people say it to them.  Say it in a different way, bring in a different speaker to get the message across.  You bring in Hall of Famers.  You bring in Dr. Elko and Trevor, and that's why those guys and off-the-field field people are so important to today's kids.  Used to be they could come sit in your office 24 hours a day.  Can't do that.  That's a violation, and you ain't around them.   
So there are so many things -- and we've got to be accountable for them, because they're playing at a younger age because back in the day they didn't get to play until there was an urgency when they were red shirt juniors.  When you get to that time, what do you say?  My clock is ticking.  I better do what?  I better pay attention.  Like I've got an F in this class, mid-term, what does that second half semester need to be?  Crank it up and get a B or C.  You gotta do it.  The urgency, that is the thing -- today's youth doesn't have urgency.  They have is about where they want to go and what they want to do, but they don't always have it in work ethic.  And I think it's a big down fall, and that's one of the huge challenges for coaches today is defining that message and getting it resonated across.  That's where your team and your upperclassmen have to come into play.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I hope so and that's why I -- it's off-season, those are things that we -- the more I can educate them and visually show, because most athletes are visual learners.  If you ever go back and research in their history and learning capabilities, because athletics is all what?  Done with your eyes.  Can't see it, can't make the play.  I don't care how good a player you are, if you can't see it you can't make the play.  So my thought is I have to visually show them who has effort.  This is what I want.  This is not what I want.  That's a tweak or a turn, going back to old school.  We did that 20 years ago.  Sometimes those things work.  Trying to find that as much as we can, and I hope we will see it today.  If we don't I'm going to have a fit.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Turn the tape on.  How come all those fast guys couldn't catch him?  How did he run away from all those guys?  Combine, guys, we make too much of the combine.  All the combine does is reassure -- they need to watch the tape.  That's the main thing and they're going to look at it and for the glaring thing that jumps out, okay, there's something there, but all it does -- usually you don't go up in the combine by great wheels, but you usually drop it.  He has numbers, 4 and 5 are really bad.  I know y'all in rivals and all this recruiting stuff y'all believe those 4.3s and 4.2s and 4.4s.  I'll give you numbers.  The average DB time is 4.49.  You know what it is in backs?  4.46.  Tight ends, 4.78.  Linebackers, 4.72.  Inside backers is 4.8, around 4.6 something.  I'm talking about real electronic numbers.  In recruiting it's amazing, kids the fastest he ever is when he's 16.  Fastest they every are.  Just read the recruiting report.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I don't know.  I just saw him in the weight room.  I was giving him a hard time.  He was giving me a hard time.  But just the smile and knowing, again, what I was going to get every day.  Guys, there is nothing more satisfying as a coach to know when that guy walks in the room or on the practice field or in the meeting room what you're going to get every day, and you can count on it.  That goes back to accountability as much as anything.  Examples of what he did.  The leadership, the yards, the plays, but you knew what you were going to get every day.  If you didn't all you had to do is walk by and whisper something, just set him off.  He would look at you and -- like I told you that day when he said, "Coach, it's like I'm a freshman again."  That's what I mean as much as anything.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: They've all done well.  We'll find out.  They've all done well in the off-season, but we will see when they get out there with 11 on 11 and how they play.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Got some excellent leadership guys in now.  I mean, I see Sweat and them doing that, I see Sweat doing that at times.  I see Derwin.  Trey Marshall, Nate, those guys are really good, they set a good stage.   
Let me go back through here.  Nnadi has been a good leader, back to it.  Derrick is a quiet guy.  Matthew has done some good things.  Logan Tyler does a good job leading.  You think of a kicker, but he does.  Deondre has done an excellent job.  You talk about Mr. Steady Eddy.  You know everything you get done the right way, done at full speed, puts his heart and soul into everything he does.   
Ryan Izzo does it as good as anybody.  Deondre, the same way.  Ryan Green has had a good camp.  I'm anxious to watch Ryan.  Ricky Leonard is stepping up in the offensive line.  He was trying to feel his way as a player.  Now you see him leading by example, opening his mouth.  Eberle did a good job of that, but being out it's tougher to do it that way.  Dickerson will be that guy.  He does those things.  Played at the receiver position, three older guys -- two older guys that played a lot.  Done a good job.  Keith has had an outstanding camp.  We'll see.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: It was a bad point because the bench was going to be a problem.  You know what I'm saying?  In the off season, he will be fine.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: I don't know off the top of my head.  I mean, I say off the top of my head, I don't.  I want to say -- I think I'm right, but if I say it will be wrong.  You see so many of them with that stuff, you know what I mean?  Getting things cleaned up, fixed up.  What else we got?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: You'll see him out there today.  He's out of the sling now.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: No, we had breakout guys in that group, as many guys as we -- it was just a weird deal with Delvin.  He could create so many big plays and he could do that, you know what I'm sayin'?  So from that standpoint he did it.  But you would always love to have a great guy.  I mean one guy to jump out, but you also know to have a running back you are going to have to have a stable guy.  You are always going to have to have that.  I mean, so that's just something we will constantly be continuing to grow in.  That's a position that was always done that way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: He will be in spring -- he will be in noncontact early but going full speed and he's had a really good camp, running really good, very pleased with his off-season and noncontact early, and we'll see in spring what he does, but very pleased with his progress.  He can run though.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: He got great hands.  People don't realize he's 212 pounds too now, and he's a big guy.  He can run, catch, very smooth.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Baveon, Boselli and Martinez, all of 'em.  Baveon and Boselli are getting over ankle injuries, that were non-football related, one on a trampoline and one goofing around with one of his players horse wrestling and turned an ankle.  They have been bothered for the last three, four weeks, but they will be out there for practice.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JIMBO FISHER: Yeah, jump, do flips.  He had fun.  Now it becomes a deal.  Anybody else?  Anything?  Okay.
