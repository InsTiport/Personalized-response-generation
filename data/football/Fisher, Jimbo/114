 GEORGIA TECH   35
  FLORIDA STATE - 37 
   
 Q.   You just won a third‑straight ACC title and it was tough.   
JIMBO FISHER:   It was a great game.   We knew going in Georgia Tech was going to be tough with that option.   Our defense did a great job in the second half getting enough stops.   Offensively, we maximized and got points.   Wish we could have got touchdowns but we scored every time we had it.  
   
 Q.   Talk about adjustments you made going into the second half defensively?   
JIMBO FISHER:   We did.   We made a few little tweaks and turns.   We slowed them, we never really stopped them, but we slowed them down enough and Charles Kelly and those guys did a great job.  
   
 Q.   Offensively it was best your first half you had all season.   
JIMBO FISHER:   No doubt.   We were very efficient.   We knew going in that we had to be and we wanted to be balanced running and throwing.   Jameis was very sharp.   Dalvin, we were running the football, and Nick and Rashad making their normal plays and it was a complete team game.   
   
 Q.   You asked you about Dalvin making a role for himself yesterday.   
JIMBO FISHER:   He really was and keeping us balanced and it really makes us a different football team.  
   
 Q.   I can list off the numbers, 13‑0 this year, 29 in a row, third ACC title.   Is there anything that stands out.   
JIMBO FISHER:   The resiliency and their ability to overcome in so many different ways, and you can't put a price tag on what those kids have.  
   
 Q.   Talk to me now about what you look forward to tomorrow when names are announced.   
JIMBO FISHER:   Well, I think when you find out where we're going, who we'll be playing, and just take the next step forward.
