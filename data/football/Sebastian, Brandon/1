Wake Forrest - 27 - Boston College - 24
Q. (Question)
BRANDON SEBASTIAN: Yeah. That's one thing. We have to get off the field on third down. The receivers, their big receivers, 6'3" and above, one of the receivers seniors was 6'5" and a half and 220, and 14 was 6'3", 225, big body receivers.
And Jason Maitre started for us. They're going to obviously try to take shots to use their advantage of the height, use their body and we have to compete at the ball and have to put the pass behind us and go up and play Louisville.
Q. Can you talk some about the preparation that went into Wake Forest, the way they hold the ball behind the line of scrimmage with the hand offs?
BRANDON SEBASTIAN: We were trying to put more pressure, have backup blitz, and we were playing more man into the boundary. And so we had one guy missing in coverage, and so we were just trying to put pressure on him so you could get the ball quicker on the RPOs or just get the ball out and try to get to the quarterback, new player.
