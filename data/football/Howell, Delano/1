 Q.   Does it get you excited to go up against an offense like OSU?   
DELANO HOWELL:   Definitely.   It is a defensive dream to have an opportunity to show what we have against an offense like that.   
   
 Q.   Weeden, talk about him.   
DELANO HOWELL:   He leads this team to victories.   He scores a lot of points.   He is the leader of the team.   He has an accurate arm.   He trusts his receivers.  
   
 Q.   Can you get anything out of going up against Andrew Luck?   Can you get practice anything against him?   
DELANO HOWELL:   It is always a challenge in practice.   We only have so many periods to do that, too.   So it is always fun as well.   Andrew, as far as looking‑‑

DELANO HOWELL:   I would say so.   We'll find out.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything‑‑ comparing Oklahoma State compared to Oregon, anything you learned?   
DELANO HOWELL:   It is all about communication.   You have to make sure everybody is on the same page.   You need to execute the defense.   
   
 Q.   What about Justin Blackmon?   What have you studied about him to prepare for him?   
DELANO HOWELL:   He has great hand‑eye coordination.   So he goes up for the ball.   You just got to run your feet.   
   
 Q.   Tell us how practice has been going.   What's the situation?   
DELANO HOWELL:   It is good.   We have been working hard for the past month trying for get the game plan down.   
   
 Q.   When you took at the OSU team on film, what jumps off the screen at you?  
DELANO HOWELL:   They are explosive, fast tempo.   They like to get a fast game.   
It will definitely be challenge, but looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   Looking at the offense, two‑prong attack, solid on both ends.   Do you have to stop the run first?   
DELANO HOWELL:   We have to stop the run and make them one dimensional.   It will be a good challenge on the defense backs and the linebackers.  
   
 Q.   What does the running game look like to you?   They have Randle and Jeremy Smith?  
DELANO HOWELL:   They make good decisions and run hard.   We have to make sure we are limited to the yards.  
   
 Q.   They have Blackmon.   What do you know about him?   
DELANO HOWELL:   He is very explosive.   Obviously he is a competitor.   He doesn't go down easily.   
So we will have to make sure that we use the fundamental skills and keep up the intensity.   
   
 Q.   How do you prepare for their tempo?   Have you faced anything close to that that will help you prepare for the situation?   
DELANO HOWELL:   We have definitely faced like Oregon.   It is communication.   We need to make sure we are on the same page.
