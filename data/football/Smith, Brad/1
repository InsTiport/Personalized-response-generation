<p>	Q.  For the players, is it often a fine line between dedication and exploitation.  Do you guys talk about honoring O'Neal's memory without exploiting it?  Is that something you are concerned about and thought about? </p>



<p>	Q.  From the team's standpoint, I know you said they started working out the other day.  I am sure every person is handling it different.  How hard is it, and when is the right point to say, okay, we have a season starting in a month and we have to move on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Steve Ryan, Big Red Report.  Brad, can you talk about your role this year and how different it is, or if it's different, what you will be expected to do differently in the system. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, when you went back into last season, can you put your finger on two or three things that caused things not to work out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, quarterbacks, what are you guys doing mentally as far as half plays?  You didn't play as well in the second half as the first.  What can you do to counteract that problem? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, are you -- did you make any changes to the offensive playbook for this upcoming season?  Are you going to be utilizing Brad in a different way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Brian Davis from Dallas, can you talk about -- you and Brad both address this, please -- what kind of talks did you have when the season was over in off season or in the spring about what kind of quarterback did you want -- do you want Brad to be this year?  The running guy, the passing guy, mix of the two in terms of going into this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, players, sorry for your team's loss.  Through adversity -- you faced a lot of it last year, and you face some now -- and you learned something about yourself.  All three of you, what do you think you have learned through these trying times? </p>




<p>	Q.  This is for Brad.  In retrospect will the Heisman trophy hype have on you as you progressed? </p>
