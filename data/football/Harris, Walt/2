<p>	Q.  What does this mean, how are you feeling right now personally coming out of the last game as the head coach, the ending of your time here?  Talk to us about your feelings tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much did injury and illness affect your offensive line?  We understand that Petitti was ill?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a pretty mobile quarterback and yet Utah had nine sacks.  Was that more of an issue of identifying where the people were come from the are just the physical thing. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there something in their defense that you had not seen or something that surprised you that made their defense so successful?  Was there something that perhaps was there that you were not prepared for? </p>
<p>	Q.  From your perspective, how would -- did you get any feeling on how your decision to leave affected the team in terms of do you think they were more emotional, less emotional or maybe just about the same way they would have been? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tyler, let me start with you, that defense it seemed like they were just constantly in your face.  Were you surprised by how aggressive they were coming after you and how successful they were, nine sacks? </p>
<p>	Q.  This question is for Vince.  It's one thing to watch game film and see a team on film and a different thing to see them in person.  Your impressions of Utah's offense now that you've played against it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Vince, could you talk about the one play they were doing, ladder up four to Warren a lot of times, you had a lot of trouble on that play.  Could you talk about how much trouble you had and how you could not catch on to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk to us a little bit about the gentleman who just walked out of here and your thoughts about Walt Harris tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about just Alex Smith, how he seemed to have really just full control over the offense and seems to see things so well, can you just tell us what a factor he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you could just look back and summarize the season now that it's completely over, and also the other part of it is, you're one of a lot of guys that are coming back, what do you think is ahead for your team and what can you learn from tonight? </p>
