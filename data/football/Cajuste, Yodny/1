West Virginia - 38, Baylor - 36
Q. What went right for three quarters offensively, and what stumbled for you guys in the fourth?
YODNY CAJUSTE: Honestly, I feel that we were passing the ball good in the first three quarters, and in the fourth quarter, things happened, a momentum switched.
Q. Did you think the game was put away, not you, but just in general?
YODNY CAJUSTE: As far as?
Q. That the game was over when you got the last touchdown and you go to 38 points?  Did you think it was over?
YODNY CAJUSTE: No, I mean, we didn't want to.  We wanted to go out there and continue to score, but things happened.  But I'm just glad we got the W.
Q. Struggles with the run games, I mean, Dana still wasn't really happy with that.  The combination, can you explain what it is?
YODNY CAJUSTE: We've just got to watch film tomorrow and see what we did wrong and get better on that and try to fix it.
Q. What's it like watching that in the fourth quarter, especially when they get the on-side kick?  You don't go out and get to run clock or put the game away.  Kind of helpless or what?
YODNY CAJUSTE: I was just excited that defense got a stop and we were able to get the win.
Q. So tell me what's going on when you're watching that two-point play?  I guess the whole offense at that point is watching it?
YODNY CAJUSTE: We're just praying, defense get a stop.  Defense get a stop.
Q. Did you say anything to Xavier after that one?
YODNY CAJUSTE: I congratulated him.
Q. Did you think of last week but in reverse when you guys had the big come back and all of a sudden they're doing it to you?
YODNY CAJUSTE: Not really, you know.  At that point in time we just didn't get a stop.  Just get a stop, get a stop.  Let us win.
Q. In the end, I know you want to play as well as you can, but in the end is 38-36 as good as 38-20 for purposes of going home happy?
YODNY CAJUSTE: No, not at all.  Not at all.  It was an ugly win but at the end of the day, a win is a win.
Q. What was Dana's message in the locker room afterwards?  Have you had time to talk?
YODNY CAJUSTE: Just basically, you know, this is the Big 12, so there's going to be competition no matter what team you play.  Just like a said, a win is a win.  And we got that.
