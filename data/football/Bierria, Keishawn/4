 Q.  Talk about that high that you guys have been on for so long.  
KEISHAWN BIERRIA: We knew there was going to be a lot of cameras, so everybody tried to be smart about what they were doing.  But, you know, it's just playing football to us.  That's what we're looking forward to, just playing better teams, great teams and showing who we are as players.   
We knew as far as events and stuff, we're going through stuff like this, we're in larger places, we're not like surprised because we haven't been on the stage before.   
But one thing that we're really looking forward to is just playing better teams.
