CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Felt great.  A great win for us on the offense.  We put a lot on tape, but definitely still -- there's still some things we can work on. 
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I did not know until they said it on the loud speaker.  But it's clichÃ©, but we had a lot of receivers blocking down field and that's the guys that really made it happen and I'm just happy for them.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Most definitely.  Like I said before, we put up 56 points against a good defense and that's something -- definitely we'll celebrate our victories.
But at the same time, I still think we haven't played our best football and we left a lot out there that we can fix and we'll get back to the drawing board and get ready for the Huskies.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No idea.  They work.  It always kind of depends on the defense and what we see on film and see if it works.  We'll see.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: That's awesome.  That's definitely a huge honor, but can't do it without the teammates.  It's definitely a team victory and team win and I'm thankful for the play of my brothers.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I still am at a loss for words on the catch.  I handed it off to Bryce, he pitched it to Hoge, Hoge, bombed one out there.  I saw the catch and didn't know what to do.  Sprinted to the sideline and just sat down.  And I was at a loss for words, kind of like I am now.  I couldn't believe that.  That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Exactly like that, that was planned.  We knew that was going to happen and so Hoge put it on the money and Francis made the catch.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No.  No, he hasn't.  No, he hasn't.  We go back and forth every once in a while.  I got three brothers too, so we're always competing.  But it's definitely a healthy competition, and we like to joke around.
But all my brothers have a lot of size on me, so every time I try to face them, they kind of just look down on me and just embarrass me, but that's okay.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Yeah, I mean definitely.  I think I said a lot about our team, a lot about our front seven, our guys up there.  They all work hard out there and try to make plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: That's a great description.  I'll take that.  I think that's something just that -- our strength program has really kind of emphasizes is, doesn't matter how big you are, doesn't matter how little or big you are, it's everyone's physical and has a very physical nature at Stanford, so it's something that we definitely want to carry on.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No, no, you will not.  No.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Couple like that in high school.  That's definitely a lot of fun to go out there and see holes and make plays.  It makes football a lot of fun.  It makes people scream a lot, but there's still no trophies at the end of that.  We got a lot of football left.  We got a lot left in the tank and we got to move on and look to next week.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I honestly don't.  I have no idea.  I don't really -- we just try to do our best to look at the film, see what we can do on tape, and then correct it, and then move on.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No, he definitely gets out.  I got three brothers running around.  One of my older brothers plays at Duke and two younger brothers in high school.  And he's announcing the Bronco's games on the radio.  So it's definitely tough for him to get out, but he's been out to a couple this year.
My mom came today, so really thankful that they get out for me and also for my brothers.  Just really happy that they can get out.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: It means a lot.  That Northwestern loss did something to us that it bonded us together, because we went out there and we didn't play our best, and it showed on the scoreboard, it showed on the film.
A lot of teams fold after a loss like that first game and a lot of people were against us and we remember that.  That's something that we hold dear to our hearts.  So it continued to push us and it will continue to push us because you can't forget where you come from.  So, it's definitely a big part of our team.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No, like I said, I don't focus on that stuff.  It's definitely a huge plus, but it's a team game and that's why football is so fun because it takes every single person for sure.  I'm sure everybody else will say the same thing.
It's not one guy out there, it's 11 guys doing their job and making things happen.  It's a blessing to play with such amazing people.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Most definitely.  I think every program around the world wants to drive to be the best they can be and win every single game, but most definitely, last year we had a salty taste in our mouth at the end of the season.  Our first game we easily could have folded.  But these guys are so amazing, we come to work every single day with a chip on our shoulder, no matter if we're in the National Championship talk or we're 0 and whatever, we're going to come to work each day.  And that's why I love these guys so much, just because I really definitely feel something special with them.  They're my brothers and I get a little emotional talking about it, because it's definitely something that we love and it's a brotherhood that you don't see a whole lot of schools.  So really thankful for those guys and we're going to take it game by game and see what we can do next week.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Definitely a little bit sore.  That's what comes with football a little bit of soreness.  But soreness is good after a win, so.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I didn't believe what I saw.  I was telling him earlier, I handed off to Bryce, he pitched it and Hoge threw a bomb and I saw him hold the ball over the guy's back, but couldn't believe he caught it.  I sprinted off the field and sat down, because I didn't know how to react.  That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life.  I couldn't believe what I saw.  I had to kind of process it and really couldn't believe I was on the field at that time.  And I hope that's on ESPN number one on ESPN for the next month.  But, yeah, that was pretty amazing.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I think definitely.  Any time you score, whatever the formation is, it's, oh, that was a great play call.  But definitely, any time you make a good play, it's a fun thing.  You celebrate with your teammates and move on.  So that was an unbelievable catch by Francis, so just a lot of fun to be on the field at that same time.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Most definitely, I definitely think he's emotional, but I think that also comes from the team.  Our team really -- really, football is an emotional game and it's a shame to let the emotion out of it.  You definitely want to be emotional playing this game, to play this game that we love.  So I think that this year we definitely focused on playing our game and having fun with our brothers and part of that comes on emotion and I think it's not only rubbed off on the players, but also on all of our coaches, so it's a very fun locker room to be around, a very fun field to play on.  I love coming to practice every day and just real blessed that we get to show our emotion, I really thank Coach Shaw for that aspect as well.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I think it's a matter of execution.  We have always had the talent, it's just a matter of coming out each week and executing.  And that's something that we focused on each day, we don't want to over complicate anything if it's working.  And our guys do a great job of executing.  We really focus in practice on trying to be perfect.  We talk about having a perfect practice, no mental errors.  And it's very hard to do, but I think once you really start honing in on that and focusing on those fundamentals you start seeing the big plays happen.  The little things always make the big plays happen.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No, luck of the draw.  I was just lucky enough to run behind some great offensive linemen and went through some holes and tried to make stuff happen.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: It's a great feeling.  It's definitely a great feeling.  Definitely it means a lot to me, but I said it a hundred times, I want all thanks to God, the guys up front, who do such an amazing job.  The linemen, people blocking down field, those are the guys that make it ham.  Football's a team game and you got to look at it that way and I'm just really thankful to play for an amazing team.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Don't know what to say about it.  As I told someone earlier, I was so amazed that I ran off the field, didn't even celebrate.  I did not see it.  I kind of sat down and took a second to process what was going on.  So it was amazing and I'm still in awe, still don't know what to say about it.  I'm going to have to re-watch that a thousand times.  And that's got to be number one on ESPN for a couple years, but we'll see.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I'm sure as it should be.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Sometimes that stuff just happens.  A lot of people ask me, what did you see on this play.  I have no idea.  I just react to the game.  That's what I love about football is you just react.  That's kind of what happened.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Definitely it says a lot about our team, a lot about our fans.  I just go out there and try to make plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: That's a great description.  I'll take that.  I think that's something that our strength program really kind of emphasizes is doesn't matter how big you are, doesn't matter how little or big you are, it's everyone's physical and we have a very physical nature at Stanford and in our program.  So it's something that we definitely want to carry on.
Q. Is Francis ever going to live that catch down?
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: No.  No.  He will not.  No.
Q. Have you had a game like that in high school where you just were almost unstoppable?
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: A couple like that in high school.  Definitely a lot of fun to go out there and see holes and make plays.  It makes football a lot of fun.  Those are the games that people dream of.  But there's still no trophy at the end of that.  We got a lot left in the tank and we got to move on and look to next week.
Q. Do you remember what your best yardage was in high school?
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: I have no idea.  I honestly don't.  The one thing Coach Shaw harps on is we don't focus on the stats, we just try to do our best, to look at the film, see what we can do on tape, and then correct it and move on.
Q. Does your dad come to games or watch them?
CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY: Yeah, no he definitely gets out.  I I got three brothers running around.  One of my older brothers plays at Duke and two younger brothers in high school and he's announcing the bronco games on the radio, so it's definitely tough for him to get out.  But he's been out to a couple this year.  My mom came today, so really thankful every time they get out to watch us.
