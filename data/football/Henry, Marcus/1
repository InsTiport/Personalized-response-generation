		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Did you get in yesterday?
MARCUS HENRY:   Yes. 

Q.   What do you think so far?
MARCUS HENRY:   Really good.   Arizona is a great place.   This is my first time being here.   I like it a lot. 

Q.   What do you have plans for today?
MARCUS HENRY:   I have plans to go to Top of the Rock later today.   I heard that's pretty fun. 

Q.   Tell us a little bit about how this year has been for you. 
MARCUS HENRY:   It's been pretty good so far.   I mean, obviously we've had a great season.   We're on a big stage now. 
It's been great. 

Q.   Ever been to a bowl game before?
MARCUS HENRY:   I have.   I've been very lucky going to a couple really fun bowl games.

Q.   Which ones?
MARCUS HENRY:   I've been to Vegas twice, then Hawaii, now I'm at the Fiesta Bowl. 

Q.   What do you anticipate for next year?
MARCUS HENRY:   I think we're going to be a really good team next year.   Obviously we're losing our star runningback and star quarterback, but we have both offensive lines and defensive lines coming back.   We should be a good team. 

Q.   Do you think this is the toughest defense you'll have faced all year?
MARCUS HENRY:   It will be a very good challenge for us.   They're obviously very good for being here at this stage.   It will be a great challenge. 

Q.   I understand the quarterback had some turmoil at the start of the season.   What is it like to have him back?
MARCUS HENRY:   Yeah, I mean, at the beginning of the season, I don't think that's all on the quarterback or anybody in particular.   But I think right after the Air Force game, we started hitting our stride on offense and we started dealing a lot better from there. 

Q.   What do you anticipate from your opponents?
MARCUS HENRY:   Like I said before, they're going to be a great challenge.   We've been practicing well.   Hopefully it will be a good outcome for us.
