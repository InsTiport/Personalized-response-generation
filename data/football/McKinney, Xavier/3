Q. You faced a real high-powered offense with Kyler and those guys.  What did it take to stop them on that side of the ball defensively?
XAVIER MCKINNEY: Definitely took a lot.  Of course we knew they were very athletic, very fast, had a lot of weapons around the field.  It was hard to -- a little bit hard to contain them and keep Kyler in the pocket and keep him from scrambling, but I thought we did a decent job.  But of course there are still more things to do and more things to get better on and improve on.
