Q. Tanner, pretty straightforward question. You guys, considering two weeks ago, how much of this was just a pride performance, you know what I mean?
TANNER KARAFA: Yeah, you know, the last two weeks or so have been kind of -- we've had a chip on our shoulder coming in every day for practice, had that sort of mindset where we have to be able to help this team out. Like you can't do what we do and expect to win two weeks ago.
This is just a great -- it's a testament to our hard work, and we're hoping to keep that going forward.
Q. Tanner, back to the first quarter -- two three and outs, a pick six, and a goal line stand at the 1. My question is is that the most inspirational 15 minutes you've played here?
TANNER KARAFA: Yeah, guys are bowing up. You saw like our defense has some guts. We have the potential. We've shown what we can do. We just have to be consistent and do that on a night-to-night basis. Yeah, that was incredible. I've never seen anything like that, but it was great. We just have to be more consistent.
Q. Just also in terms of just you talk a lot about developing the talent you have when they're young. To see Jason come up with the pick and Sillah come up with the sack, it seems like you stopped them in a lot of different ways in this game.
TANNER KARAFA: Exactly. Those guys are coming in and working hard every day. We've been trying to bring them along for the past year or so now, so it's great to see these guys really step up and find themselves a little bit. Jason had an incredible play. Shitta -- everybody was hyped up on Shitta at the beginning of the season. I knew he was going to be like this. He hasn't quite had his opportunities yet, but he's going to be a great player going forward. I'm very proud of our young guys for sure.
