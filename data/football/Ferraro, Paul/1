		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Your impressions of the team so far?
PAUL FERRARO:   I'm very impressed with them.   Been at practice.   They practiced very hard.   That's the standard by Coach O'Leary. 
I'm excited to see them play on the 1st. 

Q.   Can you tell us a little bit about your relationship with Coach O'Leary. 
PAUL FERRARO:   I was graduate assistant at Syracuse.   We reconnected in 1999 and 2000 at Georgia Tech. 

Q.   Pretty long time?
PAUL FERRARO:   It has been. 

Q.   How did he sell the job to you?   What was he hoping you could bring to the table?
PAUL FERRARO:   There wasn't anything he had to sell.   Starting with him, the kind of person he is, the head coach that he is, having the relationship I've had with him over the years. 
Then obviously what UCF has done with the program, the way he's built it.   Noâ€‘brainer for me. 

Q.   Young defense you'll have to coach next year. 
PAUL FERRARO:   Yeah, that's very exciting.   Very young.   More experience obviously with every game and every day.   It's going to be exciting to be able to work with them after that game. 

Q.   Are there NCAA rules limiting how much input you're able to give this week?
PAUL FERRARO:   There aren't any rules.   I'm really here to observe.   I'm not going to be calling the game, doing anything like that.   Those things are for Coach O'Leary to determine. 
But I'm just excited to be down here and meet the players, get an idea of what they're all about.   It gives me kind of a head start till after we get back to Orlando.

Q.   Sometimes outside eyes are beneficial.   Will you help them this week?
PAUL FERRARO:   Again, that really is a question for Coach O'Leary.   We have not determined what my role is going to be on 
January 1st.
