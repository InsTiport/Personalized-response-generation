Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I gotta look at 'em.  The most hashtag guy on the team, probably Isaiah, he tried to imitate their style with the things he wears and he's always jamming west coast stuff, so Isaiah Simmons.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Going good.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm very excited to be here.  It's a great experience.  It's a humbling experience and we worked all year to get here.  It's finally here and it's just really great.  Just can't wait for Monday.  Feels like it's so far away because you're anxious to get there.  We're not going to take that moment for granted.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No, sir, not at all.  It motivates me to better my game and better myself as a player and as a person.
Just keep doing the little things to get better and just try and, like, be better.  Just try to go the best human I can be.
Q. How does Alabama defense rank against others you've played?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: This is the best defense we've played all year.  Great secondary, great front, the linebackers are outstanding, Williams is an elite talent.  It's going to be a hard challenge for us and a very physical game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, they're much more dynamic, just him blowing things up from the inside out, just having those guys around him.  That's just great.  It's a great defense and represents a big challenge for us and we will have to come out and be ready to play.
Q. Talk about being out here in California.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, my immediate family, they came to the game.  I wasn't able to get as many people as I did in Dallas but I have a great amount of people coming here, about 15.  Having them support me and having the game out here gives them a chance for a unique experience as well as myself.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No, sir, every time is a new game, a new feeling.  You can't get tied up playing the best each and every year.  You want to be good, you want to cement your name in college football history you've gotta go against the best teams.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm very different, my IQ of the game, the way I prepare for the game, just knowing things now that I didn't know last year and being able to have the mental capacity to take in all the little things.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir.  Last year I was just happy to be here.  This year I got a different mentality of being here, trying to show that I belong.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Honestly, it doesn't matter.  Just trying to get to the end zone the best way possible.  But being a running back you can't shy away from the contact.  Blowing by guys is great, too, so it's great to have both.
Q. Is there anything you tell young guys as a veteran about what to expect?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's going to be a four-quarter game.  Don't get too high or too low.  You've got to play each and every quarter like it's your last one.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: My favorite?
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: My mom makes a mean pork chop Sandwich, you can't go wrong with that, man.
Q. Are you going to get one before the game?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I got to.  Last two games I had a Pop-eye's before the game.  So I've got to continue that tradition.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm looking forward to that.  Don't let me down, man!
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: ACC football.  Coming in last year I didn't know much about ACC football.  I always watched the SEC growing up, being from Louisiana just watching the LSU Tigers, but coming in and getting a feel for the ACC, it's definitely not what I expected coming in, it's more physical than I expected, guys are faster than I exported.  Anytime team is capable of beating you if you don't bring you're A-game so I mean the ACC, I feeling it's -- they don't get the credit they deserve for the conference that it has been.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I feel like I progressed throughout the season just knowing more and being able to pick up tips from just the players' demeanor, the way they stand and things.  Just being able to play the game within the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Actually I want to be a family psychiatrist.  I just really like just giving feedback or just trying to guide someone in the right direction.  So just trying to be there for someone and give them life.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, there is no drop-off at any position.  Each and every one of them is a great player.  The chemistry they have on the field and the way they communicate is just really great.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, it's very important, especially this is the biggest game of the year.  This is as important as the last game and it's going to be a challenge to stop the running game on these guys, its just the way they play defense, the guys that they have and things of that sort.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: What's up?
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yeah, some of my friends sent it to me.
Q. I just sent it, to you too.  (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Being on "Dancing With The Stars" most definitely, would be really great, just his personality.  He won't shy way from the moment but I could definitely see him on "Dancing With The Stars."
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: All the time.  All the time.  In the locker room, people around the corner, Christian is back there trying to hit and shoot, a little dance, he tries it, man, but it doesn't always go as he plans but he tries it.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I can't, no.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: The Dab is gone.  Every day at practice we play "pipe it up" so everyone Dabs on our team so it's kinda not dead.  A little life in the Dab.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No problem.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Preparation has been really good for Alabama.  Just coming in prepared, having that mind-set that it's going to be a four quarter game, going out and practicing every day like it's our last practice, because it really is.  Having a focused mentality and preparing and having that mind-set of getting ready for the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: They're very physical, they communicate a lot with each over.  They have a chemistry about them that you're going to have to be on your P's and Q's when you're playing them.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's definitely a huge challenge, definitely a challenge.  As a football player you want to go against the best football players they are and they definitely have the best players so establishing that running game is going to be a big challenge for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely.  It's definitely a challenge going against the best.  It's definitely different going against Alabama than somebody else but establishing the run game easy, no one gives you credit, so being able to establish the running game against Alabama is going to be a huge challenge for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: That was very huge, keeping our season alive.  One loss can change your whole season, change the whole trajectory of the season.  Being able to come in and doing what he did in that game just built character and helped us come closer as a team.
(No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, yeah, he definitely has some of the best.
Q. Rank the hair on these individuals as worst to best.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I gotta look at all five.
Q. Take your time, man, this is the important stuff!  Don't forget to put Trevor in the ranking.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Trev is number one.
Q. That was fast!
TRAVIS ETIENNE: The worst.
Q. Tom Brady?  That hurts!
TRAVIS ETIENNE: This picture or hair in general 1234.
Q. The hair.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Tom Brady, I seen him, he got nice hair.  I ain't gonna say him.  Tua I gotta put him last.
Q. Travis, that's your boy, had to do it.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Worst!  Tua is in front of him.  This remind me of Trev.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: This reminds me of Trev, he's right under Trev, right here.  He has nice hair.  I've seen his hair.  I have peeked at his Instagram a little bit, gotta go about Fabio and Trev is first.
Q. I'll take it.  That's science!  (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No problem.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Honestly new names and new numbers.  They're all great players just as they have been in the past.  It's definitely going to be a challenge playing against those guys.  They're great and physical every year and you see no slack off.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, I like being in the Bay area, it gives me a different experience, something different and unique for me, something to hold on to for the rest of my life.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yeah, most definitely.  We all went to In-N-Out last flight, so trying things, just trying to enjoy the moment and enjoy being here and not lose sight of what we're here more.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I had one last night.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: In-N-Out Burger, it was good.  I liked it.  I should have got my onions grilled, it was a rookie mistake for me so I kind of tasted onions all night.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: We had a social dining last night but tonight is going to be a comedy jam or something.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know what to expect, honestly.  Seen the field a couple of times it's amazing.  I know they're going to pack the stadium.  I expect a crazy atmosphere, something new and revived, I guess.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It would mean a lot, just all the hard work we put in all season so it doesn't go unnoticed.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's going to be a four quarter game, hard-fought game.  You can't take a play off and keep your head on a swivel.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's a great experience, just the way it's set up is amazing.  I'm glad that God has put me on this platform speaking to you today and just -- I'm just grateful for this moment.  Grateful for the opportunity that I get through playing the game of football.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, nothing really.  They know I wouldn't be here without them.  I push them each and every day and for me to be up here is laughable because when I'm offensive line I wouldn't be sitting here at all.  Their hard work doesn't go unnoticed by us and grateful for those guys.
Q. The media is putting out that Alabama is the favorite.  How much are you guys feeling the pressure?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Not at all.  Actual we can't be on social media during the season so we hear what y'all tell us, but we kinda put our blind folds on and look forward.
Q. Is there any pressure on you, big win last week.  Final game of the year.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Pressure?  Not really.  We have to remember that it's football.  We have been playing football our whole lives and we can't let the moment overwhelm us so the sooner we realize that it's just a football game just like every other game we've been playin' all year, the better off we'll be.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Honestly there are a couple of guys I style my game after.  I like Leonard Fournette, Ezekiel Elliott, I mean, Le'Veon Bell.  They each tech me something different.  Leonard just teaches me physicality that I need just to run with, Le'Veon, the patience that he has looking for the hole, and just Ezekiel, the way he can blow by someone and make a move on someone with ease, so that's how I try to incorporate those three guys into my game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: They're very physical.  They present a great challenge for us.  They pick up op your tips well and you've got to be physical and ready to play every play.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just new names and new numbers.  I mean, physicality is still there, the style of play is still there.  They're still a great, great secondary, great linebackers, great defensive front so just new names and new numbers.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just his ability to pick up on things.  The quick route throws he throws and keeping the defense on their toes with those throws, that sort of thing.
Q. Opening kickoff, I know you remember it?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir.
Q. What do you remember from that?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Preparation going into the game, not taking a moment for granted and not being overwhelmed by the moment and keeping your head on a swivel.
Q. What was practice like after the Cotton Bowl win last week?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: What?
Q. The boys are giving you a hard time in the background here?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: They're giving me a hard time.  The hard work we put in all season and preparation, we are just ready to go out there Monday and play the game.
Q. Establishing the run is going to be a big deal Monday night?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely.  It's not going to be an easy task.  We definitely have to bring our A game and be ready to play every play.
Q. Wish you the best.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Thank you.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely.  This year being about 20 pounds heavier, my body feels better entering the season, not having wear and tear on me like I did last year.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, it will be a hard time just establishing the run game.  We are definitely up for the task.  We're ready for the moment.  We know it's not going to be easy so we're going to come at each and every play ready to play pound and bring the physicality that we know we need.
Q. The defensive line, is there any linebacker you are thinking I can't wait to go up against this competitor?  Are there certain guys that you want to go one-on-one against.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Not really.  I mean, they are all great players.  I'm going to get that chance on Monday, so just having the mind-set of not taking plays off and being ready for anything and everything and any player.  They're a great defense.  You see week in and week out they present each and every team so it's going to be a challenge for us to establish the run game and we're excited for the challenge.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Very different.  Last night we went to sleep at 11:00 and woke up at 6 and was ready to go.  It was weird being three hours behind.
Q. What's your confidence level with Trevor as your quarterback, freshman?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: At this point in the season he's not a freshman.  He's been put in multiple situations, multiple tests and you've seen the way he performed throughout the year.  Him being cool, calm, collected guy that he is, I feel that it really helps us.
Q. Five minutes before the National Championship game, what are you going to have on your playlist to make sure your mind is right for the game?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Five minutes before the game?  Right before the game I jam two YoungBoy songs, "Untouchable" and "Dedicated," definitely get my mind right for the game and don't lose sight of what's important.
Q. Okay.  Five minutes before the game, what do you think Dabo is going to have on his playlist?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Probably "Eye of the Tiger" honestly.  He mentions that a lot in the speeches he gives us.  Definitely "Eye of the Tiger."
Q. If you happen to be celebrating come Monday night, anything you will be dancing to?  "Eye of the Tiger"?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Probably not.  You never know with Coach Dabo, you never know he might surprise us and put on a little old school.  One time "Body like a Back Road" he karaoked that for us a little bit.
Q. There has been talk in the media about this being the fourth time in a row.  Ticket prices are down.  What do y'all think about that?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm just happy to be part of the program and it's a testament to the guys that we have every year, both and you say Alabama and the work doesn't go unnoticed.  I can call this a rivalry so I'm happy to be a part of this rivalry.
Q. This is the best Alabama offense I've seen in a long time.  What do you guys have to do offensively to ensure that you have the best opportunity to win Monday night?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: We have to be who we've been all season, establishing the run game and being able to take deep shots down the field.
We have to just help our defense out, try to put be points on the board.
Q. Good luck Monday night.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, thank you.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm okay.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just be who we been all season, not lose sight of the moment.  Don't be focused on the next play, be focused on the play now.  Having that be mind-set of being the best right now.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It is the best defense I've played this season.  It presents a huge challenge for me and the offensive line.  We're excited for the challenge.  You don't wanting to against lesser competition, you want to go against the best and Alabama is the best so we're going to have to come out and play our A game and try to establish the run.
Q. How well does your running game have to perform to win?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: We have to perform very well, being able to move those guys in the trenches, being able to establish something is going to be a huge part of our winning.
Q. Most teams in college football seem to fear Alabama.  Your team doesn't seem to be like that.  Is that a fair reflection?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, I've seen the preparation we put in week in and week out, having played them multiple times, having that mind-set and believing in our preparation week in and week out.
Q. Everybody talks about there is a lot of parity in college football, but every year it seems Clemson is here, Alabama is here, too.  The two best teams are here all the time.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just the preparation that we put in and our hard work doesn't go unnoticed.  You just play the game.  You just play the game and the two teams that ended up here, I'm just glad I am here and have a chance to play Alabama.
Q. How about having a young quarterback like you do?  Do you anticipate being successful when you made the early season changes and all?  Did you think you were going to get here?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I definitely feel like Trevor is mature beyond his years and having the football IQ he has and the progression that he put in week in and week out, day in and day out, to me he's not a freshman.
Q. What was it like not being in the championship game last year?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I have to answer that for you next week, but definitely a much better feeling being here than being home so that's a plus!
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, ma'am.
Q. I wondered how your body felt after the Cotton Bowl and recovery and how that went?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I've done a lot of recover, a little laser -- I don't know what it's called but I got into this new thing, and being in a salt tank and get my body ready for the game and be being prepared for the moment.
Q. Do you ever look at it that you have a chance to show your talent against the best defense in the country and how does that excite you?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It excites me whole a lot, just kinda hearing little mumbles about the competition that we play throughout the season and not being able to like -- just have that completion.  So I mean just having that competition that Alabama presents -- just to have that for the day to go against the best, and it enables you to present yourself in a light that everyone can see.
Q. Thank you?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No problem.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I feel like the offense has been the same throughout the season, schematically, just us growing and being together and being able to communicate with each other and learn each other I feel has really helped us.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yeah, his biggest growth has been definitely his leadership qualities, becoming a vocal leader and talking more throughout the huddle and things of that sort.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely but I mean, with all the guys we have Hunter, Hunter will drop a pass that maybe wasn't the greatest throw but he'll take responsibility.  I think that goes to the leadership we have and just those guys having the humility they have just being able to take that and move on.
Q. We heard that your mom makes gumbo and you're the king of gumbo.  We wanted to hear about that.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Makes it special?  Probably the rue that she makes and having the flavors in the rue.
Q. It's the love?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's the love.
Q. When you get the win, what's going to be your victory meal?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: My victory meal?  Whatever Adam Choice wants to have.
Q. Are you a good cook?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: What are we having after the game?
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: 74?
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: 74?  Oh my God?  I could eat 74 boneless wings.
Q. Good luck on Monday.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, thank you.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Come on, come on, yeah!
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Can I take a picture?  Next.  (Laughter.)
Q. What's it mean for you guys to be playing Alabama again?  When you are playing a familiar opponent does that make you more excited to play them?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: We are excited for the opportunity we have to play against Alabama.  They're the greatest team in the NCAA, so being able to play the best team and prove yourself is a really great feeling.
Q. How about coming out here to the west coast?  You guys don't usually play in places like California and the Bay area.  What's it like?  We have college football here but we are known for the 49ers, the Raiders, other franchises.
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's a unique experience to be in the Bay area, and it's my first time being here.  It's a unique experience, and I'm not going to take it for granted.  I'm going to take advantage of each and every moment I'm out here.
Q. Do you guys feel like you have something to prove, obviously getting a chance to have a rematch against these guys?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, having the motivation to go out there and be the best we can be.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I don't know who he is.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I never watched it.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: He told me 74.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Oh my God, no.
Q. (No microphone.)
(Laughter.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: (No microphone.)
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: (No microphone.)  You can have it, Bro.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: (No microphone.)
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm doing good.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I don't know.  That's a hard question.  Probably -- I don't know.  It's a really hard question.
Q. It wasn't long ago that it was rare to have a freshman quarterback, teams had this wisdom that you had to be older.  How does it change the dynamics of the team to have such a young guy at quarterback?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It challenges other guys around him to step up and be leaders also and when he gets down on himself or whatever just to have those guys around him to pick him up and let him know it's not the end of the world and things of that sort.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just a freak of nature right there in the front.  Just watching film and each and every play blowing up the center and things of that sort.  Just a potential first-round draft pick, a lot of things come to mind when you mention him.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: They present a challenge and we are doing that during practice, having those guys there and they have speed, too, being big and have that speed, so you're not going to run east and west on those guys, you have to take the yards they give you each and every play and be ready to play physical and play pound each and every play.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely, definitely gets me ready for the mind-set that I need for the game to be able to keep that mind-set throughout four quarters, because you definitely can get weary and get away from it.  Having those guys each and every day in practice keeps me ground and had focused.  I know that the home runs aren't going to be there, it's going to be down to 3 yards in a cloud of dust, so having those guys help me get ready for the mind-set and be ready for the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, it's a unique experience, a once-in-a-lifetime experience and like coach says, you never get a second chance at a once-in-a-lifetime experience and so I have to be me and be the best I can be and we have to go out there and play for each other.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No, ma'am.  I haven't been a huge social media guy throughout my life, honestly.
Q. Really?  You're not on anything?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I'm on social media, but I might check it twice throughout the day.
Q. What to you is the biggest factor (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: My biggest factor coming here?  Definitely when I got to Clemson, my visit, talking to the coaches, them having a family aspect to them, walking around the facilities, watching little kids run around and things of that sort, so definitely having that family feel.
Q. The coaching staff has been pretty consistent longer than you've been there, how much did that factor in?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: That's a huge thing in my decision, talking to Coach Elliot and Coach Swinney, having his kids coming to college now, you know there is stableness there so that played a huge role in my decision.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, ma'am.
Q. Chaired with Alabama in their own category, do you feel like an underdog?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, kind of, but, like, we have to focus on our preparation going into the game.  We've got to stay away from those things and focus on the game at hand.
(No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Establishing the running game is going to be a huge task, a hard task for us.  We're going to have to establish it in order to be successful throughout the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just trying to stay away from running east to west ask just taking those 3 and 4-yard runs, taking that with a cloud of dust.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, my mom, dad, sisters, brother call came to the game, my grandma, uncles, aunts, I was able to get quite an amount here.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: You have to ask my dad about that.  He deals with all that stuff.  I just sit back and get the tickets, I guess.
Q. Hey, Travis what do you see differently from you guys this year heading into this match-up against Alabama compared to last year in the sugar bowl where you had to struggle to get points on the board?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: This year, just the mind-set going in, having that feeling of defeat and having it as motivation to prepare.
Q. Is this kind of a revenge game for you guys?  If you think about it, last year in the bowl game that wasn't the performance you guys are accustomed to putting out there.  This time do you guys want to show up and show this is the Clemson team?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: We definitely want to play better but it's not a revenge game, it's not the same team that we were last year and not the same "Bama" team, but we definitely want to go out there and try to prove ourselves against Alabama.
Q. I'm assuming you guys are feeling good about the game plan and the game for Monday?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Yes, sir, that goes to our preparation we put in week in and week out, practicing Monday through Thursday now, it goes to the work that we put in, that's where we get our confidence in is the preparation we prepare with.
Q. Four years in a row you've been in the College Football Playoff, does this get old hat for you all?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: No, most definitely not.  You don't take these games for granted.  You're not guaranteed to be here each and every year.  It goes to the work we put in every off-season so we definitely don't take it for granted.
Q. How exciting is it to watch Hunter?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's very exciting for me, a humbling experience to have a guy that comes in each and every day and works.  The work ethic he prepares about, I'm blessed to be on the team with him.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, I definitely enjoy and dreamed of moments like this, you have to dream big and I picked being here throughout my life so it definitely doesn't come as a surprise.  Just getting here, it kind of let us know that your hard work doesn't go unnoticed, keep grinding.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: That's a unique -- I mean, it's very weird, honestly, guys mentioning me with the greatest in college football this year, so that was definitely a unique experience and a humbling moment for me just to know that if you work for it, you can get anything you work for.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I lost count.  I feel like each and every time somebody comes up to me new they said it a different way.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: The most?  Probably like 18 or something like that.  Some crazy -- just weird.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, when I go home they kind of like wish me luck and stuff like that.  I don't get as much grief about not going to LSU than I did when I first came here.  They are just happy for me and happy that I'm here.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just being who we been all season, having that focused mentality of each and every play being physical and taking what the defense gives us.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It's definitely been a motivation for me throughout the season and in the summer working out with these guys on the Jumbotron, coach put the loss up there and replayed it.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: During workouts, that loss and the Syracuse loss so it's definitely been motivating us all season to be here and have the opportunity to get redemption.  It's definitely something we don't take for granted.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just the mentality and each and every week enjoying the moment and taking the games one at a time and not looking too far ahead.  He didn't have to motivate us too much.  Everyone knew how it felt to walk off that field last year with the feeling that we had and knowing that we didn't leave our best out there on the field.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I kind of -- Trev had multiple moments like this.  The moment I remember is when he first got here, second team, third team guys, he draws it back and he throws a dime and hit the dude right in his helmet and it bounced right off.  Throwing the ball the way he does with power, the way he did that, it was like you couldn't miss that ball and he missed it because he threw it so hard and everybody was looking around saying this kid is the real deal.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, definitely will have to establish the running game in order to be successful this game.  But from the other games, having a great quarterback like Trev, it helps the running game and I feel like they complement each other, keeping the defense on their toes and having to be aware of each, the running game and the passing game.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Honestly, I miss the food.  That's definitely the biggest outside of family.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: The Creole food.  For me every time I go home I get Crawfish Etouffee, make sure I get gumbo and just some other favorites like red beans and rice.  It's kind of different in South Carolina, the seasonings and stuff like that.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, we have crawfish balls, but shrimp balls are my fav.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: I mean, I definitely feel like I'm just scratching the surface of who and what I can be as a player and as a man.  Just going to have to go in next season and work even harder and not lose sight of the things I want most out of life.

Q. What does it mean to be in the national title game?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: It means a lot for me.  It's a crazy feeling, humbling experience for me, a small-time kid from Jennings, Louisiana just having the platform that I have now, just being able to play in front of so many people.
Q. What did you want to say to the people back in Jennings and in southwest Louisiana?
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Dream big.  If you work hard enough for it, it will come true.  Don't grow weary in the process and keep pushing for whatever you want in life.

Q. (No microphone.)

Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Just take the 3 and 4-yard runs, don't grow weary and keep fighting to define what they give you and the little holes and that sort.
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Most definitely.  Definitely have all your bullets in your gun when you are playing these guys.  They present a huge challenge.  I can't tell you what we're working on back there, in the secret lab!
Q. (No microphone.)
TRAVIS ETIENNE: Definitely embracing the moment and taking it head on.  We're not going to grow weary of who we have here and we are not going to lose sight of what we have here.
