Q. Talk a little bit about the performance of the offensive line today. Obviously you were featured heavily in this game playing again. Talk about the guys playing in front of you and the job they did today.
AJ DILLON: We had 252 yard rushing. Any time they're doing that, they're obviously doing their job.
I love those guys up front. I mean, as you can see, 252 yards rushing. They did their job.
Q .It seemed like you did your most productive running on sweeps this week. Were they loading up the blocks and you were able to get outside to the edge?
AJ DILLON: That tends to be the case when teams play us trying to get as many people to stop the run.
The outside plays worked well. Some of the inside plays worked well. You know, we just kind of stuck with it and where we got it we got it.
Q. (Question).
AJ DILLON: I don't know. It was our conversation was going in the game.
Q. As coach talked about, you had a lot of good categories. How much does it stink being right there knowing you played well?
AJ DILLON: The only thing that matters is to get the win. We didn't get that. We have to get better.
