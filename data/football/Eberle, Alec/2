Florida State - 33, Michigan - 32
Q. Talk to us a little bit about those last five minutes.  What were the emotions?  What were you feeling?
ALEC EBERLE: Look, this year's team, we've had ups and downs and had games, we're down by one, down by two, up by one, up by two, either way it could go at the end.  We were up, we lost the lead, we came back.  Those boys never quit, and to watch a team do that, never give up, it's special.  And I guarantee there's no team in this country like this team because they never quit out here.
Q. What does that tell you about your team that maybe everybody else --
ALEC EBERLE: This is just a game.  Listen, guys, it's just a game.  Next year it's going to be a team that's going to be hard to stop.
