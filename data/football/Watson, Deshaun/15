Clemson - 37, Oklahoma - 17
Q. You're headed to a National Championship.  What are your thoughts?
DESHAUN WATSON: It's a blessing.  It's amazing.  It's been amazing what we did this season.  It's what we've been waiting for 30 years, and now we have the opportunity, and I'm just thankful.  I thankful for all the guys, all the coaches, all the fans, the support staff, and we're going to Arizona.
Q. You guys trailed at the half.  What was the turning point?
DESHAUN WATSON: Just really got to finish drives.  We had six or seven drives where we went down but some of them we got to kick field goals, and we knew that we had to punch them in.  We just kept rising with big plays.  Defense stepped up and we stepped up and hey, we dominated.
