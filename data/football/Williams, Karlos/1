Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   He loves his job, he loves what he does.   You don't find that too many take passion in ‑‑ and you know that whole "red lightening" thing came out, we totally embraced it, you know?   We don't call him "red lightening" because that's what everybody else calls him, but we love Frankie to death. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Oh, definitely, love it all.   He's very aggressive, when Jameis gothit in ‑‑ a championship last year, that's a whole other level, picked his quarterback up, tell him he's going to make plays and we love Frankie to death, we love him to death.   We appreciate what he does for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   He keeps his cool in the locker room, he's always got a smile on his face, and I've been in a bad mood coming to practice a couple times and he's come in there, "Hey, how are ya doing?"   With his smile and his energy about what he does, and his passion about Florida State, it puts you in a whole different mood, changes your mood totally, and you don't find too many people, too many equipment guys, you know?   He loves what he does, he loves Florida State.

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Um, I believe because the season we had last year, being undefeated our young guys understood that we didn't know how to lose in college football.   Jameis doesn't know how to throw a losing college football.   When you have that attitude, and you have that approach and he goes into the game, into the season, into the camp, your young guys understand that.   This is why you don't lose, this is why we haven't lost, this is what it takes to win every single game and when you have that attitude, you have that leadership coming from Jameis, from Rashad, coming from Cam, coming from me, coming from a lot more senior, a lot more juniors like Jalen Ramsey, a young guy who doesn't understand how to lose when you have that and it pours out, and it spreads across that whole team, the attitude carries throughout the season, you know?   You have, you know, overtime when it gets clinched, you have that, the late scores against Notre Dame, the three and outs, the plays that we made to you know to put us in the position that we are, uh‑ you know when you have that attitude it pours out across the team, our young guys pick it up, they understand that, "This it's what it takes to win, this is how we're going to win."   And it's why we are where we are. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Sometimes, of course there's going to be those moments even coming from coaches you have those moments but our young guys, for the most part, they would say embrace it, understand it, and our young guys have actually made plays you have Travis Rudolph on offense, Dalvin Cook you have Ermon Lane who came in and played a lot, so young guys that have came in and been able to make plays and guys who have made names for themselves and put the team in a great position, where we are now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Oh, yeah, from the springtime, from the springtime and the way he carries himself to the way he trains, the way he looks at the football, the passion that he has for the game, we knew we were going to have a great backfield, we didn't know who it was going to be the guy in the backfield, we didn't know whether it was going to be me, Pender, Ryan Green or Dalvin.   We knew it was going to be somebody.
And we all had to be able to carry the load.   We all had to be able to step up when we needed to step up and make plays.   This year it's been Dalvin, sometimes it's been me, sometimes it's been Pender.   The ‑‑ game it was Pender.   Dalvin hasn't been able to take the backfield‑‑ take it to the backfield, maybe to move the ball for Coach, and they're have been a few in there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   A lot.   My brother did it.   He came in out of high school.   My brother graduated in Decemberand came in in January, and it helped him a lot, helped him get into the playbook, helped him get into school, getting into school early, almost two semesters ahead, you're two semesters ahead.   It's always something to get a boost on that, coaches really like that, because obviously you're doing something right in high school, year making good grades, you're ahead of the track, stuff like that, but you can get your head in the playbook.   Get fast ball in spring, football extreme and the ability to get in that playbook, able to learn more and learn fast and the reps you get during the spring are a lot.   You don't get the football reps in the summer when you come in.   So being trained during the summer, you have to learn to‑‑ you come in spring you get to hit the playbook hard and be around your teammates more often so you get the veterans, that closeness knows that you're going on get during the summer and also during camp so you get a whole six months earlier, a whole semester earlier. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Very important.   He didn't get to participate that much in spring, but he got to watch, the playbook, being around veteran backs, being around Coach Brown, for six months, you know, Coach Fisher, Coach Sanders, Coach Dawsey, getting ahead of the game six months instead of waiting to come in, it did a lot for him, and it shows this season. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Um, he always‑‑ always expected to be the best of the best.   I always expected to be one of the best in the country, and even if I didn't get to achieve that goal it was always appreciated.   Something I could look back and say no way, that's something I could accomplish, something that people expected from me, and I did my best to do that and also having the backs that we had, you never know who was going to be that guy.   I had a couple of injuries this year and went down and you see Mario Pender and Dalvin carry the load, and when Pender went out, you see Dalvin and me carry the load. 
It's kind of surprising because we didn't really know.   Nobody knew what kind of season each one of us was going to have.   We just knew that whoever got the ball, didn't matter who got the ball, didn't matter how many times you touched the ball, we wanted them to run as hard as they could and do the best they could, and that's the kind of backs that we have.   The running backs are pretty much like that, doesn't matter how much times they touch it.   When I hear a call and it's your call, I want to meet you in the end zone, and we've done that a lot this year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Um, I believe I've taken on that role.   Last year we had James Wilder, we had me and Devonta and I was a lot smaller, a lot‑‑ I wasn't as thick as I was last year, so I put on some muscle, a lot of muscle this year and been able to get those tough yards when Coach Fisher needs them and the short goal lines, against Notre Dame and stuff like that.   You need backs like that, and I've definitely taken on that role.   It's something I'm very proud of, too, you know, you have guys like Dalvin and Pender that can take the ball to the house anytime.   Defense football, if somebody misses a coverage, they can catch them on the fact that ‑‑ screens, we go two blocks, I'm a blocking back, and I take pride in blocking, and it's something you have to mature into, and not many guys can go into a role knowing that's their job, and I love my job and my team loves me for it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Hopefully they have, but you have to take care of business first before I look forward to that.   Thank you very much. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Rashad leads by example.   He's a quiet guy, he doesn't say much.   He never has to say much, but when he does say something, something has made him mad and he wants to get a point across.   Jameis is more by action, he talks a lot, says a lot, and you take it all in.   But he's a great leader.   He does it on the football field.   He shows you and he tells you exactly what he's gonna do, and then he shows you exactly what he's talkin' about.   That's something that a lot of people doesn't look at.   It gets overlooked a lot of times because of Jameis.   He's young, he loves this football game.   He plays with a lot of character and a lot of fun but the way he leads us is definitely ‑‑ I wouldn't trade him for anybody else. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, that's natural.   Him being the kid that he is, the fun‑loving, loves his teammates, jokes around, outgoing person that's him 24/7.   He wakes up like that every single day and it's not a face he puts on to show people, that's him 24/7, he loves his teammates to pieces and he plays like that every single day. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   He's our leader.   He's moved to be our leader.   That spring that he came in and he dominated that spring game and the attitude he carried himself during that summer and also into camp, he proved to be that leader.   The way he carried himself last year through the things he had to go through, he proved to be a leader.   The way he carried himself this year, the adversity we faced on and off the field, he proved himself to be a leader.   So when you've proved yourself, you have no choice but to follow that guy and he's our quarterback, and he's our leader and we're going to follow him. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, it's really, really exciting because like I said before you never know what to expect from the younger guys.   You never know who was going to be rise and be that ‑‑ last year it was Jalen Ramsey, started as a freshman, came out there and exploded on defense, made plays all across the field.   This year been the same thing.   This year you have Dalvin, who has been able to take over the run game, been able to run the ball and been able to get in the passing game, create plays in the passing game.   Also, Ermon Lane and Travis Rudolph, being able to explode as freshmen.   They were able to make plays.   Also on blocking, which you don't see a lot of times, those guys really take pride in blocking. 
It's amazing to be able to watch young guys explode, and I remember when I was a freshman I was a big‑time kick returner.   I averaged a lot of yards on every kick return, and special teams was my game and be able to watch guys not on special teams, but also being able to take control of the game, be able to change the game and make plays, it makes me really, really proud. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   They're tough, long, athletic, outside, they can train a lot.   They do a very good job defending the run, and that's something that we haven't seen a lot this year.   We have been able to get around the edge, quite a bit this year with Dalvin and Pender.   Also with Jameis here we get around the edge, Rashad, stuff like that.   We have been able to be a dominant edge team, containment team, but these guys are very good on the edge.   Their backers play well, and 22 and 35 play downhill, very tough downhill guys, make a lot of plays, very fast, tough, physical guys.   We've played against fast and physical, but it's a different type of game, it's a different environment, and it's a lot at stake here.   So just like every game this year, we played tough, we tried to win, we had to run the ball through, we had to throw it.   It's going to be a dog fight.   We're prepared for it.   We're going to have to run the ball, be able to pass and be able to run, and you can't do either without the other so it's going to be a tough one.   We have to prepare each day like it's a National Championship game and play football. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Every single day, it's the small stuff, the little stuff you do every single day that Dalvin has actually been able to show, be able to manage the job when you're in the game, which is always kinda tough.   I can only imagine.   I've never had to ‑‑ being a freshman having to manage a whole job against Florida, a close game, kicking field goals, we're right there in it with him.   Notre Dame being able to manage the job against Notre Dame.   Trying to be able to stay focused, locked in, when you don't have the ball in your hand, are your passes forward, are you seeing your blitz reads, are you running your right routes, are you able to do that, and he's been able to do that, and he's been able to start the game and be able to finish it.   He's been able to play a complete football game.   The ACC Championship, the MVP of the game.   I get goose bumps just talking about it.   He's an amazing young man; I'm happy to be a part of it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Thank you. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Oh, most definitely.   Cam is a leader.   He's making calls, making adjustments, stuff like that but when you move a guy like that, and take a guy as dominant as Cam to the center and be able to put ‑‑ whose a freshman, just as big as Cam, athletic, very smart, very, very intelligent, when you have that kinda move, it can be a dominating move, and when you have Cam that can swallow up nose guards, swallow up one techniques and three techniques, it's amazing. You have him, and Trey and you have Bobby, who is freakishly athletic on the edge, makes it hard for guys to pass rush, makes it hard for guys to stop the run.   You have that dominance, thatdominance on the edges.   Makes it hard to get to the edge and hook in, makes your day very, very hard. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   When Dalvin was breaking the inside run for touchdowns, when Dalvin was getting right behind center for touchdowns, also in the pass game, there was no pressure inside.   The A gaps would totally shut down, there was no pressure inside, he was making the calls before he got to the line of scrimmage, after the huddle he was making calls blitz or stand, and when you have a guy that plays so well with his eyes so well, and can see things every time when you break the huddle and can see things like that and y'all have a quarterback that can do things in traffic, it's pretty unstoppable, it's pretty great. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Oh, yeah, it definitely changes the offense, when you can run the ball in the A gap to A gap, and also you see the Miami game, the very first game Dal was breaking the A‑gap all day long, definitely changed the dynamic of the run game.   Power team, you can see that power was going to be very, very important, but with Cam in the middle, he's a dominating guy, a great leader for us, and we love it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Um, not really.   We know we can play better football.   We haven't played the best football we can play yet and it's still to come.   If we win this game, we don't know if it's going to be Dallas, you never know, so you have to play like we're preparing for the National Championship.   We have to prepare like we're playing that last game of the season, and see what happens.   We practice well, we play well, and Coach Fisher says perfect practice makes perfect play and we're trying to reach perfection, and you ain't never going to reach it, but in the meantime you can reach excellence, and that's something Coach Fisher preaches to us all the time, you know.   Try to reach the target, try to be the best we can be. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Attitude, the way we traveled out here, carried ourselves out here, our bond, we're extremely close.   I wouldn't say there is a closer time in the country, the battles that we have been through on and off the field have made us close.   Our leader is a great leader; I wouldn't pick him or trade him for anybody in the country.   The things he's went through and the way he matured through the things he's been through, the way he has led this team by separating his personal life and football has been amazing, and you don't find that too much in an individual, and in Jameis we have that guy, and I wouldn't trade him for anybody else in the world. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Something about the way you win these football games.   It describes the character of our coach, the character of our coaching staff, the players, everybody involved in the organization.   We don'tlost mentality.   We go out there and fight for every inch, and every inch is very, very important, and I believe we've done that all season.   We don't let up.   We're going to fight to the end of the game, no matter how people count us out.   It doesn't matter about them, it's all about us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, last year we beat Auburn 34‑31.   I wouldn't want to win any other way. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   My mom, my brother and his wife will be out here.   My little ones are going to be at home.   They stayed at home celebrating Christmas with their mom, so it's a little difficult.   I would love to have my little ones out here watching me play, but one what, one is 16 months, the other is a couple weeks old, and my little girl is, what, 11 months old, so it's not safe to have them out here, and the weather changes, it would be too much.   My son goes crazy when he sees me on TV, but I have family and support here and it's a long trip.   My brother plays in Pittsburgh and going to have him come out here for me, and it's just exciting to have him here, and my older brother came to the Rose Bowl last year, so he will be able to watch it and enjoy the game this year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Definitely, definitely, they pick and choose the game, California, LA, nice place to be, obviously.   Dallas is‑‑ my brother used to live in Dallas, so Dallas is Dallas, but being in LA and coming to the other side of the country and enjoying the Rose Bowl and the festivities here, nothing better. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   Yeah, the progress was amazing, watching us go year in, year out, each year going to a championship bowl, going to the Orange Bowl, winning a National Championship, now I'm set to win another one?   You can't replace that.   I watched my brother go to his first BCS bowl game, and that made joy in my heart, and for him to watch me win a National Championship, oh he went crazy, jumping me after the game, and just watching the maturity of your team, watching your classmates that you came in with, watching them grow, like, Nick O'Leary being the best in the country, Rashad Green, breaking every receiving record, that's amazing, and having your whole class, it's amazing.   Watching us grow as a class, personally, has been amazing, and I'm very, very proud of us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KARLOS WILLIAMS:   O'Leary is a teammate.   Quiet, quiet, freak athlete, grumpy at times!   (Laughter) no, but he's a great teammate.   Does his job day in and day out, he goes to work, gets off work, and once he's off work he's off work, but when it's time to play football it's time to play football.   He's very friendly but just grumpy, just very, very grumpy.   But when it's time to play football, it's time to play football.   Watching him run over people, something he does better than I do, tell you that.   He's a great athlete and great teammate, and I can't wait to watch him play against Oregon.   I can't wait to watch what he does against this defense.
