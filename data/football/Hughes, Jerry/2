   JERRY HUGHES: Being in the BCS championship, I'm excited about it. We just can't wait to go out there on January 4th.  
  
  Q. What about Boise State, a team that a couple years ago busted all the people's ideals of what one of the smaller schools could do. What do you think about facing off against them?   
 JERRY HUGHES: We are excited about it. They are 13-0. We are 12-0. We set it up as this is our national championship.   
 We are going to bring our A game and we are ready to play.  
  
  Q. How big of a motivation is it for you guys to keep that perfect season intact?   
 JERRY HUGHES: The last time they were 12-0 was 1938. For us to be able to set history, it would be great to get that W so that it will carry off to the next season.  
  
  Q. Have you had a good time in Phoenix?   
 JERRY HUGHES: Absolutely. I have enjoyed the city. The town looks good.   
  
  Q. A great way to start the new year off with a win?   
 JERRY HUGHES: Absolutely, this is a new year. It would be great to get that W and then also for -- like I said, for the young guys, for them to start this season off right with a W so that way they know that hard work, it does pay off and this is where it can lead you.  
  
  Q. Top-rated defense and top-rated offense in the nation? Does that excite you?   
 JERRY HUGHES: Absolutely. We have watched film. They look great. For us to go out there and play against them is going to be a challenge. Everybody is excited for them. We can't wait to step out on the field January 4th and get the ball rolling.
