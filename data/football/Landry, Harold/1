 Q.  Harold, you and Zach had a pretty monstrous game at both ends.  What has it been like working with Zach and playing alongside him, and what was it like containing this Virginia Tech offense, Josh Jackson?  
HAROLD LANDRY: I think we had a great game plan for them.  We did a great job preparing all week, and I think we went out and executed for the most part except for on a couple 3rd downs.  But working with Zach, yeah, he's definitely matured so much than when he first came in.  You could see the way how I approached the game and coming in early, leaving late, extra film, extra film work, and he just does the same.  He's a very mature player, and he takes the game very seriously, and you can just tell that he's being developed so well right now.   
 Q.  Kind of an extra challenge coming next week with another guy named Jackson, who you're pretty familiar with.  Just talk about what that's going to be like going into Louisville.  
HAROLD LANDRY: It's definitely going to be a challenge.  We're just going to have to be disciplined.  I know our coaches are going to do a great job putting a game plan together for them.  But yeah, in this day and age there's nothing but special quarterbacks like that that can run and throw, and especially in the ACC.  I think we play like one of those every week, and I think we'll do a great job preparing for them, and we'll be ready to go.
