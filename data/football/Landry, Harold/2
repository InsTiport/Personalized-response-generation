 Q.  Harold, how did it feel getting that first sack?  
HAROLD LANDRY: Felt good.  Should have had one last week.  But yeah, it felt good.   
 Q.  Did you feel that Wake was trying to exploit your aggressiveness on the edge in their run game?  
HAROLD LANDRY: No.  I mean, I knew the plays they were going to run.  I knew they'd try to run on third down as well.  But yeah, I guess they tried.   
 Q.  (No microphone).  
HAROLD LANDRY: No, we just went out there and played our defense.   
 Q.  (No microphone).  
HAROLD LANDRY: John, I talked to John.  John, he's a strong dude.  He knows he's going to bounce back strong, and so do I.   
Anthony, I mean, in college football.  You're going to have your bad days.  You're going to have your good days.  Today just happened to be a bad day.  He knows that.  We knows we're behind him.  We've just got to get back to work tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did you expect Wolford to carry 20 times today, or was it something about the flow of the game?  
HAROLD LANDRY: No, we knew he was going to run the ball.
