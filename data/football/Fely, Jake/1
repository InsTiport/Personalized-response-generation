THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   Yeah, it's really exciting to be bowl eligible now.   We're just focused on the next game and we have a lot more football to play. 

Q.   What did you like about this game? 
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   It was a tough game.   All the credit to UNLV, they played really good, but we're just happy that we won. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM MUEMA:   We came out with the win, and that was important. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   It's really exciting, you know.   When we first came in here, I don't know, me personally, we weren't and established team yet.   But now I feel we're an established team.   Going to three bowl games really proves that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   I feel you can always play better, eliminate turnovers.   That's the key.   But we handled adversity and came out with the win. 

Q.   What happened on the two fumbles?
ADAM MUEMA:   Took my eye off the ball, was looking at the defender, lost the ball. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM MUEMA:   Not really.   But as far as me fumbling, I guess you could say so. 
I just appreciate what the line did, the team.   They kept working hard and never gave up. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   I'm just doing whatever I can to help the team win.   That's basically all it is.   If it's blocking or making plays, I'm just trying to do what I can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   It's good.   I've been with him since he came in.   He's been the second string.   So him coming in is an easy transition. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   You'd probably have to ask him that.   I don't know what he's really looking at all the time. 
But we connected a few times.   He connected with Colin, too, so it was good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
GAVIN ESCOBAR:   It's exciting for him.   Bummer that he goes down.   We're all just praying that he gets better soon.   But it's big. 
He's a pretty confident guy in his abilities.   We're all confident in what we can do, so... 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM MUEMA:   No.   I just stay focused, keep playing because the game is obviously not over.   It was early in the game.   Keep fighting, help the team win. 

Q.   What did you think of your new quarterback tonight? 
ADAM MUEMA:   Confident.   Was my first roommate.   I'm proud of him. 

Q.   Your freshman year? 
ADAM MUEMA:   Correct.

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, it was a lot of fun.   I enjoyed it tremendously, but I think I was more nervous throughout the week just getting prepared. 
It's still football, the game I played my whole life.   Once you get out there between the lines, you just got to go out there and execute. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, in a way.   We had a pretty good offense tonight and the turnovers killed us.   We just shot ourselves in the foot. 
Give credit to the defense.   They played a heck of a game, kept us in this one.   The defense played a great game.   The O‑line toward the end did a great job and just let us run out the clock. 

Q.   (No microphone. 
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, I feel like we have good chemistry.   It just starts in practice.   I've been throwing to him since I've been here.   I feel like he trusts me and I trust him tremendously.   He's a great guy.   Makes a lot of matchup defenses. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAKE FELY:   I don't know.   I was just trying to come off the edge fast.   We preach being physical every day in practice.   Getting the opportunity to blitz like that, you got to try to show something.   That's what I was trying to do for the defense. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   I can't point out one thing.   A win is a win.   It may not have been pretty, but a win is a win.   We're happy about this one. 
The one thing I'm pleased with is how the O‑line played.   They let the runningbacks run for over 100 apiece.   Chad Young had a heck of a game also.   He was throwing his head around in there, making big hits all over the place. 
I can be pleased with how we ran the ball.   It kind of took some of the pressure off of me.   All the guys around me played a heck of a game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAKE FELY:   Yeah, I mean, like I said, every practice, we preach being physical.   It's get off the ball so the offense can get the ball.   Being physical is what we're trying to do and get a W every game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   I don't think you could really expect anything out of a first start.   Like I said, it's still football.   I'm just happy we came away with a victory and we'll celebrate this one tonight and get ready to go tomorrow. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, that was a great snap by Alec.   I got a little anxious, took my eyes off the ball.   Sometimes the ball bounces your way.   It did in this case.   Came right back to me.   Colin Lockett got open, scored a touchdown.   Had nothing to do with me, but Colin helped me out there at the end. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   I just told him to let it go, move on to the next play, nobody's perfect.   I had a fumble myself. 
Adam is a great player.   He knows when something isn't right, so you tell him to move on, keep encouraging him, still let him know he's a runningback for this team, we're going to keep helping him as much as we can.   Just keep two hands on the ball.   That's it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, it's exciting to be bowl eligible, but we still got a lot of football left.   We're just going to enjoy this one tonight, come back tomorrow ready to work.
