 Q.  Obviously the last few weeks have been a little frustrating.  You come in here obviously with a win.  Talk about your emotion after that game.  
TYLER HUNTLEY: We always knew that, you know what I'm saying, we was never down on ourselves that we wasn't good or nothing.  We just continue to fight through adversity and we came out with a win today.   
 Q.  How would you describe that play for the touchdown?  
TYLER HUNTLEY: I just knew he was going to make a play so I held the ball up long enough to make it -- let him make a play and he made a play and scored.   
It's always been there, we just found a way to hurt ourselves in previous games, but I felt like we came together as a team today and put it all together.   
 Q.  Does it seem like over 16 quarters since you've thrown a touchdown pass?  Talk about getting that monkey off your back?  
TYLER HUNTLEY: It wasn't really a monkey on our back.  Like I said, we stubbed ourselves in the foot sometimes and that showed a lot.  It shows up on the stat sheet and everything like that but we just -- today we kept working and put it all together.   
 Q.  When the defense is doing the things that they are doing, how much more does that get you guys going?  Obviously you guys are going well but knowing they are doing it on their side.  What's that like?  
TYLER HUNTLEY: It just felt like, you know what I'm saying, we could just go out there and do it, knowing that our defense has our back and we have their back and it's a team.
