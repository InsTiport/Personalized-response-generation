 ARIZONA STATE   34
  NOTRE DAME - 37 
  
TOMMY REES:   It wasn't all that tough.   I tried not to pay attention to all the outside.   Really just focused on what's going on within the program within my teammates, my coaches, family and that's who I play for.   Really just stayed positive with them and just like another week for me.   I have to get prepared and get ready to lead this team to victory.  
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
TOMMY REES:   I think as an offense, we settled in and had a good understanding of what they were trying to do.   Arizona State had a great game plan, they did a lot of things on defense to get us thinking.   So we made some plays there in the second quarter, and proud of how the offense played.   
   
 Q.   Coach says the run game sets up the passing game, and you didn't have the run game before the fourth quarter.   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, I think we had some matches, so we could take advantage and our guys protected and made plays on the outside.   Really TJ and DaVaris, Torii, all those guys ran routes well and got open for us; and Koyack, really happy for him on his first town down.   A lot of different guys contributed to the win tonight.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the importance of the win, knocking off a win‑‑  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, it's a big win for us.   You know, to get right back on the right track heading into the bye week, the halfway point of the season, was kind of a game we understood the importance of, and we are really ready to go and had a great week of preparation.   
Like I said, proud of the way the team played.  
   
 Q.   Coach talked about limiting possessions on defense; what did you try to do offensively?   
TOMMY REES:   Just try to sustain some drives.   We knew Arizona State had a really good offense and could put up some points.   So limiting their opportunities to go out there and score ultimately helps our defense with ball control.  
Obviously running the ball helps with the clock and all that, but just sustaining drives.   When you've got third and manageables, just making sure that you convert, which I thought we did a good job of, keeping their high‑powered offense off the field.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
TOMMY REES:   Oh, man, so happy for TJ.   Him and I came in together four years ago, and you know, you can't say enough about how the kid has grown since he's been here.   
You know, first of all, tremendous player; but the way he's grown off the field, really being the leadership and everything he's gone through, had to grow up fast for his family, I'm so happy for him and all the success.   It's not a surprise; he's a hard‑working and very talented player.  
   
 Q.   You get a lot of heat and know it's part of the job, but how do you let it roll off your back and perform like you did tonight?  
TOMMY REES:   I don't even know what you're talking about‑‑ no, I'm just kidding.   
Being a quarterback at NotreDame, it's one of the things that you kind of sign up for.   But for me, like I said, I rely on my teammates first, coaches, family, the people that I care about, and I care about what they think.   For me, it's just staying focused and staying within the people that matter.  
   
 Q.   As the game moved on, you really got into a rhythm in the passing game, where did that come from?  
TOMMY REES:   The week of preparation.   We did a great job all around protecting, like I said and getting open.   I think it's something that we needed to improve on the past couple of weeks and that's something that we really focused on.  
   
 Q.   How do you come back fromsix ‑‑  
TOMMY REES:   Well, yeah, you know, it's going to happen and obviously you want to limit those mistakes, and have got to take accountability for that.   But I've got a hundred of my teammates and brothers counting on me, and there's never a moment to get down.   Got to get right back out there and find a way to move the ball on the field, which we did.  
   
 Q.   What was it like to play here?   
TOMMY REES:   Awesome.   You know, the stadium is obviously an unbelievable venue, and you can really see the pull that NotreDame has nationally.   You come down here and it's like playing a home game.   It's loud for you, and that's a special thing about NotreDame.   
   
 Q.   What is it about TJ ‑‑  
TOMMY REES:   Great, he's such a smart football player.   I think that's one of the things that all good receivers have is they understand coverage.   They understand leverage and how to run routes.   TJ's best asset is how well he understands defenders are playing him, and then he runs routes based off of that.   You know, a guy like that I can trust and count on being on the same page.   He obviously catches everything and does a great job.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
TOMMY REES:   Any time you have a senior who has played as much as he has‑‑ and I can say things like, guys look at me like I'm crazy and he understands it.   He's like a coach out there for us outside and obviously being a captain and being a leader of the team, he's done a great job of understanding the intricacies of playing.   
   
 Q.   Is there an example of something that you can tell him and somebody else would like stare?   
TOMMY REES:   All those guys do a good job of trying to understand.   I think just the experience that he's had in games and understanding how defenses play, that's kind of where he builds that knowledge.
