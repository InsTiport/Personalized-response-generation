 Q.   It's got to feel really good getting the win.   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah.   First off, hats off to Navy.   They did a great job.   I have so much respect for what they do protecting our country and all that.   
For us, we had opportunities early on where we couldn't capitalize.   When you play a game like that, we need to take the early lead and take them out of their game plan.   If not, you're going to have a nail biter like that.   They do a good job of offensively staying on the field and limiting your touches.   
I'm really proud of the whole team and how they came back and were able to pull a close one out.  
   
 Q.   At what point in this game did you feel like the margin of error was small?   
TOMMY REES:   I think in the second half we knew, especially after we only had one possession in the third quarter, and we knew we needed to make plays and take advantage of the opportunities we had on offense, not knowing when the next time we touched the ball would be.   
It started up front for us.   Those big guys up front played a heck of a game, and we were able to run the ball fine.   Cam did a nice job for us in the second half.   And we made some throws when we needed to.   
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   I'm extremely happy for the kid.   We've known from day one he could provide another weapon for us offensively and for him to really come into his own.   
It starts up front for us.   We had guys in there that aren't used to playing those kinds of snaps.   He did an awesome job for us.   Tarean ran hard and took care of the ball.   He didn't play like a freshman tonight.   He played like a guy who really knew what was going on out there.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   It's awesome.   We have guys‑‑ our entire offense, we have a lot of depth everywhere.   We have tight ends that we can bring in.   We've got a lot of receivers playing.   Yeah, I think we're starting to show our depth at running back.   I think all of them kind of provide a little different intangible or skill that we can throw out there.   
You know, we all miss a step, but we're able to get those guys some fresh legs and fresh carries.  
   
 Q.   Playing against Navy provide a whole bunch of[ No microphone ].  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, it's a little frustrating.   Like I said, they do a great job controlling the clock and limiting your touches offensively.   That's how we knew they were going to play.   When you don't take advantage of early opportunities, it's tough.   
We stayed within ourselves, Zach and I, T.J., tried to keep the guys going, keep them‑‑ we're going to get another series.   We need to go down and score a touchdown.   Anything else is unacceptable.   
We had great leadership, and we were able to really rally together and find a way to pull it out.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, I think we've proven we can win some of these close ones.   It shows the fortitude and the type of character we have as a team when you're able to stay focused and really grind it out for four quarters.  
   
 Q.   Tommy, pretty great the last couple of weeks.   [ No microphone ].   How do you get yourself back to that rhythm?   
TOMMY REES:   I don't feel like the rhythm is really gone.   Obviously, threw the one play to T.J., he slips.   I've got to see that.   
The play before the half, probably should have taken it down and tried to make something when it's not there, try the two‑minute drive.   I felt like other than that we were able to‑‑ I felt like, when we needed to throw the ball, we were able to make some plays.   Troy had made a huge play for us on third down on that last drive.   
We just got to keep working and keep staying within ourselves offensively week to week and be prepared to play.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, I mean, Oklahoma kind of‑‑ I'm not going to reflect on the past, but there were obviously some things that happened early on that were hard.   
You got to keep going.   After that point, you really just need to prepare every week and working hard throughout the week of practice and film study and developing a rapport with all the guys on offense.   
We're just going to continue to do that, and you got to find a way to win next week.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah.   We didn't make all that many adjustments.   We had a couple of wrinkles here and there to what they were doing.   For us, it was about finishing drives and executing.   
We moved the ball the whole game, but it was just a matter of closing it out when we got down there.   For us, it was just keeping what we're doing and knowing that we were able to move the ball and stay confident and prepared to go.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, like I said, he didn't play like a freshman out there for us today.   He played with a lot of the confidence and a lot of toughness and grit for us.   
It starts up front.   We did a great job of getting him some great looks.   He ran extremely hard and made people miss.   I think he'll keep moving forward.   It's the kind of game where you gain more confidence in him.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   I'm no expert on that field, but I feel like for a younger back, he really understands what we're trying to do within the run game, and he understands the different looks and has really good vision.   I think he'll just keep moving forward from here.  
   
 Q.   Playing the ball well really sets off the play action.   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, we were able to get out on the perimeter with some boot actions.   Koyack did a great job.   Even Troy was holding on to those plays, but then he came back and made a couple great blocks and sprang for a couple of extra yards.   Being able to run the ball like that, you've got to have play action.  
   
 Q.   Particularly that third down where you made nine yards, talk about that play.   
TOMMY REES:   Are you talking about the last drive?  
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, we had a two high look.   Any time you meet Troy going down the middle, kind of matched up with a mike linebacker, he's a mismatch for that.   For me, you've just got to put it up there and let the big guy get it.   He's pretty tough to take down after he gets the ball in his hands.   So it was awesome.  
   
 Q.   Feel pretty good?   
TOMMY REES:   It feels great.   Just got to keep moving forward and take it one day at a time.   Come out here and find a way to win next week.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, he didn't play like a freshman.   He ran extremely hard and was able to make some people miss and get some tough yards.   I'm really happy for the kid.   I think he's got the right attitude to keep moving forward and keep working hard for us.   I think he can be a pretty good player for us down the road.  
   
 Q.   Does he play like a freshman?   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, it's about his character.   He's a pretty mature kid.   He understands the game of football and the different schemes that we're trying to do.   When you've got a kid like that, it's pretty special to see.  
   
 Q.   Maybe a little more patient?   
TOMMY REES:   I'm not going to get into‑‑ I'm not an expert on judging running backs, but I think even Cam and George made some big runs for us as well, and Tarean took advantage of some great looks, and we blocked well up front, and he really finished runs well.  
   
 Q.   [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, I think being able to have two tight ends on the field, it shows a different threat offensively, and you've got like five catches for three touchdowns or something.   But, yeah, he's a vulture for sure down in the red zone.   
Yeah, any time you can have two tight ends and run the ball and come back with some play action and different things, I think it gives an extra dimension to our offense.  
   
 Q.   When you roll out on that boot and there's nobody there, what's going through your mind?   Is it like touchdown for sure?  
TOMMY REES:   No, I think the biggest thing on boots is you don't pass up a opportunity and try to get out there and get the ball.   Troy should be coming open to a little deeper, but he made some great blocks to spring Koyack on those runs.   He did a great job for us all day.  
   
 Q.   The big one to Troy, I think it was on third and eight.   Kind of like how you saw that play develop.   Did you get a good view of him having guys behind his back?   
TOMMY REES:   I didn't see the end of the run.   I was looking back at the time.   We had a good matchup.   It was kind of a two high look, and we were able to take advantage of his mismatch, the way he presents with his size, and I just put the ball up for him, and he usually makes a play for us.  
   
 Q.   Next time you guys come back here, it will be your last game.   Can you talk about [ No microphone ].   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, I'm not trying to get into a couple of weeks ahead.   Obviously, it's in the back of our heads, as seniors, and really we've got to focus on finding a way to have a great week of preparation and get ready for Pitt.   
It will be a great moment for seniors and our families and our close relatives and people we're close with, but it's kind of the last thing on my mind right now.   We've got to find a way to have another great week of practice.  
   
 Q.   Do you think about that when you're in the locker room, like, hey, we can only do this one more time?   
TOMMY REES:   It's been a discussion.   Sometimes Coach will challenge us, hey, you've only got a couple more quarters here to play and make the most of it.   That's just how to really leave your legacy at home.   For us, it's awesome playing here.   
Like I said, we're going to focus this week on Pitt.   And then we've got a bye, and we'll focus on BYU.   
When the season's all over, it will be nice to look back and think about the special moments we've had.  
   
 Q.   Can't do anything about the past, but pretty content with where you guys are here now with three games ago?   
TOMMY REES:   I think for us, big picture, we don't want to let that get in the way.   We've got to focus on recovering tomorrow and getting ready for film study and practice throughout the week and let the big picture stuff take care of itself.   
We've just got to have a great week of practice and go out there on Saturdays and find a way to win games.  
   
 Q.   Tommy, you're a veteran and played in a lot of big games.   How was this team able to pull out this victory?   
TOMMY REES:   I think the great leadership we have, both on the coaching staff and some of our older guys.   We've been in close games before, and we've shown our character and shown that we know how to fight for four quarters and find a way to win games.  
   
 Q.   You've had some close games, but you guys are on a roll.   How good does it feel to be on this roll?   What does it do for the rest of the season?   
TOMMY REES:   I think we've got to continue with what we're doing, not look at the big picture, and stay focused.   The weekly preparations have been key for us.   Just keep executing throughout the week and find a way to win games.
