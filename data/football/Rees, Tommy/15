		   TOMMY REES: I think any time you get more balance, it helps the offense. Helps stress the defense, especially with some down-field throws. 
 I just think on first downs especially, being able to pick up good yardage, being able to run the ball as well and as effective as we have just helps open up everything for us on offense. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: The USC game obviously wasn't one of my better games. Obviously happy with the win. But going on from that game, I just wanted to make sure I limited mistakes. 
 I really feel from that game on, I've really taken an important step in understanding what defenses are trying to do, just making sure you recognize where their weaknesses are. 
 I think that was the biggest thing for me against USC, not necessarily recognizing everything they were trying to do to me, taking advantage of it. Just going back and learning from your mistakes, learning different rotations, learning different ways that players drop out, things like that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: I wouldn't be surprised if it's a lot of the same stuff. I think they're a team that's extremely talented, extremely well-coached. I don't think they're going to do too many things different than they have been. 
 I think they have a lot of confidence in their system, in what they're doing. Just got to go off of the film that we have. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: That's the reason why I came here, to play in big games like that. USC is a rivalry game. Just to get a chance to play with them, a lot of competition out there. They're very fast, very talented, well-coached, like Tommy said. Just get out there and play with good competition, it's always good for me. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: It's something that the coaches put a big emphasis on me. Having a good running game like we do, you never know when they're going to break one lose. It's just going out there and making sure you do your job is the best thing. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: It's effort and also having the coaches put a big emphasis on it, making sure we get the job done. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: Yeah, I mean, looking back, probably one of the top front sevens I've faced as far as skill, athleticism. 
 But, I mean, that's what you expect with USC. They're going to have great players, they're going to be well-coached. Playing against good competition always is exciting and usually brings out the best in guys. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: Yeah, the game took some ups and downs. Just trying to stay confident. Wasn't too much of a struggle because I understood what position we were in, what needed to be done. 
 But, yeah, I mean, being able to roll out and hit Michael on the first pass, getting the drive going with a big chunk pass, having coach have confidence in us after we've been struggling, that kind of helps get things going. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: It's been good. You know, I'm not the best at it. I'm working at it. It's just all about preparation, practice, getting the technique down. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: Yeah, I think the main thing is repetition. I don't mind people coming down. I'll make a good decision on when it's a good catch and not. Like I said, repetition is key. That makes everything more easier on the field and gets me more comfortable. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: I think him taking over the whole middle, that leaves a lot of defenses having to worry about him, giving us kind of a one-on-one sometimes. 
 For him to be able to catch the ball, have the attention that he gets when he catches the ball, goes to the middle, I think is doing good for us. 
 TOMMY REES: Going off of what Michael said, it helps give defenses something to worry about. They can't necessarily take Michael in every play. They have to be conscious of Tyler and other receivers. He's been the best on third down for us, having a big target when you need a tough completion and a big way to keep drives going, I think he's done a great job for us all year on third down. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: Yeah, you know, Coach Kelly puts a big emphasis on special teams. A lot of guys might not want to play in special teams, they've been in the role of playing defense or offense. I told him I want to be in that position and I want to try. I did it in high school and I felt confident that me being back there, you know, I can make a big play. That's what I'm trying to do. When I'm back there, that's what I'm trying to do every single time. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: No. I'm trying to do the best for the team. I'm not worrying about injuries at all because when you do, that's when you do get injured. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: I think they're getting that much more comfortable with one another. I think as time goes on, the more and more experience they get together, they start to understand each other's tendencies, get comfortable with one another, how they're playing. 
 I think just more and more experience, just making the right calls. A guy like Trevor Robinson has played so many games here, proves to be very valuable to us, just being able to communicate the fronts, what defenses are trying to do. I think his football IQ has really shown a lot this year in making sure the offensive line is always in the right protection. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: I think a lot of it's trust because a lot of times just them trusting me to make the right call. Sometimes they'll see something, but they can't see the whole picture, the defense. When I check them out on something, they have to trust I'm making the right call. 
 I think that's something that has been pretty good for us the past couple games. I think we're at a point now where we're going to keep building that. Just the communication process between us has been really good. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: Yeah, I think it just is feeling comfortable. When I committed here, I felt comfortable around the guys, felt I was already on the team. That's what you want to feel, and that's how I felt here. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: Yeah, having a season like that, looking at the schedule, stuff like that, I felt like I can help this program be successful down the future. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: I mean, I don't really mind the stuff that other teams do. It kind of motivates me. That's the stuff that motivates me. I don't mind it at all. I think it's pretty funny actually. When you go up to Michigan, you see signs of past things that you've done. To me, I think it's funny. It motivates me. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: No, because I think having the confidence that I do in myself, I think we can get the job done on third down. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: I think it's been so much tradition between both programs, it's been a rivalry game for so long. I think any time Notre Dame and USC get together, it's a big attraction. 
 I think both teams are playing pretty well right now. Both teams are kind of on the upswing of things. I think just like any other year, it's a big game. I think especially with the kind of way the programs are going, I think a lot of people are tuning in. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: You know, I was watching that game. It was pretty exciting. Just the atmosphere of that big rivalry game. Unfortunately it didn't come out how we wanted it to. It motivates me watching that, knowing you have the confidence to get the job done. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 MICHAEL FLOYD: You know, it would be a good positive for us. Like Tommy says, we're on the up of doing great things this year. Like coach says all the time, we got to take one game at a time. Every game is a playoff game for us. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 TOMMY REES: I think, like I said before, the growth, the more experience, anyone on the offensive line, especially Braxston, all the looks of the center, as the center of the football team, you have to be making calls, communicating up front. I think that's kind of a process that a lot of people don't give a lot of credit to. 
 But he's done a great job mentally as well as the physical aspects of the game. He's improving from year to year and game to game. 
 THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions from the callers. 

 Q. Tommy, I'm doing a story on how you grew up in a football family. Your older brother was a college player. Your dad was a coach for a long time. How did that help your development as a quarterback? 
 TOMMY REES: I just think being around the game for as long as I have been, just growing up where football was kind of the focal point around our lives. I think it helps the growing process. Being around a coach as a dad, it kind of helps you improve, understand how this game is played, the ups and downs of football. 

 Q. What kind of adjustments have you had to make with your skill set relative to Coach Kelly's offense?
 TOMMY REES: I think since the day I came here, since he's been here, it's been a growing process, understanding the timing of the offense, the footwork, understanding what everyone is trying to do. I think the more repetitions we get, it continues to get better.

 Q. Did you ever consider UCLA coming out of high school? I know your dad was out here coaching the Bruins. 
 TOMMY REES: Maybe a little bit. But I'm real happy with my choice here at Notre Dame. It was kind of my number one choice throughout the whole recruiting process. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
