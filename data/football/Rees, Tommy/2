 Q.   (Question regarding the offensive line.)   
TOMMY REES:   Played their tails off.   We were doing a ton of checks.   The way they played was awesome.   
   
 Q.   How close is DaVaris to where he needs to be all the time?  
TOMMY REES:   He's a great competitor, great player.   Obviously has a lot of talent.   I'm excited for him and his future.  
   
 Q.   How tough were the checks they were doing and everything you had to change?  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, that's just part of the game.   The coaches put a lot of confidence in me to call some things at the line.   
We were able to communicate well and get some things going that worked out for us.   Obviously they're a great defense.   Hats off to Stanford.   They did a bunch of stuff, tried to counter some of the checks we were making.   
Really proud of how the offense handled all that.   
   
 Q.   Coach Kelly mentioned Friday you had an IV?  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, that's part of the season.   A bug going around every once in a while.   Didn't affect me today.   
   
 Q.   No bad turkey?  
TOMMY REES:   No, no bad turkey.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
TOMMY REES:   Getting jammed up a little bit.   Work the safety over.   We know Fuller can run.   He got behind the corner.   Corner made a nice play.   
But just we were trying to take a shot there at the end.   
   
 Q.   How do you digest an 8‑4 season?  
TOMMY REES:   Not good enough, obviously.   Proud of the guys.   Proud of my teammates, how they fought all year.   But you don't come to Notre Dame to be 8‑4.   Everybody understands that.   
We're not going to make excuses.   We're going to look for solutions going ahead.   We only have one game left, we want to leave a good legacy.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding bowl game.)   
TOMMY REES:   We'll see what it comes to.   For us, it's about playing our last game, finding a way.   Wherever we are, we're going to prepare, be ready to play.   
   
 Q.   What's the highest motivation?   Do you want a strong opponent?   Good weather?  
TOMMY REES:   We just want to play.   For us, we don't have much decision about where we're going.   We just want to play another game.   We'll get that opportunity.   We're just ready to compete.   
   
 Q.   Even in the loss, feels like you're playing better than you were earlier this season.   
TOMMY REES:   There's no moral victory or anything like that.   Stanford is a great team.   You got to be ready to play.   
We come, expect to win games, no matter the situation.   Proud of the way the guys fought.   We know it wasn't good enough.
