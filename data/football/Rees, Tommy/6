 Q.   Tommy, were you shell-shocked after the first two interceptions?   
TOMMY REES:   I wasn't shell-shocked.   You have to bounce back between the play and stay positive and just keep moving forward.   There is a lot of football left to play.  
   
 Q.   What about your own performance?   What did you feel?   
TOMMY REES:   Obviously, I'm disappointed with how I played individually.   You've got to be better.   You can't turn the ball over and expect to win games against good teams like Oklahoma.  
   
 Q.   Tommy, two rough weeks in a row for you.   What needs to change?   
TOMMY REES:   We've just got to be more consistent.   Deal better with certain situations, stay out of the negative downs.   Just got to continue to work hard and get better.  
   
 Q.   Obviously, a tough situation with two losses.   A lot of BCS talk in the off‑season.   Do you feel like you're ready for that now?   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, we're just focused.   Getting ready for Arizona State and we'll take it one week at a time from here.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, there was a miscommunication within the play.   But as a quarterback, your job is to erase negative plays when things aren't perfect.   I've got to be smarter with that and know when a play is run the way it's supposed to.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, we knew we had some good run looks coming into the game, and our backs were running hard.   We had some checks at the line that gave us favorable looks.   Up front we did a great job blocking, tight ends, receivers and our running backs ran hard.  
   
 Q.   What did George give you as a back when he gets four carries like that?   
TOMMY REES:   I think he showed he has big play ability, and he has speed where if he gets out in open field he can run by a lot of people.   I think he showed that today, and he'll continue to be a good asset on offense.  
   
 Q.   (Asking about Hendrix) what did you see opening up on your offense?   
TOMMY REES:   I think it gives the defense another thing to prepare for.   It helps us in certain situations.   Obviously, we used him a lot.   When we needed a couple yards down in the red zone, it's just another component of our offense.   If Andrew can help us win games, there is no point in not using him.  
   
 Q.   Does it mess with your rhythm at all?   
TOMMY REES:   No, not really.   No, not really.  
   
 Q.   With the start, how tough is it to get refocused after giving up two touchdowns and then get back into the game?   
TOMMY REES:   With the group of guys that we have, it's not too tough to fight back.   Obviously, you can't spot a team 14 points like that right off the bat.   It's tough to fight back.   But I'm proud of the way we did.   Obviously, the start hurt us in the long run.  
   
 Q.   You said you guys take things week by week.   But just what is the mood in the locker room after a loss like this?   
TOMMY REES:   You let it sit for 24 hours and think about how you can get better and where you need to improve.   Come tomorrow morning when we check in and stuff, it's ready to go for next week.   You know, you can't sit there and sulk on a loss.  
   
 Q.   Is it almost good to get away after a tough loss like that?   
TOMMY REES:   We just need to get ready next week regardless where we're playing.   We love playing at home, but we're ready to go for this week and we have another tough challenge ahead of us.   We'll have a great week of practice and get prepared and ready to go.  
   
 Q.   What was the message to the team after this?   
TOMMY REES:   Coach was great.   He was positive and moving forward.   Got to take a look at all of us and where we need to get better and just continue to improve.  
   
 Q.   The last interception, coach said it was kind of a missed route.   EJ said the same thing, he ran a little shallow.   DaVaris said he ran a little deep.   Are these interceptions a team thing?   
TOMMY REES:   As a quarterback, I take full accountability.   If things aren't run the way they need to be, you have to erase the play and get a zero on it.   That's my job to kind of make sure that happens, so I take accountability for it.  
   
 Q.   Mentally how difficult is it to put bad luck plays like that?   That was unreal what happened today.   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, it's not too difficult.   You have a hundred guys counting on you, and you want to go out there and play with your teammates.   We understood what we needed to do, and offensively we've got to keep looking ahead and move forward.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, one play at a time.   You can't dwell on what just happened.   You have to keep moving forward.  
   
 Q.   Your offensive line has pass blocked really well this year, kept you clean.   Today you ran the ball well, so they're run blocking pretty well.   Did you notice that during the game that these guys are really doing a nice job?   
TOMMY REES:   Yeah, we had some good run looks that we could take advantage of.   Up front we did a great job blocking them out.   Obviously, the running game was pretty good.
