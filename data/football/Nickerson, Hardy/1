California - 22  Stanford - 35
Q. What did you think of your team's tackling today?
HARDY NICKERSON: They had the long screen pass where we missed a few tackles.  We got to get better at that.  We got one more game against Arizona State.  We got to send the seniors off right on Senior Day, their last day at Memorial Stadium.  So we're looking forward to practicing hard this week and getting after it.
Q. What do you think about the progress that you guys have been making so far?
HARDY NICKERSON: We made progress since last year, but at the same time, we had some third downs, third and shorts where you got to get off the field.  They were extending drives, 12 play drives, controlling the clock, and so any time you get in a situation like that you want to get off the field as fast as possible.
Q. You heard a lot about McCaffrey.  Facing him, what did you think?
HARDY NICKERSON: Great player.  Very patient, waits on his blocks and can explode in his space and make people miss.  That kick return too, elusive and can run.
Q. Was it frustrating that despite all the progress, when you're done it's sort of the same result as the last two years?
HARDY NICKERSON: Yeah, it always hurts losing, especially when you try to play as hard as you can.  Big game, we wanted to get the Axe bad as bad as possible.  It hurts.  But we got one more game in the regular season and we're looking forward to bouncing back with that.
