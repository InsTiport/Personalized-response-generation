<p>	Q.  Can you both just talk about how exciting it is to officially get the word? </p>

<p>	Q.  Explain how that will obviously give you a lot of attention, but especially for you in your home town.  Does that add a little bit to the whole thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  And just last year when you got the Bowl bid, a lot of things happened right afterwards.  What's the difference between right now going in knowing how you're playing and just the situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  I had a question for Brandon on that same note.  You came here in the fall of 2001 on the heels of Notre Dame getting blown out in the Fiesta Bowl on national television, so how important is it for you to leave a really strong positive legacy for not only the guys who are staying but for the kids who are coming in, high school seniors who might be watching Notre Dame on TV?</p>
<p>	Q.  For both guys, have you had a chance to see Ohio State play this year on television, and what are your impressions of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, did you get a chance to see them at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious if either of you two were aware as the days got closer before you jumped into the top six if you heard, "do they really deserve to be in the BCS," if you heard that and what you thought about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, coming from the Columbus area, are there guys on the Ohio State team that you know, that you played against at the high school level? </p>
<p>	Q.  I guess being from that area, how would you describe kind of the nature of Notre Dame and Ohio State?  Not necessarily a rivalry but something a lot of fans like to talk about. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, going a little bit off topic if you don't mind, talk about post-season awards after the season is over.  Can you talk a little bit about -- when you first started hearing your name pop up as a Heisman candidate and what your thoughts are on the whole thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a certain point when you first heard your name?  I was under the impression you were on the Heisman watch list, but was there a time when your name started popping up where you were like, wow, people are starting to notice? </p>
<p>	Q.  And one of the things last year was when you had big games a lot of times you didn't do so well.  This year you performed well in big games for Notre Dame.  Was it something that you learned, or what was the difference between last year's big games and this year's big games? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the pressure.  The success of this year is going to put a lot of pressure on next year's team.  That's just the way of Notre Dame, and Coach Holtz talked about it the other night.  What does that mean for you next year going in with the focus of a Heisman favorite with guys that are --</p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, how heavily recruited were you by Ohio State, and when it came down to it how much interest did you have in considering them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was that a difficult decision?  You said you were a fan as a kid growing up.  Was that a difficult decision to turn your back on the team that you followed growing up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you name one or two deciding factors why you chose Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, how aware are you of the bold streak Notre Dame is on and is that something Coach Weis has talked about with you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, as far as the Bowl streak, seven straight for Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to just ask, obviously talking about post-season awards, there's been a little bit of chatter towards the ends of the season that Brady Quinn is making Maurice Stovall and Jeff Samardzija look good while Maurice Stovall and Jeff Samardzija are making Brady Quinn look good.  How gratifying has it been to see your two targets come into their own this year and all three of you are getting post-season award talk?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are either of you tempted to look back and think about the possibility that was really there to be 11-0 with the two losses by five, six points, or is it totally looking forward and not looking back? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point during the season that you realized you could be a BCS team because obviously at the beginning of the year people weren't very high on you guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sitting here right now, was this the scenario that you saw before the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon, you talked about going out, the fifth year guys kind of putting a stamp on things.  Do you kind of look at this as like the signature game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, when you were growing up over there did you go to a lot of games at Ohio State, and could you talk about how big a fans or how passionate they are about Ohio State football over there?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wondered if you could talk on the match-ups in this game.  A lot of people are going to talk about Notre Dame's offense against Ohio State, their strong defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, did you attend the Notre Dame-Ohio State game in '95 in Columbus? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember those games at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if either of you could talk about whether you watched any of the games yesterday and how much interest you had because you probably were going to be in a BCS game.  Were you watching them from that perspective? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brady, just wondering if it surprises you, looking through the years, these programs have only met four times.  Considering they're bordering space, just wondering if that surprises you and if it'll be fun to play two Midwest teams that never play each other, to be a part of that?</p>
