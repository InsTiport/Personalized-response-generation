		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How has the experience been?
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   It's been great, fun.   Kind of know the drill. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   In some ways, it seems like I got here yesterday.   When you think of the road travelled over the last five years, it's been pretty significant. 
Obviously you try and suppress your emotions so you can get the task at hand done every day.   Trying to do everything I can to give every little last nugget that I can during this last week, from off‑the‑field suggestions, How to carry yourself, I think the world of you guys, take this advice, however you feel it applies, and go from there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Quite honestly, got some good advice from Chris throughout the course of this deal.   I've been up front and honest about everything going on once Coach Bielema took the job at Arkansas.   Everything from Coach Alvarez as the interim, how it's handled with assistants, because they don't know how it works. 
At some point, an assistant is going to have a choice to hang on and hope or have a bird in the hand.   I've had those conversations with them the whole time, always been honest and up front with them.   That's made it good.   It's allowed them to take a breath, realize what's going on, focus in on the task at hand.   I think they've handled it like champs. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Well, I really do like the concept.   I think it's fitting.   You look at it and realize, all the other stuff, there's nothing you can do about it when you're working.   Just focus on the job, what you're doing at the time.   I think it's good.   Not just do the job, but do your job well.   I think the timing of it was really well. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Well, it's funny you say that.   If you really look at the Big Ten, it's got a lot more spread.   You look at our schedule this year, really the only power‑style teams we played were Michigan State and Penn State. 
Stanford is really good at what they do.   Like you said, they dress it up, shift, different styles of formations that you have to do a good job of getting a line to. 
Bottom line, when you boil it down, they're very good on a front side double‑team, backside guard pole and on down that path.   Really good at what they do.   We have the utmost respect for that because that's what we feel like we are. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   I think they both carry a large amount of confidence onto the field.   You can feel it from both of them.   Coach Alvarez has shortened the practices down.   Beyond that, both of them allowed us to do our jobs. 
There's a lot more similarities than differences.   The thing is, you have a guy stepping in as the interim who clearly knows what he's doing, which I think is not a common situation. 
He's been here, done this, so he can step right in and become Coach Alvarez, which is unique.   Obviously, there's not many places that have that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Without a doubt, we've done Disneyland, The Improv, the Beef Bowl, which are all great events.   The kids want to go out of here and finish this season. 
A lot of the guys, we've talked about it, comparing to the Giants who were 9‑7, end up winning the Super Bowl.   If we win this, it wipes away a lot of things that you could have done better here or there.   And that's the goal, to win. 

Q.   (No microphone.). 
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   That's funny to hear him say that.   It's true.   You can feel that.   They make the announcements about what the next event is.   The kids shrug their shoulders, We got a coach, we're good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Without a doubt.   Their defense is aligned against every formation we've shown from an offensive standpoint.   We've done the same against their offense. 
The similarities are in some ways comical.   Similar play style, similar play calls.   A lot of different styles of formations.   We'll have a line to all of them.   What new things are they going to present on the 1st? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Yeah, to a degree.   Haven't seen this style of offense for five years.   I remember a couple years ago, I don't want to quote it, but they were in the Orange Bowl.   When I was watching them shift trade motion and run power, I chuckled a couple years ago.   Here we are playing against them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Yeah, the thing you see is if a team has success, you see teams try and copy that single play.   If we have an answer to that play, you know, we've been fortunate that they haven't had a lot to go to. 
We've gone back through the year, looked at plays that have been challenging for us.   Made sure that even if Stanford didn't run that play, we've at least gotten practice on it to refresh our guys. 
We have seen a lot of teams do things out of their character. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Without a doubt.   Yeah, without a doubt.   He's got the vision.   He can sit up there and see all 22 moving pieces in one rep.   That's a gift, yeah.   It is a gift.   We're all blessed to have him upstairs seeing all those things because our adjustments have been quick. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   It helps because we've been together so long that everything I say, we are all talking the same language, which sounds simple, but it really isn't. 
When you can, in one sentence, describe a shift formation play and everyone in that group understands everything you just said, you're a long ways to having a chance for success.   Nobody lagging.   Not only that, but they understand the line.   When you have that kind of foundation and understanding, then those adjustments are like that (snapping fingers). 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   I do.   I do.   Got great advice from Chris and followed it.   Been very open and up front with the players from the very beginning, how it's handled with us.   There's a time of uncertainty, but we're with you.   Guys are going to have to take jobs elsewhere during that time of uncertainty.   Very open with them about the new coaching staff.   I think they're going to be around today.   I reached out to the new D‑line coach.   Got his number.   I care so much about these kids, all I care about is a smooth transition. 

Q.   Did you get ahold of him?
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   I did.   Didn't talk to him, but exchanged messages. 

Q.   (No microphone.). 
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   There was never a time I felt like there was anger.   The world we live in, we're tied to a head coach, a head coach's decision, or a university's decision about a head coach.   That's the world we live in. 
I played non‑scholarship football.   I'm sitting on a stage at the Rose Bowl.   C'mon.   I've been very blessed.   Loved every minute I've had here, will love the last few days I have here. 
I think everyone recognizes that the same way.   Just continue to handle our business and really be Wisconsin because Wisconsin is on solid foundation. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   They have rolled with it.   There's times where they've come in and just wanted to ask why, why this, why that, what's the timing, what do you feel about this. 
They just want someone to explain to them what's going on as it's going on, and they deserve that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Well, he's really good.   He's a solid blocker, physical, does a nice job at the point of attack.   You can see the time they've invested into the run plays.   You're tired of hearing it, but just like us, they invest time in their fundamentals because they're fundamentally good.   Really respect this team for that. 
A lot of teams it's gadget‑type stuff, run sideways.   It's about fundamentals. 
In the pass game, really can use his body to the advantage.   Has long levers.   Can go up and take the ball over defenders' heads.   He's a challenge. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Oh, yeah.   He just went up and took it.   They're really good, really good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Well, if you look at the top six, you could go top 10 defensive linemen, right, they're all back.   They're obviously going to have to piece that together within their scheme, but you have to feel pretty good about the front. 
I think defensive backs, you have some kids that are developing, in position to take over for Shelton and Devin that aren't quite there yet.   There's things there they'll want to develop hard in the spring. 
Mike Taylor is a big hit at the linebacker position, but the other two back, with having that many guys back up front, you should have a chance to have success. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Just suppressing the emotions.   Don't want to think about the obvious until after the game.   Getting the task at hand done. 
I'm glad we've been here before so you don't have all that added, What's next, what are we doing, what's the Beef Bowl.   That has helped keep things on task. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Sure they do.   At the end of the day, it's execution.   Hopefully, those guys feeling that way, us having shorter practices, all the things you've heard from everyone you talked to, helps us execute on the 1st.   Ultimately ‑ I'm speaking the obvious here ‑ end of the day, you have to perform on game day. 
I will say this, coming out from the locker room from the Nebraska game, the buildup, you probably heard this from people involved, I knew we had a great chance.   The kids have handled all the potential distractions as good as you could possibly hope right now.   They've been unbelievable. 
They know you're in as a coach, they're in your meeting, in your practice.   They're all in.   Proud of 'em. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHARLIE PARTRIDGE:   Execution and quarterback play is big.   Curt has done a nice job of not hurting the football team.   Credit him for that. 
What happens with him and Joel...
