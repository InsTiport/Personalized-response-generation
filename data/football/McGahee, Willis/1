<p>	Q.  Willis, a long night?  You look tired, buddy.</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you getting tired of this press conference after press conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  So how do you push through that?  You know the routine, right?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ken, could you talk about  -- could you address the great players that have come before, particularly the quarterbacks and what it feels like being part of that continuum of excellence there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a lot of interaction with the former players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ken, what has Larry meant to you, how would describe him from your standpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  What bothers him besides maybe a bad practice; is that really the only thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Willis, was the Virginia Tech game your most memorable or the run against Pittsburgh this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why?</p>

<p>	Q.  How different is Romberg off the field?</p>

<p>	Q.  Ken, how much has he helped you, Brett?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ken, looking at Ohio State's defensive line, is there anything you have to do differently preparing with this match-up with the Buckeyes and the regular season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see Brett's comments on TV and the paper, and is there a favorite one you had from the season?</p>



<p>	Q.  Yesterday, Willis said it was up to you how many yards he gets and you decide each game.  How many yards is he going to get?</p>
<p>	Q.  Vernon, another question for you.  One of Ohio State's player compared the preparations for this bowl game to Groundhog Day; wake up, it's the same thing over and over again.  Is the monotony and repetition beginning to take its toll or does it have an effect at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ken, can you address that as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ken, what do you think you're going to miss most about college?</p>
<p>	Q.  Vernon how do you compare your experiences this year as compared to last year and your different roles?</p>
<p>	Q.  We hear about speed and Miami's speed.  Would you talk about Miami's speed?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys don't look too nervous what do you think?</p>



<p>	Q.  Can each of you say your New Year's resolution?</p>
