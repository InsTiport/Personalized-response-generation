Washington - 14  Stanford - 31


COACH PETERSON: Tough game.  It was a good football team we played.  They executed at a very high level in all three phases.  We can't get anything going in the first half offensively, and it just puts too much stress on everybody else.  It makes it a very, very hard game.  Second half got a little something going, but they're a good team that can answer right away, which they did.  Put us back on our heels.
