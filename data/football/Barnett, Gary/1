 Q.  Coach, early on you guys put together a couple play drives.  How big a momentum changes are those with the fumble -- 


 Q.  Gary, your team looked very good up until the beginning of November.  Can you pinpoint what exactly happened? 


 Q.  Gary, you have been able to see Vince Young twice now at his very best.  Can you talk a little bit about what a special player he is? 


 Q.  Gary, the play that Joel was knocked out on, they are up 70-3, does that surprise you any at all? 


 Q.  Gary, what was the message at half time?  It was out of control then? 


 Q.  Joe, can you comment a little bit about what Coach said about the team's psyche after the Iowa State game and if you felt the same way? 


 Q.  Gary, what do you do now as far as giving time off and trying to get that mental edge back, short-term plans? 


 Q.  Gary, I guess, just since you brought that up, the first thing is there probably still is a bowl.  Do you think you can get your team back in mental shape.  The bigger one is, in the last week there seems there was a little gallows humor because of the task you faced.  Was it even possible getting these guys to think they even had a chance in this game? 


 Q.  Coach, if you had a vote for the Heisman today, would it be for Number 10 on the other side over there?
