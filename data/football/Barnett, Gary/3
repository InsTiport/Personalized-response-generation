<p>	Q.  Gary from the Austin America.  Given that so many Big 12 teams are having -- aren't settled in quarterbacks going into the season, how much of a luxury is it to have somebody that is definitely number one, some guy you trust? </p>

<p>	Q.  Houston Chronicle, you mentioned about Big 12 championship and being in Oklahoma. Can you just talk a little bit about there was a gap between the two divisions in terms of the teams and the talent level, or do you not feel that way at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  For all three players, can you all discuss having survived and even thrived in the chaos that was off-field last year, that situation, how you got through it as a team and as an individual. </p>


<p>	Q.  Fox Sports Net, players, offense and defense, what things are you working on, one or two things you are working on to improve from last season's performances? </p>


<p>	Q.  Gary, you boys played a hard non-conference schedule.  (Inaudible) is this good for college football to see these other schools with a watered-down schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Randy Riggs from Austin. For Joel, could you follow up a little bit talking about improvement in the efficiency of the passing game?  Were you talking just about completion percentage or what exactly do you mean by that?</p>
