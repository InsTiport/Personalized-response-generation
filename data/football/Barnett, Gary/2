<p>	Q.  Coach, one thing you said in your news conference the other day is you wanted to see how practice went to catch the collective mind-set of the team and the emotional level coming off the last couple weeks.  Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, if you could just talk about your talk on whether or not the conference championships games are a good idea.  You have been able to use them to your advantage.  Some coaches have expressed they don't like them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, I was wondering if you can discuss your kicking game and just the offense suddenly that it can generate and how you can change field positions so quickly. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, this championship game has been marred by a lot of upsets over the course of the years.  Why do you think that is, and also, why do you feel you guys have been able to thrive in the underdog role a couple times in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think your players may revel in the sort of shock-the-world scenario everyone is talking about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, earlier this year you talked about the level of athlete quarterback in this league with McNeil and Brad Smith and Vince Young.  I'm wondering, is Vince Young even on a higher level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you see this as a game in which it's going to be particularly important to play well early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, you said on one of the conference calls earlier this week, I think it sounded like there was some degree of certainty you expected Crosby to be back next year.  Have you talked to him about this?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you watched the 2001 game on the bus.  Can you talk about why you did that and what kind of reaction you got from your players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what does your team have to do differently from that October 15th match-up to be successful?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your school returned a lot of tickets and the estimates -- the earlier estimates are that there could be as many as 60,000 fans that are in orange and white and not too many in gold.  How difficult is that for your team and were you disappointed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, with the roof closed creating more noise than normal for a road situation, is there anything you can do to prepare for that and how do you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, I was wondering if you saw anything in the Texas A&amp;M game that you can put together, and also wonder how you feel about a 9th conference game possibility?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gary, how did they tell you about the roof?  What was the explanation for the roof being closed?</p>
