<p>	Q.  Were you surprised the that Zac Tubbs was named a second-time All SEC after the bad injury last year.  What do you expect out of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Matt Jones.   Plans now at quarterback, confidence in that situation, concerns?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe you voted on the coaches poll.  Talk about that process, how detailed that's for you each week to do and do you like that format, is that the correct way to determine a National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you, going back to losing Matt Jones, talk about the challenge now and the kind of the turning point if that's the a right phrase for your program to get back to a Bowl Game and beyond without Matt Jones, and then after describing that, if you would talk about Robert Johnson, some of the others competing for that position?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Auburn going 13 and 0 last year and not getting a shot at a National Championship, first question is, do you ever imagine an undefeated SEC team that would not get a shot at a National Championship and do you think that maybe it's time to change the system and go to a Playoff because you were in 1-AA where you did have a Playoff system?</p>
<p>	Q.  With all the focus on quarterback and replacing that how about other areas of your offense and specifically who are you expecting to get more contribution there now or where you are going to be successful on the off side?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Monk, he seems to be an intriguing target, how is he's so big.  Talk about some of the things he does?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up one, with the 12th game is the season getting too long when you included postseason and two, being the coaches voter should the coaches polls be released weekly instead of just at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year in your five SEC losses you gave up 181 points.  Have a new coordinator on the defensive side this year.  How do you see the defense being different this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about De'Arrius Howard, he's kind of had an up-and-down career.  Do you expect more consistency from him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the Southern Cal game in week three, how concerned are you with too much focus placed on that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about this season and do you see this being a very pivotal season considering you got off to a great bowl run that did come to an end last year. </p>
