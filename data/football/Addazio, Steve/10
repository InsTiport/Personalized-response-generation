STEVE ADDAZIO: Just to get started here today we had a great day yesterday, had a chance to learn some things and had a chance to get some things together, move them forward for Louisville, improve on a couple of areas. We're excited about it. Our team is excited about it, our staff is excited about it, can't wait to get down there and play this game and continue to grow as a team.   
Happy to answer any questions.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: I mean, no different than when we traveled a week ago in terms of we had a road trip, we have a schedule, and, you know, the way we approach things in terms of being on the road and just to, you know, understand when you go on the road you have to pack your defense, you have to pack your run game, and, you know, you have to be able to go into to the game and be a physical football team and all of the things we talk about weekly really. Nothing different.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: I mean, there's always an emphasis. That's standard operating procedure. I mean, you got to get off the field on third down and we're going to work real, real hard on both sides of the ball. That's it. Just period. End. You know, it is very important, and we'll work hard to make sure that we're off the field and stay on on offense and get off on defense.   
 Q.  Are there any considerations you're thinking of Isaiah, of possibly redshirting him at this point?  
STEVE ADDAZIO: No. Not necessarily.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: The red shirt rule, you play four. In theory he still has four to play and still has a redshirt year. Right now at this point we're just interested in him getting back to 100%..   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Well, that's an injury situation there. I don't know that I know all the facts there. Whose hurt, whose not hurt. They had a bye week, didn't play last week. It is just hard for me to know, you know.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. Tanner is fine. Tanner is fine. They were, you know, cramps. Yeah.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: I do. Yeah. I thought that was what do you want to call that? A red stamp game for him. I mean, he crashed on to the scene as a dominant tailback with some of the runs he had and the way he flung a couple of defenders off. That was a big day for him down there for sure. Yeah.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. When you put together a run game, you want to attack it, inside, offside, off tackle. You have to tackle all quadrants of the field in a run game. We felt during that game they were giving us opportunities outside. We ran inside as well, you know, we wanted to kind of spread that out and have different attack points in the run game. That's something we do each week.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: High.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Anthony played very, very well in that game. He was 14 16 at half, and he finished very, very strong. I mean, his overall completion percentage at the end of the day was excellent. I thought he made some really good decisions.   
Obviously the first interception we had, he would like back, we would all like back. You know, those things happen.   
In the body of the game, I thought he played very, very well confident, very well, made some big plays and some big, big throws.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. Yeah. 100%, that's right. That's accurate.   
I think as you described it, I think the word would be consistency, how important the consistency factor is because, you know, when you're inconsistent it opens the door for problems on either side of the ball and it leads to negative yardage on offense and explosive plays when you're on defense. You know, so I think we want to be sure to do our best there and stay on schedule on both sides. We have been on schedule on offense, but stay on schedule on defense and don't have too many dribble yards because that leads to third and shorts.   
Third and 1 and 2, if you're in third and 1 and 2, that's a plus for the opposing offense, they should convert third and 1 to 2. So you want to stay out of that.   
You want to keep yourself on pace as best you can. You don't want to get behind the sticks in defense, and you don't want to get behind the sticks in offense and have a bunch of third and longs.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. Yeah. They're very athletic. I mean, a lot of these are veteran players. I'm really impressed, you know, I just really, really am impressed with what they have done down there.   
Their staff has done a fabulous job with their team fundamentally, with their team discipline. I think they're playing fast. I think they're playing aggressive. I mean, they have got quality players all over the field. They have great athleticism and great speed. I'm very, very impressed with them.   
The direct result, you know, of their staff, their head coach and staff, I mean, they're there. They did a great job at App State. I even watched some App State film this week and watched that team ,and I was like whoa. I mean, that's a well coached operation. He's going to do a fantastic job there, and is an excellent football coach and you can see the reflection of that in their team already.   
There was never a lack of talent there. That wasn't the case. So they're playing really well. You know, quarterback is a duel threat guy, you know, speed at the tailback, speed at the receiver, defense is big and can run. You know, back end, extremely athletic, great space tacklers. Very, very impressed with his football team, and they're only going to get better, They had a bye week last week. I anticipate they're only going to improve.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. I mean, I think absolutely stay in the moment. I'm not worried about the calendar at all. It is just stay in the moment because that's where it is right now.   
There's a lot of great football to be played, and we're going to be a part of that. We're looking forward to it.   
We have been to some really competitive good games, and we're just anxious to continue to improve and we'll do that.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Well, John is very athletic. I think he too is growing. We haven't been able to practice him as much as we would like to. I think John's done a great job. I think he like everybody else, we have got to continue to, you know, play within the structure and be detailed in everything we're doing. I think he and Max can make those athletic plays and we have seen those on display. I think, again, like everybody, we have to work on consistency.
