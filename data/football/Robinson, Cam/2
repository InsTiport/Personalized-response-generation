Q. Probably watched a lot of tape on Washington, what do you see as kind of the biggest challenge that they pose to you guys?
CAM ROBINSON: From watching tape on them, what I have noticed is that, you know, they're kind of big on the inside.  So I think they use their big inside guys to kind of stop and kind of clog up whatever you have going on with the inside runs.
And, you know, on the outside, that's where they have more of their team speed at, so they kind of let those outside guys run around and make plays.  That's what I notice from them.
They're ball hawks, also.  They force a lot of turnovers.  I think they're first in forcing turnovers.  We're just going to have to take care of the ball.
Q. Do they remind you of anybody else you've seen on tape this year, anybody you've played this year or any other year?
CAM ROBINSON: They favor a few different teams in the things they do, but they've had -- I'm not even sure how many.  They've had a few weeks to prepare for us so I'm sure they'll come out with some stuff we haven't seen before.
