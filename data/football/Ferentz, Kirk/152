KIRK FERENTZ: It was another really tough football game for our football team to be involved in, and just thrilled to get a good team victory.  It was something we talked to our guys about, playing good team football.  When we play well, we have to be doing that, and I think certainly the sequence at the end of the second quarter there right before half was illustrative of the way everybody working off each other, Dillon Kidd had a tremendous day punting the football all day long, but dropped it down there and the defense got a good stop.  We got the tip on the punt, and the offense took it and put it in the end zone, so it was a really good sequence to end that first half.
