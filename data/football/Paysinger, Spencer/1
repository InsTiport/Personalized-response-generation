   SPENCER PAYSINGER: We call it a Fuji type play. We do our Fuji period during practice. It is a hurry-up offense. We are not standing around waiting for the call and getting our lineup. We are trying to do a play every 7 to 10 seconds.  
  
  Q. The differences between SEC football and Pac-10, do you buy into that? Is there a distinction between the two?   
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: I think the perspective of it is the SEC is the premiere conference, the power running that they dominate every other conference. And the Pac-10 is the little brother to the other conferences and have a little more finesse and spread people out.  
 I feel like our teams can play with anybody.  
  
  Q. Everybody has asked you about Oregon, things people should know about Oregon. What do you know about Alabama and Auburn, the university, the state?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: Not much to tell you the truth, not much. I know my friend goes to Auburn. She has been talking a lot of smack lately.  
  
  Q. What is she saying?   
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: That Cam is going to run over me, just a lot of things. I went to elementary school with her since I was 6 years old.   
  
  Q. What's her name?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: Heather Horn.  
  
  Q. Have you talked to her recently in the last couple days?   
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: I talk to her almost every week. She is still -- she graduated, but she is still at school there, heading up some Greek Life stuff.   
 So we definitely have a little pow-wow.  
  
  Q. Is she coming to the game?   
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: No.  
  
  Q. How do you prepare from being tight in this game?   
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: It goes by preparation. We feel if you know everything -- if you know what you are supposed to do and how you are supposed to do it, that was supposed to take the pressure off naturally.   
 If you don't know what you are doing, then you are tense on what's to come. We know that in certain formations, they do certain plays, certain receivers are in certain places, that certain plays will happen.  
  
  Q. What's the mood of the team?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: Really loose.   
  
  Q. Is it?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: Really loose. We get out there and practice, a lot of people jumping around. We have the music blaring. It is not so much that the game's in five days so we have to buckle down. We know we are a good team.   
 We know our school works well offensively, defensively and special teams-wise. It is just going out there to play the game.  
  
  Q. How much did you see them play during the year? Did you get to catch many of their games?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: I was able to watch the later half of the LSU game, the whole game with Alabama and just the highlights of the SEC championship against South Carolina.  
  
  Q. Were you sort of thinking -- you guys were sort of that on that collision course, you guys and Auburn?  
 SPENCER PAYSINGER: Truthfully, I won't lie, in the back of my head, I did think we were going to see them down the line. A lot of people were talking about Cam Newton and everything. It kind of felt right that these teams were going to clash at the end.
