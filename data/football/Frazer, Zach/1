 Q. It seems like you guys are really comfortable playing in close games, they are decide in the last couple minutes. 
 ZACH FRAZER: As a player I rather it be a blowout. I know as a fan, everyone likes the overtime win and all the excitement and stuff like that. But we seem to find a way to win and, okay, we had to make it close a majority of the time. I guess it is just how we do things.

 Q. It seems like teams who get here have to figure out a way to win close games. That's the difference between teams that are playing this week. Is that something that developed throughout the season? 
 ZACH FRAZER: I feel like we never -- even if we're down or if we are losing, we never really look at, okay, there's no shot we can't come back. And when the game is on the line, I feel like a lot of players on the team step up. Everyone is after the football. It is not like, okay, I don't want to deal with this, I'm too nervous. 
 We realize, you know -- we had a couple big fourth-down conversions during the season that were key during the game. A lot of the players get together and just rally around them.
