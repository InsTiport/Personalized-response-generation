Washington - 14  Stanford - 31

COACH SHAW: First of all, I think our guys played really well.  Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  A lot of things we could have done better.  But some of it had to do with Washington.  Washington is a very, very underrated football team, and I'm not just saying that because we won the game tonight.
