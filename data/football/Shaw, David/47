DAVID SHAW: Outstanding job tonight.  First of all, I commend the staff putting together a really good game plan for our guys.  Our guys going out there and playing really well.  Playing hard, playing aggressive.  Not playing perfectly, of course, but effort makes up for mistakes.  That's the way our guys played today.
