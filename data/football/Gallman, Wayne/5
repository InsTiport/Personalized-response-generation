Clemson - 56, Boston College - 10
Q. You're in some elite company at Clemson, tying the record for most 100-yard rushing games.  You'll break it the next time.  How does it feel to be right there on the verge of having the record to yourself?
WAYNE GALLMAN: Man, it feels good, but there's so much more I want to accomplish.  I feel like I've still got a long way to go.
Q. Dabo said this was the best game -- do you feel like offensively this was your cleanest game?
WAYNE GALLMAN: Yeah, very, no turnovers except Ray-Ray's punt return.  But yeah, we done a really good job.  Everyone was really securing the ball and being smart with it.
Q. What did Dabo tell y'all at the half?  Seemed like you picked it up at halftime.
WAYNE GALLMAN: One thing from the past few weeks we haven't played as well as we have in the first half, so he really challenged us to come out and really finish the game and make this the best second half that we've played all season.
Q. How big have these last two games been for you, especially since teams have really been gearing up to stop the run?
WAYNE GALLMAN: Preparation has been my key.  Prayer has been my key.  People have been really coming to try to stop the run, and I think I have to respect that, so I've got to take my opportunities and maximize them.  So it's been really big.
