 Q.  Pretty good start back after a pretty tough game for you.  
JAMES QUICK: Absolutely.  I just felt like I had to just step up and make plays.  My team, they count on me to make plays, so I've just got to come out here and make plays every game.   
 Q.  Coach said you worked really hard in practice.  
JAMES QUICK: Absolutely.  I tried to emphasize looking the ball in and watching it to my tuck every time.  It really helped me today.   
 Q.  How much was the focus different all week for everybody?  
JAMES QUICK: We really stepped up a level because our focus wasn't where it needed to be last week, so this week we just wanted to come out and really just show everybody what we could do.   
 Q.  What were your thoughts after the reunion game, first quarter of the reunion for you personally?  
JAMES QUICK: Just trying to stay focused and just to keep my team into the game.  Really that's the only thing that was going through my mind, just trying to help the team.   
 Q.  The way Lamar delivered it today, he kind of made it look easy.  Was this one of his better games?  
JAMES QUICK: Oh, yeah.  He's a great player.  Having him as a quarterback, it's always fun.  You always look to expect new things from him, and with him throwing it the way he's been throwing it lately, it's fun to be a receiver in this offense.   
 Q.  And to make the diving catch, a very difficult catch, was that a satisfying feeling for you?  
JAMES QUICK: It was fun.  Like I said, I was just trying to make a play.  I seen the ball, and it was a little far, but I just went to go get it.
