  Q. Coach, you lose two games in one week and now 11 in a row. What was the key to this team and this turnaround to what happened here tonight?  
 COACH BEAMER: Well, we got a lot of good kids, a lot of great character kids, and they let us back. We went right back to work, they let us back and thank goodness we have a tremendous quarterback, Tyrod Taylor. He made some great plays for us tonight. We don't always play well but we always play hard, and I that I kind of says it all for our football team here tonight. Defensively we gave up some plays but we were after them and playing hard.  
  
  Q. Specifically about Tyrod, he made some incredible escapes and then was able to find some wide-open players. Talk about that a little bit.   
 COACH BEAMER: That's him. Like I said, he gives you a chance to win every Saturday. We're fortunate to have had Michael Vick at Virginia Tech. We're fortunate to have Tyrod Taylor. Over there on the sideline, you get that feeling that the next play could be a big play.  
  
  Q. Florida State led the league in scoring defense. How were you able to come out here tonight and put 44 points up?   
 COACH BEAMER: Well, we had some great execution, had one pass route in the game and some problems, hit Danny Coale two or three times, and I thought just played some good execution, good play calling, good plays.   
  
  Q. They've had your number since you've been at Virginia Tech. You've only one once again these guys. What does it feel like tonight?  
 COACH BEAMER: Well, it feels like an ACC Championship and that's the important thing. I don't really care who's on the other side, as long as we can get that ACC Championship, that means a lot to us.  
  
  Q. You've won some of these now, and how does this rank with your ACC Championships you've won before?  
 COACH BEAMER: It's right up there. Those two losses we had at the beginning of the year makes these 11 wins and the ACC Championship seem even greater. We're very appreciative, and I like these kids, I like what they're all about.
