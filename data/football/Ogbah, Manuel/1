		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   The selfie thing is a big deal now this year. 
EMMANUEL OGBAH:   It was great.   We had a lot of fans coming in, taking selfies, all that.   It was a lot of fun. 

Q.   Gundy started dancing.   Now every coach comes in the locker room doing that. 
EMMANUEL OGBAH:   That wasn't the first time we seen that.   We've been seeing that since last year. 

Q.   What do you call it?
EMMANUEL OGBAH:   The Gundy dance, I guess. 

Q.   What song would you put it to if you had to? 
EMMANUEL OGBAH:   I don't know. 

Q.   How about Get Low?
EMMANUEL OGBAH:   That's a good thing. 
We normally clap while he dances.   Goes off of the beat, so...
