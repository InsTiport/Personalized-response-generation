  Q. Describe what kind of back Malcolm is.   
 DAVID SNOW: Malcolm hits the hole very hard. He's very big and physical back and he's very fast. You know, he brings that extra dimension to the team.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 DAVID SNOW: I am. I've still got a bad taste in my mouth from the last time we were there, so it'll be good to go back there.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 DAVID SNOW: Well, sure it did. You know, any time that you lose in this home stadium to any team for that matter, it's really hard, so I'm looking forward to it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 DAVID SNOW: You know, the game plan changed a little bit after that. We decided to run the ball more. You know, Coach Harsin did a great job with that. He gave us plays to win the game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 DAVID SNOW: I mean, it really doesn't matter who's back there. We're going to do our job, and it'll just be fun.   
  
  Q. Do you think back to that national title game, how it all unfolded?  
 DAVID SNOW: You know, I really do believe that you learn from the past, you learn from the history and you learn from your mistakes. You know, it was really a bad thing what happened there with the whole Colt getting hurt and stuff. I mean, I don't go back and just think about it too much. It is what it is. It was a loss, so just got to learn from it and move on. That's what we did.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 DAVID SNOW: You know, there's not a really good answer for that. I don't know. We keep working at it and working at it and this is a new offense, so it'll keep on getting better and better, and we're working for that, and it'll get there.
