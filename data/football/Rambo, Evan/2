 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: It started off weird. I was a little bit misaligned to where I was supposed to be.   
Running back moved out, so Jordon just covered the vertical, # 3, so I just kind of played the quarterback's eyes, dropped back deep enough where if anything happens I can still break on him running or break on a pass. He didn't see me at all. He looked at one target, just broke on the ball, tried to take it and ran as far as I could.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: It was good. It is not something I like to do. You just want to be out there playing with your brothers and playing football as much as possible.   
It was fun. It was a great atmosphere. A great game to try to come back to, ultracompetitive. It was fun.   
 Q.  Does it give you a different perspective when you can watch how the defense works, you know, for a few games where you're not having to worry about your assignment? Can you actually learn more about the defense in that?  
EVAN RAMBO: You learn more about how each part is integral to everybody else having success, and just more about the trust factor that our defense is under when we're playing.   
Just seeing my position, just learning more about what I can do with the opposing offense, what they're trying to do. It was a good learning experience, even being out.   
 Q.  As far as a defensive unit, how do you take the fast starts you get off to?  
EVAN RAMBO: I mean, it is just consistency. It is just a mental focus that we have to continue to carry on.   
Physically we have it. Really it is just understanding that we have to be locked in for the second half.   
Offense is going to make adjustments, a lot of what we do in the first half may not work sometimes. We have to make those adjustments and be able to continue to have our own mental success and our own focus going in.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: It is not the noise. I mean, it is just something within each person. It is just something you have to do. You have to find that mental focus regardless of what's going on. It is not a lot of just factors around it. It is just locking in, as simple as that.   
 Q.  (Question).  
STEVE ADDAZIO: Yeah. I think we moved on well. We try to put it behind us. If we haven't, I mean, it is urgent that we do. We know what happened. We're not going to get that win back. The results aren't going to change. If we're still focused on Baylor and they're focused on us, we're behind the 8 ball. It is time for us to lock on Iowa State and prepare for them as much as possible.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: A good arm. A good quarterback. We have been dealing with that a lot of all of this year. We have been prepared, you know, how to handle that.   
They also have the run factor in there too.   
One of our biggest things is making sure we stop the run. I mean, he's a good quarterback. We're going to respect him. We're not going to fear him at all.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: I mean, he's good. I mean, I ask him questions even when I'm on the field about some things, what to do. He's a great athlete. He's knowledgeable, he knows where to be. He knows where the ball is going to be. He plays fast and physical. He's a great player just to be with and just even to learn from, seeing what he sees and how he kind of approaches line movements, quarterback plays, things like that. He's a great person to learn from and just pick his mind on what he's doing.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: We just have to make sure we have a strong edge. We try to force everything through the middle. We try to force some things that get lost into our edge of our defense. We have to stay strong.   
When we have position to make tackles, we have to believe able to wrap up. We can't let running backs or even quarterbacks escape on us.   
That's what we have been seeing from the quarterbacks all year. The biggest runs we have had have been quarterback scrambles throughout the year. We have to make sure when we have the opportunity to stop them, gain, capitalize on those.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: We were just saying what we do, how many takeaways we have had so far, we always have a goal of 3 or more in a game. We're just tracking how many takeaways, how many 3 and outs we're doing just so we know. It is what we're doing. We're not done. We're not satisfied. It is what we still have to accomplish in the game.   
 Q.  (Question).  
EVAN RAMBO: Yeah. ItÂ’s weird! I don't know -- he just comes out of nowhere sometimes!.   
That's just a testament to his preparation and his technique. He's a good player. He knows where to be, where the quarterback is and he capitalizes on his opportunities.   
Someone like him, he's really technically sound. He's a great athlete. He's able to watch a ton of film, knows where the quarterback will be, knows where the routes will be, where the receiver will be. His preparation has just led him to be able to take over like that.
