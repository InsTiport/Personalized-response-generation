Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: It's fun, man.  I rode two rides, didn't do more than that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah, I went on the cars ride and then I think it was Toy Story.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: It was good fun, man.  I mean, we had the opportunity to go to Disneyland.  We had the opportunity to go to Improv, The Beef Bowl.  We have had a lot of fun.  (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I don't know if it's a benefit.  I think it may be makes it harder, man, because you've got to put a lot more focus into yourself and the team to make sure that you're continually getting better, and obviously I think that's one of the more difficult parts.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Um, man, you know, they got a ton of great talent, a lot of depth.  They play very hard, coached very well.  Man, they're in the playoffs for a reason.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Uh-huh.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yep.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Um, just continue to do our jobs.  It's not going to take anything extravagant.  We have to do just continue to do our jobs and be aggressive.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.
Q. Yeah, very important.  Making sure that we get (Away from mic.)  Linebacker, safety, whatever it might be, making sure that we're finishing our blocks and getting guys on the ground, very important.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, you know, we expect it.  We expect them to bring the house.  We understand the different blitz they have done throughout the year.  Just like they understand the different things we have done throughout the year.  We expect some new stuff and we're ready for it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: A lot easier.  When he's able to make guys miss and do what he does, man.  It makes our job a lot easier.  We understand we may have to block.  I love it when he does his job consistently.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: A lot, man, a lot.  You know what I mean?  He's our guy, we run behind him, he understands that and he's been out there practicing and performing like he's -- (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No problem.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I'm good.
Q. How is getting ready for Georgia looking like?
ORLANDO BROWN: It's been long since the last time we kicked off a game.  It's been a lot of film work, a lot of different film work getting into some other things.  I think they're very talented as a defense, one of the best fronts in the country.
Q. In terms of what they bring to the table versus what you have seen, how different are they?
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, they do some things similar to some guys we've played.  Schematically it's a little different honestly just because everyone has their own things that they do.  I don't think schematically, you know, it's too much different from what we have seen already.  We've seen a lot of similar things schematically from what they do.
Q. What do you think of them?
ORLANDO BROWN: Very talented, very fast, makes a lot of plays for them.
Q. How is Baker?
ORLANDO BROWN: He's good.
Q. As far as the run game (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I don't know, man, I couldn't tell you, I don't know, you have to ask Coach Riley that one.
Q. What were your perceptions about playing in the Rose Bowl?  What do you think about it?
ORLANDO BROWN: Honestly coming to the game I didn't know how big of a deal it was.  I wasn't a kid that grew up watching college football, so I looked at the Rose Bowl as any other bowl.  I understood it was prestigious, but I haven't gotten into college football until I started getting recruited in high school.  After being here for a few days and realizing how big it is, man, I'm excited.
Q. What has been your favorite part of the week?
ORLANDO BROWN: The Improv was really fun.  They had some different comedians come up.  We did some funny stuff.  That was my favorite part.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: It was cool, really cool.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Just one plate.  In the Beef Bowl.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, no, I just did one plate, yeah!
Q. You didn't have five plates?
ORLANDO BROWN: No, not at all.  They cut that pretty big.
Q. Have you ever bought roses for somebody and if so when was that?
ORLANDO BROWN: I have not.  I have never bought roses for somebody.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Absolutely, absolutely, man, hopefully we get one today!  One!
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: He'll be all right.  He will be fine.
Q. What is the biggest thing that stands out on Georgia?
ORLANDO BROWN: They do some stuff schematically, that we haven't seen just because we haven't played Georgia, but other than that they've got a ton of talent, a lot of depth.  It's taken a lot of film work to make sure we got our minds right and we are physically ready to play these guys.
Q. How has preparation changed when you are playing someone you haven't seen all year?
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, it really doesn't change much.  The preparation doesn't change much.  The only difference is you've got thirty days or however long it's been so I don't think it changes much.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yep.
Q. Are you guys worried about (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, not at all.  He'll be all right.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, man, he'll be all right.  I'm sure he'll be okay.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Honestly can't.  I think Georgia is in the playoffs for a reason and they are one of the top defenses in the country.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Probably so.  Are you asking from, like, defensive perspective or offensive perspective?
Q. Their offense?
ORLANDO BROWN: I don't watch their offense.  I didn't watch their offense.  I couldn't tell you.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, a little bit here and there schematically, things that they do, not too much of the same.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yep, yep.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, just kind of been a long time.  But we have had plenty of time to prepare, taking care of business some of these last few days and been staying in the film room.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Like you said, a lot of speed defense, very physical, very strong, and they play hard.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah, he's good, yeah.
Q. (No microphone.) (Laughter.)
ORLANDO BROWN: (Away from mic.)
Q. What do you do to prepare yourself before a game?
ORLANDO BROWN: Really just kind of stay to myself.  I watch a lot of film so I do that normally.  I really don't every really get nervous.  It's not a thing for me.  I love what I do.  I believe and I have confidence in my game.  It's not really a nervousness for me or anything like that it's making sure my mind is right, making sure my body is right and getting the proper rest.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You said like if I was nervous?
Q. Yeah.
ORLANDO BROWN: Not at all.
Q. Why is that?
ORLANDO BROWN: I think when you play this game it's important to be as calm as possible going into it and understanding what you're good at it; and like I said, confidence, and just going in there with the mentality that you're going to dominate the guy in be front of you regardless what happens.  You've got to forgive and forget the plays that happen, the bad ones and the good ones and continue to the next play.  That's how I approach the game.  No reason for me to get nervous.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, you know, it's a lot of people out here that do get nervous.  I think when you get nervous, a lot of times people gravitate toward teammates or high-energy guys to bring 'em back or make sure that everything is okay.  In these bigger games you've got guys like me that are pretty calm and a lot of people gravitate toward me to make sure things are going well.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, man, we're taking it pretty personal.  We're more concerned with coming out of here with a win.  (Away from mic.)  We understand it has to be physical and we approach every game with that mentality and we're going to be the more physical team and we're not going to worry about winning, just following the plan.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, we didn't, not at all, nope.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, man, we were fortunate enough to keep Coach Riley and our offensive coaching staff.  Usually staffs lose coaches, so we didn't have to lose much.  Our chemistry was still there and we had a bunch of guys stay and not many transfers.  I don't think much changed, so that's probably the reason why.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, I mean, we play offense, man.  We want to score as many points as possible and that's just the mentality we approach every game with.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, not at all, man, you know what I mean?  These next two games is laying it all on the line.  Not too many get put in this position, only four teams every year, normally the same two of them are here every year, so really two new teams every year.  But, um, man, you're going to lay it all on the line for what you want.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I'm sure they'll be okay.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, he's been fine, yep.
Q. What's your week been like?  The experiences?
ORLANDO BROWN: It's been fun, man.  I think the most fun I had was at the Improv.  I don't ride rides and the Beef Bowl was really cool, but the Improv was really fun.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I think 13, 15, 17, 7.  All their linebackers are really good.  They got a ton of talent, a ton of depth.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like I said, he'll be fine.  We're not worried.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: He hasn't but he probably will get some soon.  (Chuckles.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, man, that's enough for me!
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: He's athletic, very long, strong guy, you know what I mean?  He plays very hard.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know we was just making sure he's -- like I said, he's very athletic.  He has got great duration for a guy his size.  Really just trying to better myself honestly when it comes to these type of games.  It's not as much about them but more about me.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Oh, everything, everything.  You know, I'm a lot faster and stronger now than I was in high school, a lot quicker.  There is so much that's changed.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Not at all.  Not at all.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, that's what we anticipated.  We set this goal as leaders and as captains, man, and we have had others follow and it's a credit to Coach Riley and what he's able to do with his staff to continue to develop us, you know, Coach Schmidt and the strength staff, what they continue to do to develop us.  This is what we expected.  We expected to be here and we expect to be in the national championship.  That's how we set our goals and that's what we want.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Absolutely, yeah.  We play in the Big 12, you know, and a lot of people don't respect that football.  It is what it is.  You see our scores throughout the season, 50-40.  You're quick to think the defenses aren't all that well so it leads you to think it's an air raiding league.  But like I said, it is what it is.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, oh yeah, yep.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: They've got a lot of depth, a lot of talent.  I think their linebacker core is really great as a whole.  Defensively they play very hard.  They're coached very well, too.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah, they're definitely one of the best we've seen.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.  You know, man, I --
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, probably not close to Ohio State, man.  They do a lot of different stuff schematically.  I don't think they compare to any team we've really seen.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.  You know, not really.  We've taken care of business these last two weeks and we've continued to make sure our bodies are right, our minds are right to go out there and fight.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, absolutely, yeah!  (Chuckles.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I ain't going to say he got no Hollywood tattoo or something, but that's something he goes by.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I think that's something he's done.  I think he says he feels better when he wears it.  He plays well when he wears it and I just hope he continues to have success.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: That's what he says.
Q. How is he personalitiwise?
ORLANDO BROWN: He's a fun guy, obviously from Florida, so he's different.  But I mean, a lot of energy, a lot of swag, a lot of juice.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, obviously it's tough.  Regardless, man, whether it be me at home chilling.  It doesn't have to be a game for me.  I don't get nervous for these big games, man.  It's football.  I do what I do.  I love what I do.  I have a lot of confidence in myself and my game.  Do I wish he was there to support me?  Yeah, but when he was alive he was watching the game.  He's a guy that watches back home on the couch.  I do wish that I had the ability to call him after a game or something like that, man, but it's obviously something that I've been dealing with since I've been playing the game I feel like and you know man I'm not going to say I'm used to it but I understand.
Q. Do you find yourself watching film from back then?
ORLANDO BROWN: Obviously, it's hard.  He played from '93 to '05.  They threw elbows.  They didn't pass as much then.  My dad was a fundamental player.  He was aggressive.  His footwork was trash, but he do what he do.  I'm not the same player, so it is what it is.
Q. Do you find yourself running across people, scouts at different places or as you go through the football journey that have had interactions with him?
ORLANDO BROWN: Absolutely, absolutely.  I met a lot of people in this game, a lot of different coaches, Bill Belichick was his head coach, so they had a ton of people underneath him that I've been able to meet, Marvin Lewis, Nick Saban, so many guys.  I run into a lot of people.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, Nick Saban actually told me a story.  I knew a little bit of it, when he was in high school when he was recruiting him.  Nick was telling me that -- Coach Saban was telling me that when my dad got there he was an undrafted free agent and they didn't let him wear shoulder pads all year, just a helmet and a jersey.
Q. Really?
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah.
Q. You're going to have a much different journey next year.  How do you expect that to go?
ORLANDO BROWN: If I decide to leave this year, hopefully I have that be opportunity to be a first-round pick, that's something he wanted, something I've always wanted and something I set my goals for.
Q. How has your game evolved?
ORLANDO BROWN: Man, really just fundamentally, you know what I mean?  Footwork, timing, punching, understanding of certain looks and certain things, I think that's where my game has improved the most.  Obviously that's taken a lot of time, a lot of hard work and man.  I'm not there yet.  I still got a lot to do, but it's been a long ride.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Oh, friends and --
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Absolutely I ran across him in Atlanta in the recruiting process, met him freshman year of high school.  My dad was actually around, spoke at my dad's funeral, so him and Belichick.  Yeah, man, I've ran into Kirk a lot.
Q. He's a great guy?
ORLANDO BROWN: Absolutely.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Basically they just told stories about some -- crazy stories that he had done, funny things about him and talked about how he was as a person, how he was as far as interactions with him and how he was in the locker room, a lot of different things.
Q. How do you feel about carrying on his legacy, carrying his name, literally?  You talk to so many people and they remember him as a wonderful person.  How gratifying is it to come and honor him?
ORLANDO BROWN: It's been very important, man, you know what I mean?  I'm Brown, Junior, so I understand the responsibility that it comes with and I understand it's a privilege at the same time, man, and I'm hoping to continue to get better and reach the goals that I set, you know what I mean, that we both set.  I reached the goals that he set and couldn't reach.  So, yeah, man, I got a lot, man, that's why I play with a big chip on my shoulder for my mom and I'm continuing to carry on the legacy and make sure I reach the goals that I set.
Q. How have you evolved personally?  If I remember right you were a late qualifier, Tennessee backed off.  How do you and this Oklahoma program, how have you grown up?
ORLANDO BROWN: My mentor, Jammal Brown, he showed me something I haven't learned anywhere else, and that's treating life as a whole like the game, you know what I mean, with the approach that you want to be the best at everything you do and embodying that, whether it be a haircut or clothes or you know what I mean?  The way that you approach a girl or the classroom, man, making sure that you take care of all those different things.
Q. When did he teach you that?
ORLANDO BROWN: After my dad passed he kinda came into my life more obviously because he understood that I didn't have that figure.  Just over time.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, he played at OU.  He played for the Saints and the Skins for a while.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: No, no, no, like he graduated in '05, '04 so --
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I knew him through my dad, though.
Q. Was he one of the reasons you went to Oklahoma?
ORLANDO BROWN: Not at all.
Q. Where is he now?
ORLANDO BROWN: He's in Virginia.  You can probably get his number from one of our media guys.  They have it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Honestly, I have his number.  I just don't want it put it on camera.  (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yep, yep.  I mean, he might know something, but --
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Coach knows me but I didn't really -- I only not spent basically a year and a half there.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Alabama, for high school.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I'm solid!  No!
Q. Did they make you wear this attire?
ORLANDO BROWN: Man, they made us wear this.  If it was up to me I would probably have worn some type of different sweat suit, but it is what it is.
Q. What's it been like?
ORLANDO BROWN: It's been fun.  For me the best fun was at the Improv last night, the comedians, all that stuff was fun.  Disneyland was fun, but can't ride my rides so --
Q. Baker Mayfield, is he okay?
ORLANDO BROWN: What's wrong with him?
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: I don't know.  He'll be fine though.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: He's been good, same 'ol, same 'ol.
Q. What's the biggest thing you're trying to key on?
ORLANDO BROWN: It's a lot, man, it's a lot.  They've got plenty of time to prepare for us, great defense, great coaching staff.  So I don't know if there is anything specifically we're keying on, but we're excited for the match-up.
Q. Outside of the X's and O's what's the extra motivation that you guys have right now?
ORLANDO BROWN: You know, man, the motivation of making it to a national championship, you know, man.  It is what it is.  That's one of the goals we set as a team and, yeah, man, and that is the most important thing.
Q. How about your head coach, Coach Riley?  (Laughter.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, yeah, Coach Riley, everything he's done to get us to this point, the coaching staff, obviously Coach Bedenbaugh and --
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Oh, just the consistency he's had with us.  You know what I mean?  He's not continued to, you know, stay with us and, you know, continue to understand us and all of those different things.
Q. You're one of the few guys on the O roster that -- (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Uh-huh.
Q. An hour, perhaps?
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, about an hour and 15.  Yeah.
Q. Growing up were you --
ORLANDO BROWN: I grew up in Baltimore, Maryland.  I lived in Atlanta for two years.  I lived there because my mom lived there, but I grew up a Terrapin fan.  I couldn't tell you much about the SEC.  I didn't know about it until I moved down there.
Q. What about your family coming out?
ORLANDO BROWN: They're excited.  My mom loves when I play in these bigger games and being able to come to them so I look forward to them and look forward to seeing her.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, you know, man, it is what it is.  We'll see on Monday.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, we set this goal every year.  I'm pretty sure just like every team in the country you set the goal to make it to the national championship and that's where the focus goes.  It goes to win your conference then to win the playoff and then to win the national championship.  But for our biggest goal just like every team it's to win a national championship and that's what we worked for.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: You know just as much, I think.  As far as us individuals, during the season, man, it's more, you know, one-week-at-a-time mentality.  We may talk about it or as an offensive line or as a team, stuff like that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ORLANDO BROWN: Yeah, Tre has been a guy that -- he's been an assistant for a while.  He understands what he's doing, and he does it very well.
Q. (No microphone.)
