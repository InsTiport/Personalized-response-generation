 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Taylor and Austin.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the start of this offense as they moved down the field there in the first quarter?   
 TAYLOR POTTS: Yeah, like you said, we he got off to a pretty fast start, running right down the field. I don't know what the first drive was. I know the second drive was 95 yards or something. We played really fast. We got lined up really fast. You know, everybody was just moving around really quickly and it worked really well for us.  
  
  Q. Did it seem pretty easy for you guys? Almost like you're like, okay, I need to get a touchdown?   
 TAYLOR POTTS: No, nothing like that. But it just, you know, today was kind of our day. Everything we did seemed to work well. We had some things not work that we'd like to have.   
 Everything seemed to kind of work today. Everybody executed really well. It felt like at times we had 11 guys playing at the exact same time, when in the past it feels like we're just missing a couple of guys on certain plays that would help. Today I felt like we had 11 playing all at the same time, and it felt good.  
  
  Q. What about that touchdown?   
 TAYLOR POTTS: I know, that was very athletic.   
  
  Q. Talk about how some of those guys did, and specifically the quarterback?   
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: I mean, obviously the quarterbacks did good because we kept cycling through them, you know. We didn't have to get them too many reps. But I think Doege wanted to see more reps but McRoy kind of took that away.   
 But it was kind of cool to see all the receivers that work behind us all the time finally get out there and get to play. They were pretty excited about it, I think.  
  
  Q. Taylor, how important is it to see everything (Indiscernible) did coming off last week?   
 TAYLOR POTTS: It was extremely important. We had a game plan of what we wanted to do coming into this game. To see it work like it did and to see us execute the way we did was huge. It's what we've been looking for all year, but I'm glad that we were able to do that.  
  
  Q. Austin, since four quarterbacks played, did it cross your mind to ask to take any snaps yourself since you used to play quarterback?   
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: One of the GA's actually came up and asked me if I knew the reads and progressions as a joke. But no, it didn't cross my mind. I wanted my roommate to get some more reps.  
  
  Q. (No microphone)?  
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: No comment.  
  
  Q. You have one game left. Tack about your thoughts about Senior Day today and having your family and all your teammates out there and kind of what that meant to you?   
 TAYLOR POTTS: I thought it was exciting. I know it's not our last time to play here at the Jones. But it's Senior Day and a bunch of us were just hanging back the other day about what we've been through, what all we've done and the dumb stuff we've done, the funny stuff coaches have had us do.   
 Five years has gone by really fast, but never thought they'd come. We'd be running off the field handing roses to our moms. But it did, and you know, it was exciting. I'm glad we got the win.  
  
  Q. Obviously this season, there's been some rough patches. How does it feel to go to the sideline in the second quarter up 37-0?   
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: Yeah, you know, it was nice. Like I said, I'm glad we came out. We all played together. It seemed like everybody was just clicking at the same time. Everybody was executing like the way we planned on it working.   
 You know, we really concentrated all week on everybody doing their job. And, you know doing it well. Not just flying around with great effort and not thinking. But putting some thought into it and do the right things as you're flying around.  
  
  Q. Was it fun watching?   
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: Yeah, it was fun watching. But like I said, I'm just glad we got the win.  
  
  Q. What would you say to fans who would point out the wins with the level of competition that you were playing?   
 AUSTIN ZOUZALIK: What should we tell them? I mean, we got the win and that's what we wanted to do. That's really all there is to say.
