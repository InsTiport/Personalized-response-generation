 Q.  Please describe your Bowl Week experience.  
RYAN ANDERSON: I just treat it like it's another game, so it's not a bowl game to me.  I'm not here to have fun.  I'm here to win a game.  So it's just like any other game.   
 Q.  With so much time that leads up to this as compared to a normal game, what does that difference make for you all in preparation, when you have more time to rest and study film?  
RYAN ANDERSON: It gives you a lot more time to prepare, like you said.  That's always good.   
 Q.  What's your favorite part of Bowl Week, then?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Just being with my teammates.  Just spending time with my teammates, staying with them, that's been the best part.
