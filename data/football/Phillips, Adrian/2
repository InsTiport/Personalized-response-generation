  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Adrian Phillips.   

Q.   What is still at stake for you guys?   
ADRIAN PHILLIPS:   I think we still have a lot at stake.   Going in and beating Kansas State, they're a top-10 team.   Being able to knock them off, if we can handle that, I think it will be good for us.   There's still a lot at stake.   We're still fighting for the best bowl possible.   

Q.   How big of a challenge will Collin Klein be for you guys? 
ADRIAN PHILLIPS:   I mean, they're a good team.   He's a good quarterback.   He knows how to lead them.   It's going to be a great challenge.   
But that's what we want.   We wouldn't want it any other way.   

Q.   Why do you think Kansas State has had so much success in recent years against Texas?   
ADRIAN PHILLIPS:   I mean, they just came out and executed better than we have.   That's with any team.   
The biggest thing for us, we just have to end that streak.   Have to go in there and set things right.   

Q.   How important would it be to finish the regular season out with a win?   
ADRIAN PHILLIPS:   Yeah, I mean, it's real important for us.   To be able to get the ninth win and still being able to get our 10th win, that's one of our goals for the season.   This is big for us.   
It's basically helping us take the right step and getting back to where Texas needs to be.   So it's important. 

Q.   Has the defense gotten better and progressed?   Are you still feeling pretty good? 
ADRIAN PHILLIPS:   Yeah, we still feel good about ourselves.   I feel like the defense has been getting better.   Everybody is going to have plays they're not proud of, but overall the defense is getting better.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
