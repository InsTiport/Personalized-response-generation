RYAN DAY: Hi Buckeye Nation. As we enter into the second week of the quarantine virus and the newness has worn off. Just wanted to visit with everyone for a little while to consider mental health and making sure that we're taking care of ourselves mentally in this time. In this time there's a lot of newness going on and for a lot of us a lot of stress and uncertainty and so just some things to think about to make sure that we're taking care of ourselves, mentally.   
The first thing is to get outside. I think getting fresh air and being outside while still observing social distancing is really important. Being outside and moving around being healthy is really important. I think eating healthy, getting exercise really, really helps in this time.   
The other thing I think is important is something that we talk to our team about all the time called 'win the moment' which means worry about right now. Because, if you think about the past you get frustrated. If you look too far into the future, you just get anxious and worried and there's nothing we can do about that. All we can control is right now and trying to maximize our days the best we can. And I think it's important to do that. So win the moment.   
I think it's important for a message for all those people who need medication or anything like that. In times like this who suffer from any kind of mental illness that they're getting the medication that they need. And certainly, for people and loved ones who know that they need that type of medication or treatment that they're staying in touch with people over the phones or whatever type of treatment they need.   
And then also, you know staying connected. I think it's really important that weÂ’re staying connected with our loved ones with our colleagues and we have so many ways to do that now through FaceTime. And not to isolate ourselves and make sure we do the best we can to get that Community feel even though we are in a quarantine. So, just some things to think about.   
Certainly making sure we take care of our elderly and those who are the most vulnerable are critical at this time. But we're going to we're going to work through this. There is light at the end of the tunnel and Go Bucs!
