 COACH PETE CARROLL:  Well, it's great to get this close to the game.  It seems like it's taken forever.  We've had a wonderful season that has positioned ourselves in the just extraordinary opportunity here at the Rose Bowl.  Our football team is thrilled about this opportunity, this chance to play.  I guess a great team and a great setting with all of the buildup that goes along with it.  It's a time of year that we have really pointed towards and looked forward to, this whole thing that happens around the 1st of the year.  When it happens here and it's a championship opportunity at the Rose Bowl, it just can't get any better for the USC Trojans.  We're really happy about it. 
 It's obvious we are playing an extraordinary opponent.  Texas comes in with an incredible football team, one that no matter how you look at them statistically, you look at their personnel or their depth or their style, they have just stood out so far ahead of the crowd that it makes the best match-up we obviously could have asked for.  It's going to call for us to put together a game that is challenging of one as we've ever faced in the years we've been here.  I know that it brings great buildup of two really successful programs and historic programs and teams that have done everything you can ask for for a season to make this just a beautiful Rose Bowl. 
 We're really pumped up about it, and everything has gone well to this point.  Practice has been right on the mark, our players have been tuned in and fortunately healthy.  We've had great competition throughout the early weeks here, and as we finish here in game week, really our focus is to have a great day today and put together essentially a great Tuesday practice for us in our format and make the most of this day, and then go to the next day and the next day and bring us right up to game time where we have a chance to do something really special.  We're really pumped up about it. 
 The other thing I'd say is we've been in this situation where you get to play this game in Miami, and it was an extraordinary experience last year and it was really special and fun and all that, but for us at USC to be able to do this in Southern California and the buzz and the hype and the buildup is right here at home and all of our local people in the media and our fans and all can be this close to it, it just makes it even more special.  It's all we can ask for, and I hope that our preparation will show that we're ready and that we're worthy of this opportunity and we can make something of it. 
 Q.  Considering whether you thought you were going to be in this game or not at whatever point, when did you think that Texas would be the team you would be playing in this game?
