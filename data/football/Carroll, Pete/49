<p>	Q.  Exactly how stunning was it to you really?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pete, Norm has never been more marketable these last two years.  Is he fooling us all that he really has the second best job in the country and is content with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a bit about the post-game celebration back at your hotel? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get any sleep?  They appear to have claimed a victim in Matt.  Is that true? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lofa said last night that as far as the practices for this game that he thought maybe y'all had one average practice, the rest of them were all really high level.  Based on that, were you fairly confident with the practices and preparations, were you fairly confident going into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you were really eloquent the other day in explaining how you would talk to Matt and his family about the decision he faces, so my question is does anything about the way he played last night or the way the game unfolded change how you'll advise him or your feelings about what he ought to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not going to use the "D" word, but you said last night that this program was definitely on a roll.  In your mind, what are the one or two things that you've got to do to sustain it over the long haul?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much have you allowed yourself to kind of look ahead?  I'm sure you have to prepare ahead to next season.  You have a lot of these same kids coming back, and I guess how excited are you to get started again for next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on that --</p>
<p>	Q.  The returning players, what groups or units in particular excite you for the future, considering you have so many returning starters?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the dominant teams the last few years, Florida's passing game changed the game last year, Iowa had the option.  What do your teams have to account for in beating them over these last two years?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier recruiting calls being made yesterday.  Could you elaborate on who was making those calls and when those calls were made?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sort of on the same theme, obviously you don't want to lose a Matt Leinart or a Mike Williams next year, but in terms of almost like clearing out inventory to get these young guys into the program, isn't it almost like you have to keep it going to keep the young guys satisfied and that's why it doesn't bother you?</p>
<p>	Q.  In what ways can Leinart improve next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a little bit ago about clinging to the experience.  How much do you feel that for yourself right now, that this is something that you wouldn't want to trade for anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your single most indelible moment from last night, be it a play in the game or something said behind the scenes? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you enjoy this now, you enjoy it on the plane ride back, maybe you enjoy it for a couple more days on campus.  When is it going back to work?</p>
<p>	Q.  When does the preparation for 2005 begin?</p>
