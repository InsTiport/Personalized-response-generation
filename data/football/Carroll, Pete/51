<p>	Q.  Given the evenness of the two teams, should we anticipate people watching the game that it'll probably come down to an unexpected element, and if that's the case, do you have any feelings about what that might be?</p>
<p>	Q.  We know you're there to help calm your players down.  Who's going to calm you down and keep you relatively at ease on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned this being the healthiest you've been all year.  LenDale and Manny I guess have come along during the six days you've been down here it seems and they're ready to go?</p>
<p>	Q.  As someone who's already been in the NFL, what's the lure for college coaches?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Having been in a similar situation last year, if you and Auburn won Bowl games, would you have a problem sharing a National Championship with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  What in your background made you right for the SC job, and with that in mind, are you -- with your success in mind, are you sort of gratified to see that more colleges are saying that they're looking at coaches with a pro background when they're trying to find someone?</p>
<p>	Q.  About colleges saying they would like to --</p>
<p>	Q.  This is sort of a corollary question, I guess --</p>
<p>	Q.  You can handle it.  Without denigrating any of your predecessors, you must have looked at SC --</p>
<p>	Q.  You looked at the situation, and it's been a long time --</p>
<p>	Q.  Particularly with regard to recruiting and whatever else you thought was important, what did you see not happening that you felt you could address to help restore SC to its old prominence?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Stoops said that since they won the National Title four years ago, fan expectations have kind of skyrocketed there.  Can you tell us what you think or how you've perceived fan expectations have changed since you took over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt obviously has a big decision to make after this game.  Can you talk about the process?  Will you sit down with him and try to discuss the situation?  Do you try to sell him on staying, or how do you approach it?</p>
<p>	Q.  In a Super Bowl environment like this, are you of the mentality that no one ends up a No. 2 or is this a win-win situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the Big 12 4-2, do you think Oklahoma played in a tougher conference and does that give them any kind of advantage tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  What class would you put your program in should you guys win tomorrow night?  Would you consider yourself kind of a dynasty or where would you put the program exactly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier this year you mentioned about this was one of your toughest challenges, to maintain the level that you had reached last year.  Now that you're in the National Championship, as you reflect back to this season, what was the most difficult part of maintaining?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Mike a little earlier.  Have you ever given yourself any time to think about what kind of team or what it would have been like having him either for tomorrow night's game or over the course of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have stated that your team and Oklahoma's are similar in a lot of ways.  Do you buy into that, and if so, does that help you in preparing for a team like Oklahoma?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said a few minutes ago that the outcome of Mike was disappointing last year and that you hoped for a better outcome.  As an evaluator of talent, do you think Matt is ready?  I mean, is that where you're coming from when you say you hope for a better outcome?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Stoops said a while ago that because of the tradition of SC, it makes playing you guys for the National Championship extra special.  What about you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most games you go into looking at, okay, there's one key match-up we need to win to be able to have success in the game.  With both teams matched up so equally, is it difficult to focus on one particular position or whatever that you'd have to win?</p>
