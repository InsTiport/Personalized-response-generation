<p>	Q.  What's your philosophy practicing for a game like this?  Do you scrimmage a lot?  Do you have a lot of physical practice?  How do you go about such a big game with so many other games under your belt?</p>
<p>	Q.  LenDale White looked a little tender yesterday at practice.  If he can't go for you, what does that do for your offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned this briefly in your opening statement, but there's such star power in this game, especially the skill positions.  There's defensive ends that are all-Americans, linebackers that are all-Americans.  Just wondering if you could expound on that, go through those positions, where they are --</p>
<p>	Q.  Being No. 1 going into the season, staying there the whole year, was the team able to enjoy what they did, or was there a sense of relief after every game that they won that they were still in that position.</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt Leinart has had attention all year, but now he's the Heisman Trophy winner.  Do you feel he'll be able to handle all that additional attention and why do you feel confident about him?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look across the line of scrimmage and see such a mirror image, does that make it easier to prepare because of all the familiarity or does it make it tougher to find a crack in the armor?</p>
<p>	Q.  Early in your career you were involved in one of the most memorable Orange Bowls when Arkansas upset Oklahoma in 78.  Could you talk a little bit about what you remember about that experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could reflect back on your year away from football, the year before you took over at USC and how you feel like being away from football might have helped you become a better coach after you came back. </p>
<p>	Q.  A couple weeks ago some kid from Oklahoma said some things about Leinart or something.  Do you use that stuff?  Do you discount it?  Do you talk to your players about not engaging in that sort of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who are some of the coaches that you've either played for or worked under that have kind of influenced your style and how you've patterned yourself after?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you arrived at SC, what was the first thing you found out you needed to get done?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know the game is several days away, but I'm curious about the thoughts about a couple of the keys, a couple things that will be important come game day. </p>
<p>	Q.  So often in a national title game, even if both offenses are high-powered it becomes low-scoring.  Do you see that happening?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was hoping you could talk about Norm Chow a little bit and how important he's been these last few years, and what are your theories on why he's never gotten that head coaching spot and do you think you're getting close to losing him now to one of those spots?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned in your year off, you talk about your reorganizing your thoughts.  What changed in your philosophy?  And also, the enthusiasm that the players say they really like about you in practice, did you find that didn't jive in the NFL?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about your corner backs and particularly in terms of match-up against some taller receivers that Oklahoma is going to present?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could talk about the running style, maybe the ball carrying style of Reggie Bush, compare and contrast with Adrian Peterson?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did Dave Wannstedt talk to you about making the transition from coaching pros to --</p>
<p>	Q.  Back on Coach Chow for a second, can you explain y'all's working relationship?  Do you turn the reins over to him and get out of his way or how exactly --</p>
<p>	Q.  What difference, if any, does it make to have had guys who have played in a national title game before, and along those lines, does it make a difference just having familiarity with this particular game in South Florida?</p>
<p>	Q.  Grootegoed and his size has thrived at linebacker for you, and I want you to talk about why that was.  And also, when you got there, you moved him from safety to linebacker.  Is that kind of a good example of your defensive philosophy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Mike Williams a little bit ago, and I was just wondering, do you expect him to be on the sideline Tuesday, and what effect has there been just having him around to whatever extent he has been around practices and games, and how proud are you of the way he's handled this fall as opposed to say the guy at Ohio State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the uncertainty with Mike going into the season, the injury to Smith, did you foresee Dwayne Jarrett having the impact that he had over the course of the season?  Did you think it was going to be down the road?</p>
<p>	Q.  If Mike had been able to play, given Dwayne's reported homesickness, do you think that he would have been here?  Do you think he would have still been in the program?</p>
<p>	Q.  To some degree last year you were where Auburn is now.  Do you feel for them at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have two questions that really have nothing to do with each other.  The first question is what you think should happen to the BCS in the wake of AP pulling out, and the second question is probably in the last three weeks a half a dozen coaches have cracked the $2 million salary mark.  Just your thoughts on the escalating salary question. </p>
<p>	Q.  One of your assistants is a local guy here, Dennis Slutak.  Could you talk about the job that he's done?</p>
<p>	Q.  With these two evenly matched teams, there's a very good chance that it could come down to a kick at the very end and Coach Stoops has benched DiCarlo in favor of two freshman who have never kicked a field goal before, and Ryan's had his roughest year statistically of the three, do you have any concern if it was to come down to that and what do you tell him if you're down by two?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you took the job at SC, was Norm Chow the first guy you wanted to talk to for the coordinator's job, and also, how much had you guys crossed paths or whatever before coming to SC?</p>
