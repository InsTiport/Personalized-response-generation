START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT







 Q. Talk about the SEC players and the season. Talk about the secondary. 
 CAM NEWTON: For me, one thing that I look for while running the football is first how far is the yardage to the first down. And after the first down, Coach Malzahn always gets on me about taking unnecessary hits. 
 So after I pass the first down mark, if there are no yards to be made, I go down. But if I feel like I can make some more than that, then I try to do so.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I don't think -- it's no me involved. It is something so big. Me personally, I think Auburn, that whole town of Auburn, Auburn University, everything that Auburn represents is past due for something great like this. You know, we have a chance. I mean, it is evident. People on this team know we have a chance to do something great. We are not just playing for ourselves. We are playing for so many people that didn't have the opportunity. We play for the pride of Auburn.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Start with Cunningham and the list goes on. His game play on the field. Not just only him, a lot of NFL quarterbacks during that era, I really look up to and admire.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I'm just trying to move the football away from the pile. Like I said, I'm one of those guys that takes, you know, this job very serious. Like you said, running and playing. Tom Brady, people are great.

 Q. (Question about Cam and LaMichael)?
 CAM NEWTON: I think after the Heisman Trophy ceremony, I think I found a friend. Me and LaMichael are very close. We just keep each other's spirits up. Text messaging each other, just see how each other are doing.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: For me, I think I opened up some of the opportunities for my other teammates. You know, it is a lot of people on this team that goes unnoticed and without those guys' hard work on the field, I don't think my success would even be to this point right now. Just everybody's eyes are on me, it is kind of something that each athlete wants. And that's what you practice for. That's what you prepare for each week in, week out.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I'm not sure. I'm not going to say what we can't do. I can just talk about what we will try to do. 
 We are going to have to start this game on the right foot. We can't get behind this is the national championship. The stakes are so high. We can't just depend on the late game by no means.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: No, I wouldn't say that. There are so many other things, or so many things that we could just say we playing for this, playing for that. We will continuously doing what we have been doing and preparing very well for the game, listening to our coaches and just being able to execute any given play.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: When I went to Blinn, what my focuses was to get consistent in my passing game. There were so many things I feel like I had to work on myself, on the athletic side also, just while I was at Blinn. I think I accomplished that. The time that I was there, I was really on a business trip.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I know there are sayings about success or the letdowns that Heisman Trophy winners have. I am not even going to think about that. I'm just going to play my game. If I do that, everything will be okay. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I really don't. Right now we do have curfew right now. But I think Coach Chizik and the whole coaching staff are trying to embrace the moment. This is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity right now. We are just trying to take advantage of every single thing that we have. When it comes to the curfew, that could mean that we are out doing our own thing. I think that gives us even more time to bond as a team. 

 Q. What time is it? 
 CAM NEWTON: It is one o'clock. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Absolutely. We have a hospitality room and it is full of Tostitos chips. You know, you got the dip, the queso, everything, you see those plays that people are making on chips and dip.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Absolutely. Any time we are watching a football game it is the cliche thing to do, just eat some chips and dip.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Absolutely. He knows how to coach his players. He knows you can't coach every single player the same way because no one player is the same. He raised the bar for so many of his players and, you know, he knows which way to coach.
 He is going to be on you consistently during practice and he won't let you let up. He says that you are failing yourself, then he is going to get on you.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Absolutely. I think every great coach is going to bring the best -- or want the best for you or out of your play. When you do that, you will be rewarded.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I think coaching any type of athleticism in the quarterback position, I think it is being labeled an athlete as a quarterback at some point. I have during the high school days, college days, and, you know, I was just trying to put it to rest game in and game out.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I'm not sure. That's an opinion-related question. I'm sure that Oregon does have fans as well as we do. We are just going to try to have a good game.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I don't think it could be even better than what being around those guys. We have so much respect for each other. At the same time, we have fun doing what we do. Of course, from those guys, you are going to hear a lot of jokes and it is fun to be around them.

 Q. (Question about older brother)?
 CAM NEWTON: Well, I mean, it speaks for himself. He was the way that an older brother was supposed to be. He told me how to live. He told me just playing football. Me growing up and seeing him playing football at every single level, it was something that was very inspiring to me. He was just another influence in my life. I call him during the wee hours of the night if I have a problem and I know he will pick up the phone. That's something that not everybody has, and I'm just blessed to have it.

 Q. What is he up to now? 
 CAM NEWTON: He's in the NFL but he just got hurt. He was on the Jaguars and he just tore his ACL before the season.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Coach Malzahn, what you see is what you get, and that's so in tuned of football, and he lives it 24/8. He is somebody that really takes pride being the offensive coordinator in the SEC. He is the best. He has an answer for every single question that we have about what's going on during this game. And any game. 
 So just to have that, you can ask him anything. Who is this, Coach? How do you think this should play out? He could give you an honest answer and it would be related to what you asked.

 Q. Obviously you are a huge guy. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I don't even know none of that. Well, for me, I think it all starts -- for any athletes, I think it starts between the ears. And you have to have something that you call your edge in especially athletics because everybody can run fast. Everybody can throw the football. It is a lot of guys out there that has accuracy but everybody doesn't think the same.
 I think it is the player's mentality that sets them apart from any other.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I play quarterback. 

 Q. During the winter? 
 CAM NEWTON: I just put my hands in the pocket. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Well, I hope I was tuned in when Texas was playing USC in 2005 and I just admire how Vince Young played in that game. He brought his team back and he played great.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I was shocked. For me knowing Andrew during the time that I did meet him, he was -- he was one of those guys. I think he made a smart decision. Whatever decision that he made, as a fan of Andrew Luck, you know, I would support that.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I watch football. The polls came out and they have been consistent throughout the year.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Pranksters? No, man, I'm all serious the whole thing. I think all the coaches does an excellent job in weighing out everybody's persona, so to speak. There are so many different guys that have different mentalities and for our coaching staff to weigh them all out and make them bond together, I commend them.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I haven't even thought that far yet. My whole focus is on January 10th and trying to be the best player that I can be.

 Q. Nick Fairley is trying to get to 10,000 fans on Twitter. Why aren't you on there? You could have Auburn Nation. 
 CAM NEWTON: I probably could. The cyber world for Cam Newton, no, I don't see that. I don't have a Facebook. I don't have a Twitter, a MySpace. That's not something that I am a big fan of.

 Q. Why do you think Nick is so popular? 
 CAM NEWTON: Nick is just a popular guy in life. He doesn't need anything to make him popular. He is a fun guy to be around. Nick Fairley is Nick Fairley.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: From what I can remember at Michigan State, they had an excellent scheme for us. I don't think I completed a deep pass during that game. I think they had an excellent game plan and the fans were a little bit on the wild side. That's something that I look forward to. That's motivation throughout the game.

 Q. What's the worst question you have been asked? 
 CAM NEWTON: The worst question? Yeah, that one. It is just like you did ask the question and you answered it and you just flush it out of your brain and just be ready to answer another one. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Just the basic, you know -- you go out there and stand right there and put your hands up. I tried to hit the little -- you aim for the littlest target and try to hit it. And it is something that -- it is not just something you do every week once a week. You got to do it consistently every single day and get in the rhythm and try to fine-tune your craft.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Absolutely. I do it in any way, shape, form that the quarterback can throw the football. I'm trying to hit every single target.

 Q. (Indiscernible) so polished, smile, look great. When you are not playing football, what shows do you watch on T.V. (indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: Honestly, when I'm not clocked into football, I try not to think about football as much as I can, honestly. Because the wear and tear of that mentally, if you just break down, if I'm not around the football team, I'm by myself, I try to do something, play video games, watch movies, just do something very regular because at the end of the day, I'm a human being just like everybody else.

 Q. Favorite T.V. show or movie, anything like you like to watch? 
 CAM NEWTON: Favorite movie has to be anything with Denzel Washington in it. He is great at what he does. Tell him to be in a movie called "Candid Cam." 

 Q. (Question about brother)? 
 CAM NEWTON: He has a couple years until he goes to college. I'm hoping that I do have influence in his life. Just like how my family gave me my decision. They gave me some intricate facts. But at the end of the day, it was my decision. I can see great success from my little brother and I'm hoping that for him. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: My little brother is Kalen Newton. He is playing football right now. He is seeing everything I do and is trying to do it. He is an interesting character, to say the least.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: No, I think during this process, everybody's anticipating Monday night. You know, but for me personally, you know, I try to find as much -- a way that I can bring myself ease during this time. Life after Monday, I can't really talk about that right now. I don't even know what life after Monday brings. I am just trying to mentally prepare and the best prepared team will win. The team that makes the least mistakes will win. 
 So, you know, I'm just trying to continuously try to improve my performance pregame until Monday.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: I learned a lot about this crazy year. That's an understatement. For me I think this has been a long, interesting year. Embraced this whole process because I learned so much about myself, about my team, about Auburn. I really make the right decision to come to Auburn.

 Q. What will the minutes before this game be like for you? Is this the biggest game you will ever have played in? 
 CAM NEWTON: It is the biggest game that everybody in this room that has on an Auburn Jersey has played in. If they say they have been in a bigger one -- but for me, what's going through my mind will be just my game. Don't play outside my means because that's when mistakes will happen. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: If I sense that, if any of my coaches sense that, they'll tell me. And I'm not going to do too much. 
 My job is to distribute the football to my teammates so they can make the football play. If that's not there, then that's when I take it upon myself to try to move the ball.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: I try to at least. My job as a quarterback is to manage the football game and just keep the football moving toward the end zone.

 Q. You guys are so fantastic in the fourth quarter. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: That's something you can't really look at. You just got to go out there and do your job. Execute every single play. You can't look at it that at the end of the second quarter, third quarter, you just got to look at it this play we are going to try to execute as best as we can. The next play will take care of itself. 
 You have to have everybody -- everybody has to be all in on every single play. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: It is something crazy. We were just talking last night who would ever have imagined I was playing for a national championship. Everybody is happy. But everybody knows at the end of the day, this is a business trip. And we came to try to take care of business.

 Q. (Question about the Heisman Trophy situation)? 
 CAM NEWTON: My dad is coming to Arizona. I'm not aware if he is coming to the game. My mom hasn't sent me the list. For me, not to just single out my father, but I want my mom there, I want my brothers there, I want my aunts there. That will play an interesting role of me being comfortable going into this game.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: I will try. It is just a wave full of people looking at you looking at them. It is something you see the final, that's great. It is something every player looks forward to seeing. After you make a play, after you do something good, you want to look up there and see how your family is doing. That's something that's always in the back of my mind.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: If you are from Alabama, you know it is no limit on the fence. You are either with this team or with that team. It is not going for both of them and I just want a good game. For us to have a game like that and to win, to prepare to this point right here, a lot of people take pride in. I mean, you go out, you go to the store, you go to the gas station, you go anywhere and you sense that this is one of the biggest games of the year, each year, whether each team is going into the game 0-12 or each team is going into the game 12-0. That's something that everybody looks forward to as an annual event. And the whole city shuts down, the whole state shuts down just to watch the football game.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: It is a wild world of questions out there that hasn't even been tapped into. You know, you are more than welcome to ask. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Nothing. I'm trying to be intrigued. I'm trying to find something "can you believe this man just asked me?" I haven't got there yet. Come on, ask me the question.

 Q. Boxers or briefs? 
 CAM NEWTON: Boxers or briefs, that's a new one. I'm a briefs guy. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: Honestly, I don't see that happening. As a player, what I would like players to get paid? I would be lying and saying that I wish we could get paid. But do we? No. But for me, I don't see it happening no time soon. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: That's a trick question, isn't it? I know what your question is when I hear one. 
 But for me, I'm excited to go against this defense because a lot of teams haven't had much success with them. I think any competitive person would try to take on a challenge and try to make due to every single challenge that they have and try to make the best of it.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Last year's national championship game? I was at Auburn, you know, watching it. No, it was kind of -- well, for the people I was watching it with. It is kind of mixed emotions because they wanted SEC to be dominant. At the same time you are at Auburn and you wanted to have your rivals playing the game. I just wanted to watch an excellent game. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: I just wanted to see that they could match the same intensity that the Rose Bowl had in 2005.

 Q. What does winning the national championship mean to you? 
 CAM NEWTON: It would mean so much. What I said earlier, I think this town, these players, these coaches, everything, everybody that represents Auburn, you know, is past due for something so great. You know, it is a great program to be around. And for us to be in this moment right now, you know, we have to be all in to try to conquer these goals.

 Q. What else don't you know about (indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: For me, they always talk bad about me. My knee pads, I wear knee pads to practice. And I think I'm a trend setter because I think -- I have seen some other knee pads out there. 
 My Cammy-Cam juice, that's undisclosed to the public right now. What else? Basketball? I'm an athlete. I can go in the hockey rink and be successful. I can go on a tennis court and be up there with Serena and Venus. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Oh, my gosh. I can't even believe they would say something like that. My teammates, the people I call my family, why would you bring that much pain to my heart. I think they are pinching themselves that they had to say that, knowing these guys. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: No. I don't. That's something that I don't hope it is like that, the fans, I'm pretty sure they want to see something like that. I think we are going to try to play as best as we can to bring us less stress throughout the game.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: Just watching that game, I think they raised the bar for any national championship. And from the national championships that I have seen, that's one of my favorites, the Ohio State and Miami, that's one of my favorites also. Any game that comes down to the wire, I think that is something very important. And for the athletes to perform great during that time, that's the biggest stage in anything. 
 The only thing that's probably equivalent is a person being successful in the Super Bowl. So this is the biggest game of anybody's legion collegiate. There is no bigger stage than this right now.
 For a person to play at a higher level, I commend them.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: It makes it even better. Coach Malzahn always says the moment can't be too big for a person to make a play. Whether it is a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior, you have to be ready to make a play because it is not -- it is not a video game. You can't just say, you know, injuries off. People are going to suffer injuries. I'm hoping that it's not for each team. But if your number is called to play, you have to be able to play and play very well. 

 Q. (Question about parents)? 
 CAM NEWTON: My parents were for every single part of my whether it was academics or anything. They demanded greatness from me. I think that's why I'm right here right now because parents that were on me since day one to expect nothing but greatness.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I can't tell you how I feel because I don't even know how I feel. This is a big game. But just this moment leading up to the game, I'm loving every single bit of it. We are just trying to embrace this whole process and just be around each other as much as we can. 
 I think this team is having an excellent time here and just loving each other's company. But when we hit that field, we are all business. Like I said, I can't really explain how I feel when I'm going out there. I'm pretty sure I would probably feel very, very good.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: They can pick us apart? We had a long time to try to find their weakness. 
 But I think this defense is very underrated. I don't think they get a lot of -- I don't think they get what they need because all the attention goes to the offense. 
 For anybody to have shutouts like they have had and put up points to teams to what they've had, I tip my hat off to them because I think it is very hard for any defense to play when your offense is scoring in less than two minutes half the time. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: That's something I didn't know until you brought it to my attention. I'm screaming inside right now.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: That's another trick question, huh? I know a trick question when I see one now. 
 If I answer this question and they hear it and it is nothing that they want to hear, everybody in TCU is going to just hate me. But, you know, watching them play this whole season has been something that motivates any college football team. 
 And it is just something that they haven't had the opportunity because it is three undefeated teams. Did they have a great year? Yes. I'm happy that we're in this game.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: I did. I commend them. Actually, everybody is going to this game thinking TCU is going to get blown out by a bigger Wisconsin team. Just looking at the offensive line of Wisconsin, it was crazy just to compare them to what they were going against. 
 But I commend TCU just for being labeled the underdog and just being dominant throughout the whole game. They played like they had a chip on their shoulder and it was very evident watching the game.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: Anybody would be lying if they said I'm sufficient if we went undefeated this season in the FBS and we didn't have a chance to play for national championship. That's everybody's team dream to get a conference championship and to play for the national championship because everybody can't say that. It is only one team that reigns every single year that says we are the national championship.
 It is a lot of conference winners. But I think the national championship ranks supreme to all of them.

 Q. (Indiscernible)? 
 CAM NEWTON: In 2006? I was thinking 2005. Oh, okay, yeah. I do actually. I just answered the question about that. 
 I think watching that game, it really raises the bar for any national championship to be played in any game in the near future, for this year, next year, the year after that because everybody is going to revert back to saying I just hope it is one of those close games.
 Is it fun to play in when it is real close? No. But to watch one, it just keeps everybody on the edge of their seat and that's what the fans want to watch. As a player, I'm not hoping for one of those games.

 Q. (Question about Vince Young in Rose Bowl)? 
 CAM NEWTON: My fingers are crossed. I'm praying a lot that I will play like he did during that game.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 CAM NEWTON: I think that's been the hardest thing for me to do, especially with a person that is very goofy. It is just always trying to have fun.
 But the things I wish we could do and get away with, I can't do it no more. I have embraced this whole role because it is something that everybody signed up to be. But a lot of signed up people aren't really committed to living the lifestyle -- a very private lifestyle. Is it fair? No, it is not fair. You go from being a regular guy to being a role model for so many people, people you may never meet but they know everything about you.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: It really is. Just to be labeled with those guys are in the same boat. I'm just honored and flattered.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I have met Bo and Pat. I haven't seen Charles yet. I have heard he was at a lot of our games. But we just haven't ran into each other yet. 
 My fingers are crossed.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I pay attention to LaMichael and vice versa. We have been talking. Do we talk about the game? No. I don't think anybody was talking about any type of football. We was just enjoying each other's company doing that. We were just trying to see who each other really were. 
 Not only us, I was trying to find out about Kevin and also Andrew because the only time you see these guys is on ESPN. I'm pretty sure it is something that sets them apart rather than just the good football player. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: That's another trick question, man. I can't give you my study guide. I'm pretty sure somebody is going to hear this and say he's going to do this. I can't do that.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: We have been trying to find flaws in their defense. I'm not sure that they have found any because they are so good. They get labeled that because of their offense. I said it once and I will say it again: They are very underrated. They are a very good defense with a lot of good athletes on their defense, and we are just going to try to exploit them as best as we can. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Just watching ESPN, you can't even watch ESPN during the whole segment without them mentioning this football game. It makes it different. 
 But for us, we just have to put our blinders on and not fall victim to the high points surrounding this game. We have to continue to play the football game we have been playing and that's all we know is Auburn football.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I was shocked about that, but I respect his decision. I have met him and I know what type of person he is during the short time that I did see him.
 Me being a fan of Mr. Luck, just going to support him as whatever he does and wish him the best in his career.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Kind of. But that's something that I haven't even really stepped into to try to think about. 
 My sole focus right now is planning January 10th.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Because our mascot is the Tigers. And you can't go around saying "Go Tigers" because that's another team's war chant. So we have to have something that sets us apart from any other school. So we got to have our own war chant. And our war chant is "War Eagle." We get that a lot about y'all are Tigers, why do y'all say "War Eagle"? That's just our war chant. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: It would mean a lot. And for us to bring something like that back to Auburn, it would be something very great.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: It has been an interesting trip so far. There's fans from Oregon and there's fans from Auburn. And they are going to make their presence felt who they are rooting for. We sense that just walking around and just being around this area.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I think it would be an easy analogy if you just kicked everybody out of this room and just listened to it. That's how Brenham sounds. Every once in a while you hear a moo and train, but that's about it. 
 Brenham, Texas. Shout out to Brenham, Texas. Old Brenham. That's something that I didn't look forward to going to. But I learned so much about myself and about things that are very important to me during that time.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I was very immature during my early career playing college football. I will be the first person to say I wasn't ready to play football at the time. And I was too naive to even think that way, but now I'm looking back at it. I wasn't ready to play football during the time I was at Florida. 
 And I learned so much under Tim Tebow because he just went about preparing or just living the lifestyle of somebody that everybody looks at. But it doesn't detour him from who he really is. Just going out and doing what he does and being an impact on everybody who is watching him in a positive way.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: That was so nice of my teammates to say something like that. That was probably the most sincere thing I have heard all night from my teammates. 
 But for me, I don't think that I could change around these guys because they will let me know if I have changed. But I'm just going to continue to be the person that got me to this point. When I get complacent, I'm just going to try to strive for greatness. 
 This team is also going to try to do the same thing because we see the job and we see the opportunity that we put ourselves in to do something very great for us and also for Auburn.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: If they're in my possession, they are probably at my house. I don't know where they are because I don't do the interior designing at my house. I leave that job up to my mother and my grandmother.

 Q. (Question about moped)? 
 CAM NEWTON: That's something that gets me from A to B. Have I been riding the moped with the cold weather? No. But I have been trying -- I have been trying to attract attention in other places.
 It is very good to have, especially with the traffic that Auburn can get. So it gets me in and out of traffic, it gets me to class and back very fast.

 Q. Do you have a significant other?
 CAM NEWTON: No, I don't. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Really? Bring them up. Line them up. I'm just teasing.
 I would be lying to you if I didn't have a person that I could just call at any time and find comfort. I have that. But are we ready to go out on that limb and say this is what we want to do? No, I'm not ready.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: There are some people in the room, I really can't. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Something I really enjoy, just to see it. If it was up to me, I would probably have so many other people on that front page because they deserve it just like all the other people that's on the front page. That's something I look at and I think that's something so many people have rewarded me with and I take it with great honor. 
 I'm screaming internally right now, right now. I'm just screaming.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Not only just my father, there are so many other people behind the scenes that have so much -- did so much for me, mentally, physically, just to get me over the hump. So many people were in front that have great ability. I had a great supporting cast to let me open my eyes to the fact that I have something -- or I have something that everybody has, but I can take it to the next level.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I think it means a lot, just walking around and getting all the support. I really didn't know that everybody kept up with football like that.
 But for anybody to put on a T.V. and just to hear somebody representing where they're from and not being shy about it, that's a big deal where I'm from.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I made a huge leap, a catapult, whatever you want to call it. I had ambitions to be on this stage, yes, but I thank God every single day that my mom is the first person to tell you that "I knew that you were going to do something. I just didn't know it was going to come that fast." Especially where I was, junior college and seeing how much support was out there. Now the support is you are comparable to anywhere else. This is the biggest stage that college has to offer. And it is something great to be a part of.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: Those guys do not get enough credit like they are supposed to. For me, they give me a hard time for getting all the credit. It is kind of something that's very ironic about that. 
 I would be a fool not to even mention my offensive line, those guys are excellent guys and just to put all of them in one room is just like a whole Cartoon Network. Everybody has a different mind-set. But also at the end of the day when we are on that football field, everybody gets the job done. Everybody knows what the task is at hand.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I wouldn't say pressure because I think that's a poor choice of words. 
 I just try to make people accountable. If the person knows that if they don't do this right, I think -- I try to make it as if they have ownership with it. Because we'll play just not to determine the fact of a football game. You have to just -- everybody has to have something and has a hand in it to get in the national championship. It is 11 guys on the football field at one time on each time. And it is going to be 11 guys that's going to be a part of making something that everybody would celebrate about.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 CAM NEWTON: I think the fans will relish the two-minute heroics. But for me, I'm hoping that this game is stress-free as possible because I think we work without stress during the season.
