   ED SABOL: I dreamed a dream, the impossible dream. I dreamed the impossible dream, and I'm living it right this minute. I said that twice because at my age, you know, your memory starts to go a little bit. In case I forgot it, I would have a back-up. Now if you can figure that out, you're pretty smart.  
 I have been to many of these events in the past, usually shooting a camera and the enshrines would usually come up and most of them would say pretty much the same thing. They would congratulate their pro coach, their college coach, their high school coach, their grammar school coach, and even sometimes their 80-pound coach.  
 But I didn't have the luxury of the advice for all of those wonderful coaches, but I do have some fans. And those fans are all you people sitting out there in those seats.  
 But of course this honor tonight really goes to NFL Films. I just happen to be accepting all the accolades and all of the other things that go with it. But is has been really exceptional?  
 I just want to say one thing, I've been very, very happy and very proud to have been your boss for all these years. You're a great bunch of people dedicated and loyal and hard-working, and you're the reason I'm sitting up here.  
 So as we get to the end of this, I just want to say thank you, which really doesn't mean much when I say thank you. It's not adequate. Al Jolson, who is an old-time entertainer way before your time, when he finished his act he used to say, "Folks, you ain't seen nothing yet."  
 So I'm just going to say, thank you, God bless you, good luck and thank you again.
