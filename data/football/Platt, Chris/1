Oklahoma State - 24, Baylor - 35
Q. Chris, Seth talked about it, you had had some drops.  How much was that in your mind and how big was this to come out and have this kind of game tonight?
CHRIS PLATT: I kind of like tried to put it behind me so it doesn't bother me in the future games.  I knew I had to come out here and do what I had to do to help the offense keep running and score.
Q. You had been trying to get loose and that's what you guys do, you beat them up in the middle and then you get loose.  What was it like to finally just have that type play to get loose like that?  What does that mean to you and also the offense going down the road?
CHRIS PLATT: It feels great.  I probably haven't opened up like that since high school, so it kind of felt great to open up and see nothing but grass and the touchdown zone.
Q. The double move, have you been doing that all night or did you just happen to call it on that play?
CHRIS PLATT: I've been doing it ever since I got here, so I kind of perfected it.
Q. Without KD tonight for the second half for most of the game, what was the mentality of the receivers to go out there and not miss a beat?
CHRIS PLATT: It was just next man up.  I mean, we couldn't just sit there and be sad about it.  He would want us to go out there and keep doing what we're doing, so that's what we did.
Q. You and Ish came in in the same recruiting class, a lot of hype about you guys.  But if there was a game to go on both of your resumÃ©s, it would be tonight.  What was it like seeing him have that success early and you in the second half have success?
CHRIS PLATT: It was great, because we both came in at the same time.  We red-shirted and we went through all that, Gogi (ph) and all that.  We sat there and watched each other struggle through everything, so it was a good thing to see him succeed today.
