 Q.  Have you been Disneyland before?  
BRANDON BELL: I've been to Disneyland.  It was my first time out there.  I haven't been to Disney World before, when I was in second grade, so it's definitely been awhile, and that was cool.   
 Q.  Have you ever been to Disneyland?  
BRANDON BELL: First time at Disneyland, yeah.   
 Q.  Talk about the opportunity to come out here.  
BRANDON BELL: It's been great, really.  It's my last college football game.  Couldn't have scripted it any better, going out to the Rose Bowl, coming out here, trying to go out with a bang, so it's been fun.   
 Q.  How much does -- inaudible.  
BRANDON BELL: We're just appreciative of everything.  We're not in the past but obviously where this program came from and where I come from, just appreciate every day I'm out here and the opportunity we have on January 2.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, you know, Coach always preaches one game at a time.  This is what we do.   
As the season went on, probably always said after the Minnesota win, we came together.  I just -- my confidence in this theme grew that much.  I wasn't sure about specifically Rose Bowl but I knew that if we handle our business the right way each week, we could be at this point, being 11-2, possibility of being 12-2.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's great.  That one in particular, we've been trying to get those guys for, at least since I've been here, four years, and finally the work paid off and everything.  Everything lined up and we got the win.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I mean, this is the granddaddy of them all, as we all know.  And it was just a game in Beaver Stadium -- as much as I love playing in Beaver Stadium, this is different.  The weather will definitely be different.   
 Q.  (How much is all of the media a distraction)?  
BRANDON BELL: I wouldn't call it distracting.  We've guys on the green screen, we're just trying to enjoy every moment we get out here.  It's a little early, but you've got to love it.  You guys got a job to do.  We got our job to do.  It all makes for a better game.   
I mean, it's actually funny.  As much as football players say they hate the media, if I wasn't playing football, it's probably what I would be doing, kind of media skills.  I appreciate you guys.  It's all fun to me.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I wouldn't say just strictly that but definitely they are kind of known to get their receivers more involved.  That's why you probably find more receivers on a Pac 12 roster with more average catches throughout the season than probably a few other conferences.  But I wouldn't say they are strictly just known for that.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: No, definitely not.  I wouldn't say it is.  Football nowadays, everybody's good, no matter what conference.  They all can get it done.   
 Q.  (Would you be a journalist or a broadcaster if you weren't a football player)?  
BRANDON BELL: Not specifically journalism.  I just graduated last week, communications major.  I'd probably be more behind the scenes in the production field.  But I probably could be a broadcaster, I don't know.   
 Q.  (How do you think Sam Darnold matches up to Trace McSorley?  Will it be a good matchup)?  
BRANDON BELL: Oh, I think it will be.  You know, not the same athlete but Darnold can definitely move and make plays with his feet.   
So that would definitely be -- Trace would definitely complement that, and when we go against them.  They both kind of give the ball a quick release, a controlled passing game, so that will be good, as well.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, a lot of the spread teams, 11-personnel kind of deal, that's what a lot of teams are doing.  You know, getting the running backs in the zone game, quarterback option, their quarterback doesn't keep it as much but they can definitely do it if they wanted.  I mean, they are similar to a lot of teams, yeah.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I would say so.  I'm just trying to live one day at a time and enjoy it while I do it.  Right now I'm focused on the Rose Bowl.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: They definitely get rid of the ball quick -- and whenever a quarterback gets rid of the ball quick, you have to move around and make plays.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I'm definitely excited.  We have all the confidence in the D-line to get through, somebody bust through and get the quarterback scrambling.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I'd say we're always trying to get to the ball.  No matter what, blitz or not a blitz, you have to look like that to get to the ball.   
 Q.  How do you combat a quarterback when you know -- inaudible.  
BRANDON BELL: You've just got to tighten up the coverage and break down the ball quick.  If you can't get your quarterback, get your hands up on the D-line, bat balls down, things like that.  That will be a challenge.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: No, California's nice, you've got a lot of palm trees.  But if I had to choose between California and -- where you from?  Outside Philly, PA?  Outside Valley Forge, PA, you've got to go with that.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Probably just got to rally to him, come at him from all different angles.  Make sure our angles are precise.  That's probably the most important thing.  You can't think about it too much because then they will make plays, freeze you up.  But trying to make sure our angles of pursuit are precise.   
 Q.  Offensive line did a great job --  
BRANDON BELL: Well, we always focus on stopping the run first.  We can stop the run on any team, kind of make them less versatile, you know, that would be the key, and then getting the pressure off our D-line and then maybe bringing a blitz here or there, that's how we go about it.   
 Q.  Talk about going against a running back like Ronald Jones.  
BRANDON BELL: Ronald Jones definitely can make anybody miss.  He's probably one of the best backs we've gone against this year, definitely very shifty.  All the backs, they get downhill, get their yards.  O-Line does a great job for them.  So it will definitely be a challenge.   
 Q.  (What do you see in USC's offense)?  
BRANDON BELL: USC, their offense, definitely a ton of athletes, speedy players, offensive line is big and fast.  They can move very well for their size.  I think they run their offense pretty well.   
I think the quarterback does a good job rallying those guys.  Pretty much we just got to get to the ball, be faster and be stronger and more physical than they will, and I think that will handle everything.   
 Q.  Who would you guys say they compare to?  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, I'd say as far as their size, offensive line, we've definitely faced some pretty big offensive linemen.  They are pretty athletic, though.  Might be better than a few O-lines we've faced.  We are confident in our preparation, the way we go about things and when it comes game day, we'll be fired up and ready to go.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Our defense is I'd say very opportunistic.  Anybody's number could be called and they are ready to make the play.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's been great.  First half of the season, I missed a little bit and I was able to sit back and really watch it kind of grow and everybody, the whole team matured and really came together.  I think that's what brought us here now is you've got a lot of young guys stepped up and matured, with the help of some older guys.  Like I said, anybody who's number was called, they will be ready to step up.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: You know, I think it was easier this year, year three, the coaching staff.  Everybody's been through, I wouldn't say dismal, but regular seasons, average seasons, 7-4, 8-5 and everybody knew we had to do more.  Coach Franklin preached that all season, got to do more.  Nobody's ever been to a Big Ten Championship, so you've got to do more.  That's all we know, at least, you've got to do more.  Everybody bought into that and put the work in and here we are.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's beautiful.  For my last college game, going out with a bang, leave it all on the field, for my teammates, I couldn't write a better story.   
 Q.  How would you say their quarterback compares?  
BRANDON BELL: I would say he's a little combination of a lot of guys.  He's a quick-release guy, but can move around almost like a duel-threat kind of guy.  Moves around a lot better than you want.  He's still a big guy, too.  He'll be a challenge to kind of keep him under control, keep the passing game under control, but we're looking forward to it.   
 Q.  Talk about --  
BRANDON BELL: What was the last part of that?   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Linebacker unit is probably the reason that that attracted me here.  I was recruited by Coach Vanderlinden.  He had a big helping hand in that and that was kind of what he preached to me in my high school during the recruiting days.   
You want to be a part of that.  You want to be a part of the names, the generation of athletes you're talking about.  Hopefully one day I'll be in the conversation with some of those greats.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I would say we won't change differently.  We won't change but they definitely have a little bit different style.  25 is definitely a 0 to 60 guy in like two seconds, you know, and make you miss and get off the field for 80, quick.   
And 22 definitely has speed, as well.  I would say his cuts aren't as threatening or as scary as 25.  But both those guys behind the O-Line, a good O-Line like that can definitely hurt you no matter what.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, O-Line, you ask any running back, they will all tell you it starts up front.  The O-Line has been solid, obviously the passing game, as well.  We let the least amount of sacks in the FBS or somewhere up there, and obviously the running game helps, too.  Give any one of those guys a little crack, and they will get through it.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Yeah, I was thinking that, kind of a lot of different emotions.  Kind of sad it's my last game but at the same time I'm pumped because it's the Rose Bowl.  Kind of got to balance that a little bit, but I'm sure kickoff, I'll be everywhere.  I'm taking it all in one day at a time and I'm just appreciating it all.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, pretty much Coach Franklin tells us just let's focus on, and whatever anybody has going on after, which in my case, I'm done with school, graduated.  So all my marbles are on the Rose Bowl, try to go out with a bang.  Hopefully if I play good here, it will help me out with that.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Movie?  I'm a movie, kinda, sorta kind of guy -- I watch a lot of movies.  If I had to pick one, I would say (indiscernible).   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Producer.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: The new one or just in general?  Probably rate it.  I mean, it's beautiful.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's beautiful.  I've talked to a lot of Uber drivers around here and most of them are either writers or something like that.  He says nobody is actually from L.A.   That's kind of funny.  The one guy was Indiana.  I was talking about the Indiana game and he was like, Oh, yeah, I'm from Bloomsburg, yada, yada, yada.  It's cool.  I'm definitely going to come back.   
I said before, if I wasn't playing football, I would probably be having the roles reversed right now, so we'll see.   
 Q.  USC was 1-3 --  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, for us, obviously we know no matter, usually the fans say, lose games or not, but you put the work in, you know what your team is capable of.  Obviously for the fans, got pretty dark for both teams.  But you ask any team, wouldn't have had it any other way if we would have both ended up here.  Obviously the playoffs were a possibility, but couldn't pass up a Rose Bowl at the same time.   
 Q.  On Monday, what thoughts will be going through your mind?  
BRANDON BELL: I'm sure a lot will be going through my mind.  My brother always texts me:  Take it all in, relax.  As soon as I step on that field before kickoff or right before the first play, I'll take a quick 360 real quick and I'll take it all in and get ready to play.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Definitely, definitely.  He moves around a lot better than you want him to for a big guy.  He's still a big guy.  He gets the ball out quick.  Like you said, he scrambles around.  O-Line doesn't do as good a job as usual, he has the ability to move around and make plays happen.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, you ask Coach Franklin, I think he would say we did, but hey, that's the way the cards fell.  And over here now, we're playing, we're appreciating it all and at the end of the day, it's just the granddaddy of them all, so we're happy.   
 Q.  Growing up watching the Rose Bowl, what do you remember?  
BRANDON BELL: Definitely, I remember, actually I think it was the 2008 or 2009 game, the last time we came here.  I just went out to eat and I was rushing -- I wanted to rush back to make sure I seen the game, you know what I mean, on New Year's Day, or the day after.   
If you've ever been a college football fan, you know what the Rose Bowl in, no matter what the year or who is playing in it.  That's one of the games that you watch.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Oh, of course.  Obviously the competitor in me wants to win because I play for Penn State.  It's just so iconic.  Thrilled to be here.  I wouldn't have it any other way.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I'd say to stop those big plays, continue to be aggressive.   Can't get on our heels and that's exactly where they want you.  They are a lot of quick guys, fast guys.  As soon as you get the defense on their heels, you know, boom, zooming past you.   
To me, just got to be aggressive, take our shots and get 11 hands to the ball and we'll like our case.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I'd say just sticking to our keys, which is just being physical, being fast and getting to the ball, being hungry.  The end of the day, football, ask any coach, you make a mistake, you make it at full speed.  We kind of rely on that and we like where we are.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's huge.  Obviously to get to where we had to be, we had to be one of the top teams in the Big Ten.  We've had to trust in the process and everything like that and get everything lined up right and we got it done.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I wouldn't say singer.  I rap a little bit, too.  I like Travis Scott before the games.  He's a rapper out of the Houston area, really getting popular these days.  I like Travis Scott.  Anything 21 Savage right now.   
 Q.  Can you rap something right now?  
BRANDON BELL: All right.  The Travis Scott song is Goose Bumps, right (singing).   
 Q.  In the locker room, who is somebody that listens to something totally opposite?  
BRANDON BELL: Totally opposite, I don't know.  I don't think nobody is a real serious like -- actually, Strickland (ph) is kind of a head-smasher kind of guy.  That's kind of opposite of me.  He's into the heavy metal kind of.  But it's not a bad thing.  Just probably different from me.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Yeah, man, everybody's amped up.  Glad to be out here.  Definitely different from PA weather, until today kind of.  Sunny and palm trees, glad to be out here.  We're just taking it in.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Trust me, we always get rain.  I think it's actually snowing back at school now.  We're glad to be here, like I said.   
First time on West Coast in general.  First time in California.  It's been fun.  Disneyland was fun.  Practicing out here in the palm trees and everything, was fun, too.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I hate to base everything off TV but that's the only thing I can base it off of.  It's been fun, though.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Yeah, I mean, Disneyland was fun.  I know the first time out there, obviously I've seen a few like celebrities and stuff come through the hotel, the basketball players.  It's kind of funny.  But that's at school, too.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: That would be dope if I could meet Kobe.  That would be kind of a dream come true.  I'm sure everybody loves Kobe out here.  I was actually a huge Kobe fan.  He's actually from PA, right, you know what I'm saying.  Kobe would be dope.   
 Q.  How is the food?  
BRANDON BELL: Food has been great.  Obviously had to try In-N-Out Burger.  We actually went to Roscoe's last night, so I had to get that checked off the list.  That was good.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Just a combination of chicken and waffles in Pennsylvania.  Down south, maybe.  Everything's been good so far, though.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Yeah, it would kind of be everywhere.  Adrenaline will be high.  Emotions will be running.  I said before, it will be my last college game, so I'll be kind of down about that, but then I'll be pumped because it's the Rose Bowl.  I'm sure I'll be all mixed up everywhere.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, envisioned it, but obviously I've been watching college football since forever and seeing a Rose Bowl, it's kind of surreal right now to actually be here.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I mean, I'd say my big brother.  He got me into football.  My football family is kind of a basketball family.  Big brother, older brother, kind of got me into it, and he's been with me since then kind of make sure my mind's right before the games and stuff like that.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Happy new year's.  Happy holidays.  Appreciate all the support, my family back home, you know I love y'all.  Mays, Landon, New Jersey, down in south Jersey, appreciate everybody, all the support throughout my career and ongoing.  Love you guys and happy new year.   
 Q.  What's your driving force?  
BRANDON BELL: My driving force, I would say at first it's kind of the love of the game.  Obviously my brother got me into football young and I fell in love with it.  I remember I was a little kid watching ESPN Classic games from like 1998 in like 2005, when I was like eight years old.  So I always kind of loved the game, watching the old classic Rose Bowl games when I was young.   
Then my family, when college football happened, it kind of gets a little tougher.  It's not as easy as high school.  I leaned on my family a lot and I kind of do it for them.  Just the love of the game, family, God, you know, kind of give Him all the glory.  Got to, actually.  That's how I do it.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Definitely, you know, get to college, it gets tough.  I lean on my family, and my family is all a family of faith, so we're a Christian family.  And my sister relayed that to me, you know, God be the glory through the tough and the thin, or whatever -- I can't think.  That's what I mean, high school, coming to a freshman is tough and you really realize what's important to you, especially the older you get.   
Now I'm a senior, I've kind of got a better perspective on life and everything and just be appreciative on everything.  Being hurt, that was tough for me and that's when I really leaned on them obviously and stayed prayed up and look where we are now, so I can't say much more.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Yeah, I mean, I'd say it's been definitely progress on an incline, which is great, for myself and more importantly for this team, definitely.  Definitely you ask any of the senior guys here in my class, our freshman football camp was shaky, man.  I was questioning myself, should I be playing college football, all that, coaches, all that stuff.   
I'm glad I stuck through it.  My teammates helped me out and I'm just glad I came to Penn State.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I think it's great.  I think you ask any of our older guys, we are not dwelling in the past but we appreciate where we came from and hopefully, I'd like to say for the young guys, maybe they go through that, that this is a Penn State that they can get accustomed to, that they have got to push for.   
Every year, the standards are set high each year for these young guys, these freshmen and sophomore guys.  The team is going to be in their hands that in a little bit.  Definitely this is a standard for them I'd like to leave.   
 Q.  How is the buildup?  
BRANDON BELL: The buildup is tough but at the same time I can't complain being about here in Los Angeles.  I definitely want to get to the game but I'm not rushing it.  I'm appreciating everything we're doing, everything moment out here, really.  It's my first time out here.   
I've been to Disney World in Florida, but I was like sick.  First time in Disneyland.   
 Q.  What did you like better?  
BRANDON BELL: I'd say Disneyland.  Everybody turns into a little kid again, running around with the Fast Pass and everything.  That was cool.  Just kind of being out here with the palm trees and the nice weather.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Oh, this is definitely helpful.  Definitely a little bit easier on the body.  Get some time to rest up, see family a little bit and obviously the more time to prepare is better, watch the film over and over again.  Obviously both teams come out with some new things, but that's always fun.  Defense has to react to it and we'll be prepared.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: It's surreal to actually be here.  Watching college football since I was a young kid and seeing the Rose Bowl and now being here in a press conference for the Rose Bowl, Media Day, it's obviously surreal, and when I get out there, I'm going to take a 360, take it all in before the first snap.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Not really, I don't know.  I think we get to visit the stadium beforehand.  I haven't seen it.  I don't know what it's like besides off the TV but it should be good.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Kind of just highlights.  Obviously being on the East Coast, time difference and everything, game is a little later.  But I mean, with USC being the iconic program it is, you definitely hear about it more often when their season started off shaky like ours and they got hot.  That's kind of in the news a little bit, so you see that.  That's probably all, really.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I think just their play-making ability.  No matter who has the ball, really, which is the scary part, definitely be a challenge.  Quarterback could throw it to any of the receivers or the dangerous tailback they have.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Oh, definitely.  I think you ask any one of the teams, they are appreciative of where we came from, not dwelling in the past, but they all know what the past was like and we're all happy to be here.   
 Q.  What does it say about --  
BRANDON BELL: Just the circumstances didn't matter to us, no matter what was thrown upon us or the trials and tribulations we had, we put it aside and came together and got the job done.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Definitely a lot.  That's what he preaches to us.  Outside, anybody outside our meeting room, whatever, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  We know we can control and handle our business.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: I'd say everybody wants to be that guy, that clutch guy that makes the play, offense, defense, and I think that goes to coaching, Coach Huff preaches that a lot.  Make the big play in your lane.  Make the big block, which is really just a normal block that you have to do.  I think everybody took home to that and everybody wants to be perfect in their game.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Definitely, definitely.  When we first started watching film, it was kind of like, oh, the freshman took over.  It's not what it looks like.  He makes a lot of savvy plays, and obviously they have been on a hot streak, as well and that's definitely due to his contribution.   
 Q.  (How excited is Koa and has he helped you guys since you've been here)?  
BRANDON BELL: Koa's been awesome.  Where's he at?  I don't know where he is.  He's obviously excited, since we've known we were coming out here.  His family is great.  Got to see his family.  They are always around, even back at school.  He gave us the dos and don't of the areas.  Definitely pointed us to some good food.  Koa's awesome.   
 Q.  What have you learned most?  
BRANDON BELL: What have I learned most?  From Koa?  I guess I'd say just enjoy yourself while you're out here.   
 Q.  Did you go to Roscoe's?  
BRANDON BELL: Went there last night.  Roscoe's was awesome.  I had to get the Obama Special with an extra wing.  Actually Koa told me, he told me that.  He told me:  Get that extra wing because you're going to want that extra chicken wing.  Usually Obama Special is just one waffle and three wings, but got to get that extra wing, so that was good.  Obama Special with the extra wing.  I'm probably not allowed to say that, college, NCAA's, probably can't give any like shout-outs.   
 Q.  (No mic).  
BRANDON BELL: Koa will definitely be ready.  Preparation is the same.  Nobody is really breaking a sweat even though we have players out and things like that.  We're good.
