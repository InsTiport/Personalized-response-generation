Florida State - 3, Boston College - 35
Q. How's your shoulder?
ANTHONY BROWN: It's fine.  I went back in the game.
Q. (Inaudible)?
ANTHONY BROWN: Yeah, I landed on it a little weird and it felt a little weird.  So I had to breathe for a second and then I went back in.
Q. Just in terms of (Inaudible)?
ANTHONY BROWN: It was a huge team win, but then again, it was just another game that we had to win.  So we have to continue this ball and keep it rolling.  In two weeks we have another huge opponent coming in here in N.C. State, and we've just got to keep going to them.
Q. The FSU head coach said you guys had some trick plays up your sleeve.  What do you guys plan on doing or do you plan on having the same momentum going into next year to be able to beat such teams?
ANTHONY BROWN: Honestly, we started off strong, and we just attacked it.  The trick play, the reverse to Jeff, it was huge.  I mean, trick plays are trick plays.  Everybody has them.  It's just when you run them when they're effective, and you've got to keep going.
