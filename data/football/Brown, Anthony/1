Wake Forrest - 27 - Boston College - 24
Q. (Question).
ANTHONY BROWN: Like you said, it is some self inflicted wounds. Some penalties that didn't need to happen.
Otherwise, I don't even know what to say about it.
Q. (Question).
ANTHONY BROWN: Just knowing we had more downs and stuff and a whole game left is huge.
Throwing the first pick was just misread it. Had a chance to get back down, and I didn't.
But moving on from that, it was just a snap and clear mentality. As they always preach to me, understanding that we have the rest of the game to play. Next play mentality, and just kept going.
Q. (Question).
ANTHONY BROWN: I would say just scoring in the red zone. We got to finish. Got down there I believe3 times and came away with no points, so I would say that is a huge factor in this game.
And we had a lot of self inflicted wounds. Like you said, we were clicking today, but we don't finish drives like that and it can hurt you. As you said, we win most categories, but then not the points. Then people don't look at it and it doesn't add up.
I would say just finishing drives is going to be huge. I know we will. But I wish it could have happened today.
We can't worry about it right now. We have to put it behind us and move on from it and get better from it.
Q. (Question).
ANTHONY BROWN: I thought he caught it. I didn't see it after.
