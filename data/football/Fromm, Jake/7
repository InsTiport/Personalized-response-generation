Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Feels good.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it's an awesome experience and one I'm definitely looking forward to.  I feel really good about the group of guys I'm going into battle with, and I hope it goes our way.
Q. Jake, how many times have you heard that the moment is going to be too big for Jake Fromm because he's just a true freshman?  How many times have you heard that?
JAKE FROMM: Honestly not a whole lot.  You try to block everything out.  You just kind of go out and play a football game.  And at the end of the day, you just play.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah, I feel like I've been through a couple big moments and a couple situations.  At the end of the day, you just play a football game with your boys and go out and have fun.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: The Benz, it's just incredible, just an awesome, awesome place to play.  And I couldn't be more excited about the guys I'm going out with, and I'm just ready to play a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: There's been a couple moments.  Definitely the touchdown at Notre Dame to Terry was an awesome, cool moment, but there's been a couple of them.  And definitely we'd make it Sony and the offensive line we have and Javon and Terry and all the guys we have outside.
Those moments have come all year just because of those guys and how they help me play.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah, we're ready to go.  We're down, again focused in, trying to rest up and really try to stay focused any way we can.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's been a crazy ride, up and down.  And I couldn't have written things if I wanted to.  It's kind of crazy the way it turned out, but we're excited about it.  I'm excited about it and ready to just go out and play a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah.  You know, it's just kind of fun, and I really don't know how to really describe it.  But an awesome experience and one I'm looking forward to.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah.  Coach Smart recruited me to Alabama, and when he got the job here at the University of Georgia, I grew up a Georgia boy.  It's where I always wanted to go, where I always wanted to play.  Now I'm here playing football for the Dogs and couldn't be more excited about it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Honestly, Dog Nation, they travel so well.  So thankful for the fans we have.  There's been a couple games on the road and definitely at the Rose Bowl and many games where I thought this is a home game for us even though we're not at home.
And it's an awesome, incredible feeling and really helps me to making calls and checks at the line.  And I can't wait to see how many Dog fans we have in the Benz.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: That was awesome.  It's always good to see the fans wherever we go.  They travel so well, and they just do so much for us.  Awesome experience and really warms your heart.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it's definitely challenging.  It comes with the challenge.  But at the end of the day, the process never changes.  You go and you start and you do what you do week in and week out and hope it pays off for you when it comes to game time.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know Alabama is Alabama.  But at the end of the day, you're playing a football game.  Really doesn't matter who you're playing.  The process never changes.  You go in and you do your work and hope it pays off for you on Saturday.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: As far as the preparation goes, it's exactly the same.  The process, it never changes for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: We obviously want to bring it home, too.  But as far as the pressure goes, we're really just kind of focused on ourselves.  Just how we can get better here in the short period of time and how much film we can watch and what we can do to just get a little advantage.  That's what we're focused on and hope it pays off for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: I think every single game we play, it definitely helps us for the next one as far as the big games and we get to see which guys show up in big moments.  A lot of guys have.  And it really helps us kind of find out who the guys are.  At the end of the day, guys are going to be ready because we have been put in those situations before.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Hey, let's go.  This is our drive.  We got to score, guys.  We had an unfortunate turn of events.  But at the end of the day, we had to score.  And it went down and we did, and thank God we did.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  Obviously winning obviously helps with recruiting.  And it's good for the University of Georgia.  Good for the State of Georgia.  Any time we can get Georgia kids to stay hope and get some help from other states, that's great.  And I hope the University of Georgia, the football program stays great for a long time.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: There's not too many times where me and Coach Chaney aren't on the same change.  Every call that usually comes in, let's go, let's roll with it.
But as far as the play calling goes, it's great.  I love it.  And I feel like I can make any play a great play, and that's what I love about this system.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, not a whole lot.  Obviously they're a great football team.  But at the end of the day, I feel comfortable if we go out and play our game, things will go our way.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Oh, absolutely.
Q. What did you think about that?
JAKE FROMM: I love it.  Anytime Dog Nation wants to come cheer us on, I love it.  It definitely warms my heart to see them out there in freezing cold conditions.  I love it.  Thank you guys for coming out and supporting us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It takes a lot.  Coach Smart has been talking about all week, what are you willing to give up for this opportunity.  I think guys are starting to get it and really trying to focus on even more than we have and really trying to kind of get down to them.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Obviously that's always the end goal and always the end plan.  But who knows?  I was just kind of taking it one day at a time, never trying to make anything too farfetched.  And I don't know.  I mean, honestly, at the time, I was just taking one day at a time and home hoping for the best.
You know, obviously they're big up front.  And systematically, they're kind of summoned our defense.  But obviously they're a great defense, number one in a lot of rankings.  And we just have to go out and play our game and hope it works out for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, they're really similar to our guys, play a lot of similar coverages.  But at the end of the day, just hope your guys make more plays than their guys, and I think they will.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Jalen, he is obviously a great football player.  I watched a lot of Alabama football last year, and he plays great.  He commands his guys, and he does really well in the offense they have for him.
And at the end of the day, he's a great player, and I'm really excited for the opportunity to go up against him.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah, absolutely.  Him doing it as a freshman definitely kind of makes you feel like you can do it, too.  He's been a great help for me.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: At the end of the day, score more points than the other team.  We just kind have to play our brand of food ball, be physical and fly around and play for 60 minutes.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah.  You come in and, coming from the West Coast to the East Coast, make sure you rest.  Coach has done a great job with that.  Come in and get extra film time and at the end of the day, go out and have your four days of practice you always do.  The process really never changes for us.  Kind of go out, and we're going to do what we do.
Q. Jake, a lot of guys say when they think about you that they don't consider you a freshman anymore.  Do you feel like a freshman?
JAKE FROMM: I just kind of feel -- honestly, you know, sometimes I really don't feel like a freshman at all.  The guys really don't treat me as one.  Just go out and play football.  You come into work every day, get treated like everyone else.  And I love it, love the way the guys treat me.  At the end of the day, kind of go out and play a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Nick and Sony, they've been a huge help for me all year.  They've definitely helped me out in a lot of situations.  At the end of the day, it's really easy to hand the ball off to them and not have to put so much on me.  They have been awesome, helped me in every single way, and I love it.  They've been a great help.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: One thing I love about Georgia is the high school football.  I think our high school football is one of the best in the country.  I played a lot of great teams in high school and played a lot against really good guys.  And I think that's been a huge help for me in definitely adjusting to the college football level.  That's one thing I really love about Georgia high school football.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah.  I saw that stat on Twitter yesterday.  And it's one thing, you know, to play with them every day, and it's just been awesome.  They've been a huge help to me.  They've been great leaders.  They come into work every single day.  They're the same guys every day.  And that's something that rubs off on me and I hope rubs off on other guys.  When they leave, I hope that we still continue.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, really similar to our defense.  At the end of the day, they're big up front.  And they play a lot of same stuff as our guys.  At the end of the day, you kind of go out, and it's kind of like a practice almost.  I just hope that our guys make more plays than their guys and hope it works out for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's huge.  It's definitely an opportunity for the University of Georgia to win another championship, and I hope our guys aren't taking that lightly.  I'm ready for it and we're ready for it and hope it works out for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  Since you're a little kid, you always dream about winning championships.  And to win a championship at this level for the State of Georgia, University of Georgia, it's something, as a Georgia boy growing up, it's something you always dream about.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Hopefully we bit off some momentum in the last 30 minutes in two overtimes we had in the Rose Bowl and hope we come out on fire and play for a full 60 minutes.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Take advantage of runs.  Four, five yards of carry, that's good for us.  And be consistent and not look at the big picture but just worry about what we're doing right now.  Obviously be good throwing the ball.  And I hope we do good at that.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's been a little crazy.  I had a 8:00 a.m. Thursday, whenever that was, and it's been fun but a little tiring.  But definitely going to rest up, and we're ready for it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: I think playing in the Benz before, it definitely helps us a lot, and we'll be definitely really comfortable with it, the whole process that comes along with it.  Coming into the stadium, the locker room, the field, and for me, definitely know where the shot clocks are so I don't have another delay of game again.  But that's one thing.
And I definitely think playing in the Benz before definitely helped us.
Q. Talked to your dad a few days go.  And he was saying how proud he is of you.  Talk about your parents a little bit.
JAKE FROMM: I love my parents.  Mom and dad and my brothers.  My whole family, I love them all.  They've always supported me even more than I could have ever imagined.  I'm just so thankful for them and all that they've given me.  And just thank you for the opportunity asking about my parents because I love them to death.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Hopefully a huge crowd.  Usually don't involve me a whole lot.  Kind of never know sometimes, but I usually always see them after the game, which is awesome.  Hopefully have a crowd.  Definitely had a crowd in the Rose Bowl.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's been huge.  People texting me left and right.  People talking about the game, talking about this, talking about that.  And it's been awesome to kind of know you have the support from your hometown.  And yeah, just the whole experience.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Coach Lassiter, he's always been there for me.  Usually text on a daily basis.  And Coach Lassiter, he's been an awesome figure in my life.  So thankful for him.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Usually what's ever on my Apple music shuffle.  My brothers do a lot with downloading the music.  Usually country music and Eric Church and Thomas Rhett and those guys.  They have some great music.  Listen to them.  I mix a rap in there, a little gospel music, and usually it works out for me.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Oh, I love music and I love singing.  I'm not very good at it, but I love doing it.
Q. Jake, that last drive in regulation, can you talk about that?  Were you surprised that you were able to move down the field like that on them?
JAKE FROMM: It was good for us, but that was the Rose Bowl, and we're kind of focused on this game coming up and kind of getting ready for it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's pretty crazy, but you're here and you're coming to work every day.  You try not to look back.  Always looking forward and just got to get ready for this game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Just kind of use the experiences you have from the previous games to help you through this one.  Really, the process going into it doesn't change so there's no reason for anything during the game to really change.  At the end of the day, it's just a football game.  And I just kind of go out and play and have fun.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Obviously there's a lot of similarities in the two defenses.  They're really good up front.  And at the end of the day, you go out and see what you see and play football.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Thank you, fans, for coming.  Dog Nation is awesome.  And thank you all and go Dogs.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Not a whole lot.  Both are incredible backs.  They obviously have their own little things.  But at the end of the day, having Nick or having Sony in there doesn't change at all for me.  Both are a great help for me on the field.  They're always with me on every check I make.  That's huge for me.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Honestly, all the backs we have, everybody's coming in freshman.  So kind of doesn't make a big difference for us, but it's awesome.  After you see one get a touchdown, it's always good to hand the ball off and see the other get a touchdown.  And I think they do a great job.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Coach Saban, he was awesome in the recruiting process.  Really respect him a lot.  He's a great football coach and a great man.  Coach Smart, he's the one that really recruited me to Alabama.  And when he got the job here at Georgia, I always wanted to come to Georgia.  I was a Georgia boy, and now I'm here playing a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's been huge.  Kind of always being put there, in those situations, it definitely makes every next situation a lot easier, and it's been good for me.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Just kind of go out and, you know, at the end of the day, it's just a football game you play in the backyard with your boys.  At the end of the day, it's just a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Rest has been huge this week.  Make sure you're getting sleep.  Earlier in the week, a lot of guys were still on West Coast time.  Going to bed really late because we couldn't fall asleep.  I was a victim of that, but kind of getting settled in now and getting ready to go.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Obviously they're a great defense with some really good players up front.  But they're really similar to our defense.  And at the end of the day, kind of just see what you see and throw the ball around and hand the ball off and play a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: At the end of the day, you kind of come off the sideline and talk to Coach Chaney and see what he sees and just try to make the little adjustments you can and put the offense in good situations.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You just try to block it out the best you can and, at the end of the day, you kind of go out and play a football game with the boys and go and have fun with it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: One benefit I've had is playing high school football in the state of Georgia.  I think the high school football in Georgia is some of the best in the country.  And definitely playing against good football programs and good teams and good players has definitely helped me walk in and play and kind of get used to the speed.
And I definitely think playing good high school football has been a huge help to me.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, in high school, we definitely threw it around a lot.  And it was a lot of fun.  Had a lot of great receivers, and it was fun.  You definitely kind of get used to throwing the ball around a lot in high school, and it's definitely helped me kind of progress to the college level.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it would be huge for me.  But at the end of the day, I think it would be bigger for the University of Georgia and the State of Georgia.  And I'm just so excited for this opportunity.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You throw it 30, 40 times, 50 times, as many times as it took.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, at the end of the day, you know, the college offense is a little more wordy.  But the passing schemes and the coverages and all that, it's just about all the same.  At the end of the day, one guy's running a route, if he's open, you throw it to him.  It's not too hard, and you just go out and play backyard football with the guys.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: I love the University of Georgia, and I love to compete.  I wanted to help the football program any way I could and make Jacob [phonetic] better and make myself better, and now we're here.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: No, not at all.  I'm just so thankful we're here and the way it's all worked out for us.  At the end of the day, just got to go out and I hope that we finish the script.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Definitely early in the season, you know, when things were clicking for us.  We felt, hey, why not us?  Felt like we were just as good as the next team, and there wasn't no reason for us to be playing on the last game of the season.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  You know, you want to meet the next best team to the country to make sure you win.  Thankful for this opportunity and hope to go out and play good.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Growing up in the state of Georgia, growing up a Georgia boy and a fan, when Coach Smart got the job here at the University of Georgia and getting the opportunity to come here, I took it.  And I wanted to compete and make the University of Georgia's football program the best I could possibly make it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah, absolutely.  You can find of feel it around the building, and it's definitely kind of a good feeling to have and one you like feeling.  But at the end of the day, you're kind of super excited about what's going on and hope it continues.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  You have a really good feeling about it, a really good feeling about the guys you're going into battle with and hope it works out for us.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Nick and Sony, they've been a huge help to me all year.  And you know, what they do with the ball in their hands, it's been incredible.  The game's never really been on me.  Anytime I needed a (indiscernible), and I let them run and make a play.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Playing in big games and learning how to control positive energy to the best of your ability definitely helps.  And it's just kind of the way it works, and just kind of hope you go out and play with that energy.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, not really.  I couldn't have wrote the script.  I can't believe kind of the way it turned out, but super thankful and super thankful for this opportunity and just kind of go out and hope we win this last football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It was huge.  Coach Saban, he's an awesome football coach and an awesome man.  And I was just super thankful for that opportunity, but now I'm here playing the football game and trying to get ready for monday.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's huge.  You definitely want to beat one of the better teams in the country for the National Championship and glad we have this opportunity and just hope we go out and make more plays than they do.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  You know, we feel we're just as good as the next team.  And kind of as long as we go out and play our football game, I think we'll be okay and, at the end of the day, score more points than they do.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: They're big up front, and the scheme is something similar I see every day in practice, and now we're here and just kind of getting ready to go.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It's an awesome experience and one that you don't take lightly.  But you just kind of get focused in these last couple days what you have and hope you go out and play great on Monday.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it's awesome, and you still kind of get sent pictures of you wearing Alabama stuff.  But at the end of the day, just hope we play good on Monday.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, old friends.  My pastor.  He's a huge Alabama fan.  But a lot of people do.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: No, I don't.  Yeah.
Q. What was the tipping point that made you change your mind?
JAKE FROMM: When Coach Smart got the job here at University of Georgia, growing up a Georgia boy, you always wanted to play for the Dogs.  And when he gave me the opportunity to come there, it's one I didn't take lightly.  And now I'm here.
Q. Did you get to know him during your recruitment?
JAKE FROMM: Actually, Coach Smart was the one who -- who actually was the main recruiter to Alabama, and building that relationship with him was huge.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, I don't know, but I think he handled it in a really great way.  But I'm just thankful things turned out the way it did.
Q. What was the call to Saban like when you broke the bad news to him?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it's one of -- probably one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life.  But with Coach Saban being who he is and just the incredible person he is, I didn't want to do the University of Alabama wrong in any way, but I thought it was best for me at the time.  And now I'm here and about to play a football game.
Q. You were picking between two blue-blood programs.  You weren't going to have a bad choice between them.  Have you thought at all about how life would be different if -- you know, you'd be in the same room, but have you thought about how life would be different?
JAKE FROMM: Honestly, I haven't thought about it at all.  Kind of never turn back.  It was foot on the pedal moving forward, and now we're here.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: It would be huge.  Something you kind of dream about as a little kid.  It's an awesome experience any way you can.  Bringing a championship home to the State of Georgia, to the University of Georgia will be huge.  I'm just so thankful for the opportunity and hope we get it done on Monday.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, they're actually really similar.  But Sony is a little more of a vocal leader, and Nick's more of a leader by example.  But both have their awesome attributes, and both have their say in the everyday locker room and at practice.
Both are awesome individuals as people, and I'm more than thankful to be able to call them my friends and teammates and just thankful they're on my football team.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, at the end of the day, you are just playing a football game.  You can't make the moment any bigger than it is.  Definitely with the guys you have with you and around you, it definitely helps.  And with those guys with you and make sure they're with you every step of way, it definitely helps a lot.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Not at all.  You can't make the moment bigger than it is.  At the end of the day, go out and play a football game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Obviously, they have some really good players up front.  But you just hope you're whole line bucks them well and hope your guys make more plays than they do.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Favorite throw?  Gosh, I don't know.  There have been a lot of incredible throws and incredible moments, but the one that jumps out to mind right now is that first one in Stanford [phonetic] and throwing that first one to Javon.
It probably was not the smartest long [phonetic] throw at the moment, but it was one, man, I got hit really hard on as soon as I threw it, and really just kind of lost it up to prayer.  And Javon came down with it and made an awesome play.
Q. What is that play?  What's the name of it, and how has it become so good?
JAKE FROMM: It's called the Javon play.  When in doubt, throw it up to him and let him make the play and the plays he's been making all year.  And he's been awesome, an incredible force.  Been awesome for me, an awesome friend, and thankful he's on my football team.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: I really hadn't thought about it much.  Kind of try to block things out and try to stay focused on the game.  And as soon as I got here, you know, kind of thought about it.  Oh, well, (indiscernible) to Alabama.
But it's an awesome experience and really just trying to stay focused on the game.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You know, it's tough.  Coach Smart has been touching on it all week, you know, to get rest, but to rest and out-recover them.  That's been a huge point all week and just trying to get any kind of rest we can.  The hotel we have, it's awesome for that.  And just kind of hope we do the best we can with it.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  Systematically, they're really similar.  And going against your guys in practice every day makes you feel more comfortable about it.  At the end of the day, you go out, play a football game, you see what you see, and try to make some plays.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Practice every single day.  That's our place.  We have all our stuff there.  For me, it doesn't make any sense not to.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Gosh.  Probably so young, I can't even remember now.
Q. Probably 4, 5, 6 years old?
JAKE FROMM: Yes, sir.
Q. Tell me what it's like in Athens.  Is it everything you thought it'd be?
JAKE FROMM: Athens is incredible.  The whole city, the whole town, the campus, it's beautiful.  I love Athens and wouldn't want to be anywhere else for the world.
Q. Talk about food.  When you go out, what do you guys like to eat?  Are you a good eater?
JAKE FROMM: Oh, I love to eat now.  That's one thing I'm going to do.  Being part of the football program, you have a lot of meals taken to you.  Always try to go out and have a meal or two on your own.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: The best training table middle of the week?  Gosh.  I don't know.  There's a couple of them.
Q. Crab legs?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah, we will have crab legs sometimes.  Yeah.
Q. Prime rib?
JAKE FROMM: We will have prime rib, yeah.
Q. Taco bar?
JAKE FROMM: Taco bar's pretty good.
Q. Out of those three, which one?
JAKE FROMM: I'm more of a steak guy, so the prime rib kind of gets me going.
Q. You're taking out a bunch of guys for dinner.  Where do you go?
JAKE FROMM: We can go to the Mexican restaurant.  We can go -- we go get a good steak.  We can get some barbecue.  Anywhere you want to go, we got it.
Q. Who's the best chef on the team?
JAKE FROMM: Oh, I am.  For sure.
Q. What do you make better than anybody else?

Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: That's an interesting question.  Outside, definitely Coach Coley.  He brings the energy.  He's awesome, and he's always kind of bringing the juice, he always says.  And definitely his energy, you kind feed off of it.  And it's something that kind of gets you going every day.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Yeah.  There's been a lot of moments all year.  But I remember on the first touchdown past at App State when I loft it up to Javon and he came down with it and scored a touchdown, got hit kind of hard.  And I was, oh, okay, that's how it feels.  But that's kind of the way it goes.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Definitely late in the Auburn game when we were down and we had that last drive.  You know, just kind of throwing on every down.  And we ended up scoring the touchdown that Riley caught.  Just that whole drive.  All right.  It's on me now.  Let's go out and let's drive, let's throw it, and let's make some plays.
Q. [Off mic]?

Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: They're a huge help.  They've been awesome for me all year.  I've never felt like the game was on my shoulders at any point during the game.  I just felt just as comfortable handing the ball to them and watching them make the plays.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: I love Coach Chaney.  Coach Chaney is awesome.  Super funny guy.  He's really smart.  He's always trying to think about new ways and any possible way we can attack their defense.  That's what I love about him.  He's always working.  He's always watching more film than the next guy, and that's one thing I admire him.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Absolutely.  He always talks about Drew Brees.
Q. [Off mic]?

Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Kind of once I left, you kind of look one way and you kind of never look back.  You know, I loved high school, and I loved all the memories I have from it.  But I'm here now and about to play for a National Championship game and really just trying to stay focused on that.
Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: You just can't let it get to you.  Gosh.  At the end of the day, you just kind of stay focused and keep your eyes on the prize.  And everybody's kind of on the same page right now and just trying to stay focused and ready to play on Monday.
Q. [Off mic]?

Q. [Off mic]?
JAKE FROMM: Coach Smart, he's awesome.  He's always on it.  He's always on top of things.  That's one thing I really admire about him and just how he's just always focused on the main thing and just really just kind of on top of everything.

Q. [Off mic]?

Q. [Off mic]?
