THE MODERATOR: I would like to introduce coaches Eddie Gran and Matt House.  Each will make an opening comment, then we'll open it up for questions.
EDDIE GRAN: Good morning.  Just excited to be here at the Music City Bowl, having a chance to talk with the other coaches here.  It's been a great week for the players, coaches, the families especially.  Haven't seen much of them this week, but really excited to be here in Nashville.
MATT HOUSE: Echo what Eddie said.  Our guys have had a great week here.  There's been great hospitality, good events for the kids, and a good balance of preparation and fun.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. We're hearing that you are preparing a little bit differently, not necessarily X's and O's, but the approach you're taking to this game.  Have you seen a difference in your players this week as you prepared?
EDDIE GRAN: I don't think there's any question.  One thing Coach Stoops does a great job of, he talks to a lot of different staffs.  As you go through these bowl games, there's different ways you can slice that orange.
So he did change it up this year.  Our kids, the energy is unbelievable.  It's been a lot of fun.  But they're getting their work done.  It's been hardhat, lunch pail when we go to work, fun when you're allowed to have fun.  It's been a whole lot different than last year.  It's been exciting.
MATT HOUSE: Coach has really done a good job with setting the tempo for our team.  I think we practiced fast.  We've had a good balance of competitive good versus good situations, then situations where you're against scouts so it doesn't get monotonous for the players.
THE MODERATOR: Coaches, thank you very much.
