   THE MODERATOR: We have offensive tackle Stephen Schilling.

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: Rough for a while. Took our time to kind of let it sink in, things like that, then we moved on. We got after it in practice yesterday. We're just focusing on Penn State now. 

 Q. How was practice yesterday? 
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I thought it was good. I thought we had a good tempo, pretty up-tempo pace. I think everybody was able to put that game behind us pretty quickly. We know we have a huge game coming up this weekend. Thought we had a good tempo getting ready. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I don't really know. I mean, I run the plays they call. I can't talk anything about that. 
 But I think we just keep going. It's going to click eventually. It's something that takes time. I think pick up the tempo maybe a little bit, utilize our conditioning, things like that might help. But we're just going to keep going. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I think so. You see on film, plays that are so close to just blowing up and letting Sam and the other guys run all the way down the field. If we can clean those up, I think we will. I think we're getting better in our techniques and fundamentals. If we can perfect those, the plays will start going for us. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I think so. Coach talked to the offensive line after the game. As much as the Toledo game hurts, it is a non-conference game. The Penn State game, it's that much more important for us too get back over .500. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I don't think so. I think we know everything's different. We know everything has changed. We know it wasn't going to be the same. It's just part of the growing process, part of the change. 
 So we believe in our coaches. I think we've all bought in throughout the summer and through camp and everything. So we believe that it will work. We just maybe have to employ a little bit more patience than we thought. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: We watched a little bit of them yesterday before practice. They're a great defense. They've got a lot of experience, particularly the defensive line. Everybody I think is back from last year for the most part that I went against. They're going to be a tough line to go against. They're big in the middle. They got a lot of speed on the outside. 
 We're going to have our hands full. But I think it's manageable. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I think it might put a slight psychological edge into it. But I think they're playing so well right now, they're really confident right now in what they're doing. They should be. No. 3 team in the country. They've played as well as anybody. 
 That's history really. I mean, can't look back on that. Doesn't give us an edge really I think going into the game. Something that we have on our side. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: Not really. To me, I can't really remember anything. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I think Moos has played really well, probably as well as any of us on the line. Coach Frey really challenged him in camp when he was playing center, then moved to guard. He's kind of excelled. I think he's played really well. Been able to work well together. Definitely being able to play next to each other has helped build continuity. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I don't know. I think we have a lot of guys that can play different positions, a lot of guys that can play well. This is what the coaches feel is working right now. I mean, I can't really say. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: That's fine with me. I did that last year. I'd be happy to play wherever. If they need me to play somewhere else, I'm fine with that. 

 Q. (Question regarding the Us against the World mentality.) 
 STEPHEN SCHILLING: I think we've had that mentality the whole time, especially with a lot of doubters this whole off-season, especially now after losing four of our first six games. What matters to us is the guys in the locker room, the coaching staff, things like that. So it is kind of us against everybody else. We're out to prove that this is working. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
