Michigan - 48, Indiana - 41

COACH WILSON: The team, it's been playing good.  Again, we played well but not good enough.  So congratulations to Michigan.  Proud of our guys, proud of the seniors.  Good, awesome group.  A lot of ball to play.  A lot of things to play for.  We'll see if we're strong enough and led well enough to get what we need down the stretch.
