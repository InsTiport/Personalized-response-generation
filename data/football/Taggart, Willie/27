WILLIE TAGGART: Well, we have a No. 2 team coming to our stadium this week, a really good football team.  Another great opportunity for our football team.  They come here, and trying to beat a really good football team in Clemson.
Q. You visited Clemson to watch them practice the spring before last, can you tell us what that visit was like, your first impressions of Dabo and what did you take away from that trip?
WILLIE TAGGART: It was a nice trip.  They were very welcoming.  Allowed us to go around and meet with some coaches and watch practice and see the new facility.  Had a chance to sit down and talk with Coach Sweeney, which was great.
It was really nice to go and see how champions do things.  You can see why they are winning and winning at a high level that's in that building and around that building, everything is channelled towards winning; from the secretary to the custodian or whatever is around there, they all are moving in the same direction.
