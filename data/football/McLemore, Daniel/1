<p>	Q.  Mike, I know this may be an old story line in Oklahoma, but just, basically, could you state your sense of what discipline means and how it is integrated into a successful football program, what effect you think it may have had on your guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel that some of the disciplinary measures you have taken has a positive impact on your football team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, Lee Barnett, is this your dream job or are you still pinching yourself a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Follow-up, how much influence have you had from other head coaches and assistant coaches?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you as funny as Pat? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, the Kansas Star.  Mike, have you given or do you have any sense of the relationship between how much it's changed?  I mean, you have a legacy in the state of Oklahoma and at that school but, by the same token, I think you have addressed some of it.  It's about you, but it's not about you anymore as a head coach. </p>
<p>	Q.  Follow-up, do you have any sense of a risk if things don't go well for you as a head coach, that that's what people will remember and not what you did on the field? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, can you just talk about the change in offensive philosophy. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you size up your quarterback situation for us. </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked before about players and everything like that.  As assistant coach you get pretty close to your kids.  Isn't it hard for you to draw that line? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what is your diagnosis of what happened the last part of the season (inaudible)?</p>
