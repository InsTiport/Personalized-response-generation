<p>	Q.  I was wondering how hard it is to try to put a game plan together against a team and a system that's so brand new?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is the west coast even more difficult?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Kelley's injury, are you surprised about how quickly he is able to come back?  There was a time when people ACL injury, it is considered the kiss of death and you are out for at least nine months.  There are a couple of guys now that are coming back who injured themselves in the spring and have been able to either participate or put themselves in a position where they are pretty much back to where they were?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that injury is it something that an athlete's competitive nature makes him or breaks him in terms of the rehab?  He's a great athlete because he goes beyond the limits.</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about E.J. Henderson.  Dose he mean more to this team considering kind of the uncertainty on offense as far as his leadership on defense?  I know he obviously meant a lot to the team last year, but kind of talk a little bit about what he means to the team this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any advantage at all to the fact that he was out in the spring; did that help anybody else develop at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you, obviously the expectations are much higher based on last year's performance.  What will the keys will be to having another successful season, and does the higher expectations affect the way in how you will coach this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I understand you haven't chosen -- named the starting quarterback yet.  Talk about the quarterbacks that are in the running and what they offer to the table?</p>
