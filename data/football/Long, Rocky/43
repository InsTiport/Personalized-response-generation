Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   Oh, I thought that we hung in there as a team.   I thought we struggled some on offense, and obviously we gave up a bunch of yardage on defense, but the defense came up with some key stops on 3rd and 4th downs and came up with some big‑time turnovers, and when we got some turnovers our offense did a real nice job of sticking them in and scoring touchdowns off of the turnovers. 
As is usual, when you have a pretty good football team, both sides of the ball have something to do with it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I don't know.   They go‑‑ they're obviously not a spread team that goes that fast, but they're lining up three backs in the backfield, but they go as fast as they can.   That makes it difficult on any defense to do that.   They're probably‑‑ I don't know, they're probably the ones that went the quickest this year, for the whole game anyway. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   Not at all.   I mean, that's what they do.   As long as it's 4th and 3 or less, they're going to go for it.   I was surprised, our goal was to make them punt.   They punted 19 times all season long, we made them punt two or three times.   That's a big‑time accomplishment.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I knew they had a lot of sacks, and I just looked and we had three.   Could have had a couple more, too, I think. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   No, I mean, I don't think that far ahead.   I think about the next game.   I don't think about‑‑ once the game is over, by this time tomorrow I won't be thinking about this one.   I'll be watching Wyoming on film hoping we can win the Conference Championship. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   Yeah, I think that's really good for us.   We've played 11 straight weeks, and I think we're a physical football team, and when you're a physical football team, you get a lot of guys beat up.   We've got a lot of guys that are playing with hurts and bumps and bruises and strains and twists.   They all keep playing.   Well, this will give us a chance to heal them up a little bit. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I think it says something about our whole team.   Our team is based on never giving up.   Just because you give a long play away or even if you give a score away, you don't quit there.   You don't ever lose your emotion.   You never lose your momentum.   You go back out and try to stop them.   To be honest with you, we want them to gain zero, so every play is to try to prevent them from getting a yard.   So they get 45 on a reverse; that means the next play we want to hold them to zero. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   Well, I think it's good now.   I don't think it was good going into the season, no.   If you have your druthers, the bye week is right in the middle of the season.   It's not at the start or it's not at the end.   But it will give us‑‑ we have so many guys beat up, it'll give us a chance‑‑ one is right here.   It'll give him a chance‑‑ he's an old guy.   He can get healed up a little bit for the last drive. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I hadn't thought about that.   You want to start that theory?   I don't subscribe to that at all.   You play each game as it comes along.   I don't think it'll break our momentum.   If we play good, we're going to win.   If we don't play good, we won't win.   It happens every single week. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   Well, I thought Air Force did a great job of slowing our run down, and I didn't look at the yardage we got, but they did a fantastic job of slowing our run down, which means play action pass is not near as effective. 
And then I thought the wind had something‑‑ I thought the one weather element that has an effect on the game is the wind, it affects the kicking game and it affects the passing game.   We intercepted passes.   Did you see that one that they threw?   That wind had a whole lot to do with that one.   Their guy was behind us, and the wind knocked the ball down about 20 yards short and we intercepted it.   The wind has a whole lot to do with not being able to throw it well. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I've got a lot of good players that played really well. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   I'm sure some of us will watch it, but I don't know, I guess we were in first place before this game, too, I guess. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ROCKY LONG:   To be honest with you, none of that stuff matters to me.   I mean, today's win matters a whole bunch to me, and now that we won this game‑‑ I've played for the Conference Championship with teams three times now, or this will be the third time, and haven't won one yet.   And our whole existence of this football team is to win a Conference Championship.   That's what we build to, that's what we train for, and guess what, we get a chance.
