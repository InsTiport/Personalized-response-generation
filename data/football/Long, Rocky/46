  UNLV   13

THE MODERATOR:   Questions for coach. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH LONG:   I thought we struggled at times.   We turned the ball over more than we had in any other single game this year, I think.   I'm not sure, but I think the turnovers kept us from scoring a lot more points. 
I was really proud of the defense.   After the turnovers, the defense went out and stopped them.   They didn't get any points off the turnovers. 
I thought the defense played pretty well except one drive where they ran the ball on us too well, got in second‑and‑short, third‑and‑short situations. 
Offense moved the ball, but we kept shooting ourselves in the foot or we would have scored a lot more points. 

Q.   (No microphone. 
COACH LONG:   I thought he did a nice job.   I thought he controlled the game.   I thought he did good getting us in the right running plays.   I thought he threw it well.   The one interception was a bit of a high throw, a tipped ball. 
I thought he played really well for his first start. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   The mood at halftime was that we had to play better.   We were in the lead.   As bad as people might think we played, we did win the game and were in the lead. 
Sometimes around here, I don't know why it is, this team hasn't been bowl‑eligible in a long, long time.   We've already won six games.   I mean, it doesn't matter how you win, folks.   It doesn't matter how you win.   Ask everybody that's lost today if it matters.   All those people that lost by 3, ask them if it matters.   It doesn't matter how you win. 
You win, you ought to be happy you won. 

Q.   (Question regarding the fumble.) 
COACH LONG:   I think the three turnovers kept us from scoring.   I'm positive.   I guess I'm not completely positive, but I think he would have scored on all three of those drives, which eliminated maybe 21 points, which makes the game look a lot closer than it probably was. 
I'm betting the statistics show that we dominated the game.   Didn't dominate it on the scoreboard, but I bet you the statistics...   I don't know who's looking at them, are you? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   That's kind of dominating (smiling). 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   Well, being eligible to go to the third bowl in a row is a record.   I guess it's never happened at SanDiego State.   So that's exciting. 
To be honest with you, we still got three games to play and we're going to enjoy the heck out of this victory because I've been around a long time.   A team will come off a big win, not play well the next week, not win.   Sometimes you get a little jaded.   So we're going to enjoy this win and worry about whoever we play next tomorrow. 

Q.   Are you worried about that? 
COACH LONG:   I was really worried about it.   I don't think the players worry about that stuff.   Coaches do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   I think Adam can be a great starting quarterback.   I think it is much, much harder to be the starting quarterback than it is a guy that comes off the bench in the second quarter.   I think there's a lot more pressure on him tonight.   He had a lot more knowledge of what he was doing tonight.   Sometimes when things don't go quite right for you, you start thinking too much. 
I don't think he did that.   I think he handled himself well, was really under control, with some maturity.   I think he can be a great starting quarterback. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   No.   We wanted him to come, but he's in so much pain, he didn't think he could be on the sidelines and stand up that long.   If you're on the sidelines, you sit on the bench, guess what, you see nothing.   So I imagine he watched it on TV. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   Doctor said it went fine.   But I think it's quite a long rehab. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH LONG:   He had one 75‑yard run.   Take the 75‑yard run out there and see what their average carry was. 
That stuff happens once in a while.   They did a great job of blocking us.   Our safety missed the tackle.   He went for 70 something yard.   You add 75 yards on one run to the total, gee whizz. 
I don't think they ran the ball very well on us.   How many yards did they get total? 

Q.   127. 
COACH LONG:   127.   Rushing got 50?   Really.   I thought we got more heat on the quarterback, yeah. 
Thanks, guys.
