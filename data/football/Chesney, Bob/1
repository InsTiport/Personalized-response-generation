Holy Cross - 14, Boston College - 62
BOB CHESNEY: A very good football team, one that we don't necessarily see the likes of.  They did a great job.  That runningback is something special.  I wish him the best.  What a future, but also just his speed, the strength, he's just great.  They did a very good job.  Coached well.  They all played well.  A little bit too much for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
BOB CHESNEY: I think we shot ourselves in the foot a little bit here and there.  We have to make some tackles, throw a couple balls when they're open.  There's things we can't hold back, expect to hang in there with a team like that, not give everything we got.
They do a great job in the run game, which sets up the pass game.  All three of them, however many were in there (indiscernible)
