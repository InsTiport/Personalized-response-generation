Duke - 40, Baylor - 27   
 Q.  Chris, it looked like you guys really controlled it with the front, especially they could really run the ball, you guys had really good pressure.  What did you see out there today?  
CHRIS RUMPH II: We watched a lot of film over the past week.  We know what they want to do.  Coach prepared us well, and we've just got their pass-rusher.   
 Q.  I was going to say could you talk about defending their running backs?  You guys had a little bit of trouble sometimes out there with some of their scrambles.  But when it came to their running game, you guys shut them down?  
CHRIS RUMPH II: You have to give them credit.  They have great athletes over there.  They do a good job recruiting at Baylor.  They did have us a couple plays, but we just stayed poised and kept attacking and came over the hills.   
 Q.  Baylor's touchdown in the second half, was the first touchdown you've allowed in almost 90 minutes of play.  What's that say about your defensive intensity and your ability to touchdown opponents?  
CHRIS RUMPH II: It shows we never let up on the gas pedal.  Four quarters, that's what the coaches preach 60 minutes.  We bring it to them.  Just because that's gone, doesn't mean we're not going to stop coming after them.   
 Q.  You guys came down a day early because of everything going on back home.  Probably a little out of routine.  But what's it say about you guys that you're able to come out, put that aside and jump out to a 23-0 lead in the first half?  
CHRIS RUMPH II: You know what, it goes to the coaching the game and our poise as a team to be able to do that in our situation.  God bless everyone back home.  Hope everybody's safe.   
But, yeah, we actually did it for them.  We think about the people we left back, those still in the storm, so we did it for them.
