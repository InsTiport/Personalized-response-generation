 Q.   Seemed you used your time away to Ohio State's benefit.   Did you feel‑‑ you looked sharp running and throwing.   How did you feel out there?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Before I answer that, I am proud of Kenny and the way he led the team while I was out.   I look at him as a big brother.   So no controversy with that.  
   
 Q.   So talk about your play tonight, stepping in there after being out for almost three weeks.   
BRAXTON MILLER:   I've been working really hard these last couple of weeks because I've been hurt.   Fundamental‑wise, and Coach Herman and Coach Meyer, they always talk about fundamentals.   That's what I've been working on.   That's how I get things going.   And I can't give all the glory to myself, I've got to give it to the team.  
   
 Q.   You got off to a really hot start.   Can you talk about how [indiscernible] and how did you feel out there?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   I felt good.   It was a good crowd.   Always a great crowd with the Buckeyes.   I felt good.   My legs felt good energy‑wise.   I wasn't out of shape.   Felt good.  
   
 Q.   Fourth quarter, what kind of went on there?   You guys first down needed a couple of times.   What was going on there?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   We backed up just a little bit because they was running this type of blitz coverage and we just wanted to run the ball and run the clock out.   So we got off the field.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel like you had something to prove tonight there?   It seemed like it became popular for the last couple of weeks to stir up this controversy.   Did you want to send any message with your own play?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Not at all.   I was just going out there to have fun and lead my team how it's supposed to be led and just have fun and big plays come along with that, and I don't really look into how the media deals with that.   So it don't bother me at all.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like this was a good game, a good icebreaker for the Big Ten?   Was this a game that kind of you needed to see, kind of where you were, where the team was?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   I love playing in big games.   Brings excitement to myself and the team.   That's what we talk about all the time.   We love night games, just like last year.   We stepped up a little bit, different game plan, and defense was good; Wisconsin, they was good defense.   And we just had a good game plan.   So it came out well.   And everybody fought hard today.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about right at the end of the first half, almost an interception and the next play, 40‑yard touchdown pass?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   It slipped out of my hands.   I can't make excuses.   It's on me.   I told coach:   Let's throw it again.   I made up for it the next throw.  
   
 Q.   Same question but follow‑up on that.   Did you tell him let's do it again?   Tell us how it went down.   
BRAXTON MILLER:   Coach know how‑‑ I don't really gotta say too much.   I looked at the sideline.   He already knows what's going on.   Good game plan.  
   
 Q.   Because of the way you normally play the game, was there any hesitation or any concern going in about tucking it, running the football, because of what you were coming off of?   
BRAXTON MILLER:   Not at all.   I worked pretty hard‑‑ I was in there all day.   I felt like I had a job without getting paid.   
I was getting in there before the coaches.   Taking care of my body.   Conditioned all the time.   Underwater treadmill.   And just felt really good.  
   
 Q.   You talked about that last drive before the half.   Can you talk about the drive before they scored and get back in the momentum and that seemed to be the first time you cut it loose running was on that drive.   Was there any hesitation early in the game to test the knee?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Just a little bit in the beginning of the game.   I loosened up and you know how things get tight, you loosen up after a while.   But the drive before the half, they opened up a lot, plus they came out with the ball again and had to set the tone before we went into the locker room.  
   
 Q.   Is the knee 100percent at this point, or how close to 100percent?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   It's good.   It's 100percent.   I just wear a knee brace for caution and keep it real tight.  
   
 Q.   What was the process like for you the past couple of weeks of trying to decide are you going to play, are you not going to play?   Did you think maybe you were going to play last week?   What was that like for you personally?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   No, we held off on that, because it was a different type of game and we wanted to get prepared for the Big Ten conference.   I wanted to rest my knee for another week so it would be absolutely 100percent, so I could give all my all on the field.  
   
 Q.   Heading into tonight, did you expect to take all the snaps?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   It's the coach's decision.   I worked pretty hard in practice.   Me and Kenny, we just have a different relationship.   And so it's all in coach's hands.  
   
 Q.   Did they give you the decision before the game in that regard?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, they did.  
   
 Q.   It looked like Kenny was one of the first guys out to celebrate with you after your touchdown passes, the first two I remember specifically.   Did you expect anything different from Kenny in those moments?   And how did it feel to have his support in that moment?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Like I said, he's been my big brother ever since I got here.   We've had a connection.   We roommate every game.   We talk about things outside of football, things outside of football.   So we hang out all the time and just happy to see him happy for me to be back on the field with the team.  
   
 Q.   How did you think the offense looked overall?   It's kind of hard to look at it in the moment.   But if you can step outside of the moment and just look at it overall, as crisp as you would like it to be?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   No, we've got a lot of little corrections to make, especially in the film room tomorrow.   It's just the little things we've got to fix from the game and little D balls I missed a couple times.   We got it back.   Fought really hard.   And guys played really well.   So you can't really tell when you mess up.  
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
