THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Braxton Miller.   
   
 Q.   Braxton, congratulations.   A lot of people talk about a new era of offensive football here tonight.   What clicked?   
BRAXTON MILLER:   I think the O line.   They stepped it up real big.   They worked hard throughout the week, every day.   So the O line just gave it out.   
   
 Q.   Braxton, seemed like once you decided to run, the avalanche started.   Why did it take you so long to get going as a runner there in the second quarter when you had the 72‑yarder?   Just talk about that and how it ignites things.   
BRAXTON MILLER:   I was just handing out the ball to Carlos.   He's the running back on the team.   So my chance to get the ball, I'm going to try to make something happen with it.  
   
 Q.   You were able to score 63points against a Big Ten defense.   What does that say about where this offense is right now?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   You know, couple big plays happened throughout the game, too, where we returneda kick‑‑ I mean he returned an interception and Philly Brown probably turned.   So we gotta keep clicking like that.  
   
 Q.   As far as learning the offense, where would you say you are right now?   I know this is the first‑year offense, looks explosive, but are you still learning offense?   What would you say?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Yeah, I'm learning every week.   They throw new stuff at us every week.   So just trying to get it down pat.  
   
 Q.   First quarter you guys had 17yards of offense.   You end up with close to 500.   What happens between the first quarter and the second quarter?   And then once it gets rolling like this, was this the most extended period of this offense being what it is capable of?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   I don't believe this is what it can be capable of.   I think it can be better.   We made a couple minor mistakes out there.   We'll watch film tomorrow.  
So I'll say we've got a lot more to do.  
   
 Q.   How was Coach Meyer after putting up 63?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   When we put it up, it was like how many points did we put up again?   It was a lot.  
   
 Q.   When Coach Meyer got here, is this sort of maybe what you thought the potential was for this offense?   Did you think games like this were possible with his offense?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Yeah, absolutely.   All the things that we do on offense is a lot different, the regular offense.   But I imagined types of points like this one day.  
   
 Q.   Biggest crowd in the history of the stadium tonight.   I just wonder what playing in this atmosphere was like.   Obviously it was different.   Can you describe how different it was and what it was like to perform in that atmosphere?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Man, the fans were electric.   And the defense was out there, they was just so loud.   That's what I think what was bothering on the offense for Nebraska a little bit.   I could hear them, definitely.  
   
 Q.   The second interception by Bradley Robey, you guys were struggling.   Before going into the second quarter, how much did that really ignite the offense, get you guys going?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Man, he does it all the time in practice.   But finally he brung it to the field and big plays like that, you gotta score after that.   So he brings a lot of excitement to the offense.  
   
 Q.   After getting injured last year in this game, was that a lot of motivation to get out there and score a lot of points and have a game like you had tonight?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   No, I wasn't really looking at it like that.   I just came out there, do the deal, do what we have to do and keep moving the ball down the field.  
   
 Q.   What part of the offense were you most impressed with?   You can certainly spread the glory here.   Was it Hyde, the tight ends, Philly Brown, yourself?   What do you give the credit?   Besides the O line.   
BRAXTON MILLER:   O line.   Oh, man, the tight ends, they actually got the shine today.   They work so hard throughout the running game blocking, so now they finally get to catch the ball.   So I'm proud of them.  
   
 Q.   Has it sunk in?   You guys are 6‑0, now chance to go 7‑0.   How good does it feel?   What's the feeling, I guess, down in the room right now?  
BRAXTON MILLER:   Man, we celebrated right now.   We gotta get back to work tomorrow.   And hopefully we'll go 7‑0.
