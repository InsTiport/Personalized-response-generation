		  RASHAD GREENE:   We're pretty much sticking to the script.   Just continuing to trust in each other and trust in the coaches.   You know, as to what we prepare for that week.   We don't really change, we just continue to try to execute better and just believe and trust in each other. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   No, it's been different every game.   Depends on the situation, or how we've been playing.   The messages are different.   But at the end of the day, we know we needed to play better, and we just went out there and played Florida State football. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I always just had the natural ability to be able to run and cut, but in high school having NFL Hall of Fame recruits coaching me up was definitely a starting point, and Coach Dawsey and Jimbo definitely taught me a lot, as well.   Between those three, I was able to get it down pretty good. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   He left before I got there. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Just most importantly, it was always just be precise, learn how to change your speeds in and out your cut, and most importantly, get in and out your cut and learning how to set defenders up and you put position in, in and out running.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I would say I was a lot ahead because I knew how to run routes.   I knew how to read coverages for the most part, which I've gotten better at, and just that experience that I had being coached by him, it helped me a lot.

Q.   Do you think the ability to route run (inaudible)? 
RASHAD GREENE:   Yeah, that's one of my great assets, being able to run routes and catch the ball.   At the end of the day, a fast guy can't always run the best routes and a DB can break on him if his routes are not precise and he didn't get in and out of cuts.   Speed is a plus, but my route running is what I bank on. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   The route, I would say to get perfect for us, a comeback route, and what we call it is an Ohio out, it's just basically a six‑step out, but it's a C cut, so it's more difficult than a lot of players think.   Just by watching the NFL combine I can see guys who struggle with that route a lot, and that's something that we emphasize on every day, running our Ohio route the correct way and not cutting short or making sure you make that big step all the way. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Yeah, if you drift, it definitely can be dangerous.

Q.   Do you find yourself with the young guys (inaudible)? 
RASHAD GREENE:   Most definitely.   I let them use me as a tool.   Anything they need help with, I'm willing to help, and anything I see that they can get better at, I always provide information or the techniques to get it done. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I'm not really sure.   I'm assuming that they probably do because I'm not the biggest guy, but at the end of the day, size is not what matters.   Some of the great receivers that's in the NFL now haven't been the biggest guys.   At the end of the day, that's not what it's about.   That's just the looks of it.   Right now that seems like what the NFL is more interested in is the look part, having the big guys.   You know, I feel like they have their reasons.   NFL is definitely a red‑zone game, and you need big bodies like that.   But I have my strong points that can be very dangerous. 

Q.   You talked about watching the combine.   How much are you watching (inaudible)? 
RASHAD GREENE:   Whenever I get a chance.   Whenever I get a chance to watch football, I always pay close attention to the best guy, that they say is the best guy on the field at the receiving position, and just see how he runs routes, the way to get in and out of cuts, his hand motion when he's running routes and things like that.   I try to pay close attention to details because at the end of the day, that's the most important in the overall picture is understanding how somebody is doing something. 

Q.   What's the best route that you ran? 
RASHAD GREENE:   The Virginia game, it was basically what we call a shake route.   It's pretty much a‑‑ how can I explain it?   It's like a post corner, and the defender was clueless by the time I caught the ball.   He just turned around and I was scoring a touchdown.   That's one of the routes that I can say definitely made somebody look bad.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Yeah, that lets me know that I was pretty much precise in my route running and I was able to get in and out of my cuts fast.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I'm not even sure because I don't watch them. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   No, I don't pay attention to that.   I'm not sure if they did or didn't. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Got to have great hips.   You've got to be able to sink your hips and get in and out of cuts, and you've got to have a great head to sell routes.   If you're not selling the route with your head, it's not going to get the DB's attention to break on this step or another step.   I would say it's all in your hips and your head.   Just learning how to control that speed, when to slow up, when to burst and things like that.   It's a combination of speed, speed control and hips and head. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)   What are you going to remember about playing with these guys? 
RASHAD GREENE:   These guys were guys that definitely took care of business, not a bunch of guys who did a lot of talking, especially Nick.   Over the years me and Nick's relationship has grown.   He's one of the guys that I actually talk to on the team now, and we're just a special group of guys.   We came in together wanting to do something special, and we was able to get it done. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   His catching ability really jumped out at me.   I haven't seen that guy drop many balls at all, and that's including practice.   His physical attributes, being so big and being able to get in and out of cuts.   Nick uses his head in his route very well. 

Q.   I know you described (inaudible) how would you compare your leadership?   How would you describe the way that you lead this team together?
RASHAD GREENE:   The way we lead this team is basically he gets the message across vocally, and I show them.   It's like he's telling you what to do, and I'm showing you how to do it.   That's pretty much how I can sum it up. 

Q.   Can you give an example from practice for a game?
RASHAD GREENE:   From practice, he may say, everyone needs to lock in and focus, and just be consistent, and he might say, like Rashad, and then they'll watch me doing it and then they'll follow.   Kind of like that. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I don't think a whole lot will change.   Like I said, that's a great program, and I'm pretty sure they have a guy that's capable of doing the same thing as the guy that went down.   I don't expect anything different from him.   We surely didn't change our game plan because of the injuries.   We was willing to‑‑ we wanted to play against the best.   Me personally, I wanted to play against the best.   That's how I judge my game against people who are considered the best.   I don't think that'll change anything. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I want to be remembered as a legend at Florida State, just someone that did it right on the field and off the field, just the perfect role model for a guy as a receiver or even not a receiver, to say, I want to do the things‑‑ I want to do it the way this guy did it, kept his nose clean, did what he had to do at school, and he also showed it on the field.   I just want to be a legend that somebody can look up to and be able to take after what I accomplished. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Most definitely not the same guys.   They're more comfortable with the speed of the game, more comfortable being out there catching balls and just playing college football now.   I knew early on it would probably be a struggle because those guys are true freshmen, and it's not easy getting adjusted to college football coming from high school, even though those are great high school players, but it's a lot different, and that's what I told them.   But at the same time they was willing to lock in and focus and get the right attitude and mindset to go out there and help this offense, and they're doing a great job at helping us. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Yeah, yeah, I talked to them, but at the end of the day, I told them it's not just your physical ability.   It's your mind.   You definitely need to get your mind in the right place and just focus, and he's been doing a great job these 11 practices at being locked in and focused during the practices, and you see a big difference. 

Q.   When you look back at your career, at what you accomplished (inaudible) 99.9 percent of kids that play college football won't have this run. 
RASHAD GREENE:   Maybe it'll hit me like harder later, but I definitely sit back sometimes and realize what we are accomplishing here, and it's like a dream come true for us.   But at the same time what I try to get to my teammates is it's an opportunity.   It's an opportunity to do something special that no one has done and embrace it.   At the end of the day, it's still football, so don't let the stage become bigger than the game, and go out there and just have fun.   It'll all work itself out.   As long as we put in the work that needs to be put in and go out there and play our game, it'll be fine. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Me and Coach Dawsey, that's like a second father to me.   Our relationship was good before I even got here.   I can honestly say he's the reason that I'm at Florida State.   When no one else was pretty much interested in me‑‑ well, by the time I was really getting recruited, he was one of the first ones that said he wanted me, and that meant a lot to me, being that I had already been to different places before I got to Florida State.   He made it clear that he wanted me, and he showed it.   He's an honest man, and I love him to death, and our relationship has continued to grow. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   He's handled it well.   At the end of the day, he is a coach.   This is something that he has a passion for, and he honestly does it for us.   He's really like just getting his money's worth.   He's doing something special, and that's good.   As a coach you want to coach people up.   You don't want to not have to coach anybody up.   That's kind of boring when you don't really have to coach.   I think he's really enjoying coaching the younger guys up and building them to be something special because he still has time. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   Most definitely.   You know, we sat down and talked about what needs to be done and the film work and the route running.   It was more focusing on getting these guys accustomed to running the routes the way we want them ran.   I did a good job this summer just running routes with them, running routes with them.   We did more route running than seven on seven.   Seven on seven, that's the easy part, but if you can't run the route right, it's not going to be effective.   We did a lot of route running and teaching them the playbook as early as possible so they could understand the concepts because we knew we would need them right away.

Q.   Did you have a moment, an aha moment where you realized (inaudible)? 
RASHAD GREENE:   I wouldn't say aha, but I knew he was capable of just being around him during the summer and seeing the way he moved, I knew that guy would be very special, and I knew it would be a matter of time before he'd get his opportunity to showcase what he can do, and he lived up to it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   No, I mean, my family always supports me, and I love them to death for that.   My mom and family will definitely be here.   I can honestly say my mom hasn't missed any game since I was a freshman in the Boston College game, and I think I was hurt that game so I didn't even play, but regardless, she always supports me, no matter where the game is.   I know she'll be there in the stands. 

Q.   Is it tough knowing (inaudible)? 
RASHAD GREENE:   I mean, I don't consider it tough.   At the end of the day, she knows this means a lot to me, and it means a lot to her to be able to support me.   At the end of the day, we're able to get it done and work it out where she always can be in attendance, and I love her to death for that. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
RASHAD GREENE:   I wasn't surprised, because Cam had already been working at center throughout the year, and even before that.   So I knew he had the ability to do it, and the athletic ability to change, and I knew Rod Johnson was a tremendous freshman who was big and strong and pretty good.   The adjustment, it worked out better for us, and it's been working ever since we started.
