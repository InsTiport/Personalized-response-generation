Stanford - 17
USC - 3
Q. (No microphone.)
CAMERON SMITH: We need to get better week-in and week-out.  I think most the whole team we're ready to get back tomorrow and start watching some film and move on, grow from this experience and so I think that's all I really can do.
Q. You guys did some good things.  How difficult did they make it for you guys?
CAMERON SMITH: I felt like they did a good job calling like coverages and a combination of like corners and I thought they had a good plan for us and things just didn't go our way tonight.
Q. Do you think the glass is half full when you see you saw Stanford's offense to under 20 points?
CAMERON SMITH: Well, yeah, I feel like the defense played just lights out and just like a lot of credit to them and, yeah, that's pretty much it.
