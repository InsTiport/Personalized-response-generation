MANDY ALONSO: Come game day, within the game, like you'll just get more of a feel of like what you think is going to happen next. You get like more -- just like more of like a gut feeling of what's going to be happening.
Q. Is there ever something as watching too much film? Can you get caught up in tendencies?
MANDY ALONSO: Yeah, I guess so. You could get like -- more like you'll be tired of watching it, like you've got to take like a break. But I guess we've had so much time that we've got to like space it out and like we haven't been like, oh, my God, I don't want to watch film. We've been locked in. Coach talks about flipping the switch from bowl game and then like game time.
Q. What would it mean to you and the program to win a game like this against a team like this?
MANDY ALONSO: It would mean the world for everybody because like just coming from 2-10 a few years ago, this is a huge jump. To be on such a big-time bowl game that this stage is like set perfectly for us to rebuild this program.
Q. If you lose the game, is it still unbroken growth in your mind?
MANDY ALONSO: I mean, I would consider it like -- to be like stalling out, but like I guess not. Like in the big picture, in the game, if we lose, it'll be sad, but we got to the Orange Bowl. It's still a big accomplishment, but we don't want to settle for just that accomplishment, just being here. We want to go win it.
