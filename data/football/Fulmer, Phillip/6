<p>	Q.  With the number of kids you had injured in the spring and then when you throw in off-the-field issues, do you think that the N.C.A.A. needs to reevaluate the rules that don't allow coaches to have the contact from April on when that seems to be when you got kids  rehabbing, that's when kids seem to get in the most trouble.  Does there need to be some sort of reassessment of this because you are 100% accountable but yet you can't contact kids?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are your feelings about Tom  Culpepper and the recent judgment against him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Threats  you mentioned to your family would you share --</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us in what form you got those threats?</p>
<p>	Q.  Analyze your two quarterbacks from a technical standpoint what each of them bring and what will be the deciding factor who starts for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have any second thoughts about coming here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why not?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two trials there, in the course of those trials a lot of people have leveled charges directly at you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Those people who did it, are you comfortable that everything that you did through this entire process was the right thing to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are the dean of coaches in the SEC, four new guys this year, talk about that, do you have any advice or recommendations for the guys as they get ready?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned high level of off-season responsibilities.  What are one or two demands in the coaching profession that you didn't anticipate when you got into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coaching changes.  You have been around the league long enough to see coaches come and go.  How rare is it to have in a single season so many changes at programs that aren't necessarily rebuilding.  Programs that are at the top and bringing in these new esteem coaches.  You mentioned having to learn some of these guys' schemes that are coming into the league but you know what Steve does well and you know South Carolina's personnel from the last couple of years.  Knowing that, what do you expect from him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  With some of the off-field issues that you guys have had, do you feel like you need to lean more on your assistance to get out there and see the players during these sort of down periods or are the assistants having too much on their plates already to even ask them to do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Arrests and --(inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Curious what was your initial reaction when you heard Spurrier was coming back not only to the league but to the division?  Part two, would it be as much if, you know, to beat him at South Carolina as it was at Florida?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had to break in a new quarterback; how difficult is that on the SEC level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Keys to breaking a knew quarterback in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have any apprehension about something unpleasant happening coming through the building today and what about the reception that you got?</p>
