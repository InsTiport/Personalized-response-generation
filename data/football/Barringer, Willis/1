 Q.  (No microphone) 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  I didn't know much about football, watch the game, like the teams that I liked at the time.  Whoever they won, they won. 

 Q.  Now that you know what the rivalry is about, what's it like playing Ohio State? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  The same as being a player at Michigan and whatever.  It's duty, I've got to go to class like everybody else and got to prepare for the game just like Ohio State have to. 

 Q.  Can you talk about what you see in Troy Smith from a defensive standpoint?  What makes him so hard to defend and what do you have to do better? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  I believe he's a fifth year senior, so he has a lot of experience.  That's a lot of it. 

 Q.  What's the campus like, did Mark talk about it over the weekend, and do you expect it to get pretty crazy by the end of the week? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  The atmosphere is the same every week. 

 Q.  (Are any of your family members coming to the game?) 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  Four people going to the game and they are going to meet me after the game. 

 Q.  Any of the kids or Ohio State -- 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  No, I know some people that I went to high school with that went to Ohio State. 

 Q.  In touch with them at all? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  Sometimes. 

 Q.  Talk to them this week?

 WILLIS BARRINGER:  I don't know. 

 Q.  Has it been every day during the season? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  Not that I know of.

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  There have been many people I ran into over the years and they helped make me into this person I am today. 

 Q.  Do you do anything to prepare for Ohio State defense -- 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  I don't know, I haven't watched any defense. 

 Q.  (No microphone.) 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  They play defense the way it's supposed to be played; hard, fast and fun.  I think we try to do the same thing. 

 Q.  What is it about the Ohio State offense that makes them so difficult? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  It's Ohio State. 

 Q.  What does that mean? 
 WILLIS BARRINGER:  It means we have to play them, 3:30, November 18.
