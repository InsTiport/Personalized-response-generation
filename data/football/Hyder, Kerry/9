 Q.   Were you pretty excited about last week?   
KERRY HYDER:   Yeah, I thought I was going to get me one, you know.   I've never scored in college yet.   Kind of get me one before I get out of here.  
   
 Q.   How satisfying was it to sit there and look at tape and see how well the defense played on Saturday?   
KERRY HYDER:   It felt good to put together a real team win like that.   Everybody played their part.   The secondary, linebackers, Dâ€‘line, I thought it was a great team win.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   I just led by example, you know?   If I'm on the screen, I'll play everybody.   It's contagious.   If everybody's running to the ball, you know, it's going to carry out throughout the whole game.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   Well, Coach Wally put a great game plan together, and the entire defense just bought in and we just rolled with it.   It's great to see how it worked on the field.   We understand we can't get satisfied, and we still have a lot of work to do.  
   
 Q.   What did Coach Wallerstedt say to you after the game?   
KERRY HYDER:   He was excited for us.   He was talking to everyone, just excited about the win and how we played well on defense, and just want to keep it up throughout conference play.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   It will feel better at the end of the season.   We're happy with the ranking, but we've still got a lot of work to do.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   We have bad days sometimes, and offense has bad days.   The whole team thing is we have their back and they have our back depending on the situation.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   It was a great catch.   I think it made Top 10, I believe, number 9 or something.   I remember him on the scout team when he was making plays on scout team.   So I'm glad to see he's doing it to somebody else.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   We were trying to attack them, you know, trying to confuse them a bit.   We were trying to hit him as much as possible and put a hand on him every time he had the ball.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   I wouldn't say it was anything different; it's just we kind of got after him a little bit.   He's a great player.   He's a tough guy to bring down.   So it says a lot about the defense.   We were flying around and frustrating him like that.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   We'll be disciplined.   You know, everybody has to know their keys and has to follow them throughout the game because anytime they can bust a long one on us, you know, fit the right gap or get the pitch man or take the dive, it's definitely we have to read our keys going in.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   They came out excited, and we did too.   So we came in with a game plan.   We were going to run them out the stadium, and that's what happened.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
KERRY HYDER:   It's exciting.   I can't remember a white out.   I can remember a pink out or blackout or things like that.   But it's something different and I'm excited for it.
