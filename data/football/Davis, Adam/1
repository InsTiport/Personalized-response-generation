Q.   What has it been like?
ADAM DAVIS:   It's been good just getting in shape because I was kind of out of shape last year.   I was overweight. 
Trimming down and getting used to playing helped me out, to get better this year. 

Q.   What was the biggest challenge you faced coming back after the back injury?
ADAM DAVIS:   For me, trying to get back into it because I was like 268.   What I usually weigh is like 250.   Trying to get in shape to be able to run side to side and make plays and stuff. 

Q.   You told somebody you didn't even know if you were going to play.   How bad was that situation?
ADAM DAVIS:   I felt like the pain I was in, I just hated it.   It was going down my leg every day.   I couldn't sleep some days.   I couldn't stand straight up.   I would bend over all day every day.   It was just miserable.   I just felt like I didn't want to play no more. 

Q.   What made you come through and stick with it?
ADAM DAVIS:   Talked to my mom.   After surgery, I got a call from my mom.   She asked me how I was doing, how did I feel.   Was I sure I didn't want to play no more.   I told her I don't know.   She told me to pray about it, take it day to day.   She was going to be there to support me.
