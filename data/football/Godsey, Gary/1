<p>	Q.  Coach, can you start out by telling us what you've seen on film of the NC State defense?  Can you talk about your defense a little bit, which is the best strength of the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a particular game or moment or practice where you felt things began to click, where you saw things change offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does recruiting in the state of Florida with success sort of make you famous among the coaching community?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you personally ever recruited the state of Florida? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are the keys, with so many coaches, so many high schools, players, competition, what is the key to recruiting? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how you hooked up with Coach Willingham over the years?  Tell me your impressions of him as a head coach.  We don't know a lot about him, even though he coached at NC State for a while. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Carlyle Holiday, you mentioned earlier about the progress he made from the injury up until the USC game.  Obviously he had his problems in the USC game.  With him and with other players, do you have to emphasize the good, since the poor performance was the last one out, do you have to do things to keep his confidence up?  What's his mood been like since you returned to practice? </p>
<p>	Q.  Your biggest play-makers are Grant and Battle.  Can you talk about them, what they do well.  Is it speed, movement, hands, strength, give us a description of them. </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you improve as much in practice over the course of a month as you do in a game?  Can you improve as much as you would like with practice situations or do you need game situations to make the improvements you'd like? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you anticipate happening at offensive tackle? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will he be on the left side? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) as a quarterback coach, offensive coordinator, do you need to play almost a psychologist there to coach him? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're talking to Carlyle, what do you tell him?  Are you saying, "Get over it"?  What's the message?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you kind of treat the next three days as a normal practice as you would in a game week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle mentioned footwork was a big stumbling block.  What about his footwork was maybe lacking, but it was there for Rutgers, say? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the offensive line.  Obviously, that was a concern.  You have two guys that haven't played a lot.  How big a concern is that going to be? </p>
<p>	Q.  How? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean Mahan is a guy that hasn't gotten a lot of attention.  He's lineman of the year.  Can you talk about some things he brought to the team and how important that may be now with new guys? </p>
<p>	Q.  You say it would be hard to identify, but do you have any sense that the team might have been either physically or emotionally weary heading into November?  Seemed like a time the team didn't have maybe quite the spark or swagger in some of the November games as in October. </p>
<p>	Q.  The converse of that, whatever that was, is the fact that you have this long time in between games.</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, I wondered, obviously you're coming off the game, Southern Cal, with their offense run by Norm.  Do you see similarities, strong similarities, some similarities between the two offenses? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you see that concerns you?  Talk about their offense a little bit, the challenges it presents. </p>
<p>	Q.  North Carolina State. </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the team, coming off a very rough loss, you have a month in between games, do you worry that doubt or lack of confidence might set in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you almost lose some of the stuff that happened during the season, and you have to work to make sure the players are ready?  Sometimes it seems in Bowl games, one team is ready, the other isn't.  How do you avoid that? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a result of his mobility? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what you've seen of No.  44 on tape? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was that something that you had to give USC, whereas against North Carolina State that wouldn't happen. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) match-ups and substitution?  Is that an added emphasis? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch them on tape, can you see defenses confused? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how much things can change in a month.  Cedric and Jerome, are they doing okay? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder more in a general sense.  Nobody is fully healthy after the first game of the season.  Do you see guys getting a little bit of that spring back? </p>
<p>	Q.  The situation with North Carolina running people in and out, is it even more important to be proactive, not necessarily waiting to see what they do?  With Air Force, you weren't waiting for the quarterback to make a decision, you were deciding to go in there every play, be proactive.  Is it the same situation?  If they end up in another defense, it could wind up being a good situation for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  That last game, you did have three interceptions, blocked the punt.  Defense made some plays in that game.  Obviously, the result, the bottom line (inaudible).  You did come out of that feeling like you have play-makers on the defense. </p>

<p>	Q.  Curious about your approach after going through finals, getting back into football.  Is it hard or something you can go into easily? </p>
<p>	Q.  With your brother playing at Georgia Tech, did you see NC State?  How aware are you of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  What were your first impressions of Coach Willingham when you had your first meeting with him, got to know him a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is he one of the most intimidating people you ever met, even though he's not necessarily the biggest guy in the world, because of his demeanor? </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you get a feel for what your role is going to be early in the game?  Do you get a sense of what the defense is going to give you quickly? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the evolution of the tight end position in the years you've played it?  Seems like early on you mostly were blocking. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you enjoy one part of the game more than the other? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys played a lot of really big, emotional games in September and October.  Upon reflection, do you feel at all the guys might have been either emotionally or physically spent by the time you got to some of your big November games?  Is that something you can put your finger on? </p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that you had all this time between the end of the regular season and the Bowl opportunity, is that a good thing for you guys, even though there's an awful lot of time in between games, a chance to recharge yourselves? </p>
<p>	Q.  This being your fourth year, is it strange to think you've only played in one Bowl game so far? </p>
<p>	Q.  During the week, somebody asked you about Carlyle, you said nobody had really seen the real Carlyle yet.  Can you talk about some of those things you see Carlyle do in practice that you guys are waiting to jump into the game situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jim and Dan, can you talk about your role helping those guys out, what you can do to make life easier for them? </p>
<p>	Q.  One of the NC State players said the only way this could be better is playing a national championship.  This is the biggest game in the history of their program.  Is it difficult for you guys to get excited about NC State?  As good as they are, it was not a team you ever anticipated playing this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenges of adjusting to the new system through the season, how the offense developed? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you use some of the external things as motivation, the chance to finish in the Top 10, to finish with 11 wins? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you focus on this game as not only the conclusion of this season but the beginning of next year, springboard toward next season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does this team have any worry about confidence (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  The mindset of the offensive line, you're going into the final game with two of your main features missing.  What does that do to the line? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you relate a couple memories you might have from your three years you spent at NC State. </p>
<p>	Q.  You said it was a challenging time.  What do you think the challenges of having a good program at NC State were at that time and how they might have changed over the course of time? </p>
<p>	Q.  The coach here said a couple days ago that you came up to him and introduced yourself to him at the coaching convention after he got the job.  What did you discuss about NC State at that time? </p>
<p>	Q.  When NC State was looking for a coach after the '99 season, Robinson came out and talked with you in southern California.  Can you talk about what those discussions were like, how serious they ever got?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any particular reason why? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you ever feel like you were a candidate?  Did you ever really want to be a candidate for that position at that time? </p>

<p>	Q.  Sounded like a lot of the NC State players are talking about this game as the biggest game they ever played.  How much does that concern you?  Do you address that with the players, what you do to try to defuse that enthusiasm they have for playing in game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk specifically about what you think makes their quarterback such a good quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier Coach Diedrick was talking about (inaudible).  Talk about the importance of experience at every position, but at quarterback? </p>
<p>	Q.  This was a long football season for your team, so many important games.  Upon reflection, do you have any sense that the team might have been at all physically or emotionally weary at the end of October?  Could that have influenced the way they played in some of the November games when you weren't quite as sharp as you were in some of the previous ones?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know if you had formally confirmed that you are starting two offensive tackles, (inaudible) will not be playing in the Gator Bowl.  Can you address that at all?  Also any other defensive players who might be dinged up heading into the Gator Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who is going to be starting at tackle?  That was a position that struggled at times.  The fact you're going into this game with probably one guy who has played some, another guy who hasn't played a lot. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it call for a change in game plan because of experience?  Do you go with the same game plan no matter who? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there some similarities in the situation now to when Pat Dillingham played quarterback?  Extra time, do you think that helps some continuity?</p>
<p>	Q.  NC State defense has seemed to be overshadowed by their offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how you've matured as a coach in terms of Bowl preparation?  What are some of the things you've learned over the last years that you can apply now?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) do you feel throughout November this team did play Notre Dame football?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  You have players that will have to make a decision about coming back.  Do you worry about how they approach this game?  How do you handle that situation in general?  Do you just wait until after the Bowl game is over to sit down and talk with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about your desire to be aggressive.  How concerned are you about NC State's to shuttle players in and out of offense after they break the huddle, how that affects your ability to be aggressive as a team?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked earlier about preparing (inaudible).  What have you learned over the years that presents, how you deal with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about their offensive line?  They've given up 11 sacks this year.  Coach Baer was talking about that's unheard of. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it kind of amazing to you, still ironic that you're going to be playing the last game of this year on the day that you were hired last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you think about the players, Gary Godsey said one of the things they want to do is make sure you get off to a good start.  They think 11 wins is going to be much better than 10. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think about finishing in the Top 10 for the first time since '93?  Longest time in Notre Dame history without being in the Top 10. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems astounding that Notre Dame hasn't had a Bowl victory in nearly a decade.  Is that something you would address with the team?  Is that an additional motivating force against North Carolina State?</p>
<p>	Q.  The issue of the illegality or legality of their substitution thing, how do you address that?  It's something they've been doing all year and haven't gotten flagged for.  Is it something you can protest or bring up?  How do you respond to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you contending this is outside the rule or something that maybe should be addressed by the rules?</p>

<p>	Q.  Could you give me your impressions from watching some film of their quarterback and their tailback? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much does their offense remind of you of Southern Cal and what they did? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you want to make the comparison between Carson Palmer and Philips Rivers? </p>
<p>	Q.  They've only allowed 11 sacks all year long.  What do they do to protect the quarterback, to keep him safe?  What do you guys want to try to do to do, what you've done all year long, make big plays, make turnovers, create things like that on defense? </p>

<p>	Q.  You're one of several guys on this team that will have a decision to make about coming back next year.  Is that something going into the game, do you allow yourself to think this could be your last game?  Do you have a timetable for when you want to think about it, how you will handle that prospect? </p>
<p>	Q.  NC State does a lot of substitutions after they break the huddle.  Have you noticed any of that?  Does that concern you at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle, when you do practice, are there certain things you see from him in practice that amaze you, you're waiting for him to move that over to a game situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  NC State has made a big deal out of this is a huge game for them.  Do you think that takes away from your standpoint because this is a big game for your program, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's not going to be the first time there's been more pressure put on defense, losing offensive linemen puts you in that boat again where you might have to pick it up.  "Hey, guys, this needs to happen, we need to be a little extra better this game." </p>
<p>	Q.  Nobody has really talked about it, but the attitude you take down there, to Jacksonville, is it going to be strictly business?  Is it going to be a combination of fun and business?  What are you thinking when you get there the 26th until game day? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday I was talking to some of the basketball players, talking about finals, how draining it is.  From your perspective, getting back to think about football, thinking about tests at the same time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can younger people can take from your example, how serious you're taking your studies? </p>

<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to see much of NC State on film?  What is your impression of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  We heard today about some unusual substitution patterns they have.  Have the coaches addressed that with you guys yet?  Have you seen anything like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  With finals just wrapping up, do you feel mentally ready to get back into kind of a game plan?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it kind of a relief to get back and just focus on football?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned getting down to Florida.  Is it kind of business, fun at the same time?  What mentality are you taking into this? </p>
<p>	Q.  The USC game, seemed like you were on the field pretty much the whole time.  At a certain point you almost (inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  The USC game leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth.  I know you've been busy with finals.  Have you had a moment to look back and say, "We are 10-2"?  After the season last year, the progress you've made, where you are now, have you had a chance to reflect on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like it's been a relatively smooth transition for you guys.  What as accounted for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you worry at all about the confidence of the defense being down?  The last game, most yards given up by Notre Dame, do you worry the confidence is down a bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) one of Notre Dame's better defenses in a long time. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes people do forget you're student athletes.  Talk about that, some of the classes maybe that you had to have, the schedule that you've had this past week.  They don't see you in the class. </p>
<p>	Q.  The next couple weeks, what are you looking forward to the most? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a big deal, end the year and start the season with a win?</p>
