 Q.  How does this help the team build some momentum heading forward?  
TREVON GRIMES: Just like last year, this year we came out coming off last year, and we knew we had to pick up where we left off, so next year coming in, we have 11 wins, so next year we have to try to strive for 12 wins and so forth and go for the National Championship. I feel like it gives us a lot of momentum going into next year.   
 Q.  How did getting on the board a minute into the game help the momentum you had all night?  
TREVON GRIMES: Oh, it was phenomenal, and then especially seeing the fans happy, we thrive on that. Getting on the board first, going up first, it was like no looking back, and we knew that if we got on the board first, it was going to be hard for them to come back, and as you could see they weren't able to, and we came out with a victory.   
 Q.  How satisfying was this win today?  
ZACHARY CARTER: Man, it's a great feeling, man. It feels good to be back where we're at. I think we're in a good place heading into next year.   
 Q.  What helped shut down Virginia's offense?  
ZACHARY CARTER: You know, just relentless effort, pursuit to the ball. Their quarterback was pretty slippery, but I think we gave them a few plays, but I think overall we did a great job of slowing them all night.   
 Q.  How does this help the team going into next year?  
ZACHARY CARTER: Oh, man, this is a stepping-stone going into next year. We're in the Orange Bowl next year, and I feel like we'll be back in Miami next year for the championship.
