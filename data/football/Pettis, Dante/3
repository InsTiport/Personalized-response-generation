Q. Obviously, all the success you guys have in the air, Myles seems like kind of a quiet constant in all of this.  Would you kind of agree with that assessment in terms of what he's been able to do?
DANTE PETTIS: No doubt.  Teams were worried about him having a great season last year so teams obviously wanted to kind of hold him down.  Definitely cleared some stuff up for us.  They're always worried about him running the ball.  Definitely helps the passing game.
Q. Your head coach, talking with some of your teammates, there's two personalities.  There's Coach Petersen and there's the guy off the field.  What is he like, I guess, kind of behind the scenes?
DANTE PETTIS: A lot of fun.  He messes around a lot.  He jokes around with us.  I know the media never sees it, but he does have a lot of fun.
Q. So is he like a practical joke guy?  Has he done anything like that, like anything memorable with you that's something he's done that stands out?
DANTE PETTIS: I remember when he first got to Washington, I wasn't here yet, but I was committed.  I was signed.  For April Fool's, he brought up these uniforms.  They were absolutely awful.  He was like, Oh, we got new uniforms, brings them out and he's acting all excited about them.
Then everyone's like, What?  Like what are those?
And then eventually, he was like, No, April Fool's, guys.  Brings out the real ones.  So that was pretty funny.  I was laughing at that.
There's little stuff that, you know, in meetings, he'll be joking about.  He's not serious all the time.
