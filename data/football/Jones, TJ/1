THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   Didn't look like you were playing your best ball.   
T.J. JONES:   I mean, I don't know if there's much you can take away.   We made a lot of mistakes.   I don't know if I would consider this our best ball, this particular game.   
It's a loss.   Like I said, there's no moral victories, nothing positive we're looking to take from a loss.   
   
 Q.   (Question regarding the bowl game.)   
T.J. JONES:   Whichever one we choose to play in, it's another game, another chance to get a win, our last game in a Notre Dame uniform.   
   
 Q.   Coach Kelly consulted the seniors about that.   Have you dealt with that issue?  
T.J. JONES:   With what issue?   
   
 Q.   As far as where you go from here bowl‑wise.   
T.J. JONES:   He said he's going to have a meeting with us on Thursday morning once he figures more of where we're going to go.   
   
 Q.   What is your sense of what the senior class wants?   He's talked about you being rewarded.   
T.J. JONES:   Definitely not to play somewhere where it's snowing.   
   
 Q.   That would be New York.   
T.J. JONES:   Yeah.   
Other than that, we'll go wherever.   We'll play wherever we can get the win.   
   
 Q.   What do you think is the next step for DaVaris in terms of knowing where to be all the time?  
T.J. JONES:   I think it just comes with maturity, with understanding the offense and the defense, understanding our schemes, understanding what defenses are going to try to do to stop him.   That will teach him how to get more open on a more consistent basis.   
   
 Q.   Does he get that, that's the next step he needs to take?  
T.J. JONES:   I think he does.   I think you've seen late in the season, he's made more plays, getting open more.   He's being more of a go‑to guy.   It's something you can see that's going to grow in the future.   
   
 Q.   How do you digest an 8‑4 season?  
T.J. JONES:   8‑4.   You're not great.   You're not terrible.   A little better than average.   9‑4 will sound better at the end of the season, though.
