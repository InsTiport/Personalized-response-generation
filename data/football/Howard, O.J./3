Q. How do you know when teams tap out, when they're tapped out?  Explain that a little bit.
O.J. HOWARD: It's mostly about how do you feel when your think your opponent's done playing.  It's mostly about when they give up, you can kind of tell.  Then don't want to come off the ball as hard anymore.  You know you got the upside on them.
