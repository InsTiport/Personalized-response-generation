 Q.  What do you think you guys do that's going to be the biggest challenge for Washington?  
O.J. HOWARD: That's a good question, really.  If I told you that, I'm telling the game plan.  But I just think we do some things that are effective.  We see some mismatches on film that we can kind of attack.  So I think certain areas, we'll be able to get them in the running game.   
 Q.  As far as what -- again, I know you can't give away the game plan.  What do you see you could attack or where do you think you might be able to have success personally or individually in the game?  
O.J. HOWARD: Passing game, obviously, I think.  But probably, you know, certain areas, my one-on-one match-ups.  For me, I think if I can get open on one-on-one matchups, Jalen will be able to see me.  It comes down to me getting open.  I've been practicing that, trying to get open, one-on-one matchups.   
 Q.  Do they remind you of anybody you've seen earlier this year?  
O.J. HOWARD: They really don't.  Honestly, these guys are totally different.  Their defense is really all-around good.  They've got guys up front 320 pounds-plus.  But they're so athletic.  Their secondary speaks for itself.  They create turnovers.  They lead the nation in that.  These guys, they're no defense we've seen before.  They're one of their own, and they're really good.
