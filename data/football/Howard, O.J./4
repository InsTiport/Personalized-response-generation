 Q.  The offense under Steve Sarkisian, what kind of impact has he had?  It's been a few months behind the scenes.  What kind of impact has he had?  
O.J. HOWARD: Great impact.  Coach Sarkisian does a great job.  He's a great offensive coordinator.  He knows how to draw plays.  I think him and Coach Kiffin go hand in hand with each other.  If he can come in, do a great job for the offense next season, I think, you know, he's a really good offensive coordinator.   
 Q.  You guys know what he's gone through obviously to get back to this point.  How refreshing is it, from your perspective, to see a guy get a second crack and lead one of the best offenses in college football?  
O.J. HOWARD: That's what it's all about, getting second opportunities and making a new start.  This is a chance for Coach Sarkisian to do that.  I know he'll do a great job.   
 Q.  Yesterday talking to John Allen about practice and how miserable it is to make sure that on Saturdays the game is almost like a change of pace.  What is practice like in your mind?  Is it brutal?  Is it as hard as some of the guys have said?  
O.J. HOWARD: Oh, yeah.  We're facing the best defense in the country every day.  They're not letting up on us just because we're teammates.  So we're pushing hard at each other.  We may get into it with each other.  That's how serious it gets at practice.  But at the end of the day, we get on that field on Saturday, we're going to play hard for one another.   
But practice is pretty tough.  But that's what makes it so good, go hard at practice.
