ARDARIUS STEWART: He has a great impact.  Being the offensive mastermind as him, he sees a lot of things.  He's helped me see a lot of things as well, the coverages, different types of things like that.  So he's a great coach.  Happy to be coached by him.
Q. How much of a hands-on role does Steve Sarkisian have with the offense right now?
ARDARIUS STEWART: Right now, he's just trying to get into the swing of things.  So not too much right now, but later on he will.
Q. Do you think there will be a drop-off from Lane to him?
ARDARIUS STEWART: That ain't for me to decide.
Q. So matching up with Washington's DBs, how excited are you to bring your skill-set, maybe give them something they haven't seen before?
ARDARIUS STEWART: I'm very excited to come out and show what we can do on the offensive side.  So this is going to be something you've got to tune in to watch.
Q. So you've had a lot of impact not only catching and passing the ball, but running the sweeps and everything.  Does your sideline-to-sideline speed give you maybe a different edge?
ARDARIUS STEWART: I'm sure it does.  Any type of speed, straight line, side to side, you know, quickness, all that, it helps in the game, in this kind of game.  So I think we're going to be all right.
