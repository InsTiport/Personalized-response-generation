Q. Jalen Hurts sort of emerges as the quarterback, what did you think of him at first in that area?
ARDARIUS STEWART: He had a lot of growing to do and he did it.  He was making small mistakes, little mental errors.  Everything he needed to get together, he got together.  He's a young guy then.  He's still a young guy.  He's just improved.
Q. Do you think next year going forward, it's going to be like his team a little bit?
ARDARIUS STEWART: It will be because he has the leadership mentality already, so he's going to continue to grow.
Q. ArDarius, it's almost home away from home.  It's almost like home field.
ARDARIUS STEWART: Helps a lot.
Q. How do you feel going in?
ARDARIUS STEWART: Feeling all right.  The team's confident.
Q. So much has been made of your defense, but you look at Washington's defense, they get after it.
ARDARIUS STEWART: All those guys are great.  They've got a lot of speed.  They've got a lot of great cornerbacks and DBs on the line.  So we'll have our work cut out for us.
Q. How has your offense evolved?  You've got to feel good.  Talking about Jalen, him aside, you and Calvin and the guys, you've become the guy too.  You got to feel good about that.
ARDARIUS STEWART: Feels great.  All of us have been together this whole year.  Figured out things we need to work on, and just trying to get better still.  The season's still going.
Q. Would you rather catch an 80-yard touchdown pass or throw an 80-yard touchdown pass?
ARDARIUS STEWART: Probably throw.  I like to throw.
