 Q.  What do you think is the biggest challenge that the Alabama defense is going to pose for you guys?  
DARRELL DANIELS: Shoot, I don't know.  I can't really say that.  We focus on ourselves.  We don't really focus on what the challenges will be.  Obviously, we know that they're a good defense, but we're going to believe in our preparation and believe in our game plan and do what we do.  We're going to execute the best we can.   
 Q.  Turn it around a little bit.  What do you guys do that you think will be a challenge for Alabama?  
DARRELL DANIELS: We're a team.  We're brothers.  We're a group of brothers on the offense and we believe in each other.  We got Jake back there calling the shots and we've got play makers on the outside like John Ross, Dante Pettis, myself.  The offensive line, we play as one unit.  That's going to be a challenge for them right there.   
 Q.  As far as how things are going this week, does this kind of feel like a normal Bowl Week for you guys from what you're used to, or does this feel like a totally different situation?  
DARRELL DANIELS: This feels like another game to us.  But obviously, we know that this platform is a lot bigger.  We're in the playoffs and we're going to do what we do each and every week.  We're out here and we're going to believe in our preparation and we're going to take care of business on Saturday.
