 Q.  With Alabama, what do you think you guys do?  
DARRELL DANIELS: We pay attention to the details.  We've got to hold on to the ball, be pretty stingy with the ball.   
We've got a good leader like Jake back there calling the shots and he gives us the opportunity to make plays when we do what we do.  Offensive line, they're young but they're still smart and they tend to their business too.  We've got great wideouts like John Ross and Dante Pettis that go out and get the ball.   
 Q.  What do you think about your matchup with the Alabama defense?  Are you excited?  
DARRELL DANIELS: We're definitely excited.  We have defense in our conference and we go against those guys every day.  So it probably won't too much different.  Just different players on the other side of the field, but we're going to be prepared for that.
