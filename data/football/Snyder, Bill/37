<p>	Q.  Bill, I want to talk to you, I guess, about the defense.  Can you talk about that, obviously, top 10 for so many years and last year fell off.  Starting with the off season program to where you are now, is it getting near where you expect it to be each year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Snyder, when you speak to like Rod Cole, what is the assessment that he gives you or the idea with the off-season workouts and how the players are progressing right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are spirit and discipline things that can be identified in recruiting, taught when players arrive, or does that come from within, something the players have to figure out for themselves? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, what do you tell your friends when they ask you, you know, how to explain what happened last year? </p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, you had a situation where a running back Darren Sproles, his era is over, that chapter is closed and it was a great run.  Where are you at that position at this point in time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bill, I wondered if you can talk about your quarterbacks and if (inaudible) Dylan Meier can come back from the spring injury he had. </p>
<p>	Q.  Bill, as a follow-up, a lot of Big 12 teams are fairly unsettled at quarterback going into this year.  How difficult is it to have early success and sustain it when that position is somewhat up in the air? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Snyder, again, I don't know if "excited" is the right word, but how much are you looking forward to getting the summer team workouts, fall practices underway for this team after a long off-season coming off last season? </p>
