 Q.   Brandon, you told me a few days that the seniors were going to come out with some fire, and lo and behold.   
BRANDON ARMSTRONG:   Yeah, like I told you when we was at practice, seniors was going to come out no doubt with fire and make sure we do everything possible we can to get this win because we know it's been an up‑and‑down season, but we just wanted to make sure we give 110 percent because we don't we ain't going to get to lace it up, come back in the spring, do what we usually do.   It's time to focus on different things.   But we're just happy we came out, played strong, got the W.   
   
 Q.   Dave, talk about what it was like to have a healthy Tucker Carter in there.   He threw two touchdown passes, ran for one, and on that option when he pitched to you, he got hit real‑‑ he got clocked and yet the pitch was right there.   Can you talk about what it was like to have him in command?   
DAVID GLASCO:   It was huge because we've been struggling at that position this whole year with injuries and everything, and I wouldn't rather have it any other way.   It's like a fairy‑tale, Tuck's senior year, and he had a damn good game.   I'm proud of him, and I'm grateful for him.   I'm grateful for you.   
BRANDON ARMSTRONG:   I ain't got too much to say, but there's a reason why he was the No.1 quarterback, because he knows how to get run the offense.   We already knew he was going to do it because when he's healthy and feeling good, he's always going to play good when he's that way.   
   
 Q.   Tucker, can you talk about the day in general, how you played, and then some of your emotions immediately following the game?   
TUCKER CARTER:   Well, I was considering this week itself was an emotional week for us.   What we tried to do was emphasize was just have fun in practice.   When we have fun we enjoy each other's company since this is the last time we're going to lace it up together, in practice or a game.   I just want to play the game, really, and after we played, and we played well on all cylinders on offense, offensive line, running backs, everyone played well, and it was great.   I've been an emotional wreck all week to tell you the truth, I just wanted to get here and play the ballgame and enjoy it with my teammates.   
   
 Q.   I just want to ask you, Tucker, did you feel stronger?   You seemed to get better as the game went on.   I know you're a very confident person but you seemed to get stronger and you got on a roll, and what was impressive is you seemed to utilize everything that was at your disposal.   We hadn't seen the tight ends catch passes like that in a while and you were using the whole field.   
TUCKER CARTER:   Well, I mean, as a quarterback you always want to get off to a hot start.   I mean any position, really.   We want to get the ball in the playmaker's hands, and that's my job is to get to them.   Those guys are great athletes and allow me to spread it around.   I got everyone involved, the offensive line came off the ball, really got after them.   That's what this offense is built on.   Coach Brown put us in a great situations to be successful today, and we were, so I'm happy.   
   
 Q.   Dave, speak about the original 18 and what you feel like that‑‑ what do you feel like that group is all about?   What is this group's legacy?   
DAVID GLASCO:   When you look at us, it's like I told you in an interview earlier in the week, that when you look at all the original 18 members, there's been some type of adversity that we've had to overcome at our time here.   And I think with that, it's helped us not only as football players overcoming odds, but I think that's going to be a recipe for success in the future with us becoming successful men, and whatever it is we choose to do, open a business, go to work, some of us go to the league, whatever the case is.   I think that when people look back at the 18 that started this, they're going to say, wow, those are some special guys.   I just think we really do have a special‑‑ you can't‑‑ not to sound arrogant, you can't do what we did with average men.   That just doesn't happen with average men.   What we did, I think it was historic, it was colossal, and I'm just proud to be a part of it.   
   
 Q.   I think a lot of times we forget you guys are in college and not pros and you're playing at a school, and I know obviously a lot of the students are on Thanksgiving break but there were some students here.   I've always thought it was so impressive even though we're busy trying to hit our deadlines and get our stories in right after the game is when they play the alma mater and you guys go over there.   Can you tell us what that's like?   
BRANDON ARMSTRONG:   For me it was just real emotional knowing that we don't get to do that again.   Singing the school song for the last time with everybody on the field and holding up that runner sign.   I'm pretty sure everybody else has just had a little emotion just built up, and like we've been saying all week, we're going to miss everything about UTSA.   It's just a great place, and yeah, just try to enjoy this win.   
TUCKER CARTER:   I think it's a great deal of pride.   You see it even when we've lost games we go over and pay respect to our school.   I told the younger guys earlier this beak I'm really thankful for them, as well.   We all bought into like a dream.   The younger guys bought into us.   It's really special, like it's something that we can't create otherwise.   We can't take the school spirit for granted.   You're always going to remember your last alma mater, your last this, your last that.   It was emotional.   It got the best of me a little bit.   I saw BA cry first.   I didn't cry first.   (Laughter.)   Yeah, it was a great feeling and a bad feeling all in one.   
BRANDON ARMSTRONG:   Well, I don't cry.   Y'all ain't going to get no tears out of me.   No, I'm joking, I was crying like a baby earlier today.   I think the alma mater just represents the great culture they've created here that President Romo and Ms.Lynn Hickey has helped build, Coach Coker has helped build.   I think the alma mater stands for that and much more, and not just sports‑wise, neither.   I think the culture that we have as a university, for the city of San Antonio, I'm just‑‑ yeah, I think it's a great feeling.   It's a great example of what we do.
