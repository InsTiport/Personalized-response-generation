 Q. How do you guys kind of pick up the pieces, so to speak, offensively, and remain confident going into obviously another difficult game? 
     BLAINE KIRBY: You know, I think after every game we kind of have something called a 24‑hour rule where on Sunday we watch fOlm, we correct everything that kind of went wrong and really review our game plan, and whether it's a win or a loss, you have to forget about the previous game. It might be a little more difficult this week, but I think everyone just has to stay confident and just really trust our game plan on offense and defense and just prepare like we've been doing every game.
     So I think this week is going to be a good week of preparation. 

 Q. Did it feel good to get a couple of catches?
     BLAINE KIRBY: Yeah. I mean, even after a disappointing loss, I mean, that was a good time, catching those balls. Yeah, I mean, it would have been better if we would have won the game. But at the same time, it's good just to kind of get that out of the way and just start playing football again. 

 Q. Is it nice to be back home? 
     BLAINE KIRBY: Back home in Austin? 

 Q. Yeah. 
     BLAINE KIRBY: Yes. It's going to be great playing in front of our fans for the first time in a while. I think our fans always bring a spirit about them, and we saw it last week in DaRlas, but now we're going to have about 100,000 of them now. It's going to be fun. 

 Q. What do you say to Case and David after a game like that?
     BLAINE KIRBY: I was talking to both of them during the game just to keep their head up and stay confident and trust their ability to play. We're not going to be able to win with five turnovers happening, but at the same time, they just have to really know that they're both great players, and they just have to trust their ability in playing football. I was just telling Case ‑‑ it was really Case, telling him just to keep his head up and that we're still following him and we still have trust in him. What happened last week was unfortunate, but it's like one of those deals where you just have to forget about it and just play the next play.
