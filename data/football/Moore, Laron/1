 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Taylor and LaRon. 

 Q. Taylor, could you talk about how the offense felt tonight and how it feels moving into a Bowl season? 
 TAYLOR POTTS: We felt pretty good tonight. Confident coming into the game. Had a really good game plan. We just needed to execute and put as many points on the board as we could. And that's what we came out, tried to do. We had several turnovers that killed us that could have made the game a lot different than it was. 
 But going into a Bowl game, you know, two games in a row, we haven't won two games in a row in a while. Offensively we're thinking, you know, as long as we don't turn the ball over we'll be good.

 Q. LaRon, did you feel like the defense had kind of a bend-but-don't-break kind of game and came up with the big plays when you needed them? 
 LARON MOORE: We knew we were going to have a tough game because they're a great offense. Houston runs the same scheme that we've run. So they're going to be putting the ball up in the air a lot. We knew we had to come out. We had to blitz them.
 They got a couple of plays they got out that they shouldn't have got out, but the young guys stepped up and helped the seniors out and we made plays when we needed to.

 Q. Taylor, can you talk about your 28-yard run early in the third quarter where you were kind of directing the blockers in front of you?
 TAYLOR POTTS: You know, that's kind of what we saw. Just trying to get as many yards as I could.

 Q. Taylor, obviously we've talked about it your entire career, but could you talk about your relationship with Leong and how special that's been and a chance to play with him basically your entire life here? 
 TAYLOR POTTS: It's been a lot of fun. I told him before the game, I said: Man, 18 years is coming to an end tonight. We've got one more. But the last time at Jones. The last time we play together here. I'm just glad we came out with the win. That's what we wanted to do, most importantly. But playing together with him, you know, pretty much since I was in third grade, it's been a lot of fun and it's pretty special. 
 I'm glad we got the win. I'm glad he did well. And glad it ended up on a touchdown pass to him. So that's kind of cool.

 Q. Taylor, on that touchdown, coach said that Lyle embellished a little bit, made it a little harder than it looked. What did he say when you got to the sideline? 
 TAYLOR POTTS: That play was all him. It was a terrible throw. He made a great catch and stayed up and ran in. I mean, that's kind of what Lyle's done his whole career, just has made me look better than I really am. He makes those great catches like that. 
 No, he did a great job being able to catch it like that and stay up and run in.

 Q. For both of you, I know last week was Senior Day. But talk about your last game here at Jones Stadium. 
 TAYLOR POTTS: The fact that we won means kind of everything. That's how we wanted it. And that's what we talked about all week. The seniors especially wanted to go out on top with a win, and that's kind of what we really focused on this week. 
 And it's really special that we're able to do that. And, like I said, I'm just glad we were able to win it. For the seniors who have been here and been through a lot, it's really special that we were able to win our last game here.
 LARON MOORE: All week on defense, we just talked about not living in the moment right then, just take it as a normal game and then let the moment come to us after the game. Because we wanted to go out on a win.
 We just told the young guys, especially me, I told the young guys, you know, cherish every moment because it will be over before you know it. Me and Duncan, we were talking, seemed like we were here yesterday. We've been here five years. 
 So even though last week was Senior Day, this was really Senior Day in my mind because this is the last game I ever play here at Tech. I'm glad we came out with the win. So it was good.

 Q. Both of you, do you feel like you're playing the best football right now heading into that Bowl game, headed into the Bowl season with the two wins in a row and with some momentum right now?
 LARON MOORE: I think on defense we started to be consistent and know that and see and believe in the system. I believe that is what we struggled with during the season, that some of the guys didn't really believe.
 But now they're seeing the outcome of what you do if you take everything step-by-step and do what the coaches tell you to do. 
 Because we got a lot of young guys playing. So some of these guys are just in high school last year. So they really don't know what college football is all about. And now they're learning, and they're seeing it. And that's the reason why we're playing better on defense.
 They're actually seeing that it takes more than just running fast or being big. You gotta know the game. They're learning it, learning the system, and they're going to be really good next year. 
 It's going to be like a catalyst to next year, this Bowl game.
 TAYLOR POTTS: I think we're playing a lot better right now. The receivers are playing great. O line is playing the best they have all year. The running backs are running hard and running great and that makes my job a lot easier.
 When you got guys around you playing as well as everybody is right now, it makes my job pretty easy, and we're able to put points on the board and get wins.

 Q. Taylor, how much easier has it been to find Detron since his move to the outside? 
 TAYLOR POTTS: I think it was a good switch. He seems pretty comfortable out there. And he kind of has a knack for it. And he's a great athlete. 
 So kind of wherever you move him, he's going to do really well. But he has a knack for it out there. And kind of when the ball's thrown to him, he's going to make the play. That's how he's always been, but it kind of exposes him a little more when he's out there on the outside, catches a few more balls and that kind of thing. He's done a great job with the move. Didn't think twice about it, just thought, hey, this can be really good if I bust my butt on it. So let's go get it done.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
