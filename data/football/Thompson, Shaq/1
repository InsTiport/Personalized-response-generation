		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   What was that first year like and what was that specific position like?
SHAQ THOMPSON:   It was like a hybrid.   Stayed in there for like nickel back. 

Q.   How do you think you evolved as a linebacker?
SHAQ THOMPSON:   Honestly, I think I improved just being there.   John Timu helped me out.   Opened up my eyes, made me a better linebacker. 

Q.   Did that include film study, hanging out outside of the facility, all that? 
SHAQ THOMPSON:   Yeah, I mean, I do film study on my own just to get used to it.   High school we never really watched film.   That was something new to me. 
I had to click on it fast, see what the opponent was doing.   High school, my coach just looked at the tape for us, came to practice, told us what to do. 

Q.   A lot of people don't know how to break film down. 
SHAQ THOMPSON:   There's a lot to it.   You got to really think about what they like to run, their top passes, second‑and‑10, what they like to do, third‑and‑five, what they like to do, break down basically what they like to do.   Just imagine yourself on the field playing through your calls and make plays. 

Q.   What about your decision about the NFL?   Have you made it yet?
SHAQ THOMPSON:   I haven't made it yet.   After this, I'll sit down with coach, go through the pros and cons, see where it goes. 

Q.   Does that weigh on your mind at all?
SHAQ THOMPSON:   No, I'm just focused on this game.
