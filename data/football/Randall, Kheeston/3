 Q. How did you feel like the defensive line did Saturday night?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Well, after the game I felt pretty good, but Sunday we seen a lot of plays that we left on the field, and that's something we need to correct for this upcoming game.

 Q. They hit you up the middle a little bit. 
 KHEESTON RANDALL: We just had a few misfits and a little bit of technique issues. But other than that, it all can be fixed in this upcoming week.

 Q. What have you heard about BYU?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I've heard they're an older group, they're pretty big, and that's about it. I'm going to check out some film on them this evening after I'm done with study hall and whatnot.

 Q. Does that present a challenge?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: It doesn't really matter to me. Physical is just more bodies you've got to play.

 Q. Is it at all comparable with UCLA last year with their big guys up front?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I think their offense is totally different because they hand the ball out a lot more, so it's just something I have to check in the film room and see how it compares. 

 Q. Do you like playing in bigger games like this, this early on in the season?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I don't really mind it. I just like playing football. We only get 12, 13 games, so no matter who we're playing, we've still got to go out and play.
