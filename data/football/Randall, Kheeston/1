  Q. Mack said that last year's Iowa State game and last year's UCLA game were kind of similar. From a defensive standpoint do you agree with that, and how do you see those guys?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, they both like to run the ball, so just got to stop the run.   
  
  Q. What did you take from last year's Iowa State game?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: That we should win. We should win every single game, no matter who we're playing, and they outperformed us last season and we can't let that happen again next year.  
  
  Q. What do you know about this year's team?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: They're 3 and 0, they're very confident. They like to run the football. They have a nice, solid offensive line up front and some pretty good backs.   
  
  Q. What did this year's UCLA game do for you guys confidence wise?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Got us to 3 and 0, so that's good.   
  
  Q. But I mean, it was your most complete performance of the year. Did it kind of in your mind say, okay, this is working?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, we know we're on the right track, but at the same time it showed a glimpse of how good we can be, and it also showed us what we need to do to get better and become a dominant defense.   
  
  Q. Do you think this bye week has been helpful for the team going into conference play?  
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, it's been helpful. We didn't have a game this weekend but most of us still worked out and stuff, so we're excited for this upcoming game.  
  
  Q. Did you watch any football this weekend?   
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I watched a little bit. I watched a few games. I was really at the pool, went to the pool and just hung out.
