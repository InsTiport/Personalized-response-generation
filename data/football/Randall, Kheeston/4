   KHEESTON RANDALL: I just feel like we feel like a new team, that we have new coaches, new players, and Coach Brown always tells us after every season the team that next year is a brand new team, whether it's with the incoming freshmen, the new senior and junior leadership or just the things that we do going into the season, whether it's some workouts or the spring before. It's just a new team, a new Texas team. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I'm real excited. We go through spring together, summer we're hanging out together and fall camp, and I love my teammates to death, but it's time for us to go out and test our skills against someone else. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Calvin has been working hard all summer. He's a lot more focused, and he's paying greater attention to detail, and that's something that Coach Davis has helped us both out with. He always tells us it's not the big thing that gets us in trouble, it's the small things, the steps taken and not using our hands. He's been a great teacher for the whole room. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Actually like this last week it's been great for me, like everything has come along a lot smoother, and I'm starting to finally understand what the coaches want out of me and this defense. Honestly I'm just getting a great feel for it. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, more technicality than anything, nothing to do with effort, just know where my responsibilities lie in each defense that we run and how I can help the tackle next to me or the end next to me in the certain formations. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: We just need to go out and play a great game and have fun. We didn't have fun last year, and that's something we need to do this season. When we do that, we'll be fine. We'll be the Texas that we need to be.
