 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: I haven't really thought about it, no. Things happen, so we're going to bounce back this year. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, Ashton played great. It was nice having him in the lineup next to me, and we're going to look towards building up a better relationship and keep the progress going into this upcoming game. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Ashton? He's from East Texas. He's a real nice guy. That's about it. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Well, we talked Sunday, and everything -- when we usually talk on Sunday, he shows the highlight table of the good and the bad plays, and we just left so many plays out on the field that it's still discouraging, but at the same time it lets us know that we can still be so much better as a unit. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, we definitely made progress, but we need to continue going into tomorrow. We have a Tuesday practice that's usually the hardest day, and we need to just built on the momentum from these last two games. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Like I said, I've thought about it, but it's a new season, new team, so nothing really to worry about, we've just got to go out and play to our best abilities. 

 Q. How physical were they last year?
 KHEESTON RANDALL: They were pretty physical, but it's nothing we can't handle this year. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, it's definitely a nice place, but we have to come out with a win this time. We didn't do so well last time we were in that area. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 KHEESTON RANDALL: Yeah, definitely, but we've got to keep on moving.
