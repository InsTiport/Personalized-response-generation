  ARTHUR BLANK:  I first want to start and thank you all for your patience during this last week.  We've had a lot to sort through, a lot of details, and we've got a number of people involved in dealing with Michael Vick's indictment.    
 This was and remains a very complex issue, which involves the National Football League, the Atlanta Falcons, the player, the Union, as well as the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  We knew, however, that we needed to make some decisions before training camp opened Thursday.    
 So we've been working with the League since last week on how best to deal with this.  Many options were discussed, including a paid leave of absence, which we didn't think was appropriate or sufficient under the circumstances.    
After a lot of conversations and giveÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½andÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½take by all parties involved, yesterday, as you know, the Commissioner notified Michael that he was not to report to training camp while the Commissioner was completing his review of this situation.    
 Prior to this action, the Falcons were pursuing the maximum discipline that we could under the CBA, a fourÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½week suspension, and had gone so far as to draft the suspension letter.  The Commissioner asked us not to take any action until he completed his review of the situation, and we agreed to his request.    
 Our preference was for the club to take an action, but after reviewing all options, I do think that this is the best approach for all involved at this time.  We're also in agreement with Michael's not attending training camp during the Commissioner's review.  We need to allow Coach Petrino, his staff and our players to conduct a focused training camp.  We owe it to them, and we need to provide them an environment in which they can plan for the season, working under the assumption that Michael's absence might well run into the regular season.    
 We don't know where things will go from here.  New information, whether it be from the Commissioner's completing his review or from further developments related to the indictment, will determine that.    
 This has been a difficult week in any respect that you can think of.  The indictment of Michael Vick has affected everyone associated with the Falcons, the National Football League, our players, coaches, our associates our sponsors, our season ticket holders, our other fans, the Atlanta community, and you in this room.  But it has also gone beyond our partners.    
 The details of the indictment have touched the emotions of people across the country, and we have heard from many of them.  I know that many people are deeply distraught and besided by what they read in the indictment, and I am as well.    
 Regardless of the outcome of this case, this issue has put a spotlight on one of those things that remains wrong in this world.  The notion that anyone would participate in dogfighting is incomprehensible to me.    
 However, we do need to remember that we're dealing with allegations at this point.  I want to be clear that we're not here today to pass judgment on Michael's guilt or innocence on the indictment.  The courts will determine that.  However, we simply cannot allow this latest event to disrupt what we're trying to achieve in the Falcons building both on the field and in the community.    
 Neither can we allow our emotions to drive our actions right now.  Our role is to deal with the facts that we have, and do what's best for all parties affected by this.  That is the approach that we'll continue to take.    
To our fans and to all fans of the National Football League, I want to emphasize that this team, our entire organization is committed to doing the right thing both on and off the field.  I said that when I bought the club and remain committed to that today.  No one will compromise what we stand for.    
 I'm going to ask Rich now to address a few details, and Rich, Bobby and I will be available for your questions.  Rich?    
 RICH McKAY:  With respect to a couple of things I wanted to raise, with respect to timeline, a lot's been said about why is it taking so long?  And I would just say to you that there are a number of parties that are involved in the discussions.  We needed internally to gather a lot of facts and not act, in our mind, too quickly.  And as I said, as we move down that path, we wanted to make sure that what we did was in the best interest of our players, best interest of our fans, best interest of the NFL, and with Michael's interests also.  So we took our time, and I think in the end, we made a decision and came to a decision that I thought was well thought out.    
 With respect to discussing this situation, in our mind, today's the day.  So any questions you have, feel free to ask them.  We've got a football team that Coach Petrino and his staff need the right environment to get ready to play in the '07 Season.  So for us, until the circumstances change, we will not be discussing this situation.  Any questions with respect to football, any day you want to ask them, feel free.  With respect to this current situation, as I say, until the circumstances change, we owe it to our players to try to create an environment that is focused and ready for football.  So that would certainly be what we're about.    
 Today's not a day, given all of you, that we're going to engage in oneÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½onÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½one interviews.  So again, I say to you, if you've got questions, don't hold them back, because in reality, we just can't do oneÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½onÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ones.  Wish we could.  I know there are some of you that would like to.  Obviously, we've got some relationships with many of you that would justify it, we just can't be in that business, because there's too many people and there's too much to be said, probably and with respect to that.    
 Lastly, I'd say, the one thing that I've heard a lot about and realize would be raised today is the old whatÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½if game.  Well, what if this happens or what if that happens?  Or what if you find out this or that?  And I would say to you we can't answer those questions.  There's just no way to.    
We can't deal in what the future may hold.  We can deal with what we're faced with.  The decisions we made.  We can certainly answer all your questions with respect to that.  But with respect to the future, we've got to respect the Commissioner's process.  We've got to respect the time he's going to put in and his office is going to put in with respect to this review, and then we'll figure out where we go from there.    
 So, that's just a couple of things that I wanted to say, with that, I think we'll open it up for questions.    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  No rush, by the way.  We'll be here as long as you want.  We'll serve dinner if you want.  You don't have to rush getting your questions out.  So that's fine.  Yes, sir?    
  
  Q.  You were seeking a maximum suspension before Roger Goodell made his comment.  Did he discuss this with you two or did he act without your knowledge?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I'll answer the first part, Rich will answer the second part.  There was never a breakdown between the communication between myself and the Commissioner.  We spoke frequently, spoke to a number of folks in the league office as did Rich.  We felt that these issues needed to be addressed.  You know, from the League perspective as well as from the club perspective.  And we shared our positions in terms of how we felt about the issues relative to the indictment as early as we possibly could.   
 As you all know, we were out of country until last Wednesday, and as soon as we got back, we began our discussions with the league office.    
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE] also, how much conversation?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I didn't hear the second part of the question.    
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE].    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I'll respond to the first part, Rich can respond to the second part.  In term of the paid leave of absence, we felt given the circumstances of the indictment, given what is recited in the indictment, et cetera, that a paid leave of absence didn't seem to be, to us, the right kind of response for the club.  So we had made the decision, and we made a decision very early on and carefully communicated that to the League that that was not going to be an option for us.  In terms of cutting Michael, Rich?    
 RICH McKAY:  With respect to that question, we discussed every option.  And we also had to deal with the facts as they were presented.  And so we felt like with everything we knew, the appropriate step, and I use the word step, was to impose a suspension and then, remember, there can be more facts into the future.  But that's what the step we contemplated.  But we did discuss, we discussed all methods of dealing with the issue.  This is the one that we felt most comfortable with.    
  
  Q.  The former commissioner saidÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ the Ray Lewis case, the former commissioner said, fine him after the case is over.  Seven years later, that's you know, where is that at?    
 RICH McKAY:  With respect to the Ray Lewis case and this situation, I would leave that question to Commissioner Goodell, he is the one that acted and he's more appropriate to answer that question.  We knew what we were going to do with respect to the facts we were presented to.  And I think with respect to the Commissioner's actions, I'm not sure it's best for us to explain those, it's probably best for him.    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I think that's very fair.    
  
  Q. The news of this investigation, at any point in the last months did you look Michael Vick in the eye and say, "Michael, are you involved in this?  Are you putting us in a bad light?  And did you lie?"  And secondly, also given the fact that the investigation broke three months ago, and all of you had realized for a threeÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½month period that an indictment was at least a possibility, why has it now taken a week after the indictment to come up withÃ¢ï¿½  a remedy?   
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I think in terms with the discussions I've had with Michael or Rich or Bobby, I, you know, I can't speak for those discussions.  The discussions I've had with him was never to the point of did you do or something or didn't you do it.  The question was the kind of circumstances that he put himself in.  The kind of decisions he was making.  The need to make a different set of decisions, whether it would be who he was associated with or the ones he was personally making and pressing him, really, in that regard.    
The second part of the question was?    
  
  Q.  Did you know for three months that an indictment was at least a possibility?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Right.    
  
  Q.  Why was there no plan in place so when it took place Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  As Rich said a second ago, we're not in a position of playing what if this happens or this happens, there's going to be a State indictment, a Federal indictment.  The Federal Government and Department of Justice did not get involved until fairly recently.  It was a state matter prior to that.    
We had no reason, obviously, to believe what came out in the indictment would be in the indictment.  And as soon as we saw the indictment, which was really six days ago now, we began to deal with it.    
 Now, as I said in my prepared comments, this is not a twoÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½party transaction.  We're involved, the player's involved, the League's involved, the Union's involved, the Collective Bargaining Agreement which bridges the relationship between the clubs, the league and the players, is involved as well.  So it's, you know, come up with the rightÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ and obviously, we have to be sensitive to the legal process that the player and this citizen has the right to go through.    
 And the fact that he did not retain his own attorney from a defense standpoint until Monday, until yesterday, made it very difficult to do anything sooner.    
So we felt our response was as quick as we could gather the facts, gather the information, pull people together, assist in that process, along with the league office and make a decision.    
  
  Q.  Can you give us a scenario by which you see Michael playing for the Falcons again?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, as IÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ I think what Rich said is what our response would be.  This is our position today.  We asked for a fourÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½game suspension.  We were prepared to ask for a fourÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½game suspension.  Obviously, we feel comfortable with Michael not being at training camp.    
 Depending on circumstances as they develop, either through the indictment or in any parts around the case, we'll make a decision, and Rich can go through what our options are more clearly than I can.  We'll decide in the future if Mike will play during this year or not.    
  
  Q.  Personally, as the owner of the team, Arthur, do you see him playing for this team ever again?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I think you have to letÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ as I said in my comments, these are charges at this point.  There is a legal process.  The legal process is one that weÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ I wouldn't want to be an American citizen or anybody in this room and not have that legal process in place and really support it.    
 So we will be supportive of Vick.  We'll follow it very closely, and follow any circumstances around it that develop.  And we'll deal with them at the time that they actually do develop.  But to sit here and conjecture as to what they might be would not be wise.    
  
  Q.  There's a line between investigatingÃ¢ï¿½  (INAUDIBLE).    
 RICH McKay:  No special lines of communication.  It's not as though we've received any information prior to the time you've received any information.  We've done our homework, if you will, in trying to stay in touch and have an understanding of what's going on.  But, we've had no advance notice.  We had absolutely no idea that the indictment was coming that day at that time.  And, yet, the question was before, there is always that potential, but there was no timing to us that we knew of.    
  
  Q.  What are your thoughts since you got here, you've had to go through several offÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½field things that you've had to deal with, Coach.  You've dealt with more of that than even coaching the game at this point.  What are your thoughts as you get ready to prepare perhaps without Michael Vick?    
 BOBBY PETRINO:  I think every year you're going to deal with controversy and adversity.  Certainly, we've had our share so far.  One of the keys to coaching and one of the keys to having success is how you deal with it.  How you face it straight on.  How you put it behind you shall and move forward.  And I think that's what we've got to do on Thursday.    
 We've got to get in the meeting room.  We're going to meet with the players.  Make sure we all face it and understand what the situation is as we know it with Michael, and then move on from there and put all our focus on our team getting ready for our opening game.    
  
  Q.  How much does this change perhaps for Harrington to be quarterback of this team?  From another standpoint you talk about how Michael's been in attendance for all his offÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½season workouts and you've worked so much on your system, and now this late date to have to prepare without him?    
 BOBBY PETRINO:  Yeah, that will be different, there is no question about that.  And that's why there will naturally be a little time of healing for everybody.  Because the coaches, the other players, Michael, himself, have put a lot into it in the offÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½season.  Have put a lot of preparation into the upcoming season.  And now we start Thursday, and he's not there.    
 But one thing that we always have done is a real nice job with our backÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½up quarterback and his preparation.  So he steps into that role, Joey does.  And now, really, the competition or what's ahead of us is who is going to be that second quarterback.  You know, that is probably the bigger question that we have right now than as far as who the starter is.  As far as everything is today.    
  
  Q.  So you're not looking for another quarterback?    
 BOBBY PETRINO:  I didn't say that.  We would have to get another quarterback on our roster for Thursday to make sure that we can run the drills.  You have to have four arms in camp.  Whether that's a guy that's ready to compete for the second job or not, I don't know.  But we definitely would have to have somebody come in, certainly keep our eyes open.  It might not be theÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½   
 ARTHUR BLANK:  We would think about Steve Bartkowski or Dave Archer, but they both passed.  So we're looking someplace else.    
  
  Q.  This question is for all three gentlemen.  Talk about tackling adversity and dealing with distractions.  But I'd like to hear from you whether or not you want to see Michael Vick back on the field leading the Falcons as the team quarterback?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, I'll start.  It's not a question of, you know, what is in the indictment is in the indictment.  I would say, you know, if Michael goes through this process and there is substantial proof and, obviously, the court system finds him guilty or he pleads guilty, you know, that's a very fair, very fair question.    
Obviously, there are things, included in the indictment, that, as I said, are very repulsive to all of us.  And we wouldÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ quarterback is not only a technical leader, but a leader of the football team.  And we'd need to look at those circumstances in that light.  That would be my answer.  Rich?    
 RICH McKAY:  I agree with the same way I started with.  To me it's a whatÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½if.  Depends on what happens as we move into the coming weeks or coming months, and you know, from that point we'll sit down and look at the facts and make our decision.    
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE].    
 RICH McKay:  I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know what Michael's position is with respect to that.  I assume that that will be discussed between his agent and his lawyers, and you'll probably hear from them.  I couldn't be the one to give you that answer.    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  My own counsel to Michael would be that this is notÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ these charges are extremely serious.  This is not about him playing football in 2007, this is about him having a life and having a life going forward.  And I would, you know, my only personal suggestion to Michael is that he focus on his defense.  Focus on putting his life together in that regard.  Dealing with the process, which is a very difficult process that he'll be going through in the next number of months.  I think it would be very difficult for him to do that and to be focused on football at the same time.    
  
  Q.  Of the three men up there, you've known Michael longer than anyone else.  When you read the indictment, did you recognize the Michael Vick you knew?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I didn't.  I listened and I read the comments that Coach Reeves made.  He was asked a similar question by somebody.  And what Dan said was this is not the Michael Vick that he knew back in 2001, and it's certainly not the player or the person that I knew in the last six years.    
 So, and that's why you have to go through a judicial system, a legal process.  And again, at this time, these are charges and that's what they are.  They're substantial, they're serious.  They're many fold, his name is mentioned 50 times in the indictment.  I've counted it, I'm aware of it.  So I understand all that.  But it's not the young man that I've gotten to know, certainly.  And I would say that most individuals that I've spoken to who know Michael for a period of time would respond the same, you know, the same way.  Rich has known him for not as long, but some numbers of years as well.    
  
  Q.  You have a huge personal stake and obviously, financial as well.  It seems like yesterday you said you wanted him to be a Falcon for life.  Personally, how do you feel about where you're sitting right now?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, I'm obviously, very disappointed that Michael has put himself in the circumstances that he finds himself now.  I'm disappointed for him.  I'm disappointed for, you know, I feel badly for our coach, our coaches, our players, our fans, the community, for all the fans of the National Football League.    
 Again, as Rich has said, we have to let this play out and see what facts actually develop through the court system.  We don't really know that for certain.    
 But, you know, I'm certainly very disappointed in the circumstances, and very disappointed that Michael would find himself in these kinds of circumstances.    
  
  Q.  What do you thinkÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ (INAUDIBLE).    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I think if you read the letter and the letter from the commissioner has been made public, it was made public last night.  It says that, you know, with Michael's cooperation, he's going to move as quickly as possible as feasible, which I believe he will.  And my conversations with him, I think that's basically been his style as well since he's been the Commissioner.  He gathers facts.  He's not bashful about making decisions.  He'll look at the pros and cons of the decision, and I think he'll make it at that time.    
 Obviously, he only has certain amount of information at this time.  When more information becomes clear over the next several weeks, next several months, I'm not certain.  But he'll be looking at that as well.    
  
  Q.  Roger said weeks ago that regardless of whether or not what actions were taken place, if this was Michael's home, he's responsible for what happens at his home in Virginia, and that the League would consider some kind of disciplinary action.  The Falcons never made that statement, regardless of whether there was an indictment.   Why haven't the Falcons had the conversation of who lives in this home?  And would there be some form of action taken regardless of the fact that there were things happening in his house that he said he was not aware of?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, I think the position that we have was we were gathering information as well.  We had made it very clear, you know, to the player that, obviously, he is responsible for what happens.  We agree with the Commissioner's position on that, which did not include any sort ofÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ I mean, he was not suspended or fined by the league, but we certainly agree with the position.  He is responsible for, you know, for his property.  He's responsible for the people, not for their actions, necessarily, but the people that he does choose to spend time with.  And all of that was addressed with Michael.  And I think, you know, the sense that I had was that Michael had dealt with organ to deal with a lot of those issues himself.    
  
  Q.  How surprised were you by the timeline, that you had conversation with him in February regarding the water bottle incident, and according to the indictment, two months later Mike Vick was on a property, present when there was actual killing of dogs taking place?  Did the timing of that surprise you or shock you at all, given the fact that supposedly you had a conversation with him?    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, I don't relate the issue with the water bottle was, you know, turned out to be a bottle of water that could be unscrewed and things put in it.  It was sold commercially.  So I don't see where that was related at all to this.    
  
  Q.  You had a meeting with him following that.    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Correct, and I think it's all part of what I said a minute or two ago, is that you know, a professional football player, all of us, professional football players are responsible for our behavior whether it's in the limelight or not.  And the circumstances we put ourselves in, and the people that we associated with.  Michael, obviously being the celebrity that he is, and being highÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½profile person that he is, as a football player in the NFL, becomes even more critical at that, and we'd be very sensitive to that.    
  
  Q.  What kind of precautions are you putting in place in connection to [INAUDIBLE].    
 RICH McKAY:  Well, obviously the League has a number of programs in place with respect to educating the players, and has now committed, I believe, in a program that Commissioner Goodell set up, even one that will deal with the issue of dogfighting, I think, to a certain extent.  So there are a lot of programs.    
We have a player programs director, we have programs that we run all year.  We have Falcons University where we basically deal with life skills, we deal with all the issues that confront players.  Doesn't mean it's a perfect world.    
 You've got young men that have a lot of things going on.  But we do, as a league take it very seriously as the Commissioner has shown in his approach in the last few months into offÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½field conduct.  One of the ways we take that seriously is through education.  It also falls back, sometimes to the leaders in the locker room.  You look to your leaders to help the younger players understand what is acceptable and what isn't acceptable.    
 But I can't sit there and tell you that we end up with a perfect world.  It does mean we do understand the responsibility of helping these guys realize what is and what is not acceptable.    
  
  Q.  There have been some offÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½theÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½field instances along the way.  Do you have any regrets about not being tougher with him?  [INAUDIBLE].    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  Well, I will tell you, we have been very, I think, starting with Coach Reeves, Coach Moore, Coach Petrino, myself, the present general manager, Rich McKay, I think we've all been very consistent with Michael in that regard.  I don't thinkÃ¢ï¿½  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ I think we've been open and honest with him, we've been tough with him.  We've advised him consistently about his behavior or about who he spends time with.    
 The circumstances, obviously some of the incidences in the past, that's what they are.  There's been no charges, there's been no convictions, there's been no plea bargains of any nature.  So, you know, those were things that did take place or were alleged to have taken place.  And we, I think we've been very firm with Michael in terms of what we expect, both as an NFL player, as a leader of our football team as well.    
  
  Q.  The Federal indictment says that Michael Vick was involved in activities where dogs were strangled, shot, drowned, electrocuted and slammed to the ground and made to fight to the death.  I wonder why you haven't been more [INAUDIBLE].    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I think that we tried to make several statements.  We made a statement, I don't remember the exact dates, but soon before the indictment but prior to the indictment we made a statement, soon after the indictment, we made a statement.  We were very clear as to our feelings on the issue then to our fans, to the community, to our sponsors, to all of us.    
 Today is a day when we've been able to gather the facts as we see them today.  We've been able to get counsel and seek and support counsel from others, as I mentioned, in the League, the Union, Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Player, et cetera or his representatives.  So I think we've made our feelings very clear today.  And we did that as quickly as we possibly can.    
 I don't think there's any question about how we feel about what's in the indictment.  We all feel the same way.  It's behavior that is really horrific.  But they are charges at this point.  Those are charges that we have to let the legal process play out to determine exactly what Michael is innocent of or guilty of or the other three individuals as well.    
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE].    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  I understand, yeah.  I think it would be a good question for the coach to respond to.   
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE].    
 BOBBY PETRINO:  Definitely we're concerned about the morale of the team.  I think first of all that all the players and coaches are concerned about Michael and his well being, and what he faces.  We understand the severity of what he faces.  And to go down to the field on Thursday, and start practicing, and start beginning working towards the 2007 Season.    
 (LOSS OF AUDIO)   
  Q.  Coach, when you took this job, you said it was the best job in the National Football League.  Do you still feel that way?  And second, do you have any regrets whatsoever?    
 BOBBY PETRINO:  I said that, and I do believe that.  I absolutely have no regrets in taking the job.  I'm very motivated and energetic towards the challenges.  This is a big obstacle.  There's no question about that.  And only time will tell whether what I said, you know, really happens.  But I do believe that this is the best job.    
  
  Q.  [INAUDIBLE].    
 COACH PETRINO:  There will certainly be adjustments, that's how our offense is based.  We have a huge playbook.  We try to throw it all at them three different times.  So we've installed it once, we've installed it twice, and we start training camp here.  This will be the third time we install the offense.  Then I believe it's our job and the coaches job to really understand what the quarterback does well, what he can't do, and then utilize those parts of that offense.  And each year it changes, or each quarterback changes, because we really try to make the offense his and utilize his talents to the best that you can.    
 ARTHUR BLANK:  The other thing I would add in that regard is that from a club perspective, speaking for myself personally, and I'm sure I speak for Rich as well, we feel very fortunate having Coach Petrino here now.  Given his experience as a football coach, given his tradition in terms of his own background, given his knowledge of the position of the quarterback, given the kind of maturity that he brings to the issues, I feel very fortunate having him here now to kind of provide us with the kind of leadership in dealing with the questions that you're all asking.
