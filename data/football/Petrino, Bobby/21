BOBBY PETRINO: Coming off of a good win on the road at Florida State.  I was really proud of our players, how they prepared for the game, how hard they played.  Defensively I thought we played our best game of the year, tackled well, ran fast and hard to the football, got some pressure on the quarterback.   
Offensively Lamar had another good game as well as Reggie Bonnafon.  It was good to see Dae Williams get started and get going.  We look forward to Saturday's game at Wake Forest.   
 Q.  Over the course of your coaching career, do you notice a difference in your team's results coming off byes?  
BOBBY PETRINO: I don't know.  We haven't had a bye yet this year, so we're probably one of the latest byes in the country.   
Normally we've done a good job coming off byes.  We spend time going back, doing some drills that you do in camp in the off week, do some ones versus ones, then spend half the practice preparing for the next team.  Basically get about a week and a half getting ready for the next game.   
 Q.  Could you talk a little bit about what you see in Wake Forest.  It seems like each year under Coach Clawson they've gotten a little bit better.  What kind of issues, particularly offensively, do they present for you?  
BOBBY PETRINO: They're playing well.  They're doing a good job of running the ball.  They've got some really good wide receivers.  Their quarterback is executing their offense well.  It's a good challenge for us, one that we're looking forward to.
