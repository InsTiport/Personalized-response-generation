Florida - 36, Virginia - 28
Q. What's the biggest thing you learned from this year?
KAIIR ELAM: Biggest thing I learned this year? Got to grow up, got to be a man early because I was thrown in as a freshman, and that's what I expected. It really came through, I just had to grow up and stand up as a man.
Q. How did the flow of today's game go? You got up early and held that momentum throughout.
KAIIR ELAM: The game didn't go as expected. We expected to come out here and fight, but we also expected to also dominate our opponent, and we didn't do that. We messed up a lot and missed a lot of missed tackles, but I think all in all, it's great to win because it's hard to win, and every win is a big accomplishment, so I just thank God we just won.
Q. How do you stack up some of their offense skill?
KAIIR ELAM: I gained way more respect for that quarterback. I think he played an awesome game. I think he's the real deal. Offensively I think the team is very technically sound.
Q. How does this help the program get back to where the Gators usually are?
KAIIR ELAM: Next year I don't expect anything less than a National Championship. That's just me. I feel like we just need to keep improving, don't take any steps back, and we'll be there.
