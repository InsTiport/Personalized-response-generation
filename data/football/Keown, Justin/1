  Q. How tough was this loss?  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: Did you say how tough was it? Yeah, it hurt, but it didn't hurt any worse than all the other ones.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: Because a loss is a loss. It doesn't matter if this is my last home game. We've still got two more, possibly three. If we lose those, it's going to hurt just as bad. It's my last season, not my last game.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about the O-line's performance?  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: I think overall the O-line did pretty well. Obviously it wasn't our best game. I think we gave pressure, but I don't think we picked up the twists in the run game very well. A little tentative in some spots in the O-line. But overall I felt like we did okay.   
  
  Q. Getting back to where your career started, did you ever think you would have gotten here?  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: What do you mean by that question?   
  
  Q. Well, as successful as you were at the start of your career --  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: No, I think we're still successful. It doesn't show it in the win and loss category, but we're still successful as a team and a program. We've got better coaches, better recruits, we've just got to put it together.  
  
  Q. Would you talk about your own personal fight with your knees and what you have to go through on game day to even get out on the field?  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: It's the same thing as practice, you just tape them up and roll. It's just stretching and biking and just go with it. The damage is done, you know what I mean, so it's just taping them up.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 JUSTIN KEOWN: Honestly I think it's a confidence issue. We came off the big win at Oklahoma and then got shut down by O State, which never should have happened, and I think a lot of guys just started to lose their confidence. This week I think that's the big emphasis is getting our confidence back and figuring out what positions we're doing wrong, all that kind of stuff, and just roll.   
  
  Q. What do you think you need to do to get your confidence back?   
 JUSTIN KEOWN: Honestly, I think it's just practicing, you know what I mean, practice the high-percentage plays that we're good at, go back to the basics, fundamental football, first steps, make sure everybody has got great pad level on both sides of the ball, and that's it.
