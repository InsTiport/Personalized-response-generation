Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I wasn't there, so that was the year I had a back injury, so I wasn't there.  I had played there since my freshman year.  I remember watching it and had a lot of exciting plays, a couple of touchdowns.  They got it done.  Like I said, I was watching on TV.  I hadn't played there in a while.  Fun place to play, a great atmosphere, it will be a great time.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I might have been back -- I think I was back home, actually.  I think I was.
Q. (No microphone.) Looking back, what's your favorite memory?
DYLAN CANTRELL: I mean I probably can't pick one memory.  I have so many memories with all the guys and just the relationships I built.  I think that's the biggest thing.  I'm not going to really remember games and what happened in games.  But I'll remember off the field stuff, just bonding with my teammates and getting to know them, that's the biggest thing I'm going to take away from this.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I didn't cry.  I didn't.  But, yeah, I mean that's -- I mean it is an emotional time.  I lying I can to think I'm in touch with my emotions.  But it was definitely -- got a little close to tearing up.  But, yeah, it was just one of those things, seeing some of those seniors that I'm close with out on the field, it's hard not to get to you a little bit.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: There were some tears, I'll say that.  I'm not going to drop names, but there were some tears.
Q. What do you attribute the struggles on?
DYLAN CANTRELL: We've just got to execute better and make plays, do whatever we can to get in the end zone.  We got down there a couple of times, four or five times I feel like in the last game.  And just couldn't get in.  So we've just got to be better in the run game, just execute.  I put that on us, just not making plays when you need to make plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: Yeah, I mean going into this practice, we practice every Wednesday.  We practice goal line and red zone plays, we've just got to tighten down, and put more focus on that.  And go into the game confident and ready to make plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I mean, yeah, like I said, we've just got to transfer that to the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: Yeah, I kind of thought he was throwing to the inside and the ball went back outside.  Yeah, I was trying to catch it and then he made a good play.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: You know, I think they'll probably play a lot of that three double cloud that we're seeing, that seems to be a trend throughout the Big 12 throughout all these passing offenses.  It's hard, they're going to drop a lot of players and force you to establish a run game.  So just got to do a good job of finding holes and being physical in the run game and really getting that going.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: Yeah, I think so.  There's so many guys inspect the middle of the field, whether it be like drop a backer with it, and got three guys over the top, there are just so many guys.  The windows are very small.  So like I said, we've just got to be better and focus on that this week, just going in there, finding windows and controlling your speed and throttling at certain times, instead of running full speed.  It makes it tough on the inside just because there's so many guys in there.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I don't think it will.  We're getting in there today and had a good walk through yesterday.  Had time to recover and get our legs back under us, and going into Tuesday practice today and then going from there.  But, it will go by fast.  We'll be down there before we know it.  Just taking it a day at a time and trying to take every practice.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I think it will be a little refreshing just because we haven't done it in a while.  And it's always fun playing at night no matter where it's at or what level it's at.  And so, yeah, the fact -- I guess Oklahoma was the last one, maybe.  But, yeah, it will be nice.  And like I said, it will be a great atmosphere.  I know it's Thanksgiving, but I'm sure that they always seem to have a lot of fans out there.  It will be a fun atmosphere.  And always a fun place to play.  Just got to get it done.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: Definitely my family.  My parents, my brothers, my grandparents, just god has blessed me so much with my family.  And I've had a very easy life compared to most.  And never wanted to anything.  And probably pretty spoiled growing up.  But I always -- you know, my parents always instilled in me that I know where it comes from and nothing is taken for granted and always work hard for everything that I want in life.  But, yeah, definitely my family.  I wouldn't be here without them.
Q. (No microphone.)
DYLAN CANTRELL: I can't say that I remember.  I'm sure I saw him at some point somewhere.  But he's a red raider legend ^ , and it's always hard and upsetting to find out those things.  But it's one thing that I've learned, especially this past semester is those things are -- they're going to happen in life.  Some happen sooner than others.  Just one of my best friends, Talor, he's been going through a lot, and just trying to be there for him.  But those things are always tough.  I send out my condolences to his family and friends.  But he was a red raider legend.  So I'm definitely proud to say that I've been associated with his legacy and what he's built.
