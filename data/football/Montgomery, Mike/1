<p>	Q.  You talked about the turnovers.  How did it change how you had to approach things when you got behind so fast?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Did the turnovers really more than just take you out of the game plan, but alter the offensive continuity?  Was everybody kind of tentative after the first couple turnovers from what you say? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your defensive effort today?  It seemed like there were times when they came to the line of scrimmage, you guys were still jumping around, they snapped the ball quickly.  Did they give you some problems with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the Tennessee game plan, especially early on.  They seemed to really have a good game plan in terms of going after you guys on offense.  Secondly, could you talk about the physical nature of their play on defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  Physicalness of the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Clausen's performance, what his ability to complete passes did to complement their running game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dennis, you mentioned the strides you've made, but you still have more to do.  Is speed also in that equation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Much is made of using a ballgame as a springboard to the spring and next season.  How do you take it from this point now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your senior leadership, like that guy sitting to your right?  Seemed like they picked it up when you needed them to pick it up, led you do a pretty good season this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see Tennessee doing in the passing game early that at times looked like was confusing the secondary a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I know you're pleased with practice during the week.  This was the first Bowl for so many players.  Looking back, do you have any concerns about them being a little overwhelmed, distracted or anything by being the first experience? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, I see you have a pretty long face.  They got after you today.  Can you talk about what happened today and how you'll learn from that for next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, can you talk about the battle up front with their offensive line and what you guys went through today? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, tough to get a running game going today.  Did the fact that you guys got behind early obviously hurt, but how much what was Tennessee doing taking away your ability to run the football? </p>
<p>	Q.  Geoff, similar question on the defensive side.  Were they doing anything that was confusing you at all or was it just a matter -- it seemed like they were getting a good push on a lot of the plays.  Was it a matter of them pushing you back or something you weren't seeing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Geoff, can you talk about your senior year, how much different it is to end it in a Bowl game versus what you had to do the last couple of years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, if you could, could you take us through the first two turnovers on the pitch.  Was Courtney not where you thought he was?  It was not a perfect pitch.  On your fumble, what happened when your helmet kind of came off?  How did that contribute to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  A loss like this, is it going to be hard not to let this diminish what you guys accomplished this season as a whole? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about their quarterback, what he did?  You said you guys were really maybe thinking more about the run than the pass.  Did he surprise you guys?  Just talk about the way he played.  That guy was a third-string quarterback a month or so ago.  Can you talk about his performance. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when you have such success in limiting turnovers, are you able to attribute it to something, then when you don't have success, are you able to inversely attribute that?  Do you understand what I'm saying? </p>
<p>	Q.  Japhus, was their speed on offense as much as you guys have seen this year?  Did their speed affect your tackling as a club?  Seemed to be not as good as during the year.  	</p>	JAPHUS BROWN:  Looking at the offense, I think they were real fast.  But as far as tackling, I think we could blame that on ourselves.  I mean, we came out and missed a couple of tackles.  I don't think their speed was the blame of that.  But I think we just missed tackles.  When you miss tackles, you lose ballgames.  I guess that's what happened today.
