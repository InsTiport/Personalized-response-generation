<p>	Q.  Coach, forgive me for jumping right into this question but for deadline purposes inquiring minds want to know, you're leaving, what if Alex were came up to you tomorrow and said, "Coach, I think I might want to try my hand at playing on Sunday what do you think"?  What would you tell him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coming into the game, did you have an inkling that you guys could or would dominate their offensive line the way you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alex, can you just talk about that incredible third quarter and then topped off by the play of the year, the third quarter you guys looked very comfortable and looked like you were rolling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alex, one of Pittsburgh's defensive linemen said earlier that it seemed like you were able to read everything that they were going to throw at you and check off at the line, what did you see and was it entirely on your shoulders to make those calls? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Meyer, two-part question.  First part is how emotional of a night is this for you to go through to compete, get the 12-0 with these guys?  And what will your schedule be now in terms of leaving Utah, taking over, moving to Florida and that sort of thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you walked into the stadium tonight, what kind of feelings did you have? </p>
