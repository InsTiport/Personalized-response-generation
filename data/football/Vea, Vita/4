 Q.  So it is 8:05 here.  Given you're from the west coast, what time does your body think it is?  
VITA VEA: My body thinks it's 4:00.   
 Q.  How tough have the early mornings been?  
VITA VEA: Not bad.  We're used to it.  We're adapting to it.  We're an early team.  We wake up early, you know, early workouts in the offseason and we continue with early practices during the season.   
 Q.  Did you guys have to do anything special to acclimate to the time change here?  
VITA VEA: I feel like our first day here, like, we adapted to it pretty quick.  Have to avoid taking naps so we can go back into our normal sleeping pattern.
