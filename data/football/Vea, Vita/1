VITA VEA: I've learned so much within just only four years.  I imagine being here for 10 years with Coach Pete, how much more knowledgeable I'd be and how much smarter I'd be if I was with him for 10 years.   
 Q.  What would it mean to the program to win this game?  
VITA VEA: It will mean a lot.  More so for our seniors sending them out right.  15 years from now they're going to remember this game, going to have to send them off right for memories.
