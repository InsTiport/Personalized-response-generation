  Q. (Question about Cam Newton)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I didn't know him at all before. He really is a great guy. Obviously he is a great player. But he is a better person. I talk to him all the time, sometimes about football. He really is a great guy.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Anybody can overcome adversity at the level that he did. It kind of makes everybody be him and the kind of person he really is. He really is a good person.  
  
  Q. Do you talk to him?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Yeah, I talk to him all the time.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: When we were in New York we spent a lot of time with each other and with Andrew Luck. I think we were just really together all the time. We had no choice but to become friends and identify each other. That just added to the friendship.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Not once. There hasn't been one time we have talked about the game whatsoever.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Whoever makes the least amount of mistakes. At this point of the time in the year, we are both really good. We have no losses. Everybody knows that. It will come down to whoever plays the hardest, whoever makes the most mistakes.  
  
  Q. (Question about the SEC and Pac-10)?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: We are just trying to win the game. Everybody wants to make it out to be a SEC versus Pac-10 matchup, but it is really not that way. It is not viewed that way from us. We want to go out and compete for Oregon. We want to win the game for us.   
 They have every right to brag about the SEC. They have won most of all their Bowl games and national championships. We can't say anything. They deserve to brag about that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: In some ways, yes, but in some ways no. We are a team. It is kind of us against the world. Nobody will give us a shot. Everybody wants to write negative things about the program.  
 Who would have thought we would be here today? Nobody, I don't think so. Except the people on the team. The only people on the team are the only ones that matter to me. Everything else, we just try to stick it together and fight it out. Nobody else matters.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: We can't really think like that. When you start thinking like that, you lose the game.  
 You just take it one game at a time.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I have. Before this, I really didn't eat too many.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It is just talk. Everybody talks about a lot of interesting things. That doesn't mean it is going to come true. That's why the game is played on the field.   
  
  Q. (Question about game against Arizona State)?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: You will have games like that. A lot of people think we will go out and brag about it. That's not the way it works. You will have those tough games.   
 It doesn't matter how many points you win by. You could say Oregon beat this team by one point, they're going to win.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Not really. I talk to Andrew a lot, too. Most people try to make it about money. But nobody really understands the importance. A degree can take you a long way. You can't play football forever.  
 I really respect his decision to stay in school. He is a good player.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Someone asked me that question yesterday. I'm sure -- everybody has asked me pretty much the same questions. I feel like we should have taped the session from yesterday and played it back today, everybody would have really good answers.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I don't have any sympathy. I think they are a great team.   
 I'm just happy to be here. I really can't worry about any other team right now.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: They are going to get ran down by big running backs. We are not going to be able to stop them with what they did.   
 I think they are a competitive defense. They are really good. They stop the run. They are not as big, but they make plays. I think it will be really fun.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I have no sympathy.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: You really can't get that. We just have to go out and play four quarters.  
  
  Q. What's it going to be like? What's it going to be like Monday out there? Are you worried at all about the game?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I'm loose. I think all of us are loose, free. We go out and practice hard. We will be ready for the game.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Most definitely. It is always good to have an organized schedule. No one wants to come in here and be unorganized.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. You are probably never going to get another chance at this. Who cares about going out until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. This is a business trip for us. We don't want to go out and have fun. It is kind of fun to be hanging out at the hotel with your teammates. It is really a fun deal for us. I really respect the curfew.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I don't know. I can't speak for another team. I'm just happy with our curfew.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Yeah, it has been really fun. This is a business trip. It is fun coming in here and talking to the media, of course, and practicing with your teammates and doing different things with your team.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Just being with my teammates. It is really fun. We are teammates but we are not around each other all the time. Just being here is a pleasure.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I'm sure you want to know how. We just talk about different things. Nothing particular about the game. Just, hey, what's up? What are you doing? Are you watching this and that game?   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I think he is very focused. He makes all the right checks, the right reads. His play is vocal enough.  
  
  Q. (Question about Darron Thomas)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Darron can turn it quick. Bam, he's right there. He gets the tempo going. If we are going too slow, we try to move it up. He makes all the right reads. I wouldn't trade him for anybody in the world.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: They're fast. They're very physical. I think No. 17 is a great player. He gets all the accolades out there. They have a great offense. They are very physical. It is going to be a pleasure playing those guys.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the (indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I talk to him all the time. He doesn't really talk about the game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I would be. I'm tired of hearing about it.   
 People are going to make it out to what they want to make it out to be. That's just the way it is. Who wouldn't do that? But the game is played on the field and not be worried about that.   
  
  Q. (Question about Cam Newton)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: He is a great player. You can't always believe what you read in the paper. People are going to write whatever they want to write that's negative mostly. I have to say, nobody wants to write the good stuff about a person. Nobody wants to read that. Everybody wants to write the negative things.   
 I came away knowing Cam is a great player obviously, but he is an even better person.  
  
  Q. In what way?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: In every way. He is helpful. He just really is a great guy. Most of the things I have heard about him are totally not true.  
  
  Q. What did you hear?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Same things you heard.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Probably so. I mean, I don't know. I can't really say how he feels. It is probably more personal on him. Any time you watch ESPN, all you hear about is the SEC, the power of the SEC and Heisman Trophy, Cam Newton. That's mostly the stuff you hear. It seems like a lot of pressure to me.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Practice. Any time we go to practice each and every day to be successful, the most challenging games have been (indiscernible).   
  
  Q. (Question about mind-set)?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: We each want to win the game. We are not thinking about the game. We just want to get out there to our practice today.   
 And then when we get to the game, hopefully we will win the game.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: There is no question. When you feel pressure, that means you don't know what you are doing. That means you are not comfortable. You didn't prepare well. I think we have really been preparing well. We really can't take a day off. Like I said, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. We got to approach it full bore and take advantage of it.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: In a lot of different ways. He is a totally different coach than what Coach Bellotti was. Coach Kelly is completely different. There is really no excuses with him.   
 We want to be treated like grown men or behave like grown men. We need to go in there each and every day and not be late. If you have study hall, you need to be there on time, five minutes before. Everything is totally different.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Oh, yeah, there's consequences in life. There's consequences with Coach Kelly, too.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It is very fun. Any time when you can watch teams get really tired. I can say for myself, any of our teams, we really do enjoy running. We do it all the time. It is a fun offense to play in, keep going and keep going. Obviously when you are playing so many players, it is really fun. It is more football.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: The stability of the coaching staff. I feel like if anybody makes a visit to Oregon to see the facilities there, you see that stuff, a 17-, 18-year-old kid, it will attract you, especially with all the uniforms. Who wouldn't want to come to Oregon?   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: We're a team. That's the glue factor. There is no independent superstars on this team.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: He hasn't gotten any taller. Just kidding.   
 He is a great player. It surprised me that he was able to contribute the way he did. He makes all the right reads, I can tell you that.   
 He is very vocal. He makes all the right checks. He really don't make any mistakes.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: This offense is very complex, and there is a lot of different checks. He never misses any of them. It really did surprise me.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Running track really helped out in my running ability.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It really helped me condition-wise. I really have a lot of stamina. I feel like I can run around all day. It really helps me in my offense.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: We are really not shocked. This stuff doesn't really bother me at all.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I don't think it is a reflection of the coach. I mean, it is me up here. Me talking, it comes with my personality.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I like the stage. I really don't care about the attention. Like I said, attention don't win ball games. Attention is out the window. I'm fine with being up here.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Most definitely. Can't look ahead. You can't really think about anything else except winning the game. When you do, that's when you lose the game.   
 I'm sure my teammates enjoy the spotlight a little bit. We accept the challenge. We welcome it. But it is a business trip. We want to win the game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I really don't want to prep them up too much right now. They have been hearing about all the offenses all week.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: You're right. I mean, I feel like -- he wasn't one of the biggest guys, but he was one of the toughest guys. He overcame a lot of different things.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: You are going to get knocked down. You are going to face adversity. It matters how you get up, it matters how you encounter adversity. Everybody will go through adversity. We want to overcome this.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It is a good decision. He decided to stay in school. Most people don't even understand the importance of a degree. That really is important. That's something you can't take away from anybody.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: To me, yes. The world today, everybody thinks about money. It is all about money and politics and all that other stuff.  
 I think it is his decision. It is not about money. I think that's the biggest confusion, it is all about money.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I do. I welcome that challenge. He is a great player obviously. Running around for the Heisman. If we beat him, that makes me happy. Hopefully it will be a great game next year.  
  
  Q. What's your favorite uniform?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: The throwback ones are my favorite.  
  
  Q. What it will mean to you on Monday if you win the game on Monday to take it back?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It would mean a lot to me and my team. We worked really hard to get to where we are today. It will be good for our fans to bring it back to Oregon. We really need this win and we really want it. We have been practicing hard. We want to win this game.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: It is good for us and good for everybody. We practice hard each and every day throughout the whole season for this day.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I can't release that information right now. I can tell you after the game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I just want to be with my team: They are my family.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: This is a business trip for us. This is the most important game for us. This is the reason why we are here.   
  
  Q. (Question about curfew)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: This is a business trip. We can go out and party next week and do all the extra stuff next week. We will take a couple days off. This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. We don't want to waste it going out and having fun too early. We want to win the game, and that's the reason why we are here.   
  
  Q. When did the offers start coming in?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Junior year. I think Oklahoma State was my first one.  
  
  Q. I know TCU was in on you pretty good. What made you pick Oregon?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: The stability of the coaching staff. That's the big key for me. The offense is really fun. I always wanted to play fast. I was intrigued by all the uniforms.  
  
  Q. How much does it attract the recruits?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I'm sure it attracts recruits.   
  
  Q. It seems like something guys that age are interested in.   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I like the different schools, but I didn't want to go to schools. (Indiscernible) I was weird like that.   
  
  Q. You have to worry about endorsements in the NFL.   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I play for Oregon. Oregon is a Nike school, so I'll probably get Nike forever.  
  
  Q. (Question about Texas and Texas A&M)?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Not all. I have had conversations with Texas after my recruitment. I don't think Texas was the right fit for me.  
  
  Q. When you came to Oregon were you immediately thinking national championship? Did that enter your mind?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: No, I was thinking about the offense.   
  
  Q. When did you start thinking national title, bigger dreams?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: Maybe last year after the Rose Bowl. Can't just stay the same. We have got to get better each and every year.  
  
  Q. A lot of different teams playing for the national championships. They always talk about NFL parity, things are equal. Now it seems like in college football, there is any number of teams, it is not the old days of Texas, Oklahoma or USC or Ohio State. Do you find that when you look at college football, it seems like there are more schools competing for the national title?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I think so. There is a lot of great teams out there now. I think TCU can play with anybody. Talented teams win ball games.   
 It comes down to whoever wants it the most.  
  
  Q. Did you watch the TCU game?  
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I did.  
  
  Q. Those guys are saying they deserve to be in this game. Do you think they deserve to be in this game?   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I think they can play with anybody.  
  
  Q. Do you have friends that chose to go to places that weren't as prominent, high school friends who went and played because they knew they might be on T.V. on Tuesday and Wednesday night? There are so many games on T.V. now.   
 LAMICHAEL JAMES: I don't have many of those friends. I have a lot of friends (indiscernible).
