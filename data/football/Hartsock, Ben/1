<p>	Q.  Are you enjoying the experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Guys, you all grew up rooting some day you would be able to go to the Rose Bowl.  Talk about the difference now, you're playing in the Fiesta Bowl.  How is it different than what you thought it would be?</p>

<p>	Q.  Are any of you guys watching any bowl games today?</p>

<p>	Q.  How anxious do you get to play this game, Tim?</p>
<p>	Q.  What makes Mike Doss such a good leader for your defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will be there any special meaning because he came back?  Has there been any sort of talk about that or is he just one of the guys?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Tim, where does this offensive line rank with some of the offensive lines you've faced this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you react to someone like Romberg's reputation?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a crazy man.</p>
<p>	Q.  Tim, would you just talk about Miami's offense overall, the things that impress you most about them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Alex, how critical is the early part of this game to get the edge and some momentum?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys have played a couple of night games but not Friday night games.  It takes you back a couple years to high school.  Is that significant to you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that mean you're ready to play now.  Are you a little overanxious like Tim mentioned?</p>
