<p>	Q.  When you were in New York, what kind of advice, if any, did Jason give you after you won on what to expect?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has it been fun or a little bit of a drag?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had to take special care not to let this distract you in practice and get ready for this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you guys were sort of the third team out playing in the Rose Bowl while LSU and Oklahoma were at the BCS Sugar Bowl playing for the championship.  Have your plans changed now that you're in the pole position as sort of the favorite here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you guys had an opportunity this week to take a look at some of the other bowl games around the nation?  There have been some pretty exciting ones, particularly Cal losing.  Does that sort of give you guys any warning?</p>
<p>	Q.  When a game is going on, are you able at all to see what the opposing quarterback is doing or are you just doing other things at that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Among all the other things that y'all are playing for this week, how much do you feel that y'all are representing the PAC 10 and wanting to do well for the conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you guys to the point where you're ready to play?  You've had enough of this pre-game stuff?  Are you ready to go?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys are smart enough athletes to know that this is being hyped up; the media crowd grows by the day, biggest game of your life.  How does this make you feel as an athlete?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Oklahoma's defense real quick?  Do they compare to anybody you've played, faster maybe than anybody?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everyone is talking about Oklahoma's defense.  Talk more about your defense.  You're talking about all the hype the last week or so.  Hype up your defense because the hype has been on your offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you've had a chance to talk about this all week and you're being awfully consigned and awfully nice about the defense and politically correct, but in terms of Larry Birdine's comments about your team and being an average team, can you comment on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did it bother you at first when you first heard it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on your receivers and the idea of coming into this season losing the quality of guys that you lost and the way these guys have stepped up?</p>
<p>	Q.  The way that you and a lot of the skilled guys get a lot of run nationally, Patterson and Cody, Grootegood get some public, but really on the national level the heart and soul guys on this team aren't really known that well nationally. </p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do to make sure you didn't get distracted after winning the Heisman?</p>
<p>	Q.  None of that stuff that Jason talked about has really hit yet.  I mean, has it really overwhelmed you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Heisman players tend not to play well in this game.  Any theories?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give me an idea going back to the receivers about Dwayne especially about how he has progressed over the course of the year, maybe compare him when you first saw him to now?</p>
<p>	Q.  To himself early in the season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think he was overwhelmed at all knowing what -- the standard he had to meet from the guys last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any particular play Dwayne made stick out in your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think of Jason White?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think this is a game where you guys should be -- the guys that are sharing the spotlight, it's a battle between you and Jason White?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you stay focused with everything that's gone on with the Heisman?  How do you stay focused?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you say you're ready to play the game, Matt, this morning you're waking up, putting on a jersey, seeing the field.  Does that add a little motivation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and Donte Nicholson talked quite a bit having played in high school.  What are some of those conversations like and are you looking forward to playing him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, what has your relationship with Norm Chow been like the past couple years and what has that meant to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  And if he leaves or if he's not at USC next year, will that affect your decision to stay or to leave?</p>
<p>	Q.  At USC and then when you had to kind of fight for the job, it wasn't handed to you like a lot of other big time quarterbacks, you had talked about this, was there a point when you finally won the job, like I don't know if I made the right choice, or maybe before you won the job, was USC the place for me?</p>
<p>	Q.  One quick thing about Jason.  Can you tell us, did you seek him out during the summer or did you like cross paths?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible).</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't mind all this, this specific stuff?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about what an influence Carson Palmer had on you.  Have you talked to him recently, and if so, what was that like?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your feelings last year when you all were not picked to go to the title game?  As I recall, the team handled it real professionally, but I never really knew deep inside what that felt like in contrast to this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a chance to watch the Holiday Bowl and were you pretty surprised about how badly Cal got beat?</p>
<p>	Q.  If folks were to apply the logic of, well, you guys had a tough time against Cal and Texas Tech was a mid-level team in the Big 12 so this game is not going to be as close as folks think, that the PAC 10 is kind of soft and these mean Big 12 teams are going to out-physical you guys, does that game have any relevance to this game as far as the Big 12 versus the PAC 10?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have the Heisman Trophy in your possession now, and where is it and what do you plan to do with it?</p>
