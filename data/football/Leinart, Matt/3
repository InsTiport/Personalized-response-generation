<p>	Q.  Matt, take us through that first touchdown drive.  If Oklahoma had ever any momentum early in the game it was when they were up 7-0, but you had the 3rd and 11 and then threw to Byrd, and it was pretty much all USC after that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Were either one of you surprised that this thing was pretty much over in the first half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, after back-to-back championships, are you going to come back for your senior year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pete, I'll ask you, your players on the field, they're not that concerned about possibly losing a Heisman Trophy winning quarterback.  Just talk about guys you've just got to plug in at that position and other positions as you go on. </p>
<p>	Q.  Pete, much was made of Oklahoma's offensive line, only given up seven sacks all season, block for Adrian Peterson.  Was this a testament today to how excellent your defensive line is, specifically Cody and Patterson, that you were able to hold down Peterson and get pressure on White?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you take it one at a time.  You've now won the National Championship two years in a row.  Is the prospect of doing something that could rank with the all-time greats in college football, is that exciting, what you're building toward here?</p>
<p>	Q.  What type of advice would you give Matt?  He's already got two National Championships, the Heisman Trophy.  He's got the decision to make does he jump to the pros.  What kind of advice do you give him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just talk about the play of Steve Smith.  He missed seven games, came back and scored three touchdowns tonight. </p>

<p>	Q.  Matt, did you get a chance to chat with Larry Birdine after the game?</p>

<p>	Q.  Do you think you have enough talent that you can go ahead and try to make it three in a row next year?</p>
