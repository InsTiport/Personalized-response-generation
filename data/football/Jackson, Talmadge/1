 Q. First thing you saw when you saw Cam Newton on tape. 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: He's a great athlete. 

 Q. I know you saw Pryor last year. Was it an awe factor with what he can do defensively with his size and his speed? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: I guess -- everybody has seen him. It is no secret. Everybody has seen him the whole year and what he has done, and you got to respect what he's done. 
 At the same time, you got to be ready for the challenge and study him, all facets of the game, their offense, and prepare for them.

 Q. What do you remember when Micky Ward, the fighter, when he came to talk to you guys and how much that inspired you guys? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: Keep your head down, keep swinging, just keep fighting no matter ups or downs, keep going through the ball.

 Q. Have you seen the movie?
 TALMADGE JACKSON: No.

 Q. Looking forward to seeing it? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: I can't wait to see it.

 Q. You guys have thrived on taking the ball away from all the teams. They don't give the ball away very much. It is a catch 22. Something has got to give, right? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: We have got to try to create turnovers. That's key in every game. That's what we are going to try to do.

 Q. Is there a way you practice that? How do you measure that? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: Study film, study routes. It is part of the whole preparation for the game. You can't just -- you never go into a game and say, I'm going to practice the interceptions. You have to study what the offense does to be able to create those turnovers.

 Q. What have you seen without getting into the game plan? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: They have great athletes. They have a great quarterback. And they have a very -- they spread the ball around. And there is going to be opportunities out there to make plays.

 Q. You are a So Cal guy. How would you prepare Lo Lo's to Roscoe's? 
 TALMADGE JACKSON: I have to go with Roscoe's since I'm from California. Lo Lo's is really good. And I liked it the way they came out and prepared food for us, and I thank them for it.
