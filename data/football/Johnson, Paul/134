  Q. Coach, a season of firsts for the Yellow Jackets. How sweet is this to be able to bring the first outright title since '90 and take this bunch back to the Orange Bowl for the first time since 1966?  
 COACH JOHNSON: I couldn't be prouder of our football team. We've overcome a lot of adversity, a lot of injuries, and we took that drive down and got it in the end zone and finally got a stop when we needed it there.  
  
  Q. You all scored on your first seven possessions, and then they finally came up with a stop, but you came back with the big answer there and got a big run by Jonathan. Just talk about that last drive and responding.   
 COACH JOHNSON: Well, great players make plays at the end, and we were going to try to get Jon the ball, and we changed up, put a guy on the line and kind of blocked him down a little bit and he got it in the end zone.  
  
  Q. Plays by two of your stars, Jonathan and Derrick Morgan, the defensive player of the league coming up with the big sack.   
 COACH JOHNSON: Well, no question, it was harry there at the end, but like I said, our good players made players.  
  
  Q. Scott Blair kind of unsung hero in this one, four field goals, kept the ball away from C.J. Spiller. Talk about his importance tonight.   
 COACH JOHNSON: Scott did a great job. We were able to get points when we were bogged down down there. We were playing at the end to get him in front of the goal post and kick a field goal at the end, but like I said, you can't tell a guy not to score.  
  
  Q. We'd be remiss in not saying something about C.J. Spiller and how difficult it was for a guy to dial up that kind of performance on this kind of stage.   
 COACH JOHNSON: C.J. played a great game. He's a tremendous player, and I wish him the best in the NFL.
