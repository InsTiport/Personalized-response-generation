 Q.   You're getting the victory in a very loud fashion.   What kind of statement did you make today?  
PAUL JOHNSON:   Well, this is a good football team.   I think we're a top 10 football team for sure, and I'm proud of these guys.   At least for a week or two we're don't have to worry about the SEC.  
   
 Q.   You guys really redeemed yourselves.   
PAUL JOHNSON:   We played awful in 2009 and I thought our kids played really hard.   I'm proud of them.   Our quarterback was a good player.   He played hard.   
We were very resilient.   I think that Synjyn Days made a great run, and defensively we gave up a ton of yards, but when we got down in the red zone we made some plays and got some turnovers; just enough to win the game.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL JOHNSON:   Yeah, I thought it kind of gave us the momentum back, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You had two scores off of turnovers and one off the onside kicks.   
PAUL JOHNSON:   Well, in the second half, I think we scored every time we had it until the fourth quarter down there.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL JOHNSON:   Well, if you're ahead, that's all you have to do.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL JOHNSON:   Well, that's what we do.   That's who we are.   
   
 Q.   What do you tell them at halftime in the locker room?   
PAUL JOHNSON:   Nothing really.   I mean, we just went back to what we do, and I drew up the defenses on the board, and I said here's where we are, here's the plays we run against them, just execute.   I said, hey, guys, it's 21â€‘20.   Nobody thought the game was going to be 30 minutes.   Their kid made a play.  
   
 Q.   How did your approach change in the second half?   
PAUL JOHNSON:   Well, we started running the ball more inside the second half.   Our D backs ran hard.
