Oregon - 38, Stanford - 36
Q. So take us through that play and did you get your hands on the ball?
JOE WALKER: I might have touched it a little bit.
Q. You did touch it a little bit?
JOE WALKER: Just a little bit.  Yeah.
Q. Okay.  Because it was hard to tell?
JOE WALKER: Yeah, just a little bit.
Q. Finger tips, palm?
JOE WALKER: Whatever, I'm not sure.
Q. Take us through what you saw as they were lining it up.  Coach said you kind of knew the tight end was coming over there?
JOE WALKER: When they motioned the back guy, we were playing man, corner took the back, me on the tight end, just tried to play him.
Q. It's been four weeks in a row where the defense has come up with an interception or a pass breakup to end the game.
JOE WALKER: It's been awesome.  Coaches doing a great job, we have been practicing hard all week, and it's been -- I can't be prouder of this team.
Q. Neal has been coaching a long time he said, he said it's the most energy he's been around in a long time.  What's it like in there?
JOE WALKER: It's fun.  Those are some moments you'll never forget.  Celebrating with your teammates.
Q. Why so much?  Is it because Stanford is No. 7, it's a big game, is it because something that happened earlier in the season?
JOE WALKER: I think it's how hard we have been practicing, how hard we fought hard all game and just to come up with a win was awesome.
Q. When you guys are on the field as much as you are, how hard is that defensively?
JOE WALKER: We practice so hard that when game time comes, it's not a problem.
Q. Your offense had the ball for less than 18 minutes in this game.  The they scored 38 points.  But could you have believed that if somebody had told you that?
JOE WALKER: I mean, they practice so hard, we go against them every day, they're awesome.  They're great.
