Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Yeah it means a lot, playing in the Rose Bowl. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   No, we talk a lot about looking at ourselves and look at the opportunities and see what we can learn from that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Just like the rest of the team we as a receiving core need to be aware of what's going on.   We do have a lot of speed outside so I think that's what we bring to the table. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Same. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   To answer your question, I feel like the other guys in the receiving core are right there and anybody else (Away from mic.)   Including tight ends. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   The way we operate as a team, I would be surprised if our special teams was, but we definitely want to take advantage of that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Yeah, I was in that. 

Q.   Could you get off the field? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   I tried.   It was tough but I tried. 

Q.   Having played against him, outside the realm of the Rose Bowl, what was that like, the way that ended?   Being on the other end for a couple of years you guys were on the winning end.   What do you recall about that? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   It was tough.   It was very hard and tough.   Like anything, you've got to be able to come back and handle it the best way you can and I feel like that's what we did and got an opportunity to be better as a team. 

Q.   The Utah State game, I know I talked with a couple of seniors who said when you lost that close one, it ended that dream of having an undefeated season but what do you recall about the after math of that? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   (Away from mic.)   Look where we are now, take it all in and count our blessings.   I have no complaints for the way the season is ending because of where we are. 

Q.   Do you think you have an advantage having been in the environment already last year and playing in the Rose Bowl and all that goes with that against a team now that's coming out here for the first time? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   That's something we talk about but I think that‑‑ we haven't spent too much time on that because at the end of the day, it's 11 guys playing 11 guys.   And playing the No. Two team in the Big Ten championship, it's a big game for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Very good football player, very good athlete and he demands respect and attention. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   That's something I have watched on film.   Anybody who is matched up against him, we're going to have to attack the football, because that's what he's good at.   If he finds it he's like a receiver. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Just his decision making, he's been given a lot more responsibility at the line of scrimmage before the play happens and he's done a very good job of that.   It's something we as a team all appreciate. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Yeah, I believe so.   I don't want to compare him to Andrew, but he does a good job of handling what we do as an offense and he knows and understands us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Um, I wouldn't say‑‑ first of all, I wouldn't say that Kevin had that bad of a performance.   He put some balls on the money to me that I should have caught.   Those were mine.   But you can definitely tell when he is going to be in a rhythm, he puts the balls on the money.   Whether or not he was in a rhythm during the USC game, I wouldn't say that was his fault. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   There are a few things that come to mind.   We define our team as a measure stock increase and we feel like we are not entitled to having another guy ahead of us.   (Away from mic.) 

Q.   (No microphone.)   This game everybody expects it to be a low‑scoring game.   Is there any chance that the offenses will take over this game or are the defenses too good? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   I mean, it's a game.   There is always a chance.   You never know what's going to happen. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   There are things that come to mind.   We define our team as a merry to come increase and there are things we fight which are immediate ok credit and entitlement.   We understand that we have to get what we earn each year as a team. 

Q.   Where did that understanding come from?   Is that something from Coach and the leadership or‑‑
TY MONTGOMERY:   It's something that's preached to us by our coaches and it's something that is believed in by the leaders on the team. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Very good athlete, he's a very good player. 
He plays the ball when it's in the air just like a receiver would.   He's very good at that.   We as a receiving core have talked about both of our corners, really, we have talked about how‑‑ (Away from mic.) 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Yeah, definitely. 

Q.   Ty, how are you? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   Good. 

Q.   When you were recovering from your injuries last year, how important was the recovery?   Earlier in your career what was your relationship like? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   He's definitely a hard guy but it's all for the team.   He understands that his job is to make sure that we're here to play football and‑‑ (Away from mic.)   If you're injured you can't play football so a big part of his job, which he will tell you is injury prevention. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Yeah, whatever he can come up with. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   I'm not sure.   To be honesty haven't even thought about that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   I guess I could, yeah, but I haven't thought about it. 

Q.   Not at all? 
TY MONTGOMERY:   No. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   You will see him play like that on Saturday.   Same thing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   I wouldn't say that he tries, I would say that he has done that in practice. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   I had some other schools.   My mom talked to me about the academic aspect and how important that is.   I can't put all my eggs in one basket, that being football.   You have to get an education and graduating from Stanford with a Stanford degree means a lot and it's very important.   My mom always said it's not a four‑year decision.   I don't just go to college to play football.   I go to get my degree. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Definitely, yeah.   (Away from mic.) 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Confidence level.   I wasn't sure I could run with these guys, if I was going to be big enough, fast enough, strong enough, and over the years I have gained confidence. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TY MONTGOMERY:   Coach played a role and all my coaches, and all my teammates, we're very close and we always want to build each other up.   It's a great environment. 


KEVIN HOGAN:   Hi, how are you? 

Q.   The Rose Bowl was good to you last year. 
KEVIN HOGAN:   It was. 

Q.   Are you looking forward to getting back to that and repeating that performance? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Absolutely.   Once we come down here, it's all business, but we're going to enjoy this week.   It's great to be here and we are going to take full advantage of being here but practice is going to be real this week.   We're excited for the game. 

Q.   What do you remember about your own performance last year, why you were able to do so well? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Boy, we got up early on Wisconsin and we were able to pull it out in the end.   Games like that, it's kind of a blur, but I probably had a good game, we ran the ball well and we're hoping for the same process and the same outcome this year. 

Q.   How about you individually?   Take me back to you individually on that day and kind of why you were able to do so well? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   I was happy with myself.   Obviously I would have liked to have made certainly‑‑ I remember at the end of the game we could have put it out of reach but that's something that you can learn from and it's going to be nice to be on that same field this year and just be able to kinda get a second chance. 

Q.   Do you think you have an advantage having gone through this whole thing.   Played in that environment last year? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah, I mean, I guess you could say that, just having been here but at the same time any good football team is going to find their way to the game and come ready to play.   Michigan State is going to enjoy it, just like we will, and we all know why we're here.   I guess you could call it an advantage but, you know, in the end you have to play football. 

Q.   (No microphone.)   How does that change anything for you individually? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   For me individually, not much.   But, I mean, he's a good player.   You have to give respect to him.   He's their leader, and for us it doesn't change too much.   They have guys that can come in and make plays for them, but not too much. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I think that our offense has, you know‑‑ we have hit on more of the down field plays, made more big plays, bigger offense than we were last year with guys like Ty, guys that can make plays down field and keep the defense honest and that allows us to run the ball. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Well, I look at each play and depending on which play we calm sometimes we will send in one play and other times we will send in three or four.   We will see what the defense is doing and it helps just having guys in our huddle who can process all that information and be there at the line of scrimmage right before the play is snapped and recognize that all of 11 are at same page with one of the four plays and it just shows that our guys are out there, capable of making any of those plays. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Sometimes they want to do that and they're in there, they're our linemen and they do a heck of a job blocking and not many can stop them so we run behind them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)   You have shown your mobility and you can move and operate on the go. 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Luckily I won't have to try to stop him.   That's why I have guys up front and they do a good job of scrambling on those quarterback runs and he's a heck of a player.   We're definitely going to have our hands full. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I think the 30th. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Probably. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Oh, I don't know.   Not with me.   He knows I would whoop his butt. 

Q.   You're off limits anyway, right? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   I'm off limits.   He wouldn't do that at practice, he could easily if he wanted to.   But for our sake he doesn't do that in practice.   When we watch him in games do it it's unbelievable.   The last game (Away from mic.) 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   He's one of those guys that works hard.   He's a high‑intensity guy.   Great leader, great captain.   He's kinda got that‑‑ a little bit of a goofy side to him.   Really, he's pretty‑‑ he's just another one of us in the locker room, and then out on the field he gives 100%, he's aware of you and he's going to get it done, whatever it takes. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Before games he's getting us all going with unbelievable speeches.   We play for guys like that.   All the older guys, (Away from mic.) 

Q.   Does the Michigan State defense blitz a lot?   What makes them so great? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   What they do well is they lineup pretty much the same time, cover four and they don't show a lot.   They do a very good job of disguising it and they have several defenses they utilize.   With their experience they know where to be when the ball snaps so they can hold it long and before you know it, they're sending cross dogs, corner traps and you have to be prepared for that, know that every play might look the same but they're going to come at you differently. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   No, we're‑‑ he's a heck of a player. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Absolutely.   You can't be afraid to go out there and make a play.   He's one heck of a player and he's going to make plays throughout the game.   It's about who makes more plays. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   No, he (Away from mic.)   Hopefully he will play the field. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Either side. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Good, how are you? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah, very good. 

Q.   What year are you? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   I'm a junior. 

Q.   One more to go? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Two more if I with respect to. 

Q.   Oh, two more, okay. 
KEVIN HOGAN:   It's been a lot of fun. 

Q.   I can imagine.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah.   We're going to enjoy it. 

Q.   You didn't play under Coach Harbaugh? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   No. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   (Away from mic.) 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   First thing is they do very well.   They are very well coached, good technique and part of doing what they do well is they disguise very well their formations.   Every time they lineup the same and like a flash it will change completely.   It gives the offense trouble trying to figure out how to protect or which way to run the ball.   You just don't know what they're going to do.   They're experienced and they play well on the other side of the ball. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I mean, you get a different feel at the line of scrimmage.   A lot of teams will look over and see the coaches, and that can kind of gets you out of a rhythm.   At the line of scrimmage everyone is on the same page, everyone sees what the other person sees and we will call three or four plays and I'll get us to the right one and everyone knows what we want to do then.   We run the play successfully, hopefully. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Absolutely. 

Q.   (No microphone.)   Is that something you noticed on film? 
KEVIN HOGAN:   Well, it's tough.   Like you said, it gets them in all the right spots and it's kind of like a chess match and it's fun because you're both doing it on the field.   That's something that he did very well.   I'm not sure how the stadium here will work for them but he's very good at that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I mean, it's hard in general, but, yeah, we're going to try and stick to our game plan and run the ball and we will at times throw it and it will be a back and forth.   Our identity is running the ball down field, that's it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Well, I think first and foremost the atmosphere has changed drastically from what it was, so I've heard.   Just starting in the workouts with Coach, they're of a different mind‑set.   We want to be the toughest guys in the country, we want to be the bully and that carries over to the football field.   Our coaches put a lot on us and we trust them, they trust us and we're able to do a lot more, able to handle more offensively and defensively and I think that just smart, tough guys that come together and play with each other and trust in each other, it goes a long way. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I don't know much about them, probably because they weren't winning, but when I first was recruited, I was recruited by Coach Harbaugh and I could see that the atmosphere was changing and after I committed they had the Orange Bowl run and everyone bought in.   But at the same time the price increases, you gotta pay the price each year and it's going to get harder.   Each year it's gotten harder and that's what it takes to get back to the Rose Bowl. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Um, I guess before‑‑ I guess before people would settle with mediocrity and not going to a bowl.   That changed my freshman year, you saw it with Andrew's class, and you could tell that we were done settling for that and we weren't happy with losing multiple games a year.   We bought into it and we've been able to stay in success.   We're going to keep working hard and try and get back every year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Oh, absolutely.   You see it time‑in, time‑out, guys will even say it on opposing defenses, which is a credit to us and our will. 
We believe it's going to be a heavyweight fight for four quarters and that's our mind‑set heading into games.   It may not be other teams but when you have a team like Michigan State it's going to be a heavyweight‑‑ it's going to be a 15‑round fight to the fourth quarter. 
We have been in those all year, so I think we're ready for it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I would say no one can out way our physicality, out‑toughen us.   I would definitely not tell that to any of our guys.   Luckily I'm just the quarterback, but look at Yankee over there, he's going to run you over every single play even if it's the last play of the game. 
That's our goal.   We want teams to quit, we want them to "tap out" and say, if you do that one more time I'm done.   That's our goal. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah, I mean, you can look at 'em‑‑ we're looking at 'em just as a common opponent but at the same time their games were played at totally different times in the year and a lot changes.   We played 'em early on and they definitely got better after that game, as you saw.   We happened to play them more recently. 
It is nice looking at a common opponent and seeing how you compare, but at the same time you kinda put that all away, because you're not going to be that team‑‑ it's not we beat that team so we're going to beat Michigan State.   It's not that.   They're going to come ready to play. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   I was recruited by most of the east coast schools, Virginia, Boston College, Vanderbilt, and I chose Stanford late in the process because I wasn't sure I was going to come out here, I thought I was going to play on the east coast but I came out here, fell in love with the campus, bought into what Coach Harbaugh was preaching, and the style of offense we're playing, it's a pro style offense.   I can watch any NFL game on Sunday and call out the plays that they're running and it's nice knowing that as a recruit that you have a chance to play at the next level. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
KEVIN HOGAN:   Yeah and seeing the success that they had with it in their Orange Bowl year.
