Q. So just describe what your agility drills are like in the off-season.
NOLAN BORGERSEN: No, our strength program has been awesome. They did a great job getting us ready for the season. I think everyone out there is fresh, stronger, faster, and it's been good.
Q. What did you see on the pick?
NOLAN BORGERSEN: We were in cover two. Got my depth -- your eyes really bring you the ball on that play, and that's what happened, and I was able to make a play on it.
Q. We're talking about the number -- you've heard this before, the unknowns on the defense. For the yards you give up, you had like seven turnovers in two games.
NOLAN BORGERSEN: Yeah, yeah, the defense has done a great job and special teams, I know. Myself, Mike, and Mehdi, we all play a lot of special teams. So I think it's really big to have a rotation and be able to stay fresh, and that's helped the back end a lot. We have a lot of guys playing on defense, and swarming the ball creates turnovers. So that's been really good for us.
