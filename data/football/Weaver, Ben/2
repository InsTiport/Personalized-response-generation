BEN WEAVER: All these coaches are teaching you so many values in life that will be so beneficial.   
 Q.  Why Boise, what made you decide I'm going to stay here and train?  
BEN WEAVER: I think it gives me the ability to kind of work on other things as well.  I mean, you can only train for four, five hours out of the day.  And for myself I need to be doing something.  I need to be doing something productive.  And to be able to work part time and work towards my career and what I want to be doing with my life post football is extremely important to me because as you see the lifespan of the NFL isn't very long.   
And if I were to get that opportunity, it would be awesome.  But if it were not to happen, then I want to be able to kind of have my life in order.   
 Q.  If football doesn't work out hypothetically, what do you want to do?  Have you thought about coaching?  
BEN WEAVER: My idea is to be in the football aspect.  Not necessarily coaching.  I'm currently trying to start my own company actually in a type of football equipment.  Some innovative things.  I've been working with our engineering program and actually our venture college.   
So doing some of that stuff would be really cool.  Trying to stay in the football aspect.  But not necessarily coaching, I don't think.   
 Q.  Can you share any of your ideas?  Are they still secret right now?  
BEN WEAVER: Still secret, exactly.  Sometime, yeah.
