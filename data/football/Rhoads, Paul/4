IOWA STATE   35
  TEXAS TECH - 42

COACH RHOADS:   You can say this, we play exciting football games.   In five games they've all been 60‑minute football games and our kids have been fighting right down to the very end.   That's very pleasing to a coach in a time where his record is below 500 and he's getting his kids to play, he's getting his kids challenged and our kids continue to respond.   Very pleasing, as I said. 
Football is shaped a funny way, it takes funny bounces.   We had an opportunity at the very end, and couldn't grasp on to an oval‑shaped object to give us an opportunity to win.   It's very disappointing to us as we finish out this ballgame.

Q.   You talked about that onside kick that Deon looked like the ball went through his hands.   Was that a microcosm of the day you guys just couldn't find enough to win? 
COACH RHOADS:   I don't even want to relate those things.   It's an exciting play in football, and we had an opportunity to get it.   The slippery thing got away from us.

Q.   What are your thoughts on defense?   You got three turnovers, four turnovers, whatever it was, you gave up a lot of yards?
COACH RHOADS:   Turnovers give you an opportunity to win any game, turnover margin.   We certainly were positive on that end today.   But you're not going to win football games giving up 666 yards.   It's just not going to happen.   Too many easy plays. 
But Texas Tech is a very explosive offense with good players.   22 is a great player, quarterback played very well.   They're going to score points in this league against a lot of good defenses.

Q.   Aaron Wimberly most of the second half didn't play, shoulder?
COACH RHOADS:   Hurt his shoulder.

Q.   Offensively with Sam, was the ankle rearing up today?   Was that part of the problem? 
COACH RHOADS:   He got hurt again there at the end.   Get used to it.   We have.   Told you earlier, once he sprained it, as many hits as he's going to be a part of, he's not going to get healthy.   But Richardson can play pretty good football sub‑100%.   When he's not truly effective enough for us to feel that we can win with him, we'll bring Grant into the game.

Q.   Wimberly, just to follow up on that, will he play? 
COACH RHOADS:   I think he'll be back.   I don't have very much doubt that he'll be back.

Q.   On the fake field goal, what was your view of‑‑
COACH RHOADS:   Not going to go there.   Not going to go there.

Q.   What was your view of‑‑ let me ask it a different way.   What was your thought process in going for the fake right there? 
COACH RHOADS:   Field goal wasn't going to win the game.   24‑21 wasn't going to win the game.   Touchdowns were going to win the game, and we had a play that we thought was going to be effective, should have been effective.   It should have been effective.

Q.   Can you talk about your quarterback's success running the ball? 
COACH RHOADS:   It's part of the offense, both scrambling and designed run.   The staff made a really nice call in a two‑man situation there late in the game to get us a big run for a first down and in the two‑minute.   But imagine what a healthy Standard could do running out of the offense.

Q.   Could you talk about his difficulty maintaining the drive in the second half? 
COACH RHOADS:   This is a very good defense.   One of the things that they do very well is disguise.   If you can't get settled in presnap, post‑snap with consistency, you're going to have trouble.   We ended up with 35 points on the day, albeit, one a kickoff return for a touchdown.   But I think this defense has been giving up ten points a game or something like that.   That's pretty salty defense, and we hung 28.   So did we do some good things to get to 28?   Sure we did.   Did we do enough to win the football game?   No.

Q.   You brought up Jarvis West's return.   How big was that for you guys in the first half when you were still struggling offensively?
COACH RHOADS:   Huge, huge.   I thought momentum was clearly in their favor at that point.   Plays that we went out the first series and got some first downs, but stalled and didn't finish the drive.   Finish was a big emphasis for the game.   The kickoff return gave us life, gave us energy, gave us juice.   I thought the whole football team was able to feed on that and helped lead us to a 21‑21 draw.

Q.   Just looking ahead now, you had one pinball like offense going.   Now you have Baylor coming up.   Your thoughts on these back‑to‑back games like this? 
COACH RHOADS:   101 plays.   101 plays, 666 yards, what time is it?   7:00 that we're getting out of here?   Baylor's going to do more of the same and have done it with more success than anybody in the country.   We're going to need to put on our track shoes and get a lot of sleep this week so we can get a lot of good preparation.
