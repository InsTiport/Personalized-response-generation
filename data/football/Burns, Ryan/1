RYAN BURNS: Just got to get a couple more throws.   
 Q.  What's it like watching Christian go?  
RYAN BURNS: That last play especially.  I was just sitting there in awe, of course.  He's a heck of a player, heck of a guy, heck of a leader.  Came up to me during the game and just gave me some words, a great guy to be around.   
 Q.  What from your vantage point changed in the second half?  
RYAN BURNS: Personally, I think we slowed down a little too much, got too comfortable I think.  Really first and second down, and really third down late in the game, we were just not doing what we wanted to do.  So that's going to be good film to watch, learn from it, and we'll be ready.   
 Q.  Missing the series when Keller came in, did that change your rhythm or hurt things?  
RYAN BURNS: I don't think so.  (Indiscernible).   
 Q.  What about that fumble with McCaffrey, was that just an exchange thing?  
RYAN BURNS: Yeah, that was on me.  Trying to pull a little too late.   
 Q.  What was it like just being out there (Indiscernible)?  
RYAN BURNS: It's special.  I tried to tone it down a little bit.  I was pretty relaxed going out there.  But if you're watching Kevin take control of the team the past few years and watch what he did and being able to take that spot and be in his position, that's really special.   
 Q.  When you first got out there, what were the nerves like?  
RYAN BURNS: It was kind of weird.  It still hadn't hit me when I was on the field.  The first few plays though I got a little grass in my pants and started walking.  But it was almost like an out-of-body experience.  But I got used to it pretty quick.  It was cool though.
