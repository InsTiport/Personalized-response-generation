Q. Shaun Dion Hamilton goes down with a knee injury against Florida, you have a new running mate full-time in Rashaan Evans.  Where is he in terms of being ready for the game Saturday?
REUBEN FOSTER: Rashaan, I have no doubt about Rashaan.  Me and him played in high school together, so we've got that.  So he's ready.  He's a very smart kid and very quick and athletic.  So his instinct is good.
Q. You're a different player than what you were a year ago.  Can you take us through what you accomplished in the off-season?  Tell us what you're weighing now.
REUBEN FOSTER: I'm weigh like 222, 225 and trying to get up to 230 right now.  But since I lost the weight, I'm trying to get back up, I feel great.
