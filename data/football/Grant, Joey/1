  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   Today was your birthday.   How was that?
JOEY GRANT:   Nobody really cares it's my birthday.   We're here for a bowl game.   We're excited about that.   We're out here practicing. 
Good day of practice.   Got better today. 

Q.   What would be the perfect birthday present? 
JOEY GRANT:   Win would be the ultimate birthday present for everybody.   We've been working for it for about two, three weeks now.   We're going to go out there and play. 

Q.   Good days out here in Arizona. 
JOEY GRANT:   It's beautiful out here.   The hotel is absolutely gorgeous.   It's huge.   I've gotten lost a couple times. 
It's great.
