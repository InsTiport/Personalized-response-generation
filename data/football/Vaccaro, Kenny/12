  Q. Is there a concern about the defense starting a little faster? Keenan said you guys made the adjustment at half.   
 KENNY VACCARO: I mean, we're going to work on that this next week in practice and of course we need to start off faster. Every team needs to start off fast in every phase of the game. We'll be working towards that.   
  
  Q. Is there anything you can put your finger on in your defense along with getting your first look at film?   
 KENNY VACCARO: Well, probably being mentally prepared for the game would help us a lot because you play faster when you're mentally prepared. If we get in the film room more, get with our coaches more we'll be able to play faster and that will kick us off faster.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KENNY VACCARO: Yeah, I mean, honestly I'm taking it just the next game, but it happens to be UCLA, and it's going to be a good game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KENNY VACCARO: Yes, because they ran for over 200 yards on us, and that can't happen to win the game. We have to hammer the run so we can make the quarterback one-dimensional and then we can get after him. Yeah, it was kind of a taste of disrespect because to run the ball straight up north and south all the way up and down the field all game, our defense kind of took that to heart, and we'll be definitely working on that all week in practice.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KENNY VACCARO: I mean, honestly, if they watched the film last year and just the first game, they'll know in the game plan they're going to run the ball. They're going to run the ball north and south, and we'll be prepared for it.
