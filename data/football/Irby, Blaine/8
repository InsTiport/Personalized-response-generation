 Q. (No microphone.)
 BLAINE IRBY: A little bit. I haven't played the last couple years so I'm real excited to get out there with the guys, the rest of the team, and I think just like anybody else, going through spring ball and summer workouts and camp, I mean, we've prepared so hard for this moment, and we're -- I think as a team we're ready and we're excited for this game against Rice. 

 Q. (No microphone.) 
 BLAINE IRBY: You know, a lot of young guys at the wide receiver position in particular. We've got a lot of youth. I just think it brings more energy and more excitement to the game. It's just like any other year when a senior leaves or somebody leaves the team, someone else has to come in and step up. Like I said, I'm excited to see some of these young guys because a lot of these guys I've never played with. 
 From what I've seen during the spring, the whole off-season, I'm just real excited to see how we're going to play out this Saturday. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BLAINE IRBY: You know, I just -- a lot of my guys or a lot of the guys on our team have been my friends for a while, and I've played with a couple of them -- not a couple of them, but a lot of the guys in my class I played with before I got hurt. It's just, like I said, every year people are -- we have new freshmen coming in, guys are leaving, and we develop relationships among our team, and I think every year it's kind of a special year. I'm real excited about this year, I'm real excited about our youth that we have and just guys stepping up and playing. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BLAINE IRBY: I think on offense in particular, I think with all the new changes going around, I think we definitely have a new level of energy and intensity, and it's definitely shown throughout the off-season, just kind of with every workout or every practice is a competition, and we try and compete at 100 percent and go in 100 miles an hour, and really, I feel that's the only way we can get better, and I feel that new energy that has basically been brought in and kind of lights our butts on fire. 
 We're real excited about this weekend, and we've definitely worked hard to get to this point. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BLAINE IRBY: I think Garrett definitely was real consistent in the camp. I thought all of our quarterbacks did really well. It was a pleasure working with all of them. I definitely think Garrett has worked with us, I mean, all spring and all summer, and I just think during practice he was making really great plays every practice. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 BLAINE IRBY: I think every practice you kind of go into it, it didn't really matter who was throwing the ball. I thought every quarterback was doing really well and they were competing hard. The guys that -- I mean, I was mainly playing with Garrett and Case and David Ash would come in and Connor would come in and all of them would do great. But I just think that Garrett definitely has the experience level, and he did really well during camp.
