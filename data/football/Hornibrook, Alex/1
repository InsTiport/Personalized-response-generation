Q. Your best most impactful performance as a Wisconsin Badger.  Talk about your mindset come into this game.  Was there something you saw you could attack in this Miami defense?
ALEX HORNIBROOK: I think for all of us we knew we were pretty relaxed.  We knew we had what it takes to win this game.  They played a lot of man coverage, so we just trusted our guys, and our receivers did a heck of a job, made some unbelievable catches for me as well as the O-line, so it was really a group effort.  I'm really proud of these guys.
Q. How great is it to play with a defense like that that's able to hold off a very good offense?
ALEX HORNIBROOK: Yeah, that's huge.  Our defense has been doing that all year.  I don't know if it's wrong or not, but every time we are on defense, I expect an interception.  That's kind of what they do for us.  But they give us the ball right back every time.  They played unbelievable this year.
