<p>	Q.   Larry, as you sit there and play the game over in your mind, what do you go into this game saying; you know, "we can't do this, if we do this we're in trouble"?</p>
<p>	Q.   The mood of the team right now, you mentioned they're very, very anxious; is it ready to play tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.   Can you describe your relationship with Ken Dorsey.  Does he get the respect he deserves?</p>
<p>	Q.   What advantage do you think your team has from having played and won in last year's game?</p>
<p>	Q.   Kind of a follow-up to that:  One, do your players seem looser, more relaxed then last year?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, can you describe just a little bit about Rob Chudzinski's contributions to the team?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, Ohio State wants to control the game, manage the game; how do you plan to disrupt that?</p>
<p>	Q.   With all the press Maurice Clarett has received in his freshman year, do you think in the mind of McGahee, does he see this game as a challenge and a one-on-one match-up.</p>
<p>	Q.   You mentioned you're heading to the Auxiliary Hotel and are you pulling out of The Plaza?</p>
<p>	Q.   What's the reason behind that?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach Coker, Coach Tressel came out and watched your practice.  You said you only ran about three plays that day.  What did you do that day and what was it like having him there.  Did you ever think that was probable?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, I was just wondering if you could expand on that.  You were talking about Willis a minute ago.  What do you see as similarities and differences between Maurice and him on and off the field?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, can you talk a little bit more about Butch Davis, his contact with your team this year and on a personal level, for you getting an opportunity to, in one way, climb out of the shadows of Butch Davis and make your own stamp on this team?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, underdogs have done very well in the bowl games, and I just wanted to see if that's something you've noticed and if that's something you'll address with your team?</p>
<p>	Q.   Larry, you might have answered my question.  How do you warn a team that hasn't lost that maybe it could?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, how or why have you guys given up 171 yards on the ground per game?</p>
<p>	Q.   What makes Ohio State's defense different from any defense you've played this year?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, now that you're 24 hours away from game time, do you do anything differently?</p>
<p>	Q.   Jim Tressel coached in six Division 1 AA Championship games.  What would you tell him about the difference in magnitude?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, as you look at the match-ups within the game, which match-up during this game concerns you the most?</p>
<p>	Q.   Larry, your team injurywise, is everybody healthy?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, a follow-up to Coach Tressel playing in those six Division 1 AA National Championships.  Do you dip back into Coach Tressel's days at Youngstown to check out those films?</p>
