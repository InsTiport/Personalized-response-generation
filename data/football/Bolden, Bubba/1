Q. Bubba, could you speak to what went wrong in the early goings of the defense, and what did you do to make adjustments and fix things and get back into the game?
BUBBA BOLDEN:   It was missed tackling, not fitting gaps -- it's on the defense, it's on us.  We just had to make an adjustment.  Went back and from there it kind of -- kind of went up.
Q. And then for you personally, just your emotions and your feelings after this game, what you're feeling after this and about your future here.
BUBBA BOLDEN:   You know, mad.  We just lost.  I'm not really focused on the future.  The few future will come.  Decisions will be made.  Right now, what you want me to say, we just lost the game.
Q. Many mentioned the amount of passing they were doing early on, catching you guys off guard considering they are such a run-heavy team typically.  Did you feel like that, that maybe they were doing stuff you didn't necessarily expect?
BUBBA BOLDEN:   No.  Not at all.  We knew they were going to pass the ball.  They have one of the best receivers in the country.  We knew it was coming.  We took away the deep balls.  They started throwing it at short on check downs, in zone coverage, they start picking apart that.  We just have to make adjustments.
Q. Brian starting alongside you at safety, what he did to earn the right to start in this Bowl game and what he did to get there?
BUBBA BOLDEN:   Yeah, he's came a long way.  He's been one of the young guys that's really stepped up and locked in the season.  He's been very helpful, especially when we get tired and everything, he knows what he's doing.  He plays very well.  He has a bright future here and I can't wait to see what he does.
