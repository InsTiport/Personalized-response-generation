 Q.   Will, just talk about the defense tonight, and the couple times you got off to a good start, three‑and‑out, and then the fumble and you guys responded to it.   It seems that this defense keeps building up every week?  
WILL SMITH:   Yeah, every week we're just trying to get a chance for ourselves.   When a sudden chance happens, you have to be ready to step up to the plate.   Other than that, you have to take care of assignment football.   So that's what we've got to do tonight, just focus on our individual assignment.   
I mean, we made the tackle like individually, but as a team, we did what we wanted to do.  
   
 Q.   Was it confusing when they were switching the quarterback?   Did you like that because it gives you something to think about as you're moving forward?   
WILL SMITH:   It wasn't too confusing.   During the week you prepare for that because we study the film.   We see that they can change into two different quarterbacks.   So it wasn't too difficult.   They run pretty much the same kind of scheme, so it was pretty easy to get out there and play around there.  
   
 Q.   Will, do you feel like you guys are getting better each week?   
WILL SMITH:   Yeah, I do feel that we're getting better each week.   I feel like we haven't hit our peak yet.   But I feel like we're on the way to get there.   I would say by the first game, we should be pretty close to hitting it.
