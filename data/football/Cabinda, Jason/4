 Q.  What did you like most this week?  
JASON CABINDA: I liked Disneyland, to be honest.  Disneyland was cool.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it.  Felt like a kid again.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: We tried to go on every single one.  We had to go to ESPN Zone after a while and came back, and then we were just too tired.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No.  I actually -- I was born like right near here.  I went to Disneyland when I was really little, like 3 years old maybe.  It was cool going there like growing up and stuff.  Enjoyed it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Oh, this is great.  The weather, it's hot to me.  Right now back in State College, it's probably in the 20s or 30s.  It's cold out there and snowing.  This weather is awesome here.  We're enjoying it.  Shorts and shirts.  I haven't had shorts on for a month and a half or so.  So we're really enjoying it for sure.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No, I wouldn't say so.  He's a really impressive quarterback, especially for a freshman.  He has poise in there.  Really good pocket presence.  Quick release.  He gets the ball in the hands of his guys, simple as that.  He has a lot of targets, a lot of weapons.  It's going to be a difficult challenge for us, but it's definitely the guy we're going to have to rattle and kind of get him off balance.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, I mean, I think the thing that's going to be best is disguise.  He's a young guy.  He's a guy we're going to have to throw a lot of looks at.  As much as we can slow his mind down and make him feel uncomfortable, make sure he doesn't peg us, bootstrap, all those kinds of things is going to be really important and vital to our success.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I would say they have similar styles of running, but a couple of those guys are quicker than the others.  Ronald Jones is very dynamic.  Really good vision.  He's a good back.  He's the type of back that you'd expect to see on a USC team.  So I mean, it's definitely going to be a good challenge for us.   
Also just knowing, having a rotation like that, they're going to have fresh legs.  That's something that you also have to be reminded of.  Make sure none of those guys kind of get going and get the confidence.  When they play with confidence, those guys could really get going.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah.  Vince Young, probably the Rose Bowl I remember the most.  That guy is just a stud.  He dominated college football in general.  That's definitely my Rose Bowl memory that I definitely remember.   
My sister went to USC.  So I grew up a USC fan in general, so no doubt.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No doubt about it.  I would have never thought that one day I'd be playing against USC, a team I once rooted for growing up.  So it's interesting.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No doubt.  Thank you.  She is 27.  Seven years older.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I mean, that's a team I've always remembered to be a dominant team, the best of the best of college football.  So to be going against a team like that and be put up in that same tier is awesome.  It's going to be a great opportunity for me, and kind of interesting, kind of reflecting back, knowing that the team I once rooted for I'll now be playing against.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Unfortunately, no doubt.  My sister was definitely more heartbroken than I was, but no doubt about it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Not too much.  I followed Washington a bit, but it's what you would expect.  Pac-12 football is kind of what you'd expect, run and gun.  A lot of passing, a lot of quick screens.  They like to get the ball into their best weapon's hands.  That's kind of what they do.   
I think USC's game is a more controlled passing game.  They have a lot of good targets at the receiver position.  I believe Number 7 got hurt earlier in the year, but Number 1, JuJu, they've got a lot of good guys.  It's going to be one of our toughest challenges, especially with Sam Darnold at quarterback.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No, I don't think it's as strong as it used to be.  I just think the Pac-12 has a very good crop of running backs, and when you have really good running backs, you're going to run the ball, as simple as that.   
But I mean, it's definitely still leaning towards that style, but I definitely wouldn't say it's as -- how can I say it?  It's not as extreme as it used to be.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, definitely.  Absolutely.  Linda.  Linda Cabinda, yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I probably wouldn't go as far as to say that, but I would definitely agree with the fact the Big Ten is scoring a whole lot more points.  I really think that's more due to the fact a lot of people are running the spread offense.  When they run the spread offense, I just think you're going to score more points.  It's not exactly the same grind it  out, run the ball every play, I-formation.  It's not really that anymore.  It's more because I think a lot more teams are running that spread offense that people are able to put more points up.   
It's a difficult offense.  They put a lot of guys in conflict play after play.  When you put guys in conflict with their responsibilities, pick and runs and all that kind of stuff, you're going to have open plays and make big plays.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: As a linebacker, I love the power.  I love the power type offense and seeing I-formation and 22 and personnel, all that kind of stuff.  I like playing that physical, hard-nosed football.   
But at the same time, I think we played really well against the spread this year.  We played a lot of times this year.  We have 11 base personnel, and we played pretty well against them.  Either/or, I don't mind.  We have a game plan, and we're going to go out and execute, and I think we're going to like the score at the end of the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I would say both of them really take command of the offense.  For Trace, not being as much of an experienced guy at the beginning of the year, and Darnold also being a freshman, both of those guys kind of play like veterans.  That's something I really like in the both of them.   
And that Darnold kid, quick release.  He has a strong and accurate arm.  He finds his play makers, simple as that.  He really commands their offense.  Since he's taken over, they've had a lot of success with him.  So really impressed with him.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Don't get me wrong, we've been stopping the run all year really against teams that run the ball pretty well.  That's a tribute to our front seven, really our key line.  We have a deep rotation right now on our defensive line, and we have a lot of guys that can play.  We have a D-line that can go out and have fresh legs and play well and get negative plays, and even zero yard plays are huge.  They've done that, and they've been very disruptive this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: 25.  I would say 22 is a bit quicker.  I think 25 has really good vision.  Ronald Jones has really good vision.  That's the thing that stands out to me the most.  They run that stretch play, and a lot of times it looks like there's nothing there.  He always seems to make something out of nothing.  When you have running backs that can do that and make yards after contact, make guys miss, that just makes you very dynamic.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Just the fact he doesn't play like a freshman.  He makes very good decisions.  26 touchdowns, like 7 interceptions.  He gets the ball in the hands of his playmakers, the offense really goes through him.  He's really taken over that offense and been a leader for them, and they've had a lot of success with him.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, it's tough.  When they get the ball out there quick, quick screens on the outside, you're going to have to have a game where you tackle really well.  That's going to be huge.  I think that's one of the things that comes up most in bowl games is tackling and special teams.  I think that's what really affects the outcomes of these bowl games.  A lot of these teams haven't tackled in a few weeks, since their last game really.   
So continuing to fine tune our tackling day after day is going to be huge.  When you have those quick screens and talented receivers who can make guys miss, it's going to be important to get those guys on the ground.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, I think in the sense that these are the guys that haven't had a lot of playing experience, but they're really playing like veterans.  They really settled in, both of them, I feel like, and they're playing their best football so far.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It's been awesome.  Great weather.  Awesome to be out here in L.A.  Great vibes out here with the people.  My highlight is going to Disneyland, to be honest.  It felt good to be able to go out there and feel like a kid again and ride a bunch of rides and do all that kind of stuff.  It was fun walking around in Disneyland.  It was awesome.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think for us, you want to find tendencies.  We have a lot of guys watching film and trying to find those tendencies, trying to find what they're doing and exactly how we think they're going to try to attack us.   
At the end of the day, the most important thing is to make sure we get Sam Darnold off balance and not in a rhythm.  I think he's dangerous at the quarterback position.  He's a guy who runs a bit better than you'd want him to.  That's definitely a guy we're going to have to stop.  Obviously, stopping the run in Ronald Jones as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Well, I think that's going to be huge too.  I mean, that's disguising, presnap, and all those kinds of things.  At the same time, that's going to be getting them off schedule.  It's going to be huge.  I think that's what we've done in the second half with the defense so well is getting guys off schedule and making teams do things they really don't want to do.  Get them out of their game plan and make them force things.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I don't know the hazards yet.  This is -- to me, this is the most historic Bowl game you can play in.  It's a blessing.  It's a great opportunity for us.  I think this isn't something that's going to really sink in until maybe two, three, four weeks after we play this game.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No doubt.  Enjoying it, man.  I'm enjoying it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It was pretty good, man.  They were talking up the meal.  So I was a little unsure at first, the way they were talking about.  But then all right, they definitely backed it up.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It was so good, but I've got to give it to the prime rib because I'm actually not a big prime rib guy.  In general, I already wasn't too excited about it.  Once I ate it, I was like all right.  You've got to have good prime rib, you know what I mean?  It was good.  I'm a believer now, no doubt.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No, no, I was actually born out here.  Stayed out here for the first three, four years, then moved over to Virginia then to Jersey.  So I've been out here a few times.   
No, I'm born here, but I grew up in Jersey actually.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It's all super exciting.  It's a great opportunity.  It's the granddaddy of them all.  So right now, just taking it all in, enjoying the great weather.  But waiting for the Bowl game at the end of this week.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: They have a lot of offensive weapons.  Sam Darnold, their starter, for one, a freshman who's really playing like a veteran.  He's a guy, since he's taken over, they've found a lot of success with him.  Running backs, Justin Davis, Ronald Jones, good backs, the kind of backs you would expect to see out of a USC team.  Obviously, at the receiver position, they're loaded as well.  JuJu, Number 1, they've got some guys.   
It's going to be a tough challenge for us, but we're really excited.  Just with all the down time we have in general, guys get a whole lot of film watched, try to pick out tendencies, kind of see how they're going to attack us.  It's going to be a tough challenge, but we're up for it.  They're a good football team, and we're a good football team as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think in the Wisconsin game, that was probably a game we really couldn't afford to lose belief.  Knowing that we were able to come back down 28-7.  When you can make a comeback like that and kind of play like that, it gives us certain confidence that you can achieve anything.   
When you give a defense -- really in any form, when you give people that kind of confidence, the way they're able to play with confidence, I think we're going to see this game, how that game is going to affect our defense and our team as a whole.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Absolutely.  I think, to me, it's his energy.  It's his energy and his mentality and his belief in us.  Belief is a powerful thing.  When you get guys all going the same road in the same direction and all believing, a lot can be achieved.  I think that's something all year Coach Franklin has been preaching to us.   
And we've been through a lot, a lot of adversity through this season, really in the beginning, all that kind of stuff.  It's a tight-knit group, and we're close, and we really believe in each other's abilities, and it's shown all year long.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: We don't want to feel that feeling ever again.  It's as simple as that.  It's knowing that the week before and the week before that, you didn't do enough.  You've got to do more this week if you want to get a win.  You've got to build on it week upon week upon week, and we've done that.   
And the guys have coached through the game and through practice every single day.  These guys really work hard, and they put everything into this game.  I think that's why we've been able to find a lot of success this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No.  I mean, it's been the same approach.  It's just how we've done things.  Paying attention to the little details.  Doing every little -- every single little thing the right way.  I think that's really what it's been about.   
 Q.  Microscope microphone?  
JASON CABINDA: You know, at times.  I think the best thing about our team is he never has to get on us about effort, any kinds of things like that.  Guys, before the coach even -- if we make a mistake, before the coach even wants it played back, you have the older guys saying, hey, run it back.  We want to get this look again.  When you have the older guys facilitating practice like that, when the coaches don't have to say anything, you're going to find success.  Appreciate it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I've really been enjoying it.  I think the whole team is really.  Going to Disneyland, ESPN Zone, all these things have been really, really cool.  For us, being able to have an extra opportunity to play a game as a family is the most important thing, and being able to play in the Rose Bowl in general, it's a blessing.  It's awesome.  We're really appreciative of it.   
Right now, we're just preparing so that at the end of the day after the game, when we get those rings, they can say Rose Bowl Champions.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Definitely Disneyland.  I haven't been to Disneyland since I was 2 or 3 years old, so being able to come as a 20-year-old and feeling like a kid again and riding the rides, it was awesome.  I really enjoyed it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, I mean, there's really no other way to explain it.  Really the past three years, I don't think I've had that feeling.  I mean, it's just great.  The guys, they really love each other.  Everybody cares about each other so much.  That's a testament to the off-season and the work we've been through.  When you're out there grinding with your brothers and sweating, it's tough.  You have guys constantly picking each other up, constantly asking for more of each other.  When you have that, I think, guys who want to be better and get better every single day continuously, you're going to find success, like I said.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Absolutely.  Just the fact that nobody would have thought we'd be here, simple as that.  Being able to prove people wrong, while at the same time just worrying about the people in our room, at the end of the day, that's what got us there.  Believe in each other in our room, our coaches, our trainers, our strength coaches.  That's really all that matters to us.  Any outside noise is really irrelevant for us.   
I think we have a formula of success and we know our approach and what we have to do week in and week out, and we're going to do that and be 1-0 at the end of the week.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, for us, like I said, it starts with Coach and his positive attitude he brings, and that's one of our core values.  He believes in us, and he's constantly telling us what we're capable of doing.  When you get 105 guys all believing in the same thing, all pulling the rope in the same direction, special things can happen.  I think we've seen that this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Whatever expectations I may have is probably going to blow them away, to be honest.  I'm just excited to run out that tunnel and take it all in and really just experience it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: He's a really good back.  He has really good vision.  I think he's an explosive back.  Runs hard.  He makes people miss.  When you have a back that's dynamic that can make people miss, get a lot of yards after contact.  One thing he really does is a lot of the times that you see some of his big runs, he's making something out of nothing.  When you have a running back that can do that, that's one you can have some problems.  So that's a guy we're going to have to tackle and get on the ground and really make sure he doesn't get into a rhythm.  You give a guy like that confidence and let a guy like that get going, you're going to have problems.   
I think through watching film, you've seen him really have some games.  We can't afford to let him have a game in the Rose Bowl.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Tough to say.  He reminds me a little bit of Justin Jackson actually.  Maybe a little more dynamic.  He's quick.  He makes people miss.  He runs hard.  Really good vision.  All those things have been really good for him.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: The unsung hero?  It would probably go to D-line.  And it's a testament to really our strength coaches and what they've been able to do in the off-season.  Really the line on both sides of the ball.  They really grind it and really wear teams down in the third and fourth quarter.   
I think in the second half, you've seen our D-line get a ton of negative yard plays, TFLs and sacks, and even zero yard plays are really huge to be honest.   
And the O-line as well.  We lost guys, we have.  We lost some guys, and guys have stepped up.  This team has really taken that next man up mentality and kind of ran with it.  We have a lot of guys step up and young guys too, step up and make plays for us.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No doubt.  That was one of their biggest motivations, to be honest.  Everyone saying, oh, Zettel's leaving, Nassib's leaving, Austin Johnson, all these guys leaving to the NFL.  People were going to say, our D-line is going to be all weak on our defense.  Guys like Garrett Sickels and Evan Schwan, that leadership, Torrence Brown, those guys made sure every single day that D-line was working and working and working to make sure, not only was that not a weakness, but it ended up being one of our strengths.  That's maturity, and that's leadership.  Those guys have done such a good job.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think it was like 2008.  Yeah, 2008/2009.  I actually didn't watch that game.  I didn't.  It's ultimately back to your game.  Hopefully, we'll get the "W" this time.  No doubt.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think that's what you have to understand.  There's few guys here really are doing that at this point in time.  I think we're a bit removed from that time.  That's in the past.  We kind of buried that.  At this point in time, we don't even let that come up in conversation, sanctions, all that kind of stuff.  Right now, all that matters is working and believing in each other, working as a team, pulling the rope in the same direction.   
In the past few years, I don't think that was happening.  Right now we have guys really believing in each other, really care and love for each other.  That's really carried us throughout the whole season.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, I think that's one of the toughest parts nowadays is facing running quarterbacks because, you know, you may cover well, and nobody may be open.  Then all of a sudden, he gets out of the pocket, and they have a whole other threat they have to worry about.  I think the running quarterbacks give defenses quite a challenge.   
He's a guy who definitely runs better than you'd want him to.  We're going to have to contain him.  That's the rush lanes, with our four-man rush, and covering well at the same time.  It's going to be a challenge for us, but we're up for it.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Oh, no doubt.  Obviously, the D-line, that's going to be their challenge of the week.  I think they've only given up 11 or 12 sacks this year.  So if they want to get after it, USC has a big offensive line.  They're athletic.  73, he's like 6'9", 360.  They've got some big guys on that offensive line.  So it's going to be a challenge for our D-line.   
The best thing about it is our D-line has worn guys all year long and kind of grinded offensive lines down towards the second half or so.  We're very confident in their ability and what they're going to be able to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: To me, he's very dynamic.  He's a guy who makes something out of nothing multiple times a game.  He has very good vision.  He's explosive.  He's quick and fast and makes people miss.  It's going to be a tough challenge.  It's the type of USC back you'd expect to see out of a team like USC.  Going to be a tough challenge for us, but we're going to have to tackle him and get him on the ground and make sure he doesn't get going.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Oh, yeah, no doubt.  Trace and Tommy Stevens really, I think they both carry that run threat.  That's difficult for defenses, you know.  Playing guys that are going to be able to make plays, even if there's nobody open downfield.  It's really one of your worst nightmares.  The running quarterbacks all year long really have been giving defenses a lot of problems.   
So going to have to contain him in the rush lanes and keep him contained and make sure he doesn't get out.  And when he does get out, we're going to have to get him on the ground, as simple as that.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I mean, he's a huge target.  He's fast.  He runs really well.  Runs good routes.  His hands have been so solid this year.  Honestly can't really recall any of his drops, to be honest.  What a turnaround for him.  He's having an incredible year and really hasn't gotten enough credit.  We're really proud of the way he's played, and he's added a whole other threat.  When you have a big receiving tight end target, possession receiver like that who makes big time plays, it's a whole other thing you've got to worry about on the defense.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: A 2017 New Year's resolution besides winning the Rose Bowl?  Nothing I can think of at the moment.  Thank you.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, they have good receivers.  They have JuJu, Number 1.  I believe Number 7 went down early in the year.  But talented receivers.  Their running backs, Ronald Jones, Justin Davis, those guys are very dynamic.  Ronald Jones, exactly the type of running back you'd expect to see out of a team like USC.  Really good.  Great vision, explosive, makes guys miss, gets yards after contact -- all those things that kind of what make a very good running back.   
Obviously, Sam Darnold.  Ever since he's taken over, they've really believed in him, and he's kind of got them going all year long and has been a leader for them on offense.  I think, to me, with him being a redshirt freshman, he's really playing like a veteran, 26 touchdowns and maybe like 7 interceptions.  He's taking care of the ball.  He's making good decisions.  So that's a guy we're going to have to rattle and make sure he doesn't get going during this game.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Yeah, absolutely.  That's the only competitive advantage, the fact they technically have that home field advantage.  But for us, being able to come out here and knock them off, it would be huge.  It would be awesome.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No doubt.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Absolutely.  I think we've never really listened to the outside noise.  We have our formula and our approach and what we know is going to make us 1-0 at the end of the week, and that's been our preparation.   
The only guys that really matter are the people in our room.  The players, the coaches, the trainers, the strength coaches -- that's really all who matters.  We take care of our business each and every day and make the right decisions and make sure we're preparing and watching films and doing the right things, we're going to like the outcome on Saturday.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Oh, yeah.  It's been awesome.  The Beef Bowl was amazing.  Got to go to Disneyland, ESPN Zone.  I mean, we've enjoyed a whole lot of this.  The weather as well.  We're really enjoying it out here.  Probably not going to want to leave after the game, to be honest.   
Obviously, it's a business trip.  As we get closer and closer to the game, guys are going to be more locked in.  Luckily, we have a lot of down time where guys are able to watch film and pick up tendencies and kind of figure out how they're going to attack.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Awesome, awesome.  Enjoying L.A., enjoying the weather, enjoying some time with my brothers out here.  It's been amazing so far.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It is raining today, but it's still warm.  I'll still be able to come out in some shorts whereas back in PA, it's 20, 30 degrees, cold and snowing.  Thankful for, even if it's 55 degrees, thankful for the weather, you know what I mean?  Just got to think of it on the bright side.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It's awesome, you know.  I remember we came out in the first practice, this is like training camp all over again.  But guys are getting acclimated to the weather.  Being able to play out in great weather is awesome as well.  I think football in the cold isn't really as fun as it is in warm weather.   
We're excited as hell about it.  Excited to play at the Rose Bowl Stadium.  We're really thankful and grateful for this opportunity.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Really well.  I think that's the difficult thing about Bowl games.  You have Bowl events, Disneyland and ESPN Zone and Beef Bowl and all those things.  Guys got to know when to turn the switch on and get back to business, when it's meeting time and time for practice and all those things.   
I think that's one of the things we've handled really well so far.  Guys have been locked in during practice, locked in during meetings and film sessions.  That's huge because it's tough.  You're at Disneyland one second, and the next moment you've got to lock in for practice.  They've done a really good job turning that switch off and on.   
That just shows you how important that game is to them, to be honest.  Really proud of the way our team is staying really mature out here.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: It's an 11, no doubt.  It's 11.  You got guys in practice -- we have anybody make mistakes, and before the coaches are even calling to run the plays back, our older guys are saying, hey, y'all got to run that back.  We want to get this right.   
When you have the players facilitating practice and wanting to do things the right way and do things perfectly before the coaches are even calling it out, I mean, you're going to have success like that.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think for starters, their quarterback Sam Darnold has done a really good job ever since he picked up for them.  He runs better than you want him to.  Quick release, strong arm, he's accurate, gets the ball out there quickly and out to his play makers.  That's a guy we're definitely going to have to contain and going to have to throw a lot of disguises at him and make sure he doesn't peg us presnap, because if that guy gets going, he can have a day.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I think a team that played them really well and aggressively on defense is Washington's defense.  They played fast and really aggressive.  Ronald Jones, when he made guys miss, there were guys there to make up for it and gang tackle and those types of things.   
I think pursuit and all those kinds of things are going to be huge for us.  They have play makers.  They're going to make guys miss, but we have a second and a third guy in there to clean it up, it's going to be huge for us.  We can't allow them to have a ton of YAC yards and those types of things and explosive plays.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Me personally?  I think my job is to command the defense, make sure everybody's lined up right.  Obviously, to do my job, execute, and be a playmaker as well.  Being a junior and an upper classman at this point, you've got to lead by example.  You've got to go out there and get guys fired up and give guys the mentality to go out there and win a football game and make sure guys don't lose belief in each other regardless of the circumstances.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: My mom, no doubt about it.  My mom, she's done it all for me.  Growing up, working multiple jobs, driving me back and forth for practice between football, basketball, lacrosse.  I mean, she really put us on her back.  To me, she means everything to me.  She's why I do this for.  I do it for her.   
Another reason why I'm staying, because I want to make sure I have my education because, at the end of the day, that's number one to her and that's number one to me.  That's one of the reasons I'm deciding to come back and play another year as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: LeBron James because I think -- to me, the kind of circumstances that LeBron James has played through and the expectations and constantly time and time again exceeding expectations.  I think there's not an athlete really of our generation that has had the type of expectations coming out of high school as an 18-year-old like LeBron James has had, and he's, like I said, continuously overcame what everybody was saying.  Regardless of the media, regardless of what anybody had to say.   
He's done what's best for him and stayed true to his values and who he is.  That's really inspirational to me, and that's who I really idolize.  There's really no other athlete I idolize besides LeBron, to be honest with you.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Work ethic.  Because to me -- and that's one of our core values.  To me, work ethic is what you can control.  Your attitude and work ethic is what you can control.  At the end of the day, no matter what time of the day, you could be going and doing something and getting better.   
As more talented as somebody may be than you, that's faster, stronger, whatever the case may be, you can always outwork people.   
That's really one of the things that I love about this country in general is the fact that, no matter where you start at, if you put in the work and you continuously make the right choices and make the right decisions and get to where you're going, whatever path that may be, you're going to find success.  That's really what I love about this country the most.  It's what you make out of it.  It's what you make out of your time.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Penn State?  I hope to see 107,000 out there.  We are.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I was born in Buena Park by Orange County.  Then I moved out to Virginia when I was like 4.  Then I moved over to Jersey when I was 6 or 7.  Really, I grew up in Jersey since then.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Not too much.  I've been back here a couple times.  I have family out here.  So I've been back here a couple times, but I claim Jersey.  I claim Jersey.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: Oh, man, right.  It's warm here.  It's warm to us.  We're enjoying this, man.  Oh, yeah.  It's funny.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: I know, right?  Now they know what cold really feels like.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
JASON CABINDA: No, exactly.  I freakin' hate the snow.  Hate it.  It's pretty when it first snows, then it gets all slushy and dirty and makes your car all nasty.
