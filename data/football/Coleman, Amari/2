Q. Just give us your overall thoughts from today's performance from you guys.
AMARI COLEMAN: Obviously it's not good losing, but I feel like there's some good things we can take out of this.  I feel like defensively we played well.  We played with energy, and I feel like we can only build from here.
Q. Do you feel like they kind of wore you down?  That second half they seemed to run the ball well and had some success against you guys.
AMARI COLEMAN: I feel like they didn't wear us down.  They only scored 14 points if you really think about it.  But I mean, I don't know we let them wear us down, we just kept getting out on the field, and we've just got to make plays.
Q. How tough was it to have that short field after those couple of punt returns?
AMARI COLEMAN: I mean, it's hard, but we've still got to come out on top.  We've got to stop them because we're on defense.  That's what we've got to do.
Q. What's the vibe like among this team now, three losses in a row?  You've got to get it going next week, get back to the league next week.  What's the vibe like for you guys?  You're in a leadership position on this club.  What do you got to do at this point?
AMARI COLEMAN: I feel like the vibe is well.  The last thing we can do is just get on each other in a bad way.  We've just got to stay positive and come together in this point, and I feel like we're going to do that because I feel like we're a strong team.
