		   JERON JOHNSON: We will be proud of the things we have done this season. One of our main goals is to win a Bowl game. We won't be satisfied with just winning the WAC this year. We want to win a Bowl game. 

 Q. Everybody says this team is the underdog in this game. Do you feel like that? 
 JERON JOHNSON: Yeah, I feel like we are underdogs in this game. The things they've done this season, their strength, they deserve it. They deserve to have an advantage right now. 
 But, I mean, we are just going to come in and fight and do the best we can.

 Q. Is that extra motivation for you guys, being the underdog? 
 JERON JOHNSON: We have all the motivation we need despite that. They beat us last season. When you look at losing against someone, you want to come back and beat them.

 Q. Talk about that loss. What did you learn from it? 
 JERON JOHNSON: We just got to fight harder and be more physical. We weren't the most physical team in that game. We have to be more physical. 
 They played four quarters. We didn't do that last year. We have to come in fighting and play four quarters.

 Q. Everybody is talking about the offense. What about the defense? 
 JERON JOHNSON: We are great competitors. We are going to compete. We are hungry. We don't get the recognition that we want. And the work that we put in, we want more recognition. We got to come in this week and make some noise.

 Q. How great would it be to start off the new year with a big Bowl win? 
 JERON JOHNSON: It would be great. It's already being nice to be here, but a win would be even better.
