   QUINTON CARTER: I put on a lot of weight. I was 170, I think. And I'm 210 right now. That's the biggest change. I mean, just my knowledge of football growing a whole lot, just becoming a smarter person, a smart smarter football person and a more mature human being.   
  
  Q. How excited are you about the game?   
 QUINTON CARTER: I'm very excited being my last game in the Sooners, being in the championship. Want to go out with a win. I mean, it's big. We haven't won a BCS game. All of those things are factors in the excitement leading up to the game.
