 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 MASON WALTERS: The first two games at home, getting the jitters out of everything, it's never the same situation you get in practice. You can control things in practice different than what shows up in a game. And that's something we've got to improve on. We know that, and that's something we're going to work on this week. 

 Q. Is there a difference between the quarterbacks in the huddle starting the first half?
 MASON WALTERS: The only thing that's different is the cadence, the way they go about it. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 MASON WALTERS: It all happened. It's behind us. We'll do a good job of clueing into -- how they say -- you and I say things differently. It's the same thing in the cadence, but that's the only difference. 

 Q. (Indiscernible.)
 MASON WALTERS: The work ethic he has coming in every day with a great attitude ready to go to work. I think he does a great job of that and the way he plays, obviously. As an offensive lineman, that's the way you want your running back to hit the holes. 

 Q. When you're here as a young guy I assume a lot of it is about you and wanting to get playing time. Do you notice as you get older it becomes more about the team? 
 MASON WALTERS: Definitely. I think that's a big part of it, something you go through in the maturing process. Coming in as a red shirt sophomore this year I think that's something I'm finally starting to get a hold of. It's not about one person just walking out there; you're at the University of Texas, and so many people are watching. And anybody can go out, and it's still going to be a productive program, still going to be really good.
