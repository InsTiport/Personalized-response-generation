   THE MODERATOR: Questions for Mason Walters.

 Q. Mason, you were part of last year's team. 4-2 at this point last year, then went down. What makes this year you're going to go up?
 MASON WALTERS: We're going to stay positive. I think we saw last week we're going to keep working hard no matter what. 

 Q. (Question regarding the bye week.) 
 MASON WALTERS: Protecting the ball, scoring in the red zone, big emphasis going into the week. 

 Q. Talk about Josh Cochran, what you've seen out of him. 
 MASON WALTERS: I've seen the kid growing up really fast, playing left tackle. In this league, it's no easy feat. As a freshman, it's really hard. 
 He's grown up and done a good job with it.

 Q. What are his strengths?
 MASON WALTERS: He's a technician. Just getting better at that week by week. Right now he's giving himself a good chance to win most of the time because he is using the right technique. 

 Q. What was it like to see David be the man? Did you see confidence grow into his game?
 MASON WALTERS: I think all of our quarterbacks are really more confident, I really do. Getting to see David grow up a little bit in the last couple games, been good to see. 
 Thank you.
