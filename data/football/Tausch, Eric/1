TCU   10
  TEXAS TECH - 20

Q.   Eric, how did you guys play as an offensive line tonight? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   Anytime you lose, you always wish you can play a little better.   Just didn't have some things go our way, but all of us have to grow up and we have to start playing better.

Q.   What were some of the problems with the offense moving the ball through the first two, three quarters?
ERIC TAUSCH:   We just needed to get in a rhythm, and playing offense, that's what it's all about, playing in a rhythm, and finding that rhythm, so we can score points.   We just never found that.   At the end of the game, we found it, and just wish we could have gotten it early in the game.

Q.   (No microphone)?
ERIC TAUSCH:   Do what? 

Q.   You guys weren't able to find a rhythm?   Was it due to their defense or was it just the offense?
ERIC TAUSCH:   No, we game planned for these guys, and it's on us.   We have to step up and take that upon ourselves and find that rhythm ourselves.

Q.   Like you said, you guys did find a rhythm later on in the game.   What were some of the things that worked that helped you guys do that? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   We just started executing.   We started overcoming everything and taking the fans out of the game and we started playing how TCU offense was supposed to play.   It's just too bad we found that rhythm later in the game.

Q.   How would you describe B.J. Catalon's play this season so far? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   B.J. is a very explosive player and brings a lot of energy on the offense.   He not only plays offense, he plays special teams and stuff.   That is the kind of energy we need.   You know, same with Brandon Carter.   Those guys are multi‑tasking guys.   They can play different positions.   They can go out on the route and catch the ball, he can run the ball, he's shifty.   He's doing a good job. 
We just need to keep it up.   As an offensive line, we need to grow up and help him out.

Q.   Can you spell your last name for me? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   T‑A‑U‑S‑C‑H.

Q.   Did you play against this team last year? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   Yes, ma'am.

Q.   Did you notice any difference in this team? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   As a defense, they played a little bit more 50‑front, kickdown to a double eagle.   But pretty much they had the same personnel.   It was the same group of guys for the most part.

Q.   You said you guys got to execute better on offense.   What are some practical things you've got to do as an offensive line if you want to be able to do that? 
ERIC TAUSCH:   Play with our heart.   We've got to sit there and there is a point in time in the game where you've got to overcome everything and play with your heart and believing in yourself with the ability of your teammates and knowing that my guy to the left, my guy to the right, is going to have my back no matter what.   That is how you get in a rhythm.   You believe in everybody, and that is how you start scoring points. 

Q.   What is your playing position, Sam? 
SAM CARTER:   Strong safety.

Q.   Did the Tech offense‑defense surprise you any?   Did you play against these guys last year? 
SAM CARTER:   No, we watched film on what those guys do best.   They're up‑tempo, they have great team.   They know what to do, and they have great coaches over there.

Q.   (No microphone)?
SAM CARTER:   Yes, ma'am.

Q.   Did you see a difference? 
SAM CARTER:   Same team.   Those guys are good.   They do what they do and play good defense.

Q.   You guys played really good defense for a lot of the game.   Their two touchdowns and really most of their offense came on a few big plays.   What was the problem on those plays?   What happened? 
SAM CARTER:   Just mistakes.   Like you said, mistakes will kill you, those kind of things.   I think it was two mistakes and two mistakes cost us the game.

Q.   What does the defense need to do to progress from this game just to get better? 
SAM CARTER:   Stop making mistakes, limit the mistakes and I think everything else will take care of itself.   Our coaches do a great job every week giving us a game plan.   So today we fought hard, it's just those two mistakes cost us.

Q.   Did Devonte being back on the field help you guys a lot? 
SAM CARTER:   Yeah, his presence, all of the D‑line, all those guys did a great job.   Having him back was great, but we still lost, so...

Q.   Did you feel like you guys had their starting quarterback kind of wrapped up and had him where you wanted him before their back‑up came in?   Did that make a big difference for them? 
SAM CARTER:   No, those guys still went down in and scored with the back‑up.   We knew the back‑up was good.   The starter did a great job when he was in.

Q.   Before Mayfield was out, what is challenging about his style of play and athletic ability?   What makes him challenging as a quarterback to defend? 
SAM CARTER:   He's a good quarterback.   He's good at what he does.   We go against Tre Boykin every day, so we have experience with guys that run the ball and throw the ball, but he's good at what he does.

Q.   Did you feel like the guy his taken over the momentum and it was sort of your game to win at that point? 
SAM CARTER:   I don't even think none of the guys on the team paid any mind to it.   At the end of the day we wanted to win by one, and we came up short today.

Q.   What was‑‑ what did G.P. have to say to you in the locker room in terms of what you guys need to do going forward? 
SAM CARTER:   Just me listening to what he said about the defense, just mistakes.   We're losing games, close games, you know because of mental mistakes and those are mistakes that kill you, and that's what happened tonight.
