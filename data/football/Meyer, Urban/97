Minnesota - 14 Ohio State - 28
COACH MEYER: Thanks for coming.  And appreciate our fans and incredible atmosphere at nighttime in the horseshoe.  I don't think we played a clean game.  I do not want to take anything away from our opponent, because that's two weeks in a row that they just swung as hard as they possibly could, with very good players.
