<p>	Q. What duties will C.J. Leak have on your staff. Will he have any on-field responsibility? </p>
<p>	Q. How did you feel about the learning curve of your team learning your system? </p>
<p>	Q. The Mountain West this year is going to have instant replay. To challenge would you rather allow SEC coaches to challenge in the ballgame or live with it? </p>
<p>	Q. This is the best football conference in the country. With your history and everything you have done personally, what do you do look you adjust in playing in the conference? What do you have to do? What does Florida have to do to get to Atlanta? </p>
<p>	Q. What were you able to accomplish at your last two stops, especially a year ago with Utah? Can you assess how excited you are now about your systems especially the offensive system and the level of talent as compared to what you have been able to work with in the past. How is this level of talent at Florida different at all? </p>
<p>	Q. Urban can you talk about some of the off-the-field things you have had to get used to as far as the interest and the peripheral, obviously, much greater in SEC and in Florida than Utah or any place you have been?</p>
<p>	Q. Coach, have you had any conversations with Steve Spurrier, whether about the special challenges of coaching at Florida or golf anything?</p>
<p>	Q. Urban, can you talk about how you inherited this level of talent at Florida. And when Steve came in '90, it was the similar situation, a lot of talent. How much easier is that when you watch it on film and watch the spring practices? What do you see? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, when you are coming into a new situation, what are some of the keys to, I guess, bringing the team onto your page of the way you want to do things beyond just X's and O's on the field and recruited by another staff and another head coach?</p>
<p>	Q. Coach, can you talk about the pressure of living up success of the Spurrier. What is the game going to be like to go in South Carolina?</p>
<p>	Q. You talk about wanting Florida to be a tougher team. Did you leave a tougher team than you found at Florida, and can you just talk about what you saw this Spring and where Florida needed to get tougher? </p>
<p>	Q. When you saw Florida needed to get tougher, did you leave behind at Utah. Did you find they're a tougher bunch?</p>
<p>	Q. Urban, new coaches coming in have a tougher time with the abbreviated Spring practices now. Where were you at the end of Spring and what kind of specific areas do you need to attach in the Fall?</p>
<p>	Q. Coach, I read somewhere you played at Florida and it didn't turn out too well. </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, would you talk about has the team met your off-season expectation and then also would you talk about where your strength comes from, have they met your expectations there?</p>
<p>	Q. Urban, can you describe matt drills for us? </p>
<p>	Q. Yes. </p>
<p>	Q. You were talking about how much you enjoy being around the players. </p>
<p>	Q. Yeah. Coach, you brought several motivational ploys and ways to unify the team that are knew to Florida. Where did you learn these methods? How do you gauge their effectiveness? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, taking over a program is nothing new for you. Could you describe some of the challenges? And you say the system is really the players system, but taking over this program, when I will guess, and if you could describe the difference, the expectations on your arrival here are a little different than they were when they took over at Utah. For example, not everyone there didn't want to win, but what's expected right out the gate. Can you describe what that's like in the challenges of getting the players to handle your system and meet the expectations from people there? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, I guess this is a Chris Leak question, but, also, could you talk about how he is similar and different than Alex Smith was for you last year?</p>
<p>	Q. Coach, how much time do you spend with the players and your coaching style, motivating them and trying to get them do the things off the field as X's and O's? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about your team strengths. This might be your first year, and maybe what you need to get better at in two days?</p>
<p>	Q. A lot of coaches will be breaking in inexperienced quarterbacks. How difficult is that process and how fortunate are you to walk into a situation with a guy that's had two years? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, I know you get two days to be getting ready for game one. When you glance at your schedule, before you start preparing for first game, what are the things in the schedule that jump out at you with a new place and new conference and everything that you are really looking for, whatever the case maybe? </p>
<p>	Q. Just things that jump out for the schedule for you?</p>
<p>	Q. Any opponents in particular or places that you are going to visit that you have or have not been in terms of Saturdays on your schedule this Fall? </p>
<p>	Q. Coach, you seem to have been relatively free of off-the-field incidents since you have been at Florida. Do you have a policy of five and out? Three and out? One and done? How do you approach that? </p>
