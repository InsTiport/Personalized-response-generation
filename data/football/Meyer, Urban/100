COACH MEYER: Thanks for coming.  A couple of quick comments as we always do, without any hesitation or deepest gratitude to our incredible fans and support.  And the Buckeye Walk was incredible.  The skull session was incredible.  And a lot of great places in college football, and this is a special place.  A night game in the Horseshoe, I remember the first one against Nebraska back in, whenever that was, 2012, and this is a special night.
