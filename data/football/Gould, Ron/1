  STANFORD - 45

Q.   Just overall, how does this game impact your team at this point, early in the year?
COACH GOULD:   In a very positive way.   It's a great learning experience for us.   We played arguably the best team in the nation. 
There's some good things, our defense played, I thought, extremely well.   Three turnovers there.   I was very pleased with that.   They just stayed on the field a long time. 
I was very pleased with how London played.   This is his first start ever and first college start ever.   And so very pleased how he managed the game for us and so forth.   We got a lot of things to be excited about. 
We have a lot of improvement that we've got to make in all three phases.   We did some things that are uncharacteristic of our team and all the penalties and so forth.

Q.   For example? 
COACH GOULD:   We had a couple of personal fouls.   That's not who we are.   And so we'll get that corrected and we had a few false starts in there that, like I said, are out of characteristic for our team and definitely we'll get better.   The players will be back starting tomorrow and we'll be ready to take that next step.

Q.   What specifics can you hang your hat on? 
COACH GOULD:   Defense played their butts off.   We're excited about that.   There were times, we were very spotty, very inconsistent on the offensive side of the ball.   There were times we were able to run the ball in there just a little bit and so that's promising. 
We do have a veteran offensive line.   We'll get our right tackle back in Christian Schneider.   He'll play full time for us.   So that will be good to see.   But I'm very, very pleased with the kids and just their effort and their willingness and continue to fight.   A little Aggie pride there. 
I was grateful for that, very pleased with how the 2014 Aggies came out today.   Obviously we'll be better.   We'll definitely get better.   And as I told the players, everything rests on me and I take the responsibility for all of it. 

Q.   What's with TJ and his leg? 
COACH GOULD:   I don't know at the present time.   We'll go back and I'll meet with the doctors and then we'll proceed from there.

Q.   First half injury? 
COACH GOULD:   Yes, sir.   We had a couple of them.   We had Inoke suffered an ankle sprain in the first half.   But we'll rebound.   The next man up.

Q.   As far as playing these type of teams, Stanford teams, David Shaw says he wants to see these continue.   I know there's some talk about possibly the big schools not playing you guys anymore down the road.   What are your thoughts?   Do you want to play these type of teams?
COACH GOULD:   Absolutely.   I think it's good for our program.   I think it's good for our kids and I like to continue with these kind of games as well.

Q.   Why?
COACH GOULD:   Because I think it sets the tone for where we want to go and where we want to build and how we want to build this thing.   As I told Coach Shaw today, I've got so much respect for him and his program, and we too aspire to be the Stanford of the FCS. 
And so for us to put our players, have an opportunity to see this and compete in this environment, I think it's great for us.
