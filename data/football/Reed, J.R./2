THE MODERATOR: Welcome back to the Georgia defense press conference.  To my right we have Jonathan Ledbetter, linebacker Lorenzo Carter, and J.R. Reed.   
Questions?   
 Q.  Lorenzo, we talked to Orlando Brown.  Talked about playing against you at Norcross.  What do you remember about him from Peachtree Ridge?  
LORENZO CARTER: I just remember his size, man.  Orlando's a big guy, hard to get around at times.   
It is going to be a battle.  It was a battle those two years I played him at Norcross, and I know he's not going to bring anything less.   
 Q.  Jonathan, a lot of your teammates have raved about Roquan's football IQ.  They said it's off the charts.  What does that look like?  What does that mean?  It's got to be more than he can diagnose a play quickly.  
JONATHAN LEDBETTER: Well, he's a tremendous athlete, as you guys know.  He can diagnose a play, he can check out of a play.  He recognizes offense as well.  He's just a tremendous athlete sideline to sideline.  Most importantly, he's just a hard worker.
