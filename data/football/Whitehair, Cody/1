 Q.  How hard was it to be behind the ball, as soon as you guys were able to do anything, they are already up?  
CODY WHITEHAIR: It's a tough situation to be in but we've all been in that position before, so it wasn't nothing new for us.  We knew we had to keep fighting and that's what we did, but we came up short today.   
 Q.  You guys have never been part of a six-game losing streak before.  How hard is this?  
CODY WHITEHAIR: It's tough.  You know, we're at the very bottom right now.  Emotionally, we have to come back and rally the troops around and get ready for a tough, Iowa State opponent.   
 Q.  What was the biggest difference between struggling and then finding a rhythm, what happened in the first quarter?  
CODY WHITEHAIR: I don't know, for whatever reason, but we did come out the second quarter and found some things that were working, and we stuck to those things, and we just kind of picked up our level of execution as well offensively, you know, and really I saw the guys determined and ready to get some yards, and that's what we did.   
 Q.  It seemed like the recipe for success was laid out to start the game.  They were giving up almost 300 yards rushing the ball.  What was the problem in that first quarter?  Why wasn't it clicking?  
CODY WHITEHAIR: It was probably just execution more than anything, like you see, week in and week out, and we will come through that and get better at execution.  We felt like we were prepared for this team, but they just outexecuted us today.
