Q.   (Inaudible.) 
JALEN RAMSEY:   A lot.   I don't feel like it's one leader on defense.   I feel like it's a lot of us.   I embrace the role.   I feel like I was ready for it.   I didn't feel like any type of weight towards it, I felt like I was ready to go.   I felt like I can lead by my actions and the way I played on the field, they would follow. 
I don't think it's just me, honestly.   I think there's a lot of leaders on defense.   Starting from my defensive line all the way back to the secondary.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   It took a little minute.   Like you said, last year we lost great leaders, Telvin, Joyner, T. Brooks.   So we really didn't know who was going to step in and be that vocal leader, or like the on‑the‑field leader this year. 
But it came once the time came, once we got practicing together, got more comfortable with each other, it came pretty naturally. 

Q.   (Inaudible.) 
JALEN RAMSEY:   That's amazing.   I love the star role more than anything on the field.   Of course, I came in as a corner, got moved to a safety, now I'm a star role. 
I just love playing football, honestly.   But I really like the star role because, like you say, I get to do a bunch of different things each game.   You never know what I'll be doing. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Their offense is, like you say, it's like the Auburn offense a little bit, it's kind of like Clemson as well.   It's very versatile.   They have great players, fast players.   They can do a lot of different things.   They're very competitive. 
They're going to give us a test.   So it will be fun to find out how we go up against them.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Yeah, it's very hard.   We don't ever want to guess the plays that are coming.   We want to be able to react and not think during the game.   I feel like if we do that, we'll be fine. 

Q.   The big thing is conditioning.   Anybody come to mind that prepared you for a game like this in terms of tempo?
JALEN RAMSEY:   Well, honestly, in practice we prepare for it.   We've gotten extra conditioning in after practices.   The scout team has done an amazing job of hurrying up to the line, having plays ready, going really fast, trying to match the tempo so that we can have the same look that we will get in the game. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   It just depends on what they're in.   But the majority I'll be playing star role, the nickel back. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   They probably did not eat as much as they like to because they know we have to condition. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I'm not sure.   One thing I do best.   I feel like I'm pretty rounded.   I can do everything equally.   But if you're asking my favorite thing to do, of course I like to blitz, I get to get in the back field and create some havoc back there. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Containing him, honestly.   He can keep plays alive with his feet, he scrambles out, he still likes to throw the ball.   Sometimes he scrambles out and just runs.   He's a very good athlete, not just quarterback. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   That's a big deal.   Everybody is looking at that.   Everybody is ready for that matchup.   We're not really worried about it as much, we're just worried about going out there and doing our job and playing.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't look at it any type of way.   I feel like it's a good amount of time, because the holidays are in between.   We have to go home and see our families.   I feel like it's a good amount of time. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   They're both great quarterbacks.   He plays a lot with his feet.   They like to throw the ball.   They can make plays with their feet.   They're very similar in that aspect. 

Q.   Do you see a similarity or difference between the East Coast and West Coast style? 
JALEN RAMSEY:   I'm not really sure until we play.   We haven't played a West Coast team.   We'll find out the 1st.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Maybe.   We're not really focused on that.   We're just focused on playing, and keep doing what we've got to do.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   No, I don't feel like we're the bad guys.   We just have to focus on what we have to do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Yeah, definitely.   Look at their uniforms.   They have very cool uniforms.   Who wouldn't want to wear those uniforms on Saturdays? 
They have a lot of good players and they're well coached. 

Q.   You think there's obviously more to it than that?
JALEN RAMSEY:   There could be, I'm not really sure. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   You know, we just have to do our job.   Whatever coach calls, we have to execute.   We have to go out there and make plays and have fun doing it and just play ball. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   He's a great athlete, as well as a great quarterback.   We've seen it on film.   That's something we have to contain. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   Jameis is a good leader, he leads his team, talks to us before the game.   Go out and be ready to play.   We try to carry that over out on to the field. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like he handles himself as well like a leader, like Jameis does, he's a very classy guy. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   You know, they run good routes, they're pretty fast. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We definitely need to, uh‑huh. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Because like you just said, Mariota does the same thing.   He can keep the play alive with his feet and he can scramble or he can scramble and throw it.   So it really helped us.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Everybody is going to focus on doing their job.   People have specific jobs to do, I feel like if we do all that we'll be fine. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   Definitely. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Who, Mariota? 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We didn't really put anything in for that game, that's why he had a pretty good rushing game for us. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   We accept the challenge.   Everybody is going to go out there and do what we have to do.   Play the game.   Discipline.   Do what we can do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely we'd rather be playing, but we know it's a part of it, so we're fine.   It's fine. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't think about it either way.   God had a plan for me.   I picked Florida State for a reason.   So I'm not worried about it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't think it's odd.   The first year of the playoff we're in the semifinals.   That's not odd.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We don't feel like the underdog, no. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We're not really focused on anything that people say, whether they're the favorite or the underdog.   We're just going to go out and do our job and play ball. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We're not really thinking about that.   We're just thinking about going out and playing football, doing our job, having fun, competing.   That's all we're thinking about. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Of course.   He's our brother, we're always going to have his back.   We're all teammates.   We're basically all brothers.   We love each other.   So of course we'll have his back. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Yeah, I feel like it, but that's not up to me. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   Like you say, he's a dynamic player, good athlete. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   He uses his feet to keep plays alive.   He can scramble and throw it or he can just scramble and make plays with his feet.   He's the leader of his team like Mariota.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't know we have anything to prove.   I don't think we feel that way.   We're just going out there and playing.   We're not really thinking about the outside factors.   We're thinking about going out and playing, having fun, competing. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We do team activities, anything they have planned for us.   We're a close team anyway.   So we're always going to have fun with each other, joking, having fun, no matter if we're just sitting down. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Oh, it was amazing.   I just remember taking pictures and everything like that. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   They are really fast.   They know how to get open, they run good routes.   And when Mariota scrambles, they keep plays alive, definitely. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   They're not the biggest group.   They may be the fastest.   We're not sure.   Other teams have pretty fast teams.   They do stuff a little bit different. 

Q.   Do you like the challenge?
JALEN RAMSEY:   Uh‑huh, definitely. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like it's just the tempo.   It's just the tempo.   The tempo. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   You know, just going to execute the plays coach calls.   Whether I can make the plays or not, it's just ‑‑ opportunities come.   And I'll just be ready for them.   I'm preparing myself well in practices.   I believe in the coach, he's going to call great plays.   I'm not focused on myself being the hero of the game.   I'm just going to do my job.   The plays will come. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   He's been doing great the whole time he's been playing Mariota.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   You know, when Mariota scrambles, you have to stay on your receiver, you can't try to run that.   Because that's one thing he does well is when he scrambles, he likes to throw the ball.   He doesn't just scramble and look automatically at the line.   That's going to be a key thing. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   It's going to be ‑‑ going to be a huge challenge.   Their tempo is huge.   It's a huge thing.   We're going to have to get back to the ball and match their tempo or beat them back to the ball, just be physical and do our job.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   That's definitely with our conditioning.   With Oregon we feel it's faster.   We've been doing extra conditioning, doing what we have to do to be ready.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We don't focus on that, we focus on guarding our man or being in the zone.   The ball comes to us and we're going to see the opportunities.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   You definitely can, but I don't feel like our defense will.   I feel like we'll stick together, trust each other, everybody is going to do their job and we'll be fine. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   No, you don't.   You can run your plays.

Q.   (Inaudible.)   Is this the best offense you've seen?
JALEN RAMSEY:   They're a very good offense.   I don't know if they're the best.   I don't know.   I don't think like that.   They're a very good offense. 
We're going to have a challenge.   We'll accept the challenge and we're ready for it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like he's very smart.   He's a great leader of their team.   He can make plays no matter what.   He's a great athlete, as well as a great quarterback.   We're going to have to do our job as a whole on the defense.   We'll stay disciplined and do what we have to do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   No, I'm just going to go out there, execute the plays coach calls, do what I have to do.   If the plays come to me, like maybe in the Miami game, that will be great.   Otherwise somebody else on the team will make them.   That's fine. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   No, we don't really listen to the outside press, honestly.   When we're together we don't listen to all that.   We know our winning streak.   You never get bored with winning, so we're happy.   That's all that matters.   We're going to keep doing what we have to do.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't feel any different, just continue to go out there and play, do what we have to do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Jameis?   How great of a leader he is.   How he can just make plays, how he ‑‑ it's like I've never seen it in my life before.   How he can look us off and squeeze balls into tight windows, make plays, keep plays alive by running and throwing it down field, arm strength.   Really, everything about Jameis is impressive. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely watched tape.   We learned from that Arizona, they match their tempo, they got back to the ball, they executed their plays.   I feel like if we do that, we'll have a good chance, as well. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I think so.   I don't really know what people think, honestly.   But I think they think about that, too. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   It will be totally different.   But that's not the case, so we can't really have those what‑if's.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   No, we're the best team in the nation.   We haven't lost.   Everybody is going to give us their A game.   That's what people don't really understand.   Everybody comes to Florida State with their A game.   They expect this team to be the same as last year's team, and blow everybody out.   But that's not the case.   We just keep fighting until the end and a win is a win. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't really know.   That's not up to us.   That was the committee's decision.   We're just happy to be in the playoff game and ready to play. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I think he's a good player, very versatile, very dynamic.   They can still line him up in the back field, motion him out to receiver, he can line up at receiver, motion in the back field.   He can do a lot of different things.   He's a good player. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I think he's very good.   I think all their receivers are very good, how they get open.   And of course, they all have speed. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely makes it tough to defend.   I feel like our secondary is very good, too.   I don't think they've played with someone with as much speed as us, we're bigger and more physical.   We're ready for the challenge. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I definitely am.   We're in the college football playoffs.   We're happy to have the opportunity to go out and play and compete and have fun. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)   What do you focus on on the offense? 
JALEN RAMSEY:   Like you said, it will be so many things.   We can't focus on one thing.   We have to do our job every play, stay disciplined, do what we have to do, we can't focus on one thing. 

Q.   What have you seen from Mariota on film?
JALEN RAMSEY:   The way he leads his team.   The way the receivers will run their routes hard for him, get open.   The way he keeps the plays alive.   It's all good.   I don't really know how to say it.   He's a great leader of his team. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We're going to focus on doing our job.   Whatever the coach throws at us, we're going to go out there and execute them, try to be disciplined in our coverages and rush lanes, whatever we have to do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We try to feed off the offense and they try to feed off us.   We try to go together as a whole team.   If we're out there on defense, we feel like anybody can step it up at any time of the game.   We just go out there and we contain the play until we have it down pat.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like they're both great leaders of the offense.   They're going to keep plays alive with their feet.   They can throw away on the scramble.   They can make first downs.   Get huge runs with their feet, as well.   The way their offense rallies around them, I think it's really good, really good leaders. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   If my opinion, Jameis Winston is the best quarterback in the nation, but like I said, Mariota has very great values.   He's a great athlete, as well as a quarterback.   He's going to give us a challenge. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely, but we don't think about all that.   We try to come out and continue to do what we have to do for the team. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't know, we don't really think about that, we don't listen to the outside world about that.   We don't feel like that.   We don't understand that, so we're not going to feed into that. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Like I said, we don't really know what people are thinking outside in the world.   We're going to go out and do what we have to do, like we do every game. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely, Clemson, last year's Auburn team.   Very similar to how up‑tempo they are. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like every aspect of the offense is pretty good, running, passing.   Everyone wants to talk about Mariota, how he can keep plays alive by scrambling and throwing it.   I feel like every aspect of the offense.   We can't focus on everything.   We have to be sound on everything that we do. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't know.   I don't really think about that.   I'm just going to go out there ‑‑ oh, definitely, I'm up for anything.   But I'm not really thinking about that.   I'm just going to go out and play, do my job, do what I can do for the team out there.   I'm not trying to go out and be a hero or superstar.   If opportunities come, I'll seize it.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Clemson this year, and last year's Auburn in the Championship game.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like we have to stay sound in every aspect of our game.   We have to execute the plays coach calls.   We have to stay disciplined.   We have to contain Mariota.   Stay on our coverages maybe a little bit longer. 
We just have to do what we have to do, and trust each other to be able to go out there and just compete and have fun and play. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely.   I feel like I guess the world is ready for that.   We're not really thinking about that, like you said.   I'm just focused on what I have to do with my job.   I feel like that's going to be a huge thing for people to see on TV. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Definitely we do.   We have a challenge, but we're not going to shy away from it, we're going to seek it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I feel like they're very good.   They play together.   Their receivers work for Marcus.   He's a good leader of that whole offense and can make plays. 
We're going to have to be disciplined and do our assignments with the right technique and we'll be good. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We're going to go out and execute the plays and play like we know how to play at Florida State.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   I'm not sure, honestly.   We have people come in and talk to us sometimes, speakers that we have to motivate us.   But we don't really think about anything outside of football when we're in football.   I don't really know, to be honest. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Marcus Lattimore, he came and spoke to us.   We've had a lot of good speakers.   But he's definitely one who's came out. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   Because the way that he didn't give up, fought to the end and was the lone survivor.   That's way bigger than football right there.   So that's huge. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   We trust each other.   We love each other.   We're going to keep fighting for each other until the end.   We don't feel like we're out of anything.   We're just going to stay with each other to the end. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JALEN RAMSEY:   It's the truth.   You'll hear it over and over again, because it's the truth.   We're going to keep saying it.   That's what we do.   We love each other.   We feel like brothers on the team.   We trust each other that everybody is going to go out there and do their job.   We believe in each other.   We always believe we're going to win.   So you're always going to hear that. 

Q.   What do you think is the identity of this team?
JALEN RAMSEY:   I don't know, to be honest.   I feel like we just go out there and we do what we have to do at the end of the day. 

Q.   Some people like being an underdog because you're able to come from behind and nobody sees you coming. 
JALEN RAMSEY:   Yeah, we don't really understand the underdog role or the villain role.   I don't know, we just are going to go out there and continue to do what we always do, just play and compete and have fun.
