<p>	Q.  On the new record, the new career receiving record for Ohio State, tell me what that means to you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, sometimes before big games, players dream of having a big game?   Did you think about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Craig, was it a different type of play book today?  We saw some plays today we hadn't seen all season, particularly early on, you opened it up a little more than you had all year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Will and Tim, it seemed like (inaudible) was frustrated did you feel that way? </p>

<p>	Q.  What were those last few minutes like out there?  Is it appropriate for you guys to go out in a game like this? </p>

<p>	Q.  How important was it to change the momentum of the game after they came back 21 down, you come right back and answer on that next drive? </p>
<p>	Q.  At Michigan, you guys obviously had problems wrapping up.  This seems like they broke a lot of tackles.  Tonight that didn't seem to be at all.  You guys were swarming to the ball.  Was that Michigan game in the back of your head, you weren't going to let that happen this time around? </p>

<p>	Q.  What was it like to go out on a night like this? </p>

<p>	Q.  They pulled within 21-14, you get the drive.  Can you talk about that drive, how important it was. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how scoring that first touchdown in special teams helped jump-start the offense.  Seemed to loosen you up a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, if you look at the numbers coming into the game, seemed like somewhat of a mismatch.  Do you feel validated in some sense with the 28 points your offense put up, the things you were able to accomplish tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  How anxious were you like in the last minute and a half?  Did you at all think it was kind of fitting it was going to end that way again? </p>
<p>	Q.  We saw a lot of different things out of your offensive play book today.  How many of your changes that we saw tonight were specific to Kansas State and how many were just your own wrinkles to get your offense a little bit of a different look, jump-start? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell us what the coverage looked like for next year after you look ahead into 2004, not so bare after all, Santonio a great game?  Chris Gamble mentioned to several media outlets that he is going to the NFL afterwards.  Have you had any discussion with them about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did Gamble ever give you a definitive yes or no that he was going or not?  Craig named offensive MVP.  His ability to come back and play well in this game. </p>
