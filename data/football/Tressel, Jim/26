<p>	Q.  Jim, you just beat the team that won 34 in a row.  Do you get a sense how hard it will be to approach the all time record?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, there are people this morning that are calling last night's game the greatest national championship game ever played.  Did your guys get it after it was over they had been a part of something very, very special?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that when you played all those Division 1 1 AA playoffs, when you had even far less time to prepare for Ohio State, how much did that prepare you for this experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, last night you mentioned that the young guys really stepped up.  Can you talk about that in particular Dustin Fox's performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  How hard is it today in sports to create this sort of one-for-all-all-for-one atmosphere you seem to have created and how did you and your staff managed to achieve that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you alluded in your opening remarks about the guys being receptive to what you wanted to do when you explained things to them early on.  Now that they've won a championship, does the dynamic change a bit with players who have had that success and what do you do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ohio State been involved in a lot of very big bowl games.  Can you compare how this Bowl compares to some other major bowl games your program has been involved with over the years?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things that separated this game with others is the double overtime.  Do you like that or would you rather have the NFL format?  One of the games, it was compared with was the Nebraska/Miami game.  Has that been completely taken away?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, congratulations.  Would you talk about how Craig Krenzel wound up getting back to the hotel last night and should he worry about his job security as a result of what happened?  Talk about his overall development as a leader?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, have you had a chance to talk to Michael Doss at all one-on-one?  He made a decision that's not often made these days to come back.  Have you had a chance to talk to him and say anything special to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, does the future look bright for this program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you developed any instant replay opinions since the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Those of us that have seen you all year haven't seen the fake field goal.  I wonder if you could talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you talked about reflection a while ago.  Are there one or two plays from last night that continually stick in your mind right now, plays you think turned the tide?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, fill in your personal timeline for us after the game.  Have you had a chance to sleep at all?  What did you do last night?  Also in returning to Columbus, as I understand it, only one scholarship player will be on the plane.</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do last night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, for those of us that have covered the games at Horseshoe, it seemed like the only thing that changed last night was the temperature.  Was that the biggest home feeling you've ever felt at a Bowl-type atmosphere?</p>
