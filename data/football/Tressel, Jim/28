<p>	Q.  Coach, we've talked a lot through the week, through the season and even this morning about your 1 AA experience.  Is any aspect of this overwhelming to you personally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Of all the match-ups on the field which is the most critical for Ohio State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how big in your opinion is the fan support from back home that's come out here to Arizona to see the team play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, it was asked earlier if this experience overwhelms you.  Is there anything that overwhelms you or are you right where you want to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little while ago Larry compared Willis to Barry Sanders.  Is there anyone Maurice reminds you of and if you could talk about the two running backs, their styles, how they're different, how they're the same?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Tressel, when you went to watch Miami's practice I know you said they ran about three plays and you watched how they worked.  What did you learn and what did Coach Coker want to know from you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, at one point or another you've trailed in your last six games.  I'm wondering if Miami gets the jump on you that you're confident that your players would stay the course because of those past experiences?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you have had some distractions all along the way; a couple this week as well.  Are you confident in your team's mindset and that everybody is on the same page going in here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how do you control a team that averages 41 points a game or manage the game; and the second question, have you used the word "underdog" at all this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  With so much light being shed on the Clarett-versus-McGahee match-up, you being a former quarterback can you talk about the mentality that Krenzel needs to have in this championship game?  How do you think he'll handle that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously this is the most talented team you've played this year.  Was there any team that was useful in preparing for this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Miami had a couple of close calls this year; does that give you confidence that this team is beatable?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, you appear to be a very even-keeled guy.  What do you think it will take to get you outwardly excited and do you think that will happen when you take the field tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, the last time we saw you and Maurice obviously we were talking a great deal about the passing of his friend and how the university handled that.  Have you spoken with him and where do you think his mind is today now with regard to both of those issues?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about with the university though?  He was pretty upset with the way the university handled it.</p>
<p>	Q.  They say Miami might have an advantage having been here before; how do you talk to the players in the next 24 hours?</p>
<p>	Q.  What other schools did you visit in the spring and was Miami clearly better in terms of preparation and the things you were talking about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since the season ended have there been any changes starting line-upwise this last month; and number two, the guy asked you a while ago about match-ups.  Is there one match-up that concerns you where it looks like Miami might have an edge?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are the preparations for this game compared to the 1 AA Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you've seen Maurice before this season.  He's always played well.  Are you confident he'll be able to do this and  are you staying in the same hotel tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess just following up on the 1 AA thing:  Would you support a playoff system or could you fathom playing  Miami one week and Oklahoma the next, how difficult that would be?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you have an unbelievable amount of support, not only in the State of Ohio but here.  What would be the message that you have for the fans and all the people watching out there; what would be the coach's message to the fans?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, was there a feeling of pressure for you beating Michigan and to finish it, and out here you hope the team doesn't feel that pressure they did maybe in November?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jim, it seems at Youngstown State your philosophy with quarterbacks was we want them not to win the game for us but also not to lose it.  Is that still your philosophy and where do you think Krenzel fits that profile?</p>
