RICE   33
  AIR FORCE - 14

COACH CALHOUN:   First of all, we want to thank again the people here at the Armed Forces Bowl, Brant, and everybody that's involved, certainly the City of Fort Worth and John and the people at Bell Helicopter.   It's been quite an experience for the guys throughout the week. 
It's not the way we wanted it to end and when you have guys that care and you have guys that have an awful lot of pride, we wanted it to conclude with a different result.   The difference in the game was clearly in the second half.   Stating the obvious there.   They really took control in the second half of all three phases and thought their offense did a super job. 
Defense, I thought they were absolutely sensational in the second half and when you don't make first downs, you don't score points, you're going to have a hard time winning games, and special teams part of it, too. 

Q.   How did the change of quarterback at Rice affect the game?
COACH CALHOUN:   There was some things that we knew at half‑time they were probably going to take a little different approach.   He played really, really well.   Even before the half when we came up with the stop, I thought did a heck of a job on that drive, too.   They are going to have two good quarterbacks next year. 
Probably changed a little bit of the balance in the way that they operate.   There were times today where I thought they got some big bodies on some small bodies and we just didn't get some creases, and got to find ways to get underneath and spread their bodies, so both ways.   I thought there were times when the bigger guys on the defensive line really, some times where they overwhelmed us on the offensive line, too. 

Q.   Thought process on the change of quarterbacks in the second quarter. 
COACH CALHOUN:   Well, we came into the game expecting both guys to play at quarterback.   It was something that we didn't know how‑‑ you're going to adjust as you move along and I thought Kale did a solid job in the second quarter.   But the second half, every single spot, we didn't play at the level that you have to play. 

Q.   Talk about the difference between the two quarterbacks for Rice. 
AUSTIN NIKLAS:   They are both pretty good quarterbacks.   We have seen both quarterbacks get playing time, anyways.   We knew that with the zone read, going to pick and up and run.   It was not much of a change. 

Q.   Austin, thoughts on Rice's wildcat? 
AUSTIN NIKLAS:   Yeah, we practiced during the week and we knew it was going to be more like a wildcat situation type deal.   We had plays for that and just came down to execution.   Putting bigger guys on our guys‑‑ you know, we stopped them a few times. 

Q.   Talk about Air Force's pass rush today.
COACH CALHOUN:   No question, he made some very big plays, with their passing game, you just‑‑ I mean, I thought there were balls that should be contested balls that they did a good job of coming down with.   When they put the ball in a pretty decent spot for us, just develop more confidence, you realize you can flip your hips and play the ball.   That's something that you have to do. 

Q.   Did the change have anything to do with it‑‑
COACH CALHOUN:   I think based upon coverage, we tried to change the coverage up, sometimes roll the safety over the top, double cover the guy.   They double‑call and look back to the side and recall a play. 
We have a guy that's deep, he's in a position, he ought to be able to play the deep ball.   He didn't play it well.   That's a pretty good‑sized target.   Quarterback put the ball, just in terms of ball placement, give the receiver a chance to make the plays, too.   Contested balls you have to win both ways. 

Q.   Regarding game plan and changes and adjustments during the game. 
COACH CALHOUN:   That was part of our game plan coming in, and yet when it doesn't come to fruition, I think for everyone coaching, you go back and look at what we did.

Q.   Regarding Air Force's performance over the final part of the season. 
COACH CALHOUN:   I think that's a fair question.   We struggled in the second half today.   There's no way to know no game like this‑‑ playing well in one quarter, it's much more than that.   And I think you can look at all facets.   There's not just one spot where that's the case.   There are plays that we just absolutely have to do.
We have to increase our size.   I thought there were times today where there was one block against the one defender‑‑ and that play happened on both sides.   I think when you see that on the field, just the mass difference, I think that's one thing that really, really we've got to come up with a way to change that part, the way we operate.   I think where that really helps you, I think it will help you later in the season, certainly in a contest like this, too. 
We have to gain‑‑ we have to increase the mass.   Just have to.   I think what ends up happening sometimes is all of a sudden, maybe you know, when you do get where objects collide, you start going in other directions instead of really, really tricking true to you know what has a chance for execution. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
COACH CALHOUN:   Somewhat, there were games we didn't, though, too. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
COACH CALHOUN:   I wouldn't say there were no surprises.   I think since we saw it happen, the fumble, the starter went out, there were some adjustments that we were going to have to make.   And just team‑wise, we probably didn't do enough to help our defense.   I thought we put on awful lot of strain on our defense today, an enormous amount of strain on our defense.   A couple of times it involved field position. 
The other part is just the lack of first downs.   I think any time you only make 12 first downs and any time you play a second half and only make three first downs or four first downs in the second half, our defense didn't do a good enough job on third downs either.   Any time the punt has 23 downs, there's some duration‑‑ huge series. 

Q.   Kale, at what point did you know you were coming into the game? 
KALE PEARSON:   I kind of knew‑‑ just tried to run the offense. 

Q.   Alex, talk about the defense today. 
ALEX MEANS:   Combination of our secondary‑‑ like coach was saying, we don't have a lot of size there.   We have corners there that are 5‑8.   They have a lot bigger size on the edge and our pass rushing‑‑ offensive line probably didn't do that great in the first half against us. 

Q.   Did that determine the outcome of the game? 
ALEX MEANS:   I think we got the pressure, we got a little bit of good pressure in the second half at times, but overall, I don't think we did enough up front for the D‑Line.   But you've got to give credit to those wide receivers. 

Q.   Talk about the quarterback change for Rice and the difference it made in the game. 
ALEX MEANS:   We've had a month to prepare to receive seen both quarterbacks on film.   We knew their starter was a little bit hurt so we knew the possibility if he went down, No.6 would come in.   They can both pull stuff up and move.   I wouldn't say we expected it but we were prepared I would say the best we could be.   I would say he played a pretty good game. 
He stepped up in the pocket well and he made some more pass rush attempts, and made some throws and created great pressure to back it up. 

Q.   Connor, Air Force's offense over the last half of the season? 
CONNOR DIETZ:   Not been a lot of execution from everybody on the offense, also, pretty good defense to handle different teams‑‑ contribution to everything.

Q.   Talk about being in the rhythm with the changes at the quarterback position during the game. 
KALE PEARSON:   I think sometimes‑‑ by and large‑‑ inaudible. 

Q.   Connor, talk about Rice's run defense. 
CONNOR DIETZ:   Obviously give credit to them.
