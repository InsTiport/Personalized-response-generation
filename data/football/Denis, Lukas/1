 Q.  Just talk about the honor winning the McGillis award.  What's it mean to you?  
LUKAS DENIS: It's such a special moment to be in that spot and just to be able to represent McGillis and his family.  You hear this story all the time and what a guy he was and a BC man and the things he was able to do for his team and the way they felt about him, that just speaks a lot, and it's just very heartwarming to know that I was chosen to represent and honor his family.   
 Q.  What's it like to be part of that fraternity now, a pretty select group, some NFL guys on that list.  What's it like for you?  
LUKAS DENIS: Yeah, it's amazing.  There's a lot of great guys on there.  We have John Johnson, Isaac Yiadom, Justin Simmons, it's just great to be a part of that group and to be able to go out there every game and represent for those guys.   
 Q.  How did spring practice go overall and are you happy with where the team's at?  
LUKAS DENIS: I would say it went very well.  It was very productive.  We got a lot done.  We worked on a lot of new offense and defense, which will be great and we've got a lot of the young guys to see the field more and they will be a lot more productive when the season comes around.
