<p>	Q.  Kyle, were they more physical than maybe you expected? </p>
<p>	Q.  For both of you guys, a lot of games this year there have been penalties, turnovers, those kind of mistakes.  Was this just a team that was too good to do that against, to get away with it? </p>

<p>	Q.  Kyle, how shocking was it to be down 14-0 right off and then give up as many points as you did at the end? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did the running backs wear the defense down, also the lack of rushing yards from LSU? </p>

<p>	Q.  Kyle, I know you're considered one of the real leaders of this team.  How much did you miss Jessie? </p>

<p>	Q.  Andrew, can you just discuss the struggles you guys had mounting a rushing game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kyle, you have any idea what Bowl you might go to?  Have you heard any of that?  I know you hadn't focused on it. </p>
<p>	Q.  For both of you, I guess along those lines, it's going to be a long three weeks until you actually do play that Bowl game.  Talk about letting this one sit in and soak in and moving on. </p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, it appeared the two long touchdowns early were blown coverages.  What was supposed to happen on those two plays? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, neither one of your lines, offense nor defense, really had their best game tonight.  You said you weren't expecting that.  Were they just out-toughed, physical? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you just talk about your thinking and Skip's thinking of flying to Dallas to talk to the Cotton Bowl people Thursday. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the performance Georgia had.  Was that you all or was that more of them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, couple of questions.  After your first season in the SEC, how do you evaluate it against what you were expecting?  And, second, what is the extent of Russell's injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  How disappointed will you be if you don't get to go to that Cotton Bowl? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned JaMarcus.  Could you just tell us about the other injuries sustained in the game, what you would know about them. </p>
