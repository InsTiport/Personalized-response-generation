Q. How satisfying was it to get the final win for the seniors on Senior Night?
CARSON BAKER: For guys like this who put everything in this program, done everything for this team, you know, we did it for them. The guys, the defense played terrific tonight. Seniors on the defense played really well, so just wanted to get -- ultimate goal is to get a win for them so felt really good.
