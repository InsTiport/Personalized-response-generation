<p>	Q.  Dennis, I have heard it said that you, perhaps kiddingly, said that one of your best -- perhaps your best play is to call a pass and have it covered.  Can you expand on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dennis, if I am not mistaken, you all, as coaches, rated Reggie the most improved player in the spring. </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the basis?  How did he improve?  What were you all basing that on? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your ability to turn programs around, where are you with your own schedule?  I mean, did you have something in mind where you would be at this stage and are you at that time at that point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Dennis, from what you have seen, did you feel like you have seen enough improvement or enough progress in the offensive line and at the corners to be able to make that statement? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you talk about the running game, what was the area that needs improvement most, running game, to get those third and ones, fourth and ones? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back on it, was there any hangover (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in terms of cornerback play, you have some young guys coming in, more pressure on your linebacker, (inaudible) as a whole maybe coming together more than having happened the first two years? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Jaxson and/or Archie, what is it we're hearing so much about the coach sounds so high on Danny Gorrer, what is it that you all see in him that makes him this player that they think can make such an impact? </p>
