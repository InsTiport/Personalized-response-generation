<p>	Q.  When you guys had that 4th and 1, deep in the territory on the last drive, what was the conversation like in the huddle during the time out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yemi, talking about the first three quarters, Baylor's defense you weren't able to rush the ball, do much.  What was Baylor's defense doing that confused you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  First year player, at any time did you feel frustration out there with the offense and things not working?  Did you ever feel frustrated?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yemi, you guys on the offense just have a feeling in the back of your mind that Reggie's just going to make a play.  Sooner or later he's going to do it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were your able to see Chad's catch and did you kind of catch your breath when he brought it in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Todd, I guess it's just getting to be old hat for you kicking field goals getting into overtime or in overtime.  Have you drawn on -- did you draw on anything today when you're lining up for what should be a chip shot, but with everything riding on it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now, that we talked about the good, what about the miss?  Anything -- was the snap low and did Chad have trouble getting it up exactly how you wanted on their first field goal?</p>
<p>	Q.  All right.  Thanks, Todd. Chad, will you just tell us about that last catch you made that kept the game -- kept you on possession of the ball.  It looked like the defensive back almost knocked it out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie can you describe that catch from your perspective?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, what did Baylor's defense do those first three quarters to seemingly frustrate you guys and keep you guys from moving the football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, at Clemson, you had a little off-day passing, came back, hit Chad Schroeder, 31-yard touchdown, took the lead.  Today, I don't know what your numbers were, but I don't see how you could spin on this positive.  You run for, I don't know, 40 yards, drop the ball mid field.  The crowd is going crazy.  You end up leading the Aggies back.  Is this a something for you, learning how to maybe bounce back from a bad performance early, and then lead a team to a victory?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever done this before Texas A&amp;M, have you ever played as bad as you played in the first half and as good as you played in the last two drives?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, can you talk what was going on through your mind in that final drive in the 4th quarter?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, can you talk about, you know, all week long we heard about the trash talk from them, from Baylor, and it looked like early on there was still quite a bit of talking going on on the field.  Was there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Courtney, take us to the last play and when and at what point did you know you were going to make the end zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chad, when that ball bounces off your chest, I mean, does your life flash before your eyes?  Could you take us right through that moment, what thoughts go through your head at that time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chad, how much does this team believe in Reggie?</p>
<p>	Q.  Courtney, what do you think the problems were running the ball in the first three quarters, and then getting the big play at the end, wide open, you run in for a touchdown?  What happened different at the end of the game and early in the game running the football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, before you went out to the field with four minutes left in the fourth quarter, when it was 4th and 1, what did Coach Franchione say to you before you ran out on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, can you kind of talk about (indiscernible) into overtime, the ball getting into (indiscernible).  This one you go into overtime again, were you thinking, "Here we go again."</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, you mentioned the game was fun kind of talking back and forth.  More tense than fun?  I mean, you guys, obviously struggling a little on offense, but did you feel like the fans kind of cheered in jest a little bit when you got that one first down in the third.  What did that feel like?  Did you just kind of keep the faith, I guess? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, you said on that 4th and 1 you had to talk Coach Franchione into that.  Did you really have to twist his arm?  Were you really going to punt or was that something up for discussion?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, it seemed like late in the second quarter and most of the second half, you and Coach Fran were talking quite a bit on how to get things clicking.  What went on in those discussions? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, during the week you guys talked about being (indiscernible) for the defense, but it can't just be the offense.  Defense has to keep the other team from scoring to give you guys a chance.  I know they gave up a lot of yards, but can you talk about them keeping Baylor off the scoreboard and keeping you guys in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, kind of evaluate Reggie's play in the first half and then in the second half and specifically what he did for you all those last couple of drives. </p>
<p>	Q.  He did take a beating early, but he looked pretty fast and strong on the 40-yard run.  If anybody did have questions about his toughness, what do you think he showed them today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you thought this week about the nightmare for a full year and reliving that.  Did that cross your mind at all in the 4th quarter when they took the lead?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that said, Jason how demoralizing or how whatever way you want to put it would it have been to have gone another year carrying around that weight having lost to Baylor again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you hurt in overtime, were you hurt or?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, the way the rotation went. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, you mentioned with all the talking going on during the week.  After the game I saw Dominique Zeigler over there talking to a lot of you guys.  I saw him talking to you, and I saw you put your hand to your lips.  What did you tell him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have to bust down one of your good motivational speeches for Coach Franchione to tell him to go for it on that 4th and 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, you've been known for some of your halftime speeches.  Didn't seem like you waited till the half.  It seemed like sometimes in the second quarter you started jawing on them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Pierre Brown, young guy making a big catch and what that shows for him. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, do you all feel lucky to have won this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Oh, go ahead.</p>
<p>	Q.  (No microphone)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Red, can you tell us a little bit about what was different about this game?  Seemed like you had a lot more pressure, you were able to keep them out of the end zone a lot, make a lot of plays.  What was different for the defense today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Red, what did you tell the team at halftime?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned something about an IV.  Did you have dehydration problems?</p>
<p>	Q.  Archie, I know you guys obviously respect Baylor, but back-to-back games like this, does this kind of make you guys look at them a little bit different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Archie, tell us what you feel like the defense showed, maybe not just the people in the stands and the media and the fans, but what you showed yourselves today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Red, could you speak to Jackson's tackle in overtime that Baylor ran a reverse, you kind of lifted the guy up on the sidelines there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your defense and the way you guys -- Baylor moved the ball on you guys.  When you got down there toward the end zone, you were able to either come up with a fumble, were you able to deny or something.  You guys always came up with some way to turn them around. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, can you take us through the decision on 4th and 1, take the timeout, putting team goes out first.  Take us through that decision.  Obviously it was pretty big. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, talk about Reggie McNeal's toughness in relation to specifically him carrying the ball.  He took a pounding early, but I think you could argue he won the game with his running late in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, did you wipe your brow when Chad, the ball bounced off his chest but he had the composure to gather it back in?</p>
<p>	Q.  After a game like this, can you express the emotions coming through a game like this, especially coming off that loss last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  We didn't see a post-game handshake.  I'm wondering about the rivalry that these two teams have kind of built up in the last couple years now. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about back on your own six, you had to go through, you had to go 94 yards.  You had a couple of 4th downs you had to convert, just what that said about your team to have to go through that to at least send it to overtime?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about sticking with the option, the running game, even though Baylor was containing it pretty well early on.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you and Dominique Zeigler and several others Aggie players had what looked like a warm exchange with the Baylor wide receiver.  Can you describe your exchange with him after the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, were you anticipating the way things were working out that that play that you called to win the game, that you would be able to pop it on that or is that something you got a good break on or something?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, do you all feel lucky to win this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Baylor ran a reverse there in overtime and Jackson made a nice tackle.  He's a tough guy, went down and then came back into the game.  Could you speak to that tackle in particular on that reverse?</p>
