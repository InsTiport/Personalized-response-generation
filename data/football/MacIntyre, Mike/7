Colorado - 10, Stanford - 5
Q. Welcome to the fight, beating Stanford for the first time since 1990.  How did you pull this one out?
MIKE MACINTYRE: I don't know.  I'll tell you what, we did exactly what you just said.  Our kids have been through so much blankety-blank that they just believed, and the way they fight, the way they keep fighting, and we were down to our fourth kicker.  We just keep working and everything, and I am so proud of these guys.  We are so blessed to be at Colorado, and I want to thank the 7:44 in the a.m. prayer group.  Thank you very much.
