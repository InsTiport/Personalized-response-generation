<p>	Q.   Coach, you tell a story when you first one your 1 AA Championship, they asked you can you repeat it.  Ou said, "I'm going to keep the tradition alive."</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, can you talk about the two fourth down plays in the first overtime and how key those were and the plays you had called there?</p>
<p>	Q.   Can you talk about Krenzel outplaying a Heisman finalist?</p>
<p>	Q.   This is for Michael.  All week long you heard about Miami's speed and talent.  How much did that eat at you guys.  How much did you use it as a motivational type of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, 14-and-0 is unprecedented. I would like you to comment on that.  At the beginning of the year you mentioned a long season was what you liked.  Do you still feel that?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, how much of a difference did your crowd make tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, are you going to get the cornrows now?</p>
<p>	Q.   This one's for Mike.  Mike, you say you were coming back this year to match your high school championship with a national championship.  Mission accomplished.  How does it feel?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, you talked in one of the earlier press conferences about not showing much emotion.  Have you let it go?  Did you let go a little bit in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.   You guys topped yourselves in the two fourth-down passes, Craig, in overtime.  Can you talk about those. </p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, there were a lot of people who said Ohio State didn't have a shot of winning this game before it was played.  What did you have to do to keep that from affecting your players' attitudes?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, you talked about six weeks ago breaking down films and trying to winnow down 150 plays.  When did you really start to know that you matched up really well with these guys?</p>
<p>	Q.   Donnie, we'll give you this one.  You played in a lot of close games down the stretch.  Did that experience help you at all tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.   Coach, on the fourth down play in the first overtime with the late flag, did you think the game was over?</p>
<p>	Q.   Maurice Clarett had two touchdowns and stripped and recovered a fumble.  What did he say to you?</p>
<p>	Q.   Can each of you talk about how they will celebrate the win?</p>


<p>	Q.   Michael and Donnie, defensively you guys got three great takeaways that led to 17 points. Can you talk about the defensive play that set the tone for the first half and got you in a position to win this game?</p>
<p>	Q.   Michael, you wanted to play Miami because you started your career against Miami.  You said we'll see how the final chapter is written.  Can you talk about that?  Coach, two years, did you have a timetable?  Are you ahead of schedule more so by what you thought you would be?</p>

<p>	Q.   For Donnie and Mike, in the final defensive state with what was going on on the field, what was being said in the huddle or was it business as usual?</p>

<p>	Q.   For Michael and Craig, I can see even as this thing moves along, I can see the thing sinking in.  Talk about the magnitude of what you guys have just done. </p>
