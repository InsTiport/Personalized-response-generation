Connecticut - 0, Boston College - 30
Q. John was in earlier and said their quarterback was playing with a short package.  Is that what happened on that interception, you had an idea where that ball was going?
MATT MILANO: Yeah, we had been working on it all week.  I just saw the formation and kind of knew what he was going to throw so I stepped right in front of him.
Q. You and Harold and Strachan pretty much terrorized the quarterback all game.  What do you think was different in this game allowing extra pressure than perhaps other games?
MATT MILANO: I'm not sure what the actual reason was, but I just know that all week in practice, we were frying around, working on that, ^  working on making the quarterback throw under pressure and not letting him sit back there and pick us apart.
I think the preparation we put in during the week that, really helped us out this game.
Q. You were one of the last recruits of Spaziani and now there's talk of you getting drafted in your senior year.  Did you expect to be a guy who NFL guys --
MATT MILANO: I'm not really too focused on that right now.  I'm just focused on my team and doing whatever we have to do to get to a Bowl game.  Whatever happens, happens.  But as of right now, I'm just focused on the BC football team and doing whatever we need to to get a win.
Q. That interception, what is that moment like for you on senior day, to be able to find the end zone?
MATT MILANO: Definitely a big moment.  That was my first interception.  It was great.  It was a great feeling ask to return it for a touchdown was just icing on the cake.
