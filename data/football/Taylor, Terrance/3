   THE MODERATOR: We have defensive tackle Terrance Taylor. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: Yeah, probably is. You know, just by how the season is going, we know there's a lot of things we can improve on, but we know it's going to take time, just the little things. It's something as a team you have to, like you said, get off the mat, step up to the challenge. That's what we're ready to go when we go over to Penn State. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: Just a lot of experience on the team from last year, switching over from last year to the beginning of the season, you know, we draw up on that. We try to tell the young guys that it will get better, keep your head up, a lot of things will be said, a lot of things will happen in the period of time from last week's game. 
 So right now, you know, we're just moving on, Penn State. We did that yesterday. We started watching film on them. Just letting everyone know the game's over with. Can't do anything about it. Time to move on, so... 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah. Just to show that, you know -- a lot of people have been in situations like this. The guys that were here last year, you know, have been through something similar. Just, you know, to go to practice and to push everyone else, let them know we still are a team, that we have to stick together because we all we got. Just to move on, go into Penn State with attitude. 
 If we dwell on Toledo, then Penn State is going to be a long day. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: Both of 'em, so... Both of 'em. Every loss is bad. 

 Q. (Question regarding captains.) 
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: It depends on how you look at it. Me personally, I was never a captain in high school. People looked to me to give advice, stuff like that. To have everyone have an opportunity to step up to speak what's on their heart, lead the team, I think it's pretty good. Sometimes you're used to having a certain captain that is going to be there, you know that's my captain. But it doesn't really matter to me who's the captain, as long as people are on the same page. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, not really fight it, but we know we have a young offense. We know the things we need to do. We made mistakes, too. Those are the things we need to work on to make them better. Because when we go out there, we play better, they play better. 
 We know going into Penn State we have to get the defense down that we're going to run, fix the mistakes that we made at Toledo, going there, having one of our best games, maybe the best game, because it's not easy. We went 11-2, we had a hard time out there. 
 Going out there is going to be tough. We have to step up and lead, especially on the D line. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: He's not going to yell at you. He's going to tell you the way it is, try to get you on track. You know, I mean, he'll let you know what's going on, let you know you need to fix it. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: No, no. Just ready to move on, to get everybody on the same page, you know, because after a game like that, you can have people falling off, straying away from the team, starting to point fingers. So just the whole meeting was about us sticking together and moving on past the game, learning from it, and not getting off the mat. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: As a team or defense? 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: I mean, I'm pretty sure everyone's angry. As a defense, we're really angry. You know, just frustrated that we're not doing the things we need to do. We want to make a high number of sacks and tackles, plays, touchdowns. We're frustrated more than angry. 
 I think, you know, after this week's practice, Penn State, I know the offense is frustrated, too. You got a lot of guys over there that's not doing what they know they can do. You got a lot of guys on defense not doing what they know they can do. 
 As a team, just real frustrated, but in a way where we want to get better, not kind of negative frustration where we can't do this, we can't do that. We've got to go into the week of practice and just work on those things, just take our frustrations out on Saturday. 

 Q. (Indiscernible)
 TERRANCE TAYLOR: From what I saw, it's a pretty good offense. They've got good offensive linemen, some of the guys I faced last year. A new quarterback that can run, has a nice arm. They got a pretty good offense. They can move the ball. 
 We know they're going to have some big plays on Saturday, know a lot of things can happen at their house. But we'll be ready. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
