 Q.  You were born here right?  
TOSH LUPOI: Born and raised.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We just got in last night.  Always good to be home.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yes, the majority of my whole family lives out here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: My whole family lives out here.  Yes they all live out here -- my brother lives in Southern California and my parents live right down the street there from De La Salle.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: A lot.  Too many!   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, it's a phenomenal area, so no, I wasn't surprised.  I think it's a great place to host a great game.   
 Q.  You played at Cal.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, I think it's a great area with a lot of things to do and a lot of professional organizations and great colleges around as well, so the fan base, because of that reason can get dispersed in a couple of different directions, but that doesn't mean they don't have passion and love for the game.  It's a great environment, great place, surrounded with great people.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: No.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: He's a great player.  You know, he's advantaged.  Being a young man, as a freshman.  He's obviously been coached very well.  He's confident in his reads and where to distribute the ball, you know, based off of the looks you give him.   
We know he's a great player and they're playing in this game for a reason.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: You know, it's tough to do comparisons.  I don't really like to do that.  Try to study his demeanor, his mannerisms, and what he's looking at and why he's making the decisions that he's making, and it's obvious that he's advanced as far as making clear decisions.  So it will be an exciting challenge for us.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, I think fortunately in Alabama, about every single game is on national TV and I think individuals are able to see us, you know, consistently, but, of course, there happens to be and always will be some young men that we may be recruiting in this area, in this state so, of course, having it here, front and center makes it exciting for them to -- I don't know if anybody will be there in person to see it but when it comes to Alabama football I think the fact that we're on national TV so consistently, you're obviously in front and center in the living room or in person with a lot of these young men.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I think it comes down to more so what the individual's long-term goals are and how important, whether it's getting their degree, playing at the highest stage of college football, competing for a national title, possibly competing at the next level.  It's more so where those priorities stand with each individual, you know, because it's not for everybody.  So when a young man really declares those things first and foremost, starting with the education and the other things that I mentioned, that's the type of young man that will come out and want to compete at this level.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: The mood?  I don't think there is a difference of a mood.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, they're different players.  Bryant was a great player and Trevor is a great player.  Clemson is a great team where you can't focus and hone in on one individual and try to stop somebody, if you do that you're going to get hurt in other ways.  They've got a great tailback in No. 9, they distribute the ball really will from 8, 5, 13, No. 3, No. 10, do a lot of different things with those young men.  Got some great players at the tight end position, at No. 80 and 44 and of course the other tail backs, 26, 28 and a veteran offensive line.  If you hone in and try to target one individual then the balls gonna get distributed in different ways and it's going to hurt you.  You can't just absolutely manipulate your system to do that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Xavier?  I would say the mental aspect of the game and his commitment off the field.  Xavier is somebody that impresses me of his hunger to get better.  The mental aspect of the game, and his extra study.   
He's an individual when we break from a staff meeting you always see him, whether he's sitting alone or studying the film he's got a list of questions to ask, what can I do to get better.  In this specific call where should I be located presnap, where should I end up presnap.  So in that aspect Xavier has advanced and matured.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, he's committed to it.  I think Coach Karl Scott and Coach Saban have done a great job with -- we've had obviously six individuals from a season ago go on to the National Football League and these young men in the secondary, we're never going to use anything as an excuse.  These young men have been able to use this to their advantage making more reps and every single rep at practice valuable to them and this is an opportunity for us to get better and this is an opportunity for us to get better at today's practice.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Shyheim has been an essential part of our success.  He's taken a lot of pride in communication, lining individuals up, not just doing his job, being a dominate tore in that aspect, as far as not just approaching every practice, every meeting the same way, but also having a positive influence upon his teammates as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, he's got the unique ability to hurt you from a vertical cut standpoint.  He can make you miss and he runs well behind his pads, you know?  We know who he is and he's done a great job and obviously produced the way he has because of his ability to make you miss, run with power and has the ability to break open in the open field with the speed that he has.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Dylan commits to it from the mental aspect so he's another individual that's going to come up to your office, he's gonna ask what he can do to get batter.  He loves football, takes it serious, takes a lot of pride in it and he's a mature young man that has long-term goals and that's how he approaches every day.   
Hey, girl, how we doing?  Yes, ma'am.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, well, you know, we've played these guys for the fourth time in a row.  We know that they want to go fast, and it's been a big part of their package and system.  We're playing them in this game for a reason.  It's a part of their -- what they do.   
From a practice standpoint, we try to speed up, from a scout team look, we do do a couple different things where our signals need to be shorter, our defensive terminology needs to be packaged in a certain way where you can't spit out nine different calls and checks and that's what tempo does.  That's when it does where you don't have the fortunate time to sit there in a huddle and make different calls.  It isolates leadership, okay?  And it causes you to speed up your call, get your call in and get your checks and balances in faster.  So we have to practice that way.   
Fortunately for us, too, our offensive has a tempo aspect to them, too, so we do good on good every day.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, we're going to do good on good at Alabama every single day.  It's the best look we can get.  It might not be the offensive package we're facing that week but as far as that tempo look we're going to try to mix that into the body of practice which is valuable to our young men to be able to able to see that speed at least in a game.   
No matter what, I don't know if you're about ever going to get the same picture as far as a team that does that does that on every single snap you know, but I do think that's a valuable way to give our guys a proper look as we go into this competition.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, I mean, there's a reason he's had 22 catches, 211 yards and 4 touchdowns in the past three contests.  They've done a great job of distributing him the ball, and he's a guy that can utilize his balance and body control to get open, but he's somebody that, you know, he's a versatile guy.  There's not one thing he does.  It's not like they're going to throw a certain route to him, he can stretch you vertically, and as soon as you hone in and try to take him out of the game you have No. 8, 5, 3 and 10 to deal with.  This is a team that is well balanced.  Distributes the ball well.  There's a reason that you look at the numbers from you will all the different receivers and running backs, as far as distributing the ball well, similar to the way our offense does.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: He's an accurate thrower, he's got a nice, vertical, deep ball.  He places the ball well, knows where he wants to go with the ball.   
He does a good job.  He's advanced for his age, and, you know, along with ear factors, Clemson is in this game for a reason.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I can tell he's a freshman because he's a true freshman, I know that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: You know, we're going to continue to challenge him just like we do today to prepare.  Tomorrow will be the same thing and building up to the game will be the same thing.  For the most part those guys respond to that challenge.  Taking pride in your preparation so you can play in the absence of fear, knowing what I'm going to, what my checks are, getting the front aligned and having confidence in your technique and fundamentals.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We put a lot on Dylan's shoulders as far as the different roles we ask him to do and the different things we do.  He knows that and he takes pride in doing that.  Mack has been our signal caller and he's somebody that needs to continue to take pride in his preparation and as he does that building up to this game, he will be able to play confidently as he knows his jobs.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: The main focus is on us, not necessarily what they're doing.  This is an offense with versatility and the multiple different weapons they have out there, we can't hone in and try to take away one individual.  We need to be sharp on what we do and confident in our jobs and we need to focus on the fundamental approach, technique, great tackling, disrupting the ball.  If we have that, we will have the best chance for success.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: This has been a year of maturity for Jared.  He started out and has adapted and been able to embrace the process.  I think you've been able to see that with his play as we continue on in the post season year, he's someone that has attacked his preparation and improved.   
 Q.  You say Clemson is here for a reason.  When you play the same team every year on this stage over and over again, what is it to you that stands out about -- (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I don't know a lot about Clemson, you know, so I think I'm confident in the reasons of why we've continued to be fortunate enough to play in this game over and over.  I really don't know much about them other than obviously it's a talented program that plays with discipline and makes a lot of big plays.   
Like us, they have won all the games that they have participated in this season, and that's why they're here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yes, I mean, I've watched every single game we've played them the last three seasons, but more so an approach of how they're looking at us and what they're going to do to attack us and where we went wrong in certain areas and situations, trying to do our best to prepare building up to this game where we don't go wrong again in those situations.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I think it all starts with our leadership and Coach Saban.  Everybody's job is declared early in the process, and our desire is to compete and coach to the standard and for our players to respond to that standard.   
Whoever it is, that's going to be our approach.  We've been fortunate to put together a great staff.  We have been able to adapt to our way of life, our process and Coach Kuligowski, Coach Golding, Coach Scott have done a great job of adapting and learning this scheme and implementing it and getting our players to play within that scheme.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Right.  I think obviously built a solid relationship within the recruiting process and we were hoping at that point that he would come to us.  It essentially came down to two schools and then we were a little bit surprised he made a decision early.  Obviously after that couldn't have any contact with him again and then whatever the circumstances were and whatever things didn't work out, once he got his release and made a lot of sense as far as the other school that he was considering.  We're fortunate to have him as part of our family.  He's been a contributing part of our success and excited about his future.  He's a great young man and a great player.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, I think it is very difficult and it speaks volumes to who he is and how he approaches the game and his hunger to improve and get better.  He came late in the process and we're excited about his future.  More so focused on this game and focused on how each individual can improve today at practice and in tonight's meetings and tomorrow building up to this game collectively so we can finish off the season the way we want to.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I think Q is a unique individual that has the ability to play both inside and outside, and he has the right mentality and the right attitude of "whatever is the best thing for the team" that's Q.  We put him inside and instead of making excuses and saying, "I'm not the typical 330-pound guy," it's almost like he's going to take it out on the opponent.  That's the way he plays.  He's a hard guy to block, he's extremely disruptive wherever we put him and we might do some things different with him in this game to be able to move him around and match him up on individuals where we feel like he can give us successes, that's who he is and he will respond to those challenges.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, I think because of the way he prepares in practices, that was our expectation of him and he took that and ran with it.  I think some other guys, whether general from our team or within the position, you know, from preseason getting other attention, that's who Q is.  Anything you put in front of him he's going to attack it at full speed.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, fortunately at Alabama, we're blessed with the fact that if any offense wants to target one individual or take somebody out that's going to open the doors for somebody else, whether that's somebody next to them, whether that's somebody coming off the edge or from the secondary.  We want to force you to have one-on-one's.  We want to put everybody across the board where they have to account whether it's the presnap look we give you or it's the personnel.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, well, you usually get to that when you get post season and watch the self-scout so I can recall with Da'Ron Payne, right after this game is done we will go into that mode and start looking at all the things we could have done better and could have improved on and that stood out with Da'Ron Payne, how disruptive he is.  When you see the film and the self-scout.  Right now we put a game to sleep and go into preparation for the next opponent, so you don't really get that luxury of focusing in.  I would say both with Da'Ron as well as John Allen, from a production standpoint, you know, Q is right up there with those guys as far as how disruptive he's been for opposing offenses.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, it's a great program.  I don't know much about Clemson.  Don't really focus on the past, or talk about the future.  It's all about living in this moment right now, attacking today's practice and preparation and that's, really, for you guys to kind of create rivalries or whatever you want to do with it.   
For us, this is an opponent and we're going to do everything we can to prepare and get our young men in the right position to attack this game the right way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, he's advanced.  As a true freshman, it's not just his ability to throw the ball, he's got a great arm, we could see that in the recruiting process.  It's how he processes things, doing a good job of seeing things from a presnap and postsnap, where he's going with the ball.  It's obvious he's been coached well and he knows how to operate within the scheme of their offense well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We did.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: He's playing for Clemson.   
 Q.  What have you seen on the film?  You haven't probably seen a team with as great of an offense.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Clemson is here for a reason.  They do a nice job of distributing the ball to various targets.  Start with the backfield, No. 9 has done a great job of rushing for 1600 yards and he's somebody that can hurt you vertically, make you miss in space and runs behind his pads, 28 and 26 have done a nice job in that backfield, 80 and 44 is somebody that can be utilized in the blocking scheme for the run game as well as get distributed and give you a full open look and be targets out in the open field and the receivers of No. 8, 3, 10, No. 5, No. 13, of course, all the different targets led by Trevor at the quarterback position.   
Similar to our offense there are various targets that they can hurt you with, and they're very versatile in that aspect.  It's more so focusing on what we need to do as a defense, doing our job, having great eye discipline and control, playing great fundamental football, tackling and disrupting the ball as opposed to honing in on and taking away an individual, they will distribute the ball and still be able to hurt you.   
 Q.  What's it like to be part of the College Football Playoff four years in a row?  
TOSH LUPOI: I'm really fortunate to be able to be a part of this family and part of this organization.  We really at this moment, it's about approaching this game exactly how we approach any game, attacking our preparation, just like we did in this morning's meeting, how we are going to go about in practice ahead of us, how we are going to debrief this practice.  It's about, in my opinion, being consistent, not approaching this in any different way, not making this game different than any other game.   
 Q.  When you came to Alabama did you get a chance to work with Kirby?  
TOSH LUPOI: I did.   
 Q.  Your impressions of Coach Smart?  
TOSH LUPOI: Kirby is a great man, very valuable for my experience, I had two years, two seasons with Kirby and coaching side-by-side with him, soaking up his knowledge and approach to the game.  Also had two great years with Coach Pruitt and been around a lot of great coaches while I've been here and it's now my fifth season at Alabama, so fortunate for that experience and it will be valuable to me forever.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We really haven't thought about that game.  Feels like it was ages ago.  We're more so focused on Monday night's battle and when we get into the self-scout we will reflect on that game.  Our focus is really on today's practice.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: It's awesome.  I'm a Spartan for life.  It's great to be home.  It's a great area, a lot of great people out here.  Just another opportunity for us, really, to perform at a great stage.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I'm consistently in contact with Coach Latisser.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I've had a lot of valuable years with him long before I even attended De La Salle, my brother attended De La Salle, was a ball boy at De La Salle, so it's a big part of my DNA, a big part of my life and my foundation.  What's awesome is the carryover to Alabama and the similar attributes that I've been fortunate to be around with both Coach Latisser and Coach say ban with the leadership, approach, accountability and the way they attack their preparation.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: There's some differences in gas prices.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: What's that?  (No microphone.)   
TOSH LUPOI: No, they got a "What-a-Burger" in Tuscaloosa, but I know some guys made some visits to In and Out, but I more so appreciate Taco Bell.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, you know, there are differences and similarities.  I don't think Clemson is going to deviate from what's gotten them here.  They can hurt you in a lot of different ways.  When you hone in and put your focus on one individual such as Lawrence, you're going to quickly be hurt by the many other young mean out on the field, from No. 8, No. 5, No. 3, No. 13, No. 10, No. 9, No. 28, 26 and 80 and 44 so you probably want to focus on stopping from a schematic standpoint as opposed to honing in on one individual.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We haven't really talked about last year at all.  It's more so approaching today's practice, with the right attack.  Clemson is here for a reason.  They've done a really good job of distributing the ball in various ways, and Lawrence has done a nice job of adapting to their offense and I think he's advanced for being a true freshman and knowing where to go with the ball.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, he can stretch you vertically, he's got a great long ball.  He can make all the throws.  We knew that in the recruiting process.  There is a reason he's one of the best quarterbacks coming out of his class.  It's no surprise to us, the success he's had at this level.   
We've got to do our best to disrupt him and make him uncomfortable.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I would say, you know, it's allowed him to be the versatile player he is.  He's somebody that can lineup on a center, you can put him in a 3 technique, a 5 technique, we stand him up at times.  He's got a lot of versatility to his game, his initial quickness, his body and balance control.  He can hurt you.  He plays with power.  He utilizes his hands well and above all that stuff it's who he is inside.  He's an animal.   
I think he utilizes all the attention that gets put on other people, whether it's going into game or going into a season, you know, that's how he takes that personal and he plays that way.  When you watch Q's film you see somebody that plays with a chip on their shoulder.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, I know he's from a large family, and he grew up at times getting bullied, at least he tells me that so I think he approaches that that way in practice.  I think he's still upset about that at times.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I think Deionte take has been part of the success of the secondary.  I think those guys have approached it in an unselfish team aspect.  So a very cohesive group that approaches the game the right way.  We still have a lot of room for improvement and he knows that and they know that.  But we are going to attack this practice with the right demeanor and the right mind-set to go get better and approach tomorrow's preparation the same way and hopefully that carries over into this competition Monday night.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: You got it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Great.   
 Q.  Friends?  Family?  Seeing any of them?  
TOSH LUPOI: We just got in last night, but it will be great to see my family, but all the attention is going to be on this game.  It's great to be back here in a great place.  There are a lot of great people here and all of the attention is going to be put into this game and our approach.  I haven't left the hotel other than coming here and we're going to go attack this practice and excited to get back to meetings and get our minds right for a great day of preparation today.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: No, you know, all our preparation is going to be approached the same way, both individually for myself and collectively as a staff and team.  Doesn't matter where we play, what time it is, what time of day, what the weather is we are going to approach this thing the same way.  Excited more so for this game.  It's a blessing to have it here in my home state and where I'm born and raised, but all the attention is going to be put into the preparation and we're excited for this competition Monday evening.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I'm fortunate to be around a lot of great young men, great coaches.  It's a blessing to come from the roots of De La Salle and move on and be fortunate to be part of this family and organization now for five seasons.   
There are a lot of similarities with Coach Latisser and Coach Saban from accountability standpoint, our approach standpoint.  What we put into our preparation.  I think it's been great for me and a blessing for me to be a part of such great organizations and families.  We're excited about this competition Monday evening and hopefully our preparation including today's and tomorrow's can build into that and we can perform to the standard.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Our key is execution, focusing on what we need to do.  A great fundamental approach, having great eye discipline and control, attacking the ball, being great tacklers on defense.  That's what this game will come down to.  It's not about doing something completely new.  We need to do our job and if we do that and execute, we will be happy with the results.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Trevor is a great player, he being vertically stretch the field, he's got a strong, live arm, he can distribute the ball well, he has multiple targets he likes to go to.  He's advanced for a true freshman.  We're excited for the challenge.  Clemson is here and Trevor is here for a reason.  They've done a great job and we're just excited for the challenge come Monday evening.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: You know, we haven't mentioned anything about the past once.  We're not talking about the future.  Our whole approach is living in this moment and how we can improve right now to go attack this process.  We had a great meeting this morning.  We need to have a great practice today.  We need to have a great post debrief of today's practice, hone in on what we need to do and attack this team the right way.   
For us it's all about "Bama," it's not about the preparation and the future.  I'm excited and can't wait to get out of here and get to practice.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, Clemson has a versatile offense.  They can stretch you vertically.  They've got great receivers in 13, 3, 10, No. 5, No. 8, they can do unique things with their tight end position with No. 80 and 44, and of course the great backfield of 9, 26 and 28, with a veteran offensive line.   
If you hone in on one thing and try to stop things individually they will hurt you with the various targets they have.  We need to focus on what we need to do to defend them within the body of our scheme and attack this with the right fundamental approach and execution so we can be successful.   
 Q.  It's great to be home, in a great area and be surrounded by great people, but our entire focus is this game and our approach and my approach will be no different, no matter where we play, what time we play, what the weather is so we're excited to attack today's preparation and practice the right way and continue the prep going into this contest Monday evening.  
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Compete to the standard and attack our approach and process the same exact way, no matter where we are playing and who we are playing.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: No outside elements will affect our preparation, approach.  That's part of the process.  We're going to line up, no matter where we are, what the weather is.  I hope it rains, I hope it storms and I can't wait.  I hope it does today.  I hope that every possible outside factor attempts to make this game, you know, different.  It won't for us.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: It's great to be home.  It's a great area, a lot of great people here.  I haven't left the hotel.  Don't plan on doing that.  Excited for the preparation and really just can't wait to go to practice today.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: There will be no distractions for me.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: This is my fifth season at Alabama and I'm fortunate and blessed to be a part of such a great organization and family and it's part of the process.  We allow the results to handle themselves.  We live in the every day preparation and process just like today, just like this morning's meeting and our approach to today's practice.   
The time is ticking here, I can't wait to get back and get into our meetings and get to our approach so we can have a great, necessary practice today.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Clemson is an extremely versatile offense.  They have various targets they can go to, starting with the quarterback.  He's got a live arm, he can throw the ball deep, he can make all the necessary throws to be successful.  There are various targets within this offense, starting at the backfield, No. 9, 26 and 28.  They have unique tight ends at 80 and 44 that can help out and block within the core but also give you open looks and stretch you vertically in the passing game and of course have a lot of success at the receiver position, with 13, 8, 5, No. 3, No. 10, so this is an offense where you can't hone in and try to stop one individual because they will be find ways to distribute the ball like they have all season.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: From a defensive standpoint our goal is to keep the score low.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We need to focus on being great tacklers, and we've got to attack the ball.  We've got to do our job, play with great eye discipline and control.  We need to adjust to the various looks they're going to give us and that's what we're going to focus on both in our preparation and hopefully that carries over to Monday evening.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Our approach will be handled in no different way no matter what game we play in.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, there's a lot of similarities, with the De La Salle program at a different stage.  At the end of the day, accountability will be focused on, first and foremost and competing to a standard and operating within that standard on an every day basis.  A lot of valuable things I've been fortunate to be exposed to at an early age, in a program like De La Salle and a lot of similarities when you see the success within both programs.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Not I think a lot of various things go into their success.  They've got a lot of talent, they have versatility within their offense and the ability to respond to what you are showing them.  I think it's property that we stick within the body of our scheme and as they make their changes it's important that we do our best to keep them off balance and make our changes as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yes, I think within the body of their offense they have answers to the different looks that they see and within our scheme we do our best to respond to those look and change those looks as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, you know, I don't know that answer.  I don't know much about Clemson other than what I see on film so I don't know what they're doing on their sideline or how they're approaching the game.  We're going to focus on what we need to do to stop their offense and have a great fundamental and technique approach, disrupt their ball as much as possible and give them different looks to hopefully make them uncomfortable.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, we would like to be great in every quarter.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: I think Tua had his goals set of what he wanted to accomplish.  He's a mature young man.  Getting a strong degree was very apparent for him, accompanied by wanting to compete at the highest stage, and hopefully compete and one day at the National Football League.  I think Tua is mature and has been since an early age and had his long-term goals set in an early stage, and that was evident in the recruiting process.   
When you put those things forward where a lot of young men at his age don't necessarily do -- might tell you they do, but there are different factors that go into their recruiting process and kinda get caught up in the hoopla of recruiting, Tua, that didn't affect in any way.  When you put those things out on the table it's an obvious choice to make.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, Tua's supported by a great family.  I love his family, and we've grown and had a great relationship.  We now consider each other family.  I just think he's been blessed with great support and, you know, that's no different than any great family in this process where some young men are blessed with that support and some aren't.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, Deionte has approached this game, this season from the mental aspect with a hunger.  Deionte is one of those guys that's consistently in our building when you don't necessarily have to be.  He's studying film, he's studying our self-scout, he's looking at his own personal mannerisms, demeanor, what he can do differently to improve and that's the part that's been impressive with him is his attack from the mental approach, not just depending on his talent and his range.   
I also think Deionte being an offensive player coming out of high school in a competitive football stage in the state of Texas, I think that's spoken volumes for his ability to see things differently and see things from an offensive perspective the way the quarterback looks at things, the way the receiver may look at things.  Knowing that, that's why he can do some things, where you might see him and think he's going to be at one area of the field, and at the snap of the ball end up somewhere different.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: It's a big part of their offense, obviously.  They've done a great job, just like they did in their last competition.  Based off the look that you give them, I think it starts with the quarterback of where he wants to go with the ball.  They've got between 8, 5, No. 3, No. 10, even 80 and 44 and of course 13, they've got those targets where they can throw those 50/50 balls up, it's something they practice and it's part of their offense and we need to do a nice job of attacking and finishing on every single ball.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Next man up, baby!   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, you know, we have a lot of young mean that have prepared with hunger and approached this the right way, so 47 has done a great job and been a great leader for us, not just from his production standpoint but how he approaches every contest, every practice, every meeting and every game.   
Fortunately that's been our approach at Alabama so the young men in our room, when it comes to Jamey Mosley, No. 16, of course, Anfernee Jennings, No. 33, No. 9, Eyabi, and then being a 3-4 defense, we have the versatility of utilizing the skill set of many different young men, inside and outside backers of the duties we're going to ask of them.   
We're not going to change our scheme or stray away from what we are doing when we have an injury.  We feel like we will have to utilize the young men in both rooms, inside and outside backers so we can compete to our standard and compete on Monday evening.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Those young men have been practicing in those different positions all year.  You look at our game, our last game, we utilized 30, 32, 16 in all those different ways.  You can turn on our film and see those guys playing inside and outside for us.  Hopefully we can approach today's preparation the right way and respond to the challenges and the different looks we are going to give them at practice and that will carryover to our attack on Monday evening.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Absolutely.  Wonderful to see you.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Recruiting Dylan back to his IMG days, seeing him since the eighth grade, you know, he has been a mature young man.  He knows what he wants in life, and he attacks his preparation with that.  Sitting there with him in his living room and seeing him in the recruiting process, I think we knew what we were getting with Dylan, that he is going to attack his preparation differently than most guys at his age.   
Dylan is a great father.  Dylan is someone that wants something in life.  He wants to play to his absolute maximum potential.  He wants to compete at the highest stage, and those are the main reasons that he chose Alabama, and here we are just as he was told in the recruiting process that he would get this opportunity if he approached this the right way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, you know, Bryant was a great player, Lawrence is a great player.  Our focus has been on Lawrence, obviously and doing what we can do to challenge him and make him uncomfortable.  At the end of the day, you know, we can't hone in and try to take away him, or any one guy on this offense because of their versatility.  They have various ways to distribute the ball and hurt you.   
As opposed to focusing on them, we're going to focus on us.  We're going to attack our preparation a specific way like we do in every game and focus in on our eye discipline and control, having a great fundamental approach, attacking them from a technique standpoint the way we need to and do everything we can to focus on us and not really focus on the end result here but more so the process of what it's going to take and the results will take care of itself.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We have not even mentioned last year.  This game has nothing to do with last year or even last game.  The approach is no different than it's been on any other game.  We need to do our job.  They're going to try to hurt you in various ways and as soon as you try to take away one aspect of their game they're going to go to the other aspect.  More so our approach is going our job and focusing on what we need to do to attack and play to our standard.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, I think he's done a nice job of -- as a true freshman trying to approach the game mentally the right way.  He's always somebody asking questions, always somebody that wants to come in and do extra work, watch his own work, watch his self-scout, get on his iPad, and he's always asking of questions, "Coach, what was I supposed to be doing here?"  You can appreciate that he at a young age has the hunger to want to get better.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: We've been fortunate for just about every single young man that has joined our family from California or the west coast in general to have a lot of success with us.  We have had multiple starters from out west.   
It's not really about geographically, it's about the young men we are recruiting and doing our best to target young men not just from a talent standpoint but from a mind-set standpoint, who are probably a little more mature than most young men and guys that make their decisions that they want a strong degree, to have a great balance with that degree and be able to compete at the highest stage of college football, to be able to compete for national title and hopefully become the best version of themselves both as young men on the field and off the field, where they can get a strong degree as well as accompany that with hopefully being a first-round draft pick as well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Well, we want to declare to every young man in the recruiting process that nothing is going to be given to you.  If the priorities in you allow other outside noise to creep into your own insecurities that Alabama might not be the best place for you.  Alabama is going to be the place where we want the most competitive individuals to come here.  We want a young man that wants to compete at the highest stage, we want a young man that wants to compete every day of his life and operate to this high standard.  Not to worry about the depth, not worry about the what if's, we want you to attack every day in a specific manner and buy in and believe in the process and let those end results take care of themselves.   
So we are going to declare that early in the recruiting stage and we're going to, you know, just like I'm allowing you to know if you come into our building as a media source, you're going to have to compete with Maxon, you're going to have to compete at the highest stage and there is going to be nothing handed to you.  If you can buy into that process and live that process you're going to become the best version of yourself.  So much higher than just this game of football, we're talking about life.   
It's going to be no different than when you get into the business aspect and you want to become a CEO and whatever your goals are, you're going to continue a foundation here that's going to be embedded into your DNA.  This is so much bigger than football.   
This is about competing in life and preparing at a whole different stage than you can do most anywhere in the country.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: No.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
TOSH LUPOI: Yeah, well, Najee is a young man that's extremely talented, he has strong, long-term goals, and it's important for him and everybody to stick to the process, attack every day with the same approach and preparation, and as you go about every day never lose sight of your end goals, of what you want to accomplish here.   
We're fortunate to have Najee a part of our family and organization, and I hope he continues to approach every day and attack every day with the long-term goals ahead but living in every day and attacking every day with the right preparation.
