J.K. SCOTT: Like the thing is about that is if we do -- like, if we do what we need to do, they won't block a kick.   
 Q.  It won't happen.  So you don't even want to start thinking about that because the what-ifs can be --  
J.K. SCOTT: Yeah, especially since like the protection is huge.  Coach Burns and Coach Williams have been like looking at a lot of that stuff.   
 Q.  Then this is just me being a snarky person.  Did you feel ripped off on the Ray Guy Award this year?  I was really offended that you weren't a finalist, at least.  
J.K. SCOTT: No.  That wasn't my focus.  That was never my focus, the awards or anything like that.  To be honest with you, that's not why I play the game.   
 Q.  I was a little irritated for you.  
J.K. SCOTT: I appreciate it.   
 Q.  We'll worry about it.  You don't worry about it.  
J.K. SCOTT: I didn't even know it came out, the list, until later on anyway.   
 Q.  So you weren't focused on that?  
J.K. SCOTT: I don't have any social media.   
 Q.  Good for you.  That's probably good.  
J.K. SCOTT: I didn't find out until later.   
 Q.  Probably good.  I was talking to Marcus Mariota, and he still doesn't have social media.  He didn't do it in college, and now he's a pro.  Even though he could do it for marketing, he's like I don't want to hear other people's opinions.  
J.K. SCOTT: It's awesome.  You don't have to worry about it.
