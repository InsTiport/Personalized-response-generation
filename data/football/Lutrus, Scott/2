 Q. Talk about Oklahoma's quarterback. 
 SCOTT LUTRUS: The offense is a huge challenge. He is a great quarterback. He has got a great arm. 
 Whatever it is, getting the quarterback or being physical on the receivers, we have had some time to prepare for them, about a month now, three weeks, we got a great coaching stuff putting in a game plan for them. We will be just fine.

 Q. You guys are in here right now. When Oklahoma is coming in, now we are getting closer to what this whole thing is about. This is what you dream of. Talk about now as it is getting closer to it now and you see this stuff behind you, what is this like for you? If you could, explain what it is like. 
 SCOTT LUTRUS: It is awesome. Every kid dreams of being in this position. It is not something I ever could have imagined, being part as part of the UConn football team. The success we have had over the past five years I have been here, it has been awesome. I wish this week would go on forever because it is my last game. 
 I don't want to leave this program, this team. It has been a great five years, 4 1/2 years, we got one more game to play and one more game to win.

 Q. You guys were 3 and 4. What was that? 
 SCOTT LUTRUS: The team brought it together. The beginning of the year, this is where we wanted to be. Our coaches brought it all together, we went out and gave everything we had.

 Q. What about all the people that say "they don't deserve to be there"? 
 SCOTT LUTRUS: We are used to it. We are the lower ranked team. It doesn't matter. We will go out there Saturday and show them what we got.

 Q. You have watched a lot of Fiesta Bowls. What's it like knowing it is a team that has been here? 
 SCOTT LUTRUS: They are a great football team.
