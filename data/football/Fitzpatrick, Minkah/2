Q. What makes your defense so successful?
MINKAH FITZPATRICK: Just the competitive nature.  Everybody's competing against everybody, the D-line competing with the DBs, trying to get to the ball, get the ball off the man.  If you can do that, get the turnover, get the ball to the offense, and it leads to the offense scoring points.
