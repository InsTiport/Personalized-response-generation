 Q.  What's been the success with this defense, if you could sum it up?  
MINKAH FITZPATRICK: Just the competitive nature.  Really, you know, everybody is competing with each other, whether it's the D-line competing with the DBs, we're all trying to get to the ball, get the ball off the man.  If we can do that, we can get turnovers, get the ball to the offense, we can score points too.   
 Q.  Because you were in this setting last year, how does that experience help you kind of stay grounded, not get overwhelmed by what could happen the next couple games?  
MINKAH FITZPATRICK: My first year, I was kind of overwhelmed about the media and the different things we do throughout the week.  Now I'm prepared for it, I know what's coming, it feels like it's more comfortable, stay a little bit focused.
