Q. What's it like to be here now?  Does it feel different to you right now?
ROQUAN SMITH: It's a bit different being here just with all my teammates and a huge media outlet and whatnot, but I guess that's part of it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, you just have to keep the main thing.  The main thing coach preaches day-in and day-out and that's our main focus and we have to know what we're here for and keep that mind-set.
Q. Defensively have you had good practices?
ROQUAN SMITH: I definitely felt like we had a few good days of practice and every day we have been out there we've gotten better.  That's always big and when you are preparing for a team like that.  You must have your best practices.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Yeah, it's a bit different trying to prepare for Oklahoma's offense and what they have with Baker Mayfield and many other weapons, but you have to do the best job we can to prepare for it and I feel like the coaches have put us in the best possible situation.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, we will definitely have to try to keep him in the pocket.  Our focus is to keep him in the pocket and make those guys one-dimensional, trying to stop the run.  They spread it out and try to run the ball as well and we will try to make them one-dimensional and go from there.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, we feel like every game is important so we get up for every game the same.  It's the next game on our schedule and whatnot and we know they have a great offense and we know we have a great defense as well, but we pride ourselves on stopping great offense.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely.  Preparing for that tempo is not easy, but our coaches are preparing us in the best -- putting us in the best possible situations where we're going with a lot of fast balls and whatnot.  So if they decide to go fastball we will be ready for it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We just have to keep the main thing the main thing.  We don't control all of those things, what he say and what he do.  He's a great competitor.  We just have to focus on what we can do to play our best style of defense.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, you know, everyone is different I feel like.  But when I met the guy in Atlanta, he seemed like a great guy to me.  I don't have anything bad to say about him.  He's a great competitor and whatnot and he loves to win.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We're motivated to play any game.  College football playoffs, the Rose Bowl if you need any extra motivation you're probably in the wrong business.  All our guys know what's on the line and know we control our destiny so we have to take care of business and play our best style of defense.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just sticking together and playing our style.  When we face a little adversity keep going and staying alive on the road and whatnot.  Don't let it faze you, just keep chopping.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just the way he cares about his players and the way he goes about things day-in and day-out.  Just practice.  The way we practice or the way he makes sure practice goes I think that's one of the biggest things and then the bond he created with us players, among each other, it's terrific.  I love the guy to death.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Absolutely.  I know he's a fierce competitor.  If it was me, if I was sick or something, and I was in those shoes I would do anything I could to get out there and play with my brothers, the Rose Bowl, the granddad of them all.  So I'm sure he'll do everything in his power to make it out.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: You normally go off the ball so if the ball -- it's going to be a symbol or something they do, an indicator that the ball is going to come out.  So it's not just going to be silent.  It's going to be some form of a hand clap or something along those lines.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's been amazing to be out here with you guys enjoying this nice weather and having great practices.  You can't ask for anything better.
Q. The people would like to know, if I was out there playing (No microphone.)  How does that make you feel?
ROQUAN SMITH: That's pretty scary.  I don't think I would like to hit a train.
Q. That's okay.  Hey, appreciate your time, man.  You go get them!
ROQUAN SMITH: All right.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Oh, definitely.  I didn't start my freshman year, so it's pretty crazy, stepping into college football right out of high school and whatnot, 18 years old.  It's a huge stage but, you know, you prepare yourself the right way and anything is possible.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I think any guy that can step into any Division I program and start right away.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I started my sophomore year.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Jake Ganus, he was a senior, linebacker.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I learned a lot from him.  He was a great guy, one of my mentors and whatnot, and I'm thankful I had him.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: From high school to college it was more so just the playbooks and understanding defenses and whatnot.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I watched some of it.  I didn't watch much of it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, that's just part of the business that we're in.  Everyone dreams of making it to the next level and I guess we're just another story.  That's what makes people interested, so I feel like that's what that is.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's not my main focus.  The guys here we're not really focused on that.  We're focused on Oklahoma.
Q. How you doing, man?
ROQUAN SMITH: I'm doing well.
Q. We were talking a little bit about putting defensive players in a behind.  (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We're first off going to have to try to make them one dimensional by stopping the run and forcing them to throw the ball.  Our RPOs are definitely cool and a lot of it is just reading the line and everything like that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We are just going to try to keep the guy in the pocket.  Once you keep them in the pocket then we go from there and making them one-dimensional and try to get them in third down situations.
Q. What's it feel like to be playing in the Rose Bowl?  How do you balance the emotions of being here and taking care of a game?
ROQUAN SMITH: This is the granddad of 'em all, so this is pretty special to be out here.  As a kid you dream of playing in a game like that.  But at the end of the day we have to keep our focus where it needs to be, and Coach is doing a good job of helping us keep our focus.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, you know, you like to have fun, you don't want to be too stuck up while you are out here, so you have fun with it as well.  But you have to keep the main thing the main thing.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Everything has been pretty amazing.  I would say hanging out with my teammates and whatnot as well as I would say like we went to Disney on the first day and then having -- yesterday and the comedy show.  Pretty much everything we have done we've had a great time.  It's been pretty amazing.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I would like to give a shout out to my family and friends, my mom, my aunt, my dad, everyone like that and as well as everyone back in Nashville.  I know many of them will make it out to the game, but if not I'm sure they will be turning out downtown.  I'm excited for you guys to witness something great, the Rose Bowl, the granddaddy of 'em all.  Love you guys.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I would say it's my family that help put me in this position, giving so much to me throughout my life and whatnot.  Being there through thick and thin and my coaches, like coaches from the past and my current coaches.  There has been so many to name just a few I will be shorting it but I'm grateful to be here and thankful for everyone that's in my life.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just be the best me I can be in 2018.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's crazy, you know, just thinking about life and whatnot and just like, how life throws you curve balls and you never know how life is going to pan out, but you just hope it pans out for the best.  I just can't envision myself anywhere else besides the University of Georgia.  Being here is like a dream come true and I'm pretty sure I would rather be playing on this field for the Rose Bowl rather than having it as my field each and every day.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely, that's all I can really say about it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: As far as changing coaching staff where?
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: No, I knew and everyone else on board was going to bring in the best possible guys for the situation and once I heard it was Coach Smart.  I knew he was a great guy recruiting over at Alabama and whatnot.  It was a good situation, everything worked out for the best.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely a learning curve when you witness -- you have something new for the first time and whatnot, have new people, you're trying to learn those people and whatnot as well as your defense and everything like that.  Definitely a learning curve you have to get through, but I think it was all worth it.  I enjoyed it, actually, enjoyed the process.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely, yeah, getting out and seeing -- I've actually seen it before; so, like -- I've been in there before so it will be exciting to be in there for the first time with my teammates, though.  So I'm definitely excited about that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: You definitely have to but there is never enough preparation especially when you are playing an offense like that.  You have to prepare day-in and day-out and it seems like you can never be prepared, but our coach will put you in the best possible situation by preparing us to be the best we can possibly be.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely.  I've hit back on that all week.  They have great playmakers all around the field from the receiver position to the running backs and then they have great offensive linemen and a great tight end as well, so they have great guys all over the field.  It's going to be big for us to try to stop them but it will be a great opportunity for our defense.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I would say preparation, day-in and day-out.  My coach put me in the best possible situations and then my teammates, you have to keep the offensive linemen off me and actually being there so they can free me up so I can make plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely.  I watch a lot of film so watching film and whatnot, trying to prepare for your opponents.  I feel like that's half the battle.  That would be the main thing, watching film and then just having high football IQ and pretty much knowing what's going to happen before it happens always helps you out.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just being able to play at the Rose Bowl, you know, the granddaddy of 'em all and there's not many that can say they did that throughout their careers and just to be here and do it with my teammates.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just playing my style of ball.  Just being where I'm supposed to be, not trying to do anything special, just playing ball how I normally play ball.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely, right here, right here, absolutely.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We're going to play -- we're not going to alter what we do based on someone.  We feel like we as a defense we like to take the game so we're going to do that from our standpoint.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: They're never in my ear too much like that.  They respect the game and whatnot and they try not to do anything different like this, because it's the Rose Bowl, the granddaddy of 'em all.  They're be the going to try to do something that they haven't been doing all year.
Q. Who is your inspiration?
ROQUAN SMITH: I have a few, my mom, my aunt, they're like my inspiration.  I do a lot for them so that's definitely it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely, shout out to pretty much my whole family, my teammates, the whole state of Georgia, Athens in particular, Macon County as a whole.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's going to be definitely a challenge, you know, but I feel like we prepared all week, all month and whatnot for it.  So we're definitely ready for this opportunity and I think it will be great for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I think Reggie Carter is a phenomenal guy, you know.  He's a first-class guy, graduated from the University of Georgia, School of Business, Econ, he's a -- I'm in awe just thinking about everything he's done for the University.  Wow!
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We just have to play our brand of defense, play our brand of defense and whatnot and just keeping him in the pocket.  Once he escapes the pocket he loves to keep his eyes down field and he can make plays like that and he can definitely hurt you with his legs if he decides to pull it down.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's definitely going to be a challenge for our defense, but we feel like we're prepared the right way so we are definitely ready for the challenge.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, if you need any extra motivation for the granddaddy of 'em all, the Rose Bowl, I don't think you're in the right game.  So guys may need to go play something else.  We definitely don't need no extra motivation.  We know everything that's on the line and we know we control our destiny and it is what it is.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, he can do everything pretty well.  So he can throw the ball very well.  He can run the ball if he has to.  So he pretty much can do anything he want on the field.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: One game at a time.  Our main focus right now is Oklahoma.  We're just going to focus on that and whatever comes after that, that will come.  But our main focus right now is Oklahoma.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's an honor just to be here with my teammates and being able to play in this game and represent a lot of people, you know, that came before us at the University and there are so many legends that played in this game way before us, even the Georgia team from 1942.  It's definitely big and I'm grateful and we're just thankful to be here.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just keeping the main thing the main thing.  We don't try to do anything special we just try to go there and play for each other and when there is a little adversity in the road we keep chopping and never let anything detour us.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: His play making ability, the guy can make plays all over the field.  Regardless of where he's at he can create something.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's amazing, you know.  Yesterday it was 84, sunny, no humidity in the air.  It's pretty awesome.
Q. How do you prepare for a game like this?
ROQUAN SMITH: It's definitely a challenge, you know, preparing for a guy like that.  You're not going to have anyone on the team that can do the things I do.  But we have a great scout that has given us the best possible look and that's big, but we will definitely be up for the challenge.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, you know, we turned the program around so that's definitely always big, being able to turn the program around and be the first Georgia team to get in the college football playoffs.  So that's definitely big and we are looking forward to this awesome opportunity that we have to play in the Rose Bowl and the college football playoffs.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's definitely a big milestone, haven't won an SEC championship game since 2005.  So being able to do that and put Georgia -- well, we never was off the map but putting Georgia back where it belonged and the SEC champion, that's always big.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I definitely feel that way and I feel like backing up on Tyler, getting Tyler like that, making the coach's job easier.  So having guys like that I think we are building something special at the University.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We don't get into all that.  Georgia is Georgia.  We don't focus on talking about others and whatnot.  Our main focus is more so this game and just, you know, taking care of business this game.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely.  You're going to get a little more attention when you make it to the playoffs.  Only four teams in the United States that are in the playoffs, so definitely if you're one those four you're definitely going to get the recognition.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's pretty crazy.  It's an awesome opportunity though for me and my teammates to play in the Rose Bowl, the granddaddy of 'em all, and we're grateful to be here.  We know a lot of legends have played on this field in this game before us so we're thankful to be here.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's definitely big, you know, not many SEC teams make it out to the Rose Bowl.  So being one of the teams we're just very thankful and trying to wrap my mind around that afterwards and whatnot, but we have to keep the focus on first off beating Oklahoma.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's been amazing, the amazing weather.  They have had a lot of fun activities for us to do.  So it's been fun and we've been enjoying each other's company a lot.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's always big, but I couldn't be in this situation without my family, my coaches and my teammates who have been there for me and whatnot and helped me a lot throughout the season.  It's just been pretty amazing.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, definitely.  I feel like there was many moments throughout the season where I felt like everything clicked.  But in particular I knew early on when we faced Notre Dame up in South Bend that it was going to be a special season.  We faced adversity through the game but never stopped and kept chopping and kept going until we got the "W!"
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Just playing our brand of defense and playing to our capabilities, our standard.  Do what we do best and try to make the guy one dimensional.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I don't think much about it.  I know he's a fierce competitor, so he's going to do whatever it takes to get out on the field and it's just like anyone.  I'm sure if I was sick I would be doing whatever it takes to get out on the field with my brothers.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Pardon?
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We just have to play our style of defense, you know.  Try to make 'em one-dimensional, try to stop the run and force 'em to throw the ball.  We feel like if we do that, that will definitely be big.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: They have weapons all over the field, not just in Mayfield but from the receiving core and the tight ends and running backs as well.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Yeah, two very rich programs and tradition and whatnot facing off and whatnot for the first time ever.  I think it's definitely big just to be able to play Oklahoma.  It's not something I envisioned coming to the University of Georgia with them in the Big 12.  We are definitely up for the challenge and we're definitely looking forward to it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, it's kinda crazy for me to speak on that and whatnot because I guess everyone's situation is different.  I don't know what a guy may be going through for a guy to be able to do that.  For me and my standpoint -- I know, but I don't see it; but, you know, everyone is different.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, I guess, to each his own.  I don't have much to say on that because I don't have a cat or a dog in the race.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's been crazy, but keeping our focus on, like, doing what we have to do in the playoffs day-in and day-out (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: (Away from mic.)  And everything, keep the main thing the main thing.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I don't personally write it down, but it's been said a lot.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I have definitely watched a lot of the Oklahoma team and whatnot, so being able to watch their offense.  They go all over the field, so it's definitely going to be a challenge (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: (Away from mic.)  Rich tradition, so many legends that have played in that game before us, and it's going to be surreal.  But we will definitely be up for it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: We're going to play up to our standard and (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I don't lose no sleep over games and whatnot (Away from mic.)
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: All year long it's the main thing, the main thing and keeping it the main thing.  You just can't get sidetracked on your focus.  You have to keep the main focus and our focus is to beat Oklahoma.
Q. You keep saying the main thing, is that beating Oklahoma?
ROQUAN SMITH: That's definitely it.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely a challenge, a great defense playing a great offense.  When you are a great defense you love going up against a great offense because it brings out your defense and shows why it's the best.  This is one of the best offense in the country and we are definitely looking forward to the opportunity, and it's definitely going to be a challenge for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's definitely going to be a challenge when you are playing an offense like that, and Oklahoma and all the things they can cause the defense and how much trouble they can cause to the defense.  So it's a big challenge, but I definitely feel like we are prepared for it and the coach put us in the best situation all week and I'm sure he will put us in the best possible situation for the game.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Yeah, you know, they're the best offense, you definitely wanting to against them and show them what you can actually do.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, that will be pretty crazy, but we have a lot of playmakers all over the field.  So just trying to hone your attention on one player, me in particular, I don't think that will go very well because we have a lot of relentless guys all over the field.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: He can definitely be value.  Some of the things the guy can create.  The match-ups the guy can create is pretty insane.  I think we should be following some game plan for him as well.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, it's definitely going to be a challenge.  We have done a lot of time and we are prepared.  We are prepared for difficult match-ups and whatnot, but they will lineup all over the field and do whatever it takes to get the ball in the playmaker's hands.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: No, he's 36, actually.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: He's a phenomenal athlete.  He's versatile.  He can line up in the fullback position, tight end position.  He can go out wide and be a Wildcat quarterback, so he can do pretty much anything on the field and it always helps an offense to have a player that versatile.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: It's definitely big.  If you ask me, I would say it's the best in the country.  The athletes Georgia produces each year-in and year-out.  It's crazy, playing South Georgia and being where I was at in particular, but all around the state of Georgia there is a lot of good football being played.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: South of Macon.  Yeah, considered middle South Georgia, so that's definitely it and you know guys in the Atlanta area, they have a thing against South Georgia guys and whatnot.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: He always -- we have a little about who produces the most out of South Georgia and Atlanta we always talk about and things like that.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Well, it was pretty -- my high school career was pretty amazing, like Friday Night Lights, being able to play under that, there is something different about hometown.  It's not like Sanford Stadium or nothing like that, but it's great playing on your home field in your hometown.  It's pretty amazing.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Definitely every weekend.  If I didn't play them I knew them from being in the state or something along those lines.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: Absolutely.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: You definitely see them and whatnot, you maybe played against them in high school, being able to see those guys.  They're definitely big.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: I don't think South Georgia needs to prove that, I think it's known that Atlanta wants to prove themselves like South Georgia.
Q. (No microphone.)
ROQUAN SMITH: That's what I would say.  That's what I'm going with.
Q. Can you talk about the Beef Bowl?
ROQUAN SMITH: I was just saying, man, it was amazing.  Just having that prime rib and everything like that, potatoes, the creamed corn, man, if was pretty amazing.
