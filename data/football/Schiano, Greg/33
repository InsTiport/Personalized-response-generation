 COACH SCHIANO: Sometimes you've got to make sure you go back to who you are. That's a good start. I think protection and things, we've got to get to work on. 
 I'll open it up for questions, but I just -- again, a young football team that didn't panic. A lot of times when you get a young group like that and you're in a situation like that, they can run for the hills, and they didn't. They just kept doing the best they could, and it turned. 
 It was really exciting for me to look up there and see that student section packed. Someone told me there was over 11,000 students there, and that's what it's all about, a young team growing up and a young fan base growing up, and now we've got to get going.

 Q. What was the mood like at halftime?
 COACH SCHIANO: Yeah, there was no panic. We're not going to do that. Just because the result isn't going the way that you want it to go, if you don't believe in your process then you've got to change your process, but you can't panic. If we weren't playing with emotion or we weren't playing hard -- we were playing hard. We may have been playing too hard some places where we were making mistakes, dropping the ball because we were running with it. We had two plays that could have went the distance but we dropped them. You're running before you catch it. Those are when you're a little bit ahead of yourself. We've just got to slow it down.

 Q. Do you think we saw anything differently that we hadn't seen the whole month of August? Was this pretty much what we had seen in August, the defense was pretty good, the line was maybe spotty?
 COACH SCHIANO: Yeah, a few more penalties than I thought we would have. I don't even know how many they were. They just seemed annoying at the time, like what are we doing on some of them. 
 But yeah, I mean, like I've said all along, we're going to be a much better team in November than we are in September. I hope what we grow here in September is going to be good enough. I'm excited as heck to get back with this team and get to work because I can see a lot of promise, and the best of it is they didn't panic, they just kept working. If you've got a group of guys, especially that are young that'll do that, they'll trust you and they'll do that, you're going to get better.

 Q. What did they learn?
 COACH SCHIANO: What do you mean what did they learn? 

 Q. You said it's good to learn when you win. 
 COACH SCHIANO: I think the exact thing I just said is that they didn't panic, and you just kept doing. They believe in the process. You see too many people -- I know you have to report the result, that's your job. But too many people get hung up on the result during the game, and what happens is that gets you off the beaten path. That gets you way out of whack. They learned that if you just keep going, if you do it right, it's not going to always turn out that you're going to win, but you're going to get yourself straightened out.

 Q. I know you work on it a lot, but did you ever think you'd get a field goal with one second on the clock?
 COACH SCHIANO: Sure. I mean, we were very fortunate, right, but the reason we were fortunate is because they had to stop the clock for the review, but that's called football. We have reviews. You could have stood there with your thumb up your nose and not gotten the team ready and get them out there and kick it, too. I thought our kids did a great job of getting out there and getting ready. 
 That's not easy to get it snapped with a second left. The guy is -- the umpire is backing away, and you've first-year snapper in Jonesy. I thought he was really good tonight. 
 We had a couple kids that broke in tonight, kind of slid in there, and you know, it's when you don't get noticed that it's good as a youngster. That's great when you get noticed for good things, but you know what I mean; nobody made big mistakes that were young, and they'll grow.

 Q. Aside from not panicking, did you learn anything about this team playing a regular season game that you didn't know this time yesterday?
 COACH SCHIANO: Well, you never know how they're going to be under that -- like I know we as a staff can slow Jordan Thomas down a little bit, and he's going to be -- what we saw in practice, I saw tonight. Now, we slow him down a little bit, just gear him back just a tad. 
 I knew that Joe was a better back this year than he was last year, and I saw that. 
 I knew that we had a young line that's a work in progress, and it's a work in progress. We've got some young guys behind, too. There's going to be competition there, which is good. Let those young guys get in there and hit somebody. We've got to get physical, and I've said that all along. That's been our goal. It's not going to change. It's still about blocking people. You've got to block them. 

 Q. With Chas getting in the game, what kind of role can he expect the next couple weeks?
 COACH SCHIANO: Well, look, as I've said always, there's always competition at every position in our program. Right now we have a starting quarterback who we're very, very confident in Tom Savage. Chas is our backup, and when the opportunity presents itself, whatever that opportunity is, I know he'll be ready. He's a cool customer. I mean, he's a freshman, but he was -- there was no -- let's go do it. So I'm excited about both those guys. 

 Q. Talk about Bing in the blocking game, getting his hands on the two punts. 
 COACH SCHIANO: Yeah, we were close a couple times tonight. It was really good to see Brandon get one again, scoring on defense, scoring on special teams, non-offensive touchdowns, good defensive football teams that's what you do, you put it in the end zone. Last year we had eight, and we've got one now, so let's get that thing going.
 He blocked another, just tipped it. I was happy that Brandon Bing played an entire game at corner tonight or whenever we took him out, 12 minutes left in the fourth quarter, but he played the distance, first, second and third down. He's never done that, so I was excited about that. I don't know how he played, but we didn't notice anything bad. 

 Q. How did Tom do tonight?
 COACH SCHIANO: I think Tom was racing a little bit. I've talked to him a lot. You don't have to be anything but you. Sometimes you get a lot of notoriety and who knows, maybe you start, oh, do I got to do this. I think this game will help him a ton. He'll put that tape on and watch it, say what the heck am I doing. Some of the protection, though, he got hit tonight. We've got to get that fixed. He ain't going to last getting hit in the back of the head like that like he did on that one swing pass. We need to work through that, and we will.
