LOUISVILLE  Â– 40
  RUTGERS - 13

 COACH SCHIANO: We have a lot to work on. So, that's what we're going to do. We're going to work on it. And improve. 
 Questions? 

 Q. The offensive line, you called it epidemic earlier in the year. Is it pretty much an apt description at this point?
 COACH SCHIANO: We've been struggling there, struggling there all year. It's no secret.

 Q. Two things, earlier in the season, when it wasn't going well, you talked about getting things fixed and this would be a better team obviously November. Why do you think that hasn't happened, either of those two things?
 COACH SCHIANO: There's a lot of reasons. It doesn't really matter. It hasn't happened. And we have one game left. I hope that we'll improve this week and play better at West Virginia.

 Q. Were you surprised when you look up and you see 40-13? You come into a game expecting to win. 
 COACH SCHIANO: Nothing surprises me. You play the game. It unfolds right in front of you. Did I think that we would do that? No, I didn't. I thought we'd play much better. Disappointed in the way we played, disappointed in the way we coached. We just didn't do a good enough job as an organization and they did. We got licked.

 Q. Was any of it effort that you saw?
 COACH SCHIANO: I don't think it's effort. I think it's execution. We're making mistakes now that we didn't make in the first six weeks of the season, which is disappointing now. 
 Is it because we're trying too hard? Maybe. Trying to make something happen, I don't know. But it's very frustrating, obviously. But we will get it fixed, that's what we do here.
 And this year we're running out of time. We only have one chance left.

 Q. As far as concentration, this is a little bit off topic, can you give me an idea how much their thoughts of Eric might affect their game-day concentration?
 COACH SCHIANO: Each individual is different. I'm not sure. I think I'd be naive to think it hasn't had an effect on our football team. But as I've told them, in life you're going to have things that are thrown at you, and the rest of your life doesn't stop. 
 We have not done a particularly good job with a lot of different adversities this year, foremost being Eric. But a lot of them we just haven't done a great job of handling it. 
 Again, I put it on me first; it's my job to get the ship steady and to right it. We haven't done that. But we will. It took a while to get built, and this program will continue to grow. We're having a little bend in the road. It's not the end. We'll be back. This isn't the end of the world.

 Q. How much can you do offensively when the offensive line gives up nine sacks? 
 COACH SCHIANO: What do you think? I mean, you tell me. That's an open-ended question, I guess, right? Not much. Two sacks at the half, right? What happened is in the last two drives, I don't know how many sacks we gave up. 
 I don't want to send a signal that you're getting out of there and we need to just improve. But then they just started sending more than we could block. And in retrospect run it and probably call it a day. But we didn't. So I'm not worried about numbers. I'm not worried about anything right now.
 I'm worried about getting better and making sure the young players we have in this program, they understand how it's done and that the older guys that have one more game left, that they understand how we're going to play this last one. And we have a great opportunity. It's 1-12 coming up. We have a one game season against West Virginia. As they go through this one painstakingly, we'll turn our attention to them.

 Q. What did Louisville do early on?
 COACH SCHIANO: Nothing. They outexecuted us. Nothing schematically that was confusing or anything like that. We made more mistakes than we've made, in the last two weeks, than we made all season.
 But, again, why do those mistakes happen? That's my job. 

 Q. The majority of the seniors are on defense. I know there was some thought this would be a good defense. Are you surprised or disappointed what's happened in the past two weeks? 
 COACH SCHIANO: Yes, very disappointed. But we're all part of it. Disappointed in all of us. Not discouraged, though. I know that what we do and how we do it is the right way for us. And we just need to do it well. When I looked at the Cincinnati tape, I saw the exact things that we have done in the past and didn't do. 
 I'm sure when I put this one on -- I didn't have to put it on, I watched it live, and it was easy enough. Cincinnati was a little harder to see from the field. This one wasn't as hard to see. It was nuts and bolts football. We just didn't execute.

 Q. You took a lot of pride in the Bowl streak. Is it frustrating for it to end this way? 
 COACH SCHIANO: It's frustrating in the fact that's become what we do here. Sometimes in life you've got to take a step back maybe to take two steps forward. Hopefully that's what we're going to do with this setback here. That's my plan, you know.

 Q. Aside from Eric's situation, you've been in the game a long time, coaching a long time, is this season right now, with all the close games and the last two weeks, defense giving up points, has this been a very different season, or is this just one of those types of seasons?
 COACH SCHIANO: This has been one-of-a-kind. This has been one-of-a-kind. But that's life. You gotta learn how to fight through one-of-a-kinds. It's a test. We're getting tested. From the outside, maybe we're not passing the test but from the inside we're passing the test. We'll be fine. We're learning a lot. We'll be fine. We're better than fine. We'll be real good.

 Q. You just didn't want to get Tom into the game, late in the game, just wanted --
 COACH SCHIANO: I don't think to put him late in the game, we left most of the guys in there through the game. We're trying to get better. I thought Chase, although his numbers weren't great it in the first half, I thought he was right on doing what he was supposed to do. I wasn't going to make any change. He came out and did well in the third quarter, I thought. 
 I don't know, when you get hit and sacked, the sacks are one thing. Getting hit the way he made some big throws and took a walloping, we need to get the offensive line improved. There's no doubt about it. 

 Q. I know it was hard to take any positives out of this, but what about Jordan Thomas and his running? Were you encouraged with that at all?
 COACH SCHIANO: It's not hard for me. That's one thing as a coach. It's like your own kids; just because one guy doesn't do well and the other guy does, you can't forgot about the one who does. I thought Jordan Thomas ran well. I think Jeremy -- Jeremy did a good job again. 
 Jordan did a good job, more of the conventional running game, to be able to mix it up and go back and forth. I was pleased with that. I thought Jordan ran the ball well.
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.
