Q. Playing indoors and also, of course, on turf.  For speed guys, for receivers, this is like a perfect setting for you, right?  Big plays to happen?
CALVIN RIDLEY: A hard surface like this, running fast as we can.  It looks fast.
Q. I know when you're game planning, you study Washington's defense.  Have you looked at their offense as well and do their receivers jump out at you?
CALVIN RIDLEY: Well, I heard about one of their receivers, John Ross.  He's one of the top guys.  But I haven't watched the offense.
Q. Talk about your memories of your game here a couple weeks ago, SEC Championship game.
CALVIN RIDLEY: I mean, we had a great time the last time we were here and I feel like we dominated all phases of the game and I had a couple of good plays that I'm proud of.  Just happy that we won it.
