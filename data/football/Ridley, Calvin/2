Q. Anything different about coming back, now this is the semifinal versus your previous trips here?
CALVIN RIDLEY: Grass is harder.  That's pretty much it.  It's the same, pretty much the same.  I like the stadium.
Q. So in terms of preparation, what do Coach Saban and the rest of your coaches look for in terms of building up to a game like this?
CALVIN RIDLEY: They just want to make sure we know what we're doing, make sure we're dominating and make sure there's no mess-ups from some of the easy things we do so we can go into the game and know all our stuff and dominate the game.
Q. What's been your favorite part of this week?
CALVIN RIDLEY: Some of the events, the Martin Luther King was pretty good.  The arcade thing that we went to, it was pretty fun.  They had one of these laser tag things you could sit down and play.  That was one of the coolest things I ever did.  That was pretty fun.
