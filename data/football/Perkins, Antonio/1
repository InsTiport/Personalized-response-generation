<p>	Q.  Do you look at this game as redemption, or do you have to approach this game as a completely different entity?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you pay attention when a job opens up and people say Coach Stoops is a candidate?  Do you guys even pay attention to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about the Florida job this year?  I think they had three candidates that weren't interested.  Were you guys ever concerned about that, that he might go to Florida?</p>
<p>	Q.  So you don't think he's going to go to another college?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a veteran of these type of games, what advice could you give some of the freshmen that are going to impact your team?  You guys have a kicker who hasn't been on this stage yet.  What advice would you give to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have confidence in him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you and the rest of your teammates sort of feel like it's your job to not put him in that situation, to have a lead late in the game so he doesn't have to make that big kick?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Texas game.  Have you seen any of the other bowl games this week?  There have been some exciting finishes. </p>
<p>	Q.  What can you take from a game like that?  What does that say to you about how you have to finish in these games?</p>
