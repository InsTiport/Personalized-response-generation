<p>	Q.  You came back this year to take a championship, conference championship, another shot at a national title.  Are you going to think about the Heisman a little bit, especially with the performance you had tonight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Stoops, is this as complete as a ballgame as you have played all year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Stoops, given the subjective nature of the BCS, did you feel like you not only had to win, but you had to win decisively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you compare the running game today to what happened two years ago in the championship and how well you ran against Houston?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have had some legendary defensive performances since your tenure at Oklahoma.  You hold a Colorado team under 50 yards offense, they get a field goal against you, but does it go down as best of the best?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for any of you guys.</p>
<p>	Q.  How tough is it to turn on the television, you guys play your hearts out, win a game, go home to the dorm and people on the television saying Oklahoma doesn't deserve to be in a national championship game.  Tonight is that a statement to them?</p>


<p>	Q.  Your offensive players, how important was it that opening drive, taking it right down the field to score the running and passing game?</p>

<p>	Q.  You have had an amazing freshman season.  You get the record for the 100 yard game freshman player tonight.  Is this the sweetest game for you? </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach Stoops, in 2000 you were in the same position, beat Kansas State here to beat Miami to go on to the Orange  Bowl.  This year you are doing it with players your coaches recruited.  Is that more satisfying, that you know that your programs work?  Talk a little bit about recruiting these players to be in this position.</p>
<p>	Q.  For any of the seniors, I know the emphasis you guys put on finishing in your preseason conditioning just talking about finishing your season, if this is the kind of performance you had in mind.</p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, how complete of a team is this that you have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason and Jammal, growing up in Oklahoma does it feel like the Orange  Bowl is the right place for you to play in the post-season?</p>



<p>	Q.  Bob, can you talk about the play your defensive line, particularly Mo Dampeer came up with big plays.  Do you have any idea what Remi's status will be because of the altercation on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how aware were you guys what was going on before the scores of USC and Auburn before the game?</p>

<p>	Q.  Adrian, I saw you munching on that orange after the game.  What are your thoughts now that your team has done everything you guys can to go to the Orange  Bowl and how did that orange taste? </p>

<p>	Q.  How valuable do you feel Antonio's return has been to your secondary?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason has been low key with the Heisman all year and AD is pretty low key about everything tonight.  Who would you tell the voters, Coach?</p>
