 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   It was cool, actually.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Man, it was hilarious.   We had too much fun.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   I think so‑‑ I think so, I think he's helped a lot.   Our entire defense has been working on little things and I think, you know, he is a prime example of that, that's why he's excelling the way he is.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Exactly, he's way more physical, he has a better understanding of the defense, he's maturing as a dominant football player.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Same, you know, we just‑‑ we have a mission and it's a big loss without Ifo but all we can do is do our best to make him proud, so you know, the DBs are working as hard as they've ever been and even better.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I think Troy has matured a lot, he's been balling this year, stepped up, especially as a leader.   High hopes for him, since he's been stepping it up.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   A little bit, you can tell by the way they prepare.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Okay.   You can tell by the way they prepare during the off‑season, who was focused on the year, especially like Troy and Ifo, they were focused all year being great leaders for the yuck guys so you know they mean business when this year was coming around.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   No, he's more which I will, mellow, we have a humble group of guys so he's not really like that, he's out there ready to ball.   He's going to perform.   We don't look at ourselves as I'm number one, number 2, we're all brothers, trying to make plays so that's the way we think of it on the defensive side of the ball.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I definitely think so, yeah, I definitely think so, he has that swagger, that's why we try to bring it to the table, if you're on the field you're No. 1, that's our mantra.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I'm not really sure about how they've improved but I know how they are right now.   They're big guys, pretty dominant, pretty athletic, I like to think of them as a Michigan State type of line or UCLA, but they're talented and really big.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I don't know, maybe.   We've dominated this year with those big teams, supposed to get ran over by Michigan State, supposed to get ran over by Stanford and so on, but we've been handling business, so that head line is not going to come but a head line is going to come, it always does.   A head line always comes.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Uh‑huh, yeah.   
   
 Q.   (Question about mentally preparing for a team that can come back at any time. )  
DERRICK MALONE:   What we basically have to do, is play a full and complete game.   Those guys find a way to win, no matter what deficit they're in they find a way to win so we have to make sure we're firing on all cylinders, we can't let up all game because these dudes have made it evident they can pull away and make a win.   
   
 Q.   Is it something that you need to stay even mentally?   If you go up 21‑0 in the second quarter maybe against another team and don't get‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, exactly, we gotta take it to 00, when the halftime comes if we're up or something like that, we got to think of it as zero‑zero, and we gotta get out there.   Bullet these guys, they really, it's crazy they find a way to win, they keep their composure and stuff but for us what we have to do is stay focused and we gotta keep firing, keep playing, keep playing and not give up.   
   
 Q.   Do your coaches talk to you about not getting too up and maintaining‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, definitely, the game is not over, stay focused, keep playing, stuff like that.   Some games we have been up a lot and let teams come back, especially the UCLA game, it left a tainted win on us, we didn't like that feeling because we thought we had a dominant performance that game but we don't want to have that feeling again.   We want to dominate on all levels.   
   
 Q.   It would still be nice not to play in the fourth quarter.   
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, yeah, that's‑‑ especially in the Rose Bowl, that would be a really great thing.   
   
 Q.   (Question about both teams having freshmen playing. )  
DERRICK MALONE:   It's crazy!   You know, young guys have been able to step up and contribute early.   So, you know, just like they have great freshmen, we have great freshmen and it's basically a credit to the program and the way that they're nurtured and brought to the program and having everyone step up their game.   
It's a tribute to both programs, we have sought‑out programs and that's why our freshmen are able to play the way they are.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Basically it's the off‑season, when they get there, show 'em the ropes, what they need to do, show 'em what to focus on and help guide them through.   Everyone has a talent, that come here, we all have the same talent, we improve a little bit but it's getting your head wrapped around what you need to do in that adjustment so we were able to get the freshmen adjusted in the quick amount of time, they're going to be able to flourish.   
   
 Q.   You guys have faced a lot of great offense in the Pac 12 but is there an offense that's similar in the Pac 12 to what FSU has?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Last year Heisman winner?   Hard to compare him but I like to compare him to Brett Hundley from UCLA.   The entire team I will say they're like Michigan State, that we played earlier this year and like UCLA for how many weapons they have, and how many things they can do and how big and athletic the line is.   That's what I would compare the team to.   
   
 Q.   Is it difficult for a defense in that there is no weak link at any of the position players?   There is no one you can wrap up in particular, seems like they all have the capability?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, but that's how it is in the Pac 12.   Each game we have to reload our minds because each team in the Pac 12 is going to attack us a different way, so we're prepared for anything that anyone can give us because all year long we're going against different teams but for them, we gotta be on our A game and really think about all things and all possibilities because like I say, they have all kinds of weapons, they're a complete, dominant team.   
We gotta make sure we match them.   
   
 Q.   How much one‑on‑one work do you do spring, preseason and maybe even bowl practice?   Do you do a lot?   
DERRICK MALONE:   One‑on‑one's?   Yeah, we do that probably every day, so we got a lot of practice going against Marcus and all those running backs.   
   
 Q.   Did you do any for bowl practice?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Definitely, yeah.   
   
 Q.   So having faced your offense is there a sense that there is not much more we could‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, we have one of the best offense in the nation so there is not much that we will be surprised about.   We have really great backs, one of the best quarterbacks‑‑ the best quarterback this year, so you know, can't really get better than that, better preparation than that.   
   
 Q.   Finally you may be covering‑‑ what kind of challenge will he present?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Quickness and hands, that's what I see.   You gotta stay focus and had try to lock him out, try to mess up timing and stuff like that.   All the players are dominant.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   (Laughter.)   Straight out football player.   
   
 Q.   Do you admire somebody like that?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, it's pretty cool.   I'm more flashy than that but some guys like to do it like that.   
   
 Q.   How hard is it for you guys, your mantra of "next man up" we hear about it and you're told about it but what's it like living that, when guys go down and somebody has to step in?   Do you think about it could be you next?  
DERRICK MALONE:   We try not to think about that stuff because that's going to put doubt into your mind and we're not a doubtful team, we try to stay mentally focused on what we have to do so if it's your turn up, even if you're on the field, our mantra is if you're on the field you're a one.   If you're on the field you got to play to the best of your ability.   The expectation we hold is that you play to the same capability as the number one's, the starters, so we don't look back.   
When we have someone down we gotta live up to their name and play for them because they would love to be out there with us.   
   
 Q.   When you lose a guy like Ifo, schemewise, can you expect to do the same thing or do you have to adjust a little bit?   
DERRICK MALONE:   No, we do the exact same thing, if we have a game play and we have a lot of great players and Ifo is an All‑American, but we still have a lot of great players that can get the job done.   So we really don't change our scheme based on a specific person.   
   
 Q.   Because you guys have experienced injuries all year, Ifo had been in and out of the lineup all year, how important was it for those guys to be able to step in?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Exactly.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, yeah, the young guys got a lot of valuable experience with Ifo being hurt all year so that's why I have in doubt in my mind that they're going to take care of business.   What I always tell people, Ifo is Ifo when he was a freshman in the Rose Bowl, so this is going to be kind of like the same thing.   No one knew that he was going to be the player he was going to be when he was a freshman corner in the Rose Bowl, but it's everyone's chance to step up.   We could be playing all of our corners.  
   
 Q.   Have you seen an offense as good that compares to that?   
DERRICK MALONE:   The way I like to compare it is Michigan State or a UCLA, that's how I like to compare those guys.   
   
 Q.   How so?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Big offensive line, very athletic.   They have a lot of different weapons and tools, they don't just lineup to one thing so you got to be on your P's and Q's with whatever they can attack you with.   
   
 Q.   You've seen watching game film their attack.   What was different about it?   
DERRICK MALONE:   I didn't notice a difference, what I focused on is how they are today, how they are now and really dominant.   They change their plays a lot and they're smart and talented so we got to make sure we play perfect technique so we can get around those guys.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   It's still kinda ladder, it's kinda hard especially with injuries because these guys come with us and fight with us each and every day, they prepare with us each and every day so it doesn't come any easier but we know how to accept it and continue to work hard and continue making their name known and playing for them.   
It's still difficult every time a guy goes down.   
   
 Q.   When you think of what injuries do on the field, sometimes you forget these guys are your friends.   
DERRICK MALONE:   Exactly.   
   
 Q.   How much of that is dealing with the injuries, it's my buddy?   
DERRICK MALONE:   It's tough because you know all their dreams and goals and what they want to accomplish and how much work they put in.   Put yourself in that position, how would you feel and we all empathize with them and that's why in practice we play even harder, because we all know how that feels when someone goes down.   
   
 Q.   Will O'Leary be the test tight end you guys have faced?   
DERRICK MALONE:   This year, I believe so, yeah, I think so.   
   
 Q.   What makes him so good?   
DERRICK MALONE:   He understands‑‑ I believe from seeing him on film I think he understands coverages in the sense of where he needs to go and the separations and the positions and he has sharp hands so he goes up and gets the ball and he's a dominant tight end so we got to make sure we lock him up.   
   
 Q.   Having said that, you're one of the best tight ends, if not the best tight end right now, do you expect to cover‑‑ (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I think so.   I've got to make sure I put up good technique and watch film but I think it's going to be a good match‑up.   
   
 Q.   The difference between your defense‑‑ (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   What happened to your defense?   A lot of people thought‑‑ (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Basically after that Arizona loss our entire defense mentality changed.   We came away more focused.   We practiced way harder and we knew what we had to accomplish.   We paid more attention to the details and that translated over the field.   We had less missed tackles, more take‑aways and more TFLs and disruption plays and we focused on being the elite defense and it carried over after the first loss.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Well, basically‑‑ it was basically we lost the game.   We don't lose too many games out of Oregon so it's a terrible feeling that you never want to feel again so we got to do everything in our power to ensure that we don't‑‑ anything that we don't feel that feeling again so that's what carried over on the field.   
   
 Q.   Was there any transition‑‑ (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Coach, no, not really because D.P. is the my coach so maybe you should ask another person that question so it's the same for me.   But like I say, the defense is more passionate, way more attentive and we focused on the details and everyone has a bigger knowledge of the entire scheme.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Not necessarily.   He just throws 'em sometimes, he's a real leader and puts the team on his back so sometimes he forces plays a little bit, but they come out with a victory.   That's his championship nature.   We gotta‑‑ if he makes a mistake, when he makes a mistake, we gotta make him pay for it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   (Laughter.) Yeah, definitely.   We have one of the best offense in the nation so we go against them each and every day so that's the best preparation that you can get coming up for this elite Florida State team.   
   
 Q.   How much do you see Marcus at practice?   
DERRICK MALONE:   We see him a lot, we go against them earlier in the year, but we see those guys and practice against them and go against them in different drills we do, yeah, individual drills and team drills and that's the best preparation you can get.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Right when he stepped on the field.   I already knew he was going to do high things, especially last year I thought he should have won it and this year I felt like he really deserved it and there were moments on the field when you were like, wow, how did he do that, how did he get out of that and throw that 60‑yard touchdown pass.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Oh, no, that's practice, carries from practice, everything that we do, especially the way that we practice and prepare.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Ones a little shiftier, and bigger, harder runner but they're dominant players, both of them.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   No, I haven't watched every single one.   
   
 Q.   What's wrong with you?   
DERRICK MALONE:   I still have time!   I still have time!   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I would say six or seven.   
   
 Q.   Obviously they came back a lot this year, did you distinguish between Winston's play and coming back versus first half play?   
DERRICK MALONE:   What I have noticed is they have the defenses dialed in, great coaches so they are able to make halftime adjustments and the defenses typically stay the same so they're able to rip 'em apart because they've been doing the same thing for the entire game.   That's what I've noticed, they pick it up and find a way to win.   
   
 Q.   You can tell they change the play calling and‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, based off the opponent that they're going against.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   He has another‑‑ a whole other element of speed to the game.   He's a   , fast guy and he's able to catch the ball and outrun you and stuff like that, so he has a whole other threat to the offense.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Scary stuff, you know, he'll run to the sideline and try to outrun you so you gotta make sure you keep good leverage and bottle these guys up in all phases.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, it's perfect preparation, you know, nothing that these guys have done that we haven't seen before, especially in practice.   So we're going to be prepared.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   I think so, yeah.   The more they use him the more of a threat the entire offense is.   You're not sure what they're going to do and you have a lot of different weapons especially with him he ads another entire element to the offense.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Man, all the nay sayers saying how terrible we are, we had an 11‑2 season, saying it was one of the worst seasons ever, stuff lining that, saying we're this and that but we honed in and focused, and we were hungry, especially after that season so we knew what we had to do and we did it pretty well this season.   
   
 Q.   Was it a kind of a players meeting or what was it?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Not really, it was just an understood thing.   We have the same coach, we're all like family so there was not like a players meeting, we bring our coaches in, because they're not some dictators, we were able to talk to them and things like that and we knew where we wanted to get and we're making great strides now and we knew where we wanted to end up.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   No, not at all, outsiders thought we wavered, but we knew not to count us out yet and we knew just to stay focus and had strong and like Chip said, we will pick our heads up and see where we leave off when it's all done with.   
We just got everybody together and stayed strong and now we're here.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   It was pretty easy, because they're all guys in the program.   We didn't bring some random new guy in.   We kept the structure and things are pretty similar.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Coach‑‑ the difference I see is Coach Helfrich is really like a players' coach.   You can tell he really, really cares about us, a lot, like his own sons.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   In my opinion he's able to read coverages well, find cushions, find ocean and whatnot, so he's able to catch the ball, he has sharp hands and he's able to catch the ball and whatnot so it's their goal to go to a tall receiver.   
   
 Q.   Do you see him looking for Nick for the tight end?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Oh, yeah, I believe he's an All‑American or something like that?   Yeah, so of course he's going to look for him.   He's going to use all the weapons he can.   I think he should go for it.   We just got to make sure we cover all their threats.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Um, he can run.   He still can run like Brett Hundley, this ask that.   Pass routes especially to the tight end.   He's a real big guy so you gotta make sure when you tackle him you get multiple bodies on him so he's a real big threat especially for the linebackers.   
   
 Q.   What are the other keys?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Leverage, technique, just the basic stuff we need to do, no missed tackles, missed opportunities, stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   A lot has been made about Marcus and how he exudes leadership style.   Talked to an offensive guy yesterday and they have an obvious connection but defensively does his leadership cross the boundary of a position?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Basically seeing how hard he works and more leading by example.   He doesn't say too much to the defense as we don't say too much to the offense but it's basically leading by example, you see the way he carries himself and handles his business and stuff like that.   That's natural leadership and it rubs off on each and every one of us.   
   
 Q.   Is it the type of thing where some guys I feel like they want to be the Alpha dog leader but it's said about Oregon the structure that‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, everyone.   
   
 Q.   Is that something that he fostered?   
DERRICK MALONE:   It's fostered by Coach, we have that horizontal leadership so we all govern each other, we don't have that Alpha dog or whatever, so whatever needs to be the leader is the leader that's how we need to approach thing.   
   
 Q.   That's been the buzz word, how do you learn that?   
DERRICK MALONE:   It gets preached all the time, and you just know that, that's why we have so many young guys that can step up and perform the way that they perform because we have that horizontal leadership, and one can be a leader no matter what class you are from, and we really live true to that.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Oh, God.   Just like every day.   
   
 Q.   I know it's it is morning!   
DERRICK MALONE:   It's like every day so it's kinda‑‑ let's see, um, I don't know, like the way I think about it is we have a scout guy or a younger scout guy and things aren't going right it will be a freshman or a sophomore yelling at those guys saying we got to pick this up, this isn't going right, he doesn't have to do that but even though he's in a role he probably doesn't want to be in, he's still being a leader and leading whenever he can.   
   
 Q.   What's the biggest thing that stands out to you‑‑ (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   He's a leader.   He keeps his composure no matter what happens, one thing that's funny to me, when they get a big play he's running down the field being a lead backer and you don't typically see that from quarterbacks.   
   
 Q.   I know the guys on Florida State's team say that makes them want to play harder‑‑  
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   When they see how crazy hard he works with them.   Is that the same with you guys and Marcus?   
DERRICK MALONE:   Yeah, definitely, but that happens in practice.   You see him practice and the way he practices, it makes you want to pick up our game just by the way he prepares.   
   
 Q.   For you guys, your coach being the only coach in this Final Four without a championship, do you guys feel more pressure?   
DERRICK MALONE:   We always feel the pressure, somehow people seem to count us out and this and that so right now we gotta prepare and prove and shock the world!   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   Basically seeing him in fall camp, how big he is, he's huge!   So when he really came out, we had high hopes for him but we knew there were talented guys in the backfield but he's flourished this year and is really doing his thing.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
DERRICK MALONE:   I think so.   I think so.   The way that we do things we have horizontal leadership so the way we structure things they could step up so it's be the a surprise.
