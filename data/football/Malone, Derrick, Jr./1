  DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   This is my first time up here on this big thing.   It's pretty cool.   Enjoying every bit of the ride.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's amazing.   It's the granddaddy of them all.   We're really blessed to be here, get where we are today.   We've worked really, really hard for it.   We've accomplished a lot.   We're having a lot of fun, enjoying the festivities.   We're enjoying all of it.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   They're talented on all levels.   They have a lot of different weapons, and they use a lot of them pretty well.   They always find a way to win, even though they get down.  
This team is really, really talented.   Their offensive line is really, really big, athletic.   Same as their running backs, quickness.   Their quarterback is an extraordinary player, great leader.  
So we have to make sure we're firing on all cylinders to stay in the game.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   They play a totally different game.   He's a bigger type guy, harder to bring down.   They both stay up and extend plays.   They have really great players.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It will be something different.   We've never experienced that before.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I think he's a real dominant leader.   He's able to extend plays and put the team on his back and make the game go his way.   I really respect that a lot about this team.   
You can tell by the way he does things other quarterbacks don't do.   Like a running back will run out the back, be the lead blocker down the field.   Where did that come?   I can only imagine that people seeing him play that hard, or a team play that hard, make them want to play even harder.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   They're both leaders, both quarterbacks.   They both are very accurate.   They have a different style of play.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Yeah, it helps a lot.   We are prepared.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He does everything right.   Young guys really look up to him.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   This year, he's doing everything right.   That's what you've got to do.   People notice that.   He does everything right off the field, carrying over on the field.   Everyone looks up to him.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We're going to go in prepared.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We really stepped it up.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He pumps everyone up.   Whoa, Marcus, calm down.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He's one of the most humble guys I've ever met in my life.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He always does everything right.   People take note of that.   He's that kind of guy, I believe.   Over the years he's gotten more vocal, came out of his shell.   That comes with experience, more mature.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He's super funny.   He's really talkative with us.   He's shy with the media.   He's a real shy, humble guy.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I really don't know.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Oh, that's a hard one.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Get the right calls out.   Make sure that I communicate properly with my teammates.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We have to (inaudible).   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We really don't have a certain player.   We just have to play our game.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Not really.   We play a lot of big guys.   But I think we do have a little bit of an advantage.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I've never seen a team come back as they do.   So hungry to win.   It's going to be a big challenge.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We're the same way.   We usually don't fall back in that deficit, behind points, we have the same attitude.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   For me personally, after the Arizona loss, how we came back from that, we worked hard, everyone on the field.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's amazing.   Each and every day, a lot of people doubted us.   But we did extraordinary things and we're happy about it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Each and every day we prepare.   Each and every day it's about preparation.   We're getting better each and every day.   Everyone is coming along.   I can't wait for the Rose Bowl.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Just communicate things, little team things, just normal things.   We have a lot more days to prepare and make sure we are at the right level for game time.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   He talked to me after.   He's a soft spoken guy.   He does everything right off the field as well as on the field.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Honestly we play for each other.   We have a common goal.   We all come together, that's why we're always able to do our job and come together and work together as a team.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I want it more than anybody else, I have that drive and that hunger that nothing is going to stop me.   That contributes.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   When I was younger I really loved Taylor Mays from USC.   I always wanted to be a hard hitter like him.   I looked at his college days.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   My mom.   Seeing her going through adversity and getting stronger every day.   She's really my inspiration.   Also my aunt that passed away while I was in high school.   I play every game for her.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's going to be a big challenge.   He's a dominant quarterback.   It's a dominant team.   They have a lot of different weapons they utilize.   We have to make sure each and every one does their job.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I've never heard of this before.   It's going to be pretty extraordinary to see these two guys go at it.   I'm really excited, especially as a lover of football.   I can only imagine what the fans are like.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's going to be a great game.   There's going to be a lot of back and forth, everything like that.   We have to make sure if they make mistakes we find a way to capitalize on them.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I've been here before, but it never gets old.   I loved it.   I used to always watch the Rose Bowl games growing up, so it's always like a dream come true.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's the granddaddy of them all.   I'm really blessed and happy to be here.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We have similarities.   He's an extraordinary player, their leader.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Definitely.   There's a handful of us who have been here before.   We told the young guys to enjoy themselves, but this is definitely a business trip.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's weird.   (Inaudible.)  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   The uniforms, stuff like that.   But once I got up there it was definitely the people, Oregon is way different than California.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We have to do our job, have communication, make sure we don't miss tackles and stuff like that.   We have to make sure everybody does their job.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We really don't worry about that.   But we have to prepare, it's the way we practice and prepare.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Not at all.   We'll play anybody, doesn't matter if they're close or 1,000, 2,000 miles away from us.   We are just going to play our best game and prepare.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We honestly have to do our job.   We have the passion and the fire and everything usually finally clicks.   We digress after a season goes on, especially in November, but we've been elevating, trying to get better each and every day.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   For me, personally, it's hard to step out of the shadows, we're a pretty dominant defense, as well.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We have to be in the right place at the right time.   They have a great system, a lot of patterns, we have to make sure you're doing your job.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Not necessarily.   We have to do our job they're a dominant team, so they're going to have their best performance.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Michigan State, so many different weapons.   They execute a little bit better.   I think there are a lot of similarities.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Big games, big plays.   That's what we're really focusing on.   We're great to be here.   We're happy to be in the position we're in.   We worked really hard, so we've got to capitalize on it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   How big he is and how he puts the game on his back.   
He's going to keep us on our toes.   You might think you've got him down, but he'll pop up and try to make a play.   We need to corral him, gang tackle him.   We need to be where we need to be.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   It's heart racing.   Sometimes you can't believe it, but we have to capitalize on every opportunity.   We have to prepare properly.   This is a once‑in‑a‑lifetime opportunity.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   All that preparation carried over.   We have a great leader.   He makes plays.   He won the Heisman Trophy.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I've played with a lot of great quarterbacks in my career here.   We've even played against Marcus in practice.   He doesn't scare me.   We respect them a lot.   We know they're a great team.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We have to concentrate on getting around it, make sure we capitalize on every play, take every opportunity that we can.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   You know, their offensive line is really, really talented.   They're really, really dominant guys.   Really athletic.   They definitely have a running game.   We really need to stop that.   That's one of our main primary goals is to stop their running game because they're really effective there.  
   
 Q.   Do they remind you of anybody?  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   I believe Michigan State.   They're a lot similar to Michigan State.   We know the different packages they do have.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Well, yeah, we have to perform and have control and stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   No, he's crazy.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Oh, yeah.   Speed and personality.   It will be a great matchup on the sidelines.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   We've been hanging out, playing some pool, just relaxing, stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DERRICK MALONE, JR.:   Had a steak at Lawry's, had a steak with the boys.   I really couldn't believe it, never dreamed of playing in the Rose Bowl, this is my second one.   It's crazy, I'm living the dream.
