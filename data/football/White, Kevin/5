<p>	Q.  Are you looking at any of the guys that are currently on staff that might stay on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you had a chance to see any Notre Dame games this past season and what your impressions were of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you had to sell the program again to your current players.  How do you sell the program to the recruits given some of the turmoil that's gone on?</p>
<p>	Q.  What will your involvement be with the current team in terms of its Bowl game, will you attend the game?</p>

<p>	Q.  So when you went to school here, did you attend all of the home games?  Did you make road trips?</p>

<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of discussion about the schedule maybe being too tough and academics maybe being too tough here for Notre Dame to be an elite program.  I wonder what your feelings are?</p>

<p>	Q.  I was referring to the process of becoming a head coach and how you thought that affected you previously, how important was that in terms of getting the attention you felt you deserved as being a head coach, and what does it mean to be standing here today in this position?</p>
<p>	Q.  The surgery that you went through, I read that you talked about becoming a head coach, it was important to lose weight and appearance --</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it fair to say that you always dreamed of being NFL head coach; and if so -- I don't want to put words in your mouth. </p>
