Q. (No microphone).
KAMRIN MOORE: Obviously, it's tough losing here.  It hurts.
Q. (No microphone)?
KAMRIN  MOORE: It's tough.  Obviously, working with a short field, you've just got to work with it.  You've got to try to stand up, be a defender.  That's what we tried to do.
Q. (No microphone).
KAMRIN  MOORE: I guess because he's more of a dual quarterback, the run and pass action off the run.  Tough to defend.  We tried our best to contain him.
Q. (No microphone).
KAMRIN MOORE: I just focus what I can control.  Always.  (No microphone).
Q. Did you talk to him at all?
KAMRIN MOORE: I spoke to him.  Told him to continue to keep your head up.  Can't control it.
Q. Kamrin, the disappointment, how hungry (no microphone).
KAMRIN  MOORE: If I could, I would.  That's what I want to do.  I want to go back and watch the film and correct whatever needs corrected, come back, and do it.  Thank you.
