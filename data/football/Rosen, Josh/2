Stanford - 56  UCLA - 35

Q. Did Stanford surprise you at all today?
JOSH ROSEN: No.  They lined up, they did what we thought they would do and they just out executed us.
Q. What did you see on that first interception?
JOSH ROSEN: What was it?  Yeah, it was cover four.  We had a sort of pretty deep out breaking route.  I liked the leverage on it, and they just sat on the sticks.  I mean, if we didn't luck out, it would have been a touchdown, but hindsight is 20/20.
He just sat on the sticks, and I under threw it a little bit.  But those kind of throws I kind of have to put it really, really high and away.  So it will either be a big catch or it will be out of bounds.  So, I gotta clean it up.
Q. Was there a certain play where it seemed like the game started to get out of hand?
JOSH ROSEN: Probably.  I don't remember.  I was a little frustrated that we couldn't score coming out of the first drive in the second half.  But other than that, no, nothing I remember particularly.
Q. You guys came out passing a lot more in this game.  How much of that was kind of seeing run/pass options and pick and pass a little bit more and how much of it was called?
JOSH ROSEN: A lot of it was called.  It was just -- it worked, so we kept going with it.
Q. In terms of the losses that you've had, where does this stand?
JOSH ROSEN: I don't know, it's very frustrating.  I really wanted to beat this team.  I really wanted to make a statement.
