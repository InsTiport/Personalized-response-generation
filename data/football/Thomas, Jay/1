Northwestern State - 24, Louisiana Tech - 52
Q. Anything you'd like to say about the game tonight?
JAY THOMAS: Yeah, I'd like to say that Louisiana Tech has a really good football team, and you know, they have a lot of weapons.  Proud of our guys.  You know, you come into an environment like this on the road.
First game of the season, you know, I thought we played, did some things pretty well.  Go back, clean them up and get ready for next week.
