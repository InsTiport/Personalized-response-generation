Utah State - 23, San Diego State - 17
Q. Ryan, could you talk about the resiliency of the team coming back from that deficit in the fourth quarter?
RYAN AGNEW: Yeah, I guess the only thing we can kinds of take positive from this is we didn't quit. We didn't fold and we had many chances, too. It was really good to see those guys keep fighting and doing everything we can to win the football game.
Q. What did you guys have drawn up on that fourth and ten?
RYAN AGNEW: The one we scored on, or the last one?
Q. The last one.
RYAN AGNEW: We had a play drawn up to get one across the middle. I should have stayed in there a little longer and tried to deliver a throw. Give the receivers a chance rather than, you know, doing what I did.
Q. Could you talk about just that fourth down, you passed to Kobe for the touchdown on, take us through that play?
RYAN AGNEW: It was a miracle at that point. Dropped back. They played like a prevent defense and nothing was really open. Just tried to buy enough time. Tried to find an open guy and Kobe made a great play, being open over there. I was lucky to deliver it to him, and he made a great play on it. FastScripts by ASAP Sports ...
