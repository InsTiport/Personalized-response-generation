COACH BIELEMA:   Give credit to Michigan State obviously to pull out another game like that at the end. 
I thought our guys invested a lot into that game during the course of the week, players, coaches, everybody involved, and, you know, to go nine straight weeks and then to be on the verge of getting everything back to where we wanted to be is difficult to swallow but probably a good time for a bye week to get ourselves healthy from an injury standpoint, don't know anything further on Joel, it was a left shoulder injury, and we'll get some information out when we can, but I thought we played really well defensively, did a heck of a job until the final few minutes there but kept putting our defense out there trying to play a field position game. 
Give credit to the critical field goals, Kyle French, and obviously getting that last touchdown was difficult and I know our guys will get better and hopefully move forward here in a short fashion.   With that I will open it up. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, we felt better with the field goal from the left hash and that's the one where he tried to cut it back inside and we had gotten in that formation a little earlier in the game and thought it was going to be there and obviously didn't convert but just get ourselves into a field goal position. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   I think it was on Sam honestly, I saw it as the play happened.   I didn't hear an announcement. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, I mean, obviously you have a plan with Joel and really didn't matter what quarterback was in there but the change of the quarterback changes the game itself, didn't change anything playwise anything like that, difficult spot for him to come into, let Danny handle it and we just got to make sure‑‑ the plays that hurt us in retrospect were the negative yard plays, we can't play behind the chains and that was causing us to play off rhythm and not get ourselves into a position to have success on third down. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   The game winner, it was a slot receiver, and I don't know if he did a double move but I know we were playing, talked about slant game but I don't know if that guy did a double, broke it back outside. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, on the play that that hit was going to be a big hit, they had adjusted it a certain way and looked that way and that obviously took momentum on that play to turn around and turn it into a second and whatever it was but felt good about that, going into the game plan, obviously it didn't work there.   That's a shame because that was probably a big hit if we would have been able to execute it cleanly. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Well, the first one I can't remember the exact semantics, but it was either going to be‑‑ they told me originally the reason it went back and forth they told me it was going to be a spot foul which means where we tackled them they were going to tack on 10 yards on top of that and then they turned around and said no, it was a difference of 4 yards, and then the last one in the fourth quarter it was either going to be second and 18 or first and 25 so we took the second and 18. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, you know, obviously give credit to Michigan State.   We thought they would be able to‑‑ we knew it would be a tough task but we were never able to get anything going on the ground and anytime that happens for us offensively it's never going to be a good day. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   I don't know what his numbers were when he left the game but he definitely threw the ball, we've been on him to try and get rid of the football when he's feeling pressure.   I can't remember the exact semantics of the play he got hurt on but I know they had him covered up and he just wished he could have gotten rid of the football quicker. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   You know, they did obviously‑‑ made some nice adjustments, we gave up that play that Jimmy just talked about, you had them backed up second and 18 and I think it was a Z‑stutter, came underneath No. 2 and hit a big play like that obviously hurt us. 
And the original touchdown to get 'em into the overtime was a shovel pass we defended for a second but then it came in behind it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, you know, he's really‑‑ I would say over the last two or three games built his confidence and we all knew the Perdue game wasn't great but didn't falter, didn't waver, he's a sophomore getting better and we're a young football team that unfortunately has to go through life lessons, learning experiences, but that will only make us stronger in the future. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Very tough, very tough, you know, it's a‑‑ I think this group after what we've been through earlier in the year felt they were on a mission to get to a special place and those things are still in front of us. 
I think the options that we had before today are still there as far as getting to where we want to be but we just like winning.   7‑2 sounds better than 6‑3, so we just got to make sure we don't lose anybody along the way, be smart, take care of ourselves, get ourselves healthy and take advantage of the bye week as best we can and get ready to play on the road at Indiana. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   We can't‑‑ because they're down after a loss, we can't lose anybody that doesn't want to believe in finishing this thing out the right way.

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   What we wanted to do is have a positive play and we had the next call already in but when we got backed up, I didn't want on put ourselves into a position to convert that third down play so there is another one where you want to get rid of the football when that situation pops up. 
THE MODERATOR:   All right, Coach, thank you.
