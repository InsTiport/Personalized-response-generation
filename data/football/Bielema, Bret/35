  UTEP           26

THE MODERATOR:   Coach will have opening comments and then we can take questions.   
COACH BIELEMA:   I told the guys in the locker room, nothing comes easy to this group.   I was very excited for today to get here because I thought we would truly find out what kind of guys we have and for us to play well in the first half, we didn't put 'em away, gave up the field goal at the end, you could feel the momentum swing to their sideline and obviously on the drive when they scored and got within 4 I thought our offense made a huge statement to drive down the field and James to get it in the end zone, there were key plays there, third down and passes that Joel did a nice job with.   A lot of new guys getting opportunities, Montee, don't know anything medically but I was happy to see Melvin and James respond as positively as they did and really there wasn't anybody looking around our team knew those guys could handle the work load and Stave to get the win and his first start, obviously he wishes he had that one back, but to respond the way he did and throw those balls deep in the first half, I thought he did a good job.   
Our defense did a great job, we weren't going to let anything go over the top of us, I thought Marcus tried knocking it down and he will take a huge learning step.   I was happy with Jack Russell, he popped in there and did a nice job of picking up where we put him in for Kyle and did a nice job on the kick‑offs and young guys getting out there, Lance Baretz, Jake Stangel move caused that last fumble, new guys, Andrew Wise, David Gilbert, I don't think it's going to be anything too severe, and Tyler Dippel got a leg whip there he thought but knowing him he will be back.     Kelly should be back next week, he was on the very large of it this week.   Open it up for questions.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   I thought Joel‑‑ those particular plays obviously signed plays, play action, that's his game.   He should be able to convert those.   I thought some of the critical plays were some of the‑‑ I always say this, you guys have heard me say about quarterbacks we have had or compete against.   Great quarterbacks are the guys that can make plays when there isn't an answer, and he made some scrambles and plays in the first half that kept drives alive and I think that's huge for him confidencewise for him to move forward because everything is not always going to be as clean as you want.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Yes, I could.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Well, they're 3‑1, it's not where we want to be but I told our guys the other day, going into this week we were 2‑1 and it could, 3‑0 but it could have been 0‑3.   We responded as best as they could, we continue to work with them and grow.   Our kids, I think, and coaches are learning every day in our program because you know this is the first time I've gone through this rodeo with six of my guys, too, so it's a learning curve every day.   There has never been anything looking around big eyes, whoa is me, feeling sorry for yourself, our guys just keep working and go moving forward.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Where do we get better?   We moved the ball, not just running the football, in the passing game you saw some things very, very positive, Abby was open on the two huge throws but just to throw the ball and catch it and complete it, it is a big deal, that was positive.   There were too many critical penalties, I thought our after at times, I know Chris had a personal foul for hitting the quarterback, inexcusable and off‑sides as well, I think there was one on defense, but to rebound the way he did, bat that ball out‑of‑bounds, that's the last thing I told that hands team he was yelling that as they walked out, you can always bat that ball out of bounds and that's what he did.   So I thought there were things that worked better today.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Absolutely.   Yeah.   We definitely did.   I think we got cleaner on offense as far as what we wanted to do, game plan, pregame, by that I mean not pregame today but during the course of the week came up with numbers that we would want to get Montee and Melvin and James all involved.   There were sets I know you saw before Montee went out that involved just Melvin and James and that's a set for them to get reps and opportunities.   The good news is we've‑‑ we haven't showed a lot of the things that we have been working on so I think there are nice things that can come down the line that haven't been shown net.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   It's a tremendous challenge to go on the road and win the way you want to in this league so that's an opportunity that we have in front of us.   We get better every week, the team has the right attitude, like I said I don't have any worries about the way guys handle their work during the course of the week and we will see where we are Saturday.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   What do we do with the kickers?   Jack took the job and we'll see where he is.   Kyle has done some things but we can't have those lapses.   We can't spot the ball on the 35‑yard line, one last week and one this week and the good news is Jack is confident and he made the kicks today, getting hang time on those kick‑offs, he had four kicks Thursday night and he was confident he was going to make 'em all so he did a good job.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Well, we didn't want to play him in the kicking game, so he knew he would be there offensively and he's a smart player.   I think we can put him in certain situations but you saw Ken come up with a third‑down play today.   The more people concentrate on Abbey the more it allows others to open up and Jared is a phenomenal football player.   Yeah, he did.     

Q.   (No microphone.)
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, he did, I don't know if it was a full concussion, I'll let the doctors decide that, but Montee gets a lot of attention because of the person he is and all those guys knew that 25 gets ahold of the football good things were going to happen, and he is a guy that's going to be a special football player.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Not to gave away the game plan but they had to be the way they popped up and I was happy with him.   He went out there and executed, he pulled the field goal on that left hash and didn't feel the way we were going to go at that time and Jack had been doing well, and he kicked it.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   There was only one play out there that I didn't like, and that was the pick.   He obviously would like to take it back.   Joel had a practice on Wednesday he had a few things go wrong, and he came back on Thursday and I thought the guys helped him get into position, and Danny and Curt were out there giving him as much advise as anybody.   

He's going to be a good quarterback.   He's tall, athletic, he's smart at the line of scrimmage, he doesn't hide things.   When he comes over to the sideline he tells you the truth what he really sees, and as a coach you can make that better, if a kid is telling you something that he wants to avoid getting yelled at or corrected in the right way, he tells it the way it is.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   I actually didn't talk to him about that, I let Matt‑‑ I flipped over to defense but I didn't see the play that happened on the side lines.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   I think two things, Montee had gotten reps the first three games and just, you know, to go into a Big 10 season we didn't think he would be able to do that for the entire season, but also you just watched 25 and 20 practice.   They're very, very good players and spread the wealth, get it around a little bit and it will help Montee in the long run to know those guys can come off the bench and do good things.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Just because in my coaching career we have never lost a nonconference game, I got to believe that‑‑ is that what you mean‑‑ 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, opponents.   When you schedule these games they're scheduled so far‑‑ obviously UTEP wasn't but a certain amount, you get teams when they're good, and we got that I thought Utah State last week was a very good football team, you have seen the teams they bet and what happened.   I was watching the Oklahoma game three weeks ago, and I thought oh boy here comes another one.   It's made us better, and the good thing is we have been in some 4th quarter games and these teams that are routing people and that stuff, that's worth it's weight in gold to be able to say that.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, Ethan is warrior.   He doesn't always look the prettiest, but he's always in the right place, he's intelligent, a great character kid.   He ran in the middle of my drill the other day, and I got on him pretty good, and it said ‑‑ and it was classic humor.   He's a fun kid to be around.   He benefits as a hockey player, all‑around athlete, he's good at staying on his feet.   He never is on the ground, he's got good balance and I think that gets him in a lot of plays.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Not at that point.   I thought Jesse Hayes did a nice job, too, guys rolling in there, having some fun with it.   I thought Charlie Partridge my new line coach did an outstanding job.   He's piecemealing guys there together.   I was giving Bo heat coming off the field there, he finally got on the scoreboard with that sac.   He has been impressive in fall camp.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   You know what, Tom?   Those interior linemen you don't know how well they played until tomorrow's field but Costi, he's engaging, as far as before the game and everything he puts in a lot of preparation, overtime, he's thirsty for knowledge, and I think the linemen liked having him in there.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Yep, yep, absolutely‑‑ I don't want to give you guys misinformation but it didn't do me any good to say that we were going to start a first‑time guy at right guard, so the only time I will fib to you guys is if it's in the best interest of our team and I don't mean to upset anybody.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   I know.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Yeah, he was a guy there at the end, and I wrote Chris a note last week.   He was the featured guy on our program cover and he's an unbelievable football player, but obviously everybody had their own opinion whether I should move him, and obviously you can tell he's a really good player in the middle there, and he's making good plays.   

The only time he gets in trouble is when he tries to do something he didn't need to do.   He had a hit today that would have been a big hit, and he blitzed the wrong guy and as a true linebacker, the plays come to you.   You play your scheme, inside out to the football, the way you're supposed to flow to the football, and you will make plays.   But he has a knack for it, to bat it out‑of‑bounds the way he did at the end of the game is freaky.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Absolutely.   I've been telling the defensive coaches since that first game when we gave up three scores, "Just let our guys play" if they make a first down, okay.   Just get the first down and play another set of downs, don't give 'em the freebies, like that last play.   We just can't allow that to happen and expect to beat good people.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Well, yeah, right‑hand quarterback so rolling right‑‑ 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Those are designed plays.   We're just trying to make‑‑ a lot of times you do things that‑‑ he can throw it good to the left, though, that's one thing‑‑ as a defensive coordinator, it used to drive me nuts you would chart an offense and they would have 75 boot legs to your defensive left and none the other way and I know it's difficult but it can be done and he's been able to do that.   

Q.   (No microphone.) 
COACH BIELEMA:   Absolutely.   The offensive coaches had a good game plan.   Those guys have been grinding it out and everybody is throwing bombs at them and telling them they aren't doing what they need to do.   They designed some nice things.   UTEP defensively you could see their eyes weren't in the right spot all the times, and we were trying to create misdirections, with motions and giving it to them, not giving it to them and in the play action, we knew it was going to be there and those don't‑‑ we didn't just draw those up on the sidelines.   Matt developed those during the week, and knew we would be able to have match‑up issues.   

THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for coach?   Thank you, Coach Bielema.
