  THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Jay. 

Q.   The Mountain West championship game, pretty good game.   Explain what was going through your mind when you were named the Mountain West champions once again?
JAY AJAYI:   Like I said, a dream come true.   It was one of our goals at the beginning of the season, to make sure we brought an outright Mountain West championship back to Boise State because that had never been done before.   At the end of the game, we didn't play our best football, but we came out champions.   That was the greatest feeling in the world, a moment I'll never forget. 

Q.   What are your plans for the future?
JAY AJAYI:   I did declare for the NFL Draft.   That is something exciting I do have for my future. 
Just right now I'm really just focused on playing in this Fiesta Bowl and making sure that Boise State does whatever we can to make sure we get a win. 

Q.   What kind of things are you looking for from Arizona to stop you?
JAY AJAYI:   They just play hard all the way through the whistle.   They have their player with Scooby Wright, the leader of their defense.   It's going to be a great challenge for us to be able to play another great team.   But we're excited for that challenge and opportunity. 
We know if we execute, we'll be able to get a lot of good things done.
