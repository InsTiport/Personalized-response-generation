DABO SWINNEY: First of all, really sloppy finish there, 3rd and 19 and we get a and bad PI. Just not playing smart right now. They're going to make some plays. A couple of throws to No. 1 were just great plays. They've got great players. We had pretty good position, but just dumb stuff, man. Really disappointed in how we finished and especially right there on the 3rd and 19. We've just got to play smarter, and then I thought we had two bad possessions offensively. So get in here, let's settle down. It's a long time. This is going to be a battle in the second half. We've got two great teams, and right now they're up. See how we finish.
