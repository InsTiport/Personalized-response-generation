Q. How do you think things went out there today?
CHARLIE BREWER: I think they went good.  Weren't out there for too long with the weather and stuff.  I think it went well.  Showed a little bit of improvement that we've made and we just gotta carry that on into the summer.
Q. How do you feel how much you've grown from last year to this year?
CHARLIE BREWER: As in just --
Q. As in player, everything.
CHARLIE BREWER: I think just leadership-wise, just being more comfortable with all the guys and stuff like that has really helped.  Just feeling more comfortable with just the offense, the receivers, the O line, really the whole team.
Q. Coach Rhule mentioned before the game that something about going to a bowl game this next year.  That's something he's mentioned before.  What is it about this team that makes you believe that y'all can do that?
CHARLIE BREWER: Well, we've got a lot of talent.  And y'all didn't see most of it today.  A lot of it we've got a few guys that can make really good plays on the outside.  It will be good to get them back.
Just the work ethic all spring, all offseason and I know we're going to carry that into the summer and into the fall.
Q. How important was it for you to get the rapport with some of the younger players, with some of the older guys, you know what they can do, being out?
CHARLIE BREWER: It's key.  I was kind of in the same situation they're in now.  It's really crucial to get reps.
