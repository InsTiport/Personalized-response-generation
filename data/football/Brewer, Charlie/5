Texas - 38, Baylor - 7
Q. Coach mentioned that you and Zach both got dinged up a little bit.  Are you hurt, injured?  Are you okay?
CHARLIE BREWER: Yeah, I'm good.  I'll be ready to go next week.
Q. What was it like facing the Texas defense?
CHARLIE BREWER: They're a good defense.  I just didn't think we executed very well on offense.
Q. It wasn't what you guys weren't able to do more so than what they did?
CHARLIE BREWER: I mean, they're a good defense, we just -- too many penalties.  We had a lot of stuff to deal with.
Q. From the highs of last week, even though you lost the game, the way the offense looked today.  What's that like?
CHARLIE BREWER: It's disappointing to not come out fast today.  We just need to regroup and get ready for next week.
Q. Coach mentioned that Monday will sort of tell the story, how you guys come into Monday.  How do you feel like you guys will approach it?
CHARLIE BREWER: Yeah, we've got to attack it, respond in a positive way, which I know we will, and go get a win next week.
Q. Are you feeling a lot of pressure to win right now, break through?
CHARLIE BREWER: No, I just think that we just want to win really bad, so it's disappointing.  Hopefully next week we'll get a win.
Q. Coach talked about the attitude of this team, and it never wavers.  How frustrating is it to not have been able to break through just yet?
CHARLIE BREWER: Yeah, it's always frustrating to lose.  We're doing too much of it.  We've got to find a way to win.
Q. You won all your life basically, so how much more difficult is it on you personally?
CHARLIE BREWER: You know, it stinks, but this is a team game.  It's not about me.  I feel for all the other guys in the locker room.  Everyone is a little disappointed.  We just need to find a way.
