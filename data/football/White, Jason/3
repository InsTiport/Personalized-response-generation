<p>	Q.  Chuck, could you talk about how different this time feels than it was in 2000? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, you had such a great year last year, but yet this year you've consistently said this year's offense is a better offense, we're actually having a better year this year.  As you get ready to play the biggest game of the year, all that theory and all that thought has to hold true in this game.  How confident are you that as you go into the biggest game of the year everything that you put together is really going to fly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the USC defense and some of the things in a general sense that you might want to try to exploit or you might want to try to avoid. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Wilson, could you talk about the situation with Joseph coming back home?  I mean, you have so many players that when they play Texas they're playing against their home state or whatever.  Could you talk about the lineman that you have from Hallandale and have you noticed an extra oomph in his step or anything of that nature playing close to his home town?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kevin, one of the things that USC players earlier this morning, they raved about your guys' ability to win one-on-one blocks.  Would you agree with that, that it's been a key to the season, and could you also just talk about what are your thoughts on their front four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chuck, in terms of personnel, you described the front four.  What about the seven on the back end?</p>

<p>	Q.  Adrian, what was the deciding factor for you to come to Oklahoma, and once you did, did you ever envision that this would be where you would be on January 1st? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you think you were going to be here?  Is this where you planned to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  J.D., it seems very important in this game that you as a lineman or you and Bubba, the tight end, you as the fullback, you have to establish edges, get out on the perimeter and make sure you can pin the defensive ends in and also pick off the linebackers who are not big, but they seem to make a lot of plays.  Talk about the challenge that you have against what they have, especially on the perimeter and with their linebackers. </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason White, Orange Bowl is arguably the third biggest event for you.  Do you think that that's a mental advantage for the Sooners over the Trojans?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, having been here long enough to see Oklahoma go from kind of having some down years for a while to obviously building up this amazing run you've been part of the last five years, if you could maybe pinpoint one reason why the program is able to keep this level of success year after year at this point, what do you think that would be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, Coach Long alluded to it a little while ago, but could you discuss what it has been to have Adrian for you, how it's helped the offense and you as a quarterback to have him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Adrian, do you envision running the ball against USC will be easier or harder than getting up first thing in the morning on New Year's Day and meeting with us?</p>
