<p>	Q.  Talk about all the hype and how it affects the game, whether it's a distraction or gets you more hyped. </p>
<p>	Q.  How about the hype of the last two Heisman winners in the same game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a different feel to this year's bowl experience than say last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Matt as a quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the running game, comparing that, where you see the attack being, whether it's passing, or do you see it more in the running game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised that Adrian Peterson is having the type of year he's having, and how important is he?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is he the biggest difference between last year and this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your senior year, what it's meant to come back with so many guys wanting to leave school early and go to the NFL?  How much has it meant to you to play your senior year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday J.D. Runnels and Jammal Brown said that USC's defense most resembles Oklahoma's defense.  Would you agree with that what you've seen so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, it's almost crazy to think that a Heisman Trophy winner could be overlooked, but do you feel like you were early in the season and do you feel this could be a crowning achievement for you this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I was a betting man, why would I want to bet on the Sooners?</p>
<p>	Q.  Better keep my money in my pocket?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's it been like playing for Coach Stoops?  Give us some insight on what he's been like as a coach, on and off the field. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about the disappointment of the Sugar Bowl, both personally and as a team from last year?  And then most college players don't get a second chance at a title game; just talk a little about having a second chance to finish with a victory. </p>
<p>	Q.  Being you are coming in under the radar a little bit, how does that better prepare you for this game?  Do you feel better prepared now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, others have talked about how you seem to be motivated by criticism.  Is there one comment that sticks in your head or one headline or one newspaper story that you look at most often?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you say earlier that you didn't get to enjoy last year as much?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think being here at the Orange Bowl back in 2000 helped you at all knowing what to expect coming through that tunnel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was this your redemption for you?  Is it redemption coming back for this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you mind telling us where your Heisman Trophy is?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was your mindset coming into this year coming off a couple of injuries and knowing that you needed to be healthy?  What was your mindset coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it important to get off to a quick start or is it more to play your game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Heisman winners haven't had much success particularly in National Championship type bowl games.  Is there anything to the Heisman jinx that you can tell?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel any different now not being the Heisman winner going into this game?  Is there a different feeling?  Do you feel less rushed and pressured?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, you've been part of a program that's only lost six games in five years, and you're here playing for the national title for the third time already.  Do you feel like you have a sense of just how rare it is for a program to be so dominant over such a long period of time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even though you're going to be gone after this year, do you see this program continuing to play in these kind of games nearly every year as long as Coach Stoops is there?</p>
<p>	Q.  What friends and family members are taking the tickets you were allotted, and if you have had a lot of demand for more, did you try and pressure any younger teammates for their tickets?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who did you get your extras from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, can you describe your hometown for me and can you tell me what was the reaction there when people see the Heisman?  Do people come over to see it or did you bring it to the school or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that -- have there been just total strangers who come by and want their pictures taken with it?  After you won it, has it gone anywhere in particular?  Did you go out to a bar with it, show it to people?  I'm just curious what you did with it in the last year. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you believe in the Heisman jinx or do you think that's just coincidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it for you to come out here after last season going out and not winning the National Championship like your goal was, to go out here and win it in your last game?</p>
