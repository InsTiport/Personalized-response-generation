<p>	Q.  Jason, from your vantage point could you explain how SC's early success against the run complicated what you were trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, what did you tell the team immediately afterward in the locker room? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, you've never lost like this before.  They beat you the way you've beaten Texas a couple times.  Any explanation for the total meltdown? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how good is this USC team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, that first fumble seemed to be a turning point obviously given a short field.  The field position on the first two drives was really kind of very poor.  Were we just trying to make a play or anything, or do you have any idea on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, do you worry about any far-reaching effects of this loss, not just in the nature of it but the fact that you've been in the title game two years in a row and have not won?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, how would you summarize the feeling? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, the interception, the first interception you threw, it just seemed uncharacteristic.  You seemed to be falling backwards and kind of heaved the ball straight up in the air into multiple coverage.  What kind of happened on that play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, you've had a career with a lot of ups and downs, the injuries, the Heisman Trophy, a lot of great moments.  Just kind of reflect on your career a little bit as you play your final game. </p>
<p>	Q.  The first fumble did feel like a turning point in the game, but nevertheless it was still a tight ballgame, 7-7.  I wanted to ask both of you whether you felt any anxiety or something along those lines, along the sideline, that kind of precipitated the plays that followed. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure you probably watched tape of all of USC's games this year.  Obviously they looked like a great team all season but rarely did they put it all together in one game like this.  Considering how much they rely on youth, do you think this was partially a case of that they had a month leading up to this, that some of the young players are coming into their own the last game of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Jason touched on this a little bit, but what was the difference with them being able to stop Adrian when basically nobody else was able to all year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has USC raised the bar any with the talent they've been able to accumulate with such a young team?  You were doing that three or four years ago.  Now they seem to be on top 22 in a row, 15 starters back.  Are they just raising the bar in college football for everybody else?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, you guys scored your first possession, moved right down the field, and even when you didn't turn it over, after that you didn't have a lot of success offensively.  Did they do something different or is it maybe you guys weren't blocking as well, playing as well?</p>
