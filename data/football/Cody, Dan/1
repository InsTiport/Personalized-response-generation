<p>	Q.  Because of USC's offense, is this the biggest challenge you've faced this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any of the same feelings this week that you did before the Big 12 Championship game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Dan, quick question for you.  With the team speed you guys have on this defense, does that allow you guys maybe to -- talk about the opportunities that that presents to maybe send more blitzes or send more things because you're not afraid of the one-on-one match-ups on the other side. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is the key to this game showing down Matt Leinart, to get pressure on him early?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the offensive line for USC. </p>
<p>	Q.  Dan, looking at USC's offense, are they the best you've played by far this year or do they compare to anyone in the Big 12 you've played against?</p>
<p>	Q.  When everybody talks about how dangerous Reggie Bush is, do you go against guys like that in practice when you see Mark Clayton or Adrian Peterson or something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How aware are you of what they do on defense?  I know that you pay attention mostly to the offense, but their defense is ranked in the top ten nationally in a bunch of different categories.  Does that add to your guys' motivation to show they can hang with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that the ability of their defense and the problems it might be for the offense might add even more pressure to you guys?</p>
