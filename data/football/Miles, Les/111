<p>	Q.  Talk about your coming into a program and already they are not only picked to win the division but some people picked you to be in the National Championship game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering how many things you have learned with your trips around Louisiana?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how this job is different taking other than when you went to Oklahoma State and how you rebuilt that program?  Do you do anything differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Twofold question to follow-up on that, what is it like to arrive at a place where the cupboard is so full up and down the roster and then specifically how important is the quarterback situation that you are facing in terms of a decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have got a couple of coordinators, Jimbo Fisher, veteran in the SEC and you picked up Bo Pelini; talk about them?</p>
<p>	Q.  So much focus on the quarterback.  Is it Russell's job initially or how do you see the three guys in particular?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give us an update on the status of Shawn Jordan and pit number chase?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you pinpoint a specific moment where you realized just how great the expectations were coming into this program?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you deal with the questioning that comes up about Nick Saban and his kind of legacy and your place in kind of stepping in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the process of acclimating a team to a new coach, what goes into that, how do you earn that trust, or whatever word you want to put on it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you'd like to have a starter at quarterback, one guy whose job it is.  Would you ever entertain any sort of rotation if it were close or you felt like Ryan was a guy or --</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your thoughts about the replay system being used by the SEC and as someone who worked in the NFL might you prefer the coach's challenge?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about some of the coaches who influenced you, through your NFL background and also in your college background?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you vote on the coach's poll?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a head coach is it feasible for you guys to see enough football outside your conference to give a fair evaluation, I would put the media in that category also?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the areas of your team that seems to be pretty loaded is running back.  Could you talk about some of the backs and being as deep as you are there and then maybe also throw in the wide receivers as well, please. </p>
<p>	Q.  How well did you know Nick Saban before you got in job?  How well do you know him now?  You guys talked about the fan base and the expectation that's come along with this?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played both Texas and Ohio State last year.  They are meeting early this season.  Since most of their people are back for those teams.  What would be your early assessment for that match-up ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Columbus. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you were with the Cowboys and when you were under Schembechler as a player, an assistant, did you ever see a player chewed out so much that he started crying?</p>
<p>	Q.  All this talk about loaded cupboard.  Wondering if you think that it's possible to have a loaded cupboard and have one guy on first team offense, one guy on first team defense pre-season all SEC teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the defensive side of the ball, it's been such a strength of this team, I know that it may be hard for you to assess the loss of Marcus Spears who didn't coach him.  What feel do you have of those guys being gone and what kind of a defense are you going to have this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  This summer when you watched some video of SEC games, can you compare and contrast the conference you were in before with the SEC?</p>
<p>	Q.  There was some speculation soon after you were hired that Rudy Niswanger may leave early and go to medical school.  Just want to get your impression when you have a player who has a proficiency at something outside of football and a level of expertise, has other options; does that tend to make a guy like that maybe mature and well rounded and maybe a leader?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coming from the Big 12 to the SEC, I know when we get to the two-a-days and the season you have got to take them one at a time.  Before you had to focus on that, did you look up and down your schedule and see some places that were going to be new to and if so, did anything jump out at you that are looking forward to in terms of competing?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you said earlier you have had to make yourself very open to the fans and to the media to get to know you, get to know them, everything.  How much does your outlook, your focus change now?  I assume once you are done here it's all practicing and getting ready for practice and the season, how much has it changed for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's clear you inherited a pretty talented team.  Does it matter at all that you didn't personally recruit those players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you describe your basic philosophies on offense and defense and what you will bring into LSU and how you have achieved success in your career basic beliefs and philosophies?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect to have all of your designees eligible or are there a couple that won't make it?</p>
