<p>	Q.  Coach, could you just talk about your personal experience in championship games and what's going through your mind and your players' mind the day before playing for the championship. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how much hope are you guys holding out that something might happen in one of those first two games Saturday?  Will it deflate your team if they know both USC and Texas win?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you comment on Buster Davis' season, the clutch catches he's made for you and that kind of thing, and whether he's been overlooked.  Has he been your most consistent guy?</p>
<p>	Q.  After going through this, this is your first time, would you like to see there be an extra week of preparation before the SEC championship game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given there's no chapter on natural disasters in the coaching manual, how did you prepare yourself to get through this period that you guys had to go through, and what were some of the key things that you did to as you look back to keep this team on the right track? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had the one extra day to prepare, to have some rest after ten straight weeks.  Now that you've gone through that week, how important or beneficial do you think it was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Both defenses are ranked nationally very high.  When you look at the two defenses, talk about the similarities.  Can you talk about your front four's ability all season long to get a lot of pressure, therefore, the need to blitz has been less for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  You get asked a lot about the hurricane, singular.  But do people underestimate the effect that Rita had, because you were just getting to a point where guys thought maybe normal was around the corner and here comes a smaller but stronger storm, there's more uncertainty.  You know what you just went through, you had the schedule change with Tennessee.  Was that second one just as disruptive in its own way as the first? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think having to go to Arizona might have actually helped the team come together just in a sense of getting away from all that chaos and stuff?  Just getting totally away from it...</p>
<p>	Q.  With an athletic quarterback like D.J. Shockley, I know you guys like to blitz a lot, how do you prepare for a guy like that?  Do you come all out?  Is it something you have to taper a little bit?  How do you look at that matchup?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you talk to Nick Saban?  Have you talked to him recently?  Is that a regular thing during the year?  Also, was there a time during the off-season or this football season where this team kind of ceased being Nick Saban's football team and became Les Miles' team?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the similarities between these two teams, especially defensively.  A lot of times people look to special teams to make a difference in this game.  Obviously both teams are capable in that regard.  Could you talk about Georgia's return game and obviously your own. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in the Big 12, was the Bowl situation, where you might go, where you could go, the scenarios, was it as unpredictable as it seems to be in the SEC each year?</p>
<p>	Q.  If there weren't a championship game, Texas would be a Big 12 champion, Virginia Tech would be ACC champion.  Are these games always necessarily a good thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  You took over a team, obviously, that this kind of expectation to be here was.  Is this almost relief for you more than celebrating what you've accomplished here, that you managed to go in and live up to those expectations? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was it that you learned about JaMarcus in September in particular, what he went through on and off the field, and how have you seen him evolve from there to now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just to follow up with that, Rick mentioned that Georgia has been really good this year in terms of the turnover ratio.  Obviously, you guys have gotten better late in the season.  Do you see this game hinging on quarterbacks' decisions, turnovers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the fact that you've been in three overtime games this year and played pretty well in two of them, benefits you in a game like this where it could come down to the very end? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you have your walk-through a little bit later, what are the important things that you look for, you want to happen with that?  Is that just getting a feel for the environment, or is there more to it?</p>
<p>	Q.  After we leave?</p>
<p>	Q.  Conventional wisdom would suggest that when you have two division champions, you should have a close game, but there's only been three of these games that have been decided by a touchdown or less, and seven of them by two touchdowns or more.  Why do you think when you get into a championship game, more often than not, somebody ends up blowing the other one out?</p>
