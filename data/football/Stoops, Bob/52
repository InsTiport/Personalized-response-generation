<p>	Q.  I was just wondering how D.J. and Lewis (inaudible) at secondary? </p>
<p>	Q.  Randy Riggs, Austin America.  Bob, can you give us the substance of your quarterback situation. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, with that uncertainty at quarterback, does more pressure fall on Adrian to duplicate what he did last year, or is that just already told, that he is going to be that big a part of your offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, the expectations seem to be down just a tad from how they have been for you guys the last three, four, five years.  Do you like this situation you have got where a lot of people respect expecting things out of you (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  How tough is it going to be to replace Jamal Brown, and who is the guy you want to do it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Austin America.  Bob, as great as your program is, and being from Austin, we have witnessed that, do you feel like your programs are invincible to take any hit in the Orange Bowl? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as the players, like Coach said, you have been in both situations, the hunted more than the hunter, though.  Which role do you like better?  Do you like the role of the favorite?  Do you like being in the role of everybody is overlooking us a slight bit?  What do you three guys think? </p>



<p>	Q.  Davin's role, especially given the (inaudible), his role is keeping everybody straight, describing how important that is. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike Jones from the Fort Worth Star Telegram.  Bobby, Davin mentioned that memories of the Orange Bowl had figured in some off-season motivation for some of the players.  Has that been at all in the coaches' minds, and at what point do you guys say, "Forget it, that's done"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Travis, you have had a quarterback there the past six years probably telling every player on offense what to do and be a coach on the field.  Are you finding yourself now having to help coach the quarterback position or counsel some of these guys? </p>

<p>	Q.  Bob, can you update us on Dusty's rehab?  Has he been able to lift weights? </p>


<p>	Q.  This is for Davin.  Can I get your assessment of how you felt the quarterbacks did in two-a-days, how they handle the huddle, how the guys respond to them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, have you witnessed more wrinkles having a more mobile and healthier quarterback?</p>
