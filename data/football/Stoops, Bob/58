<p>	Q.  Jason, could you talk about LSU's defense and the problems it caused? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, could you talk about the interception for a touchdown and what you saw, were you surprised that he dropped on the coverage a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  You guys were knocking them back on their heels on that last drive going in to tie it with the run game, and then you threw eight straight passes to end it.  Reason for that; was it their defense or you saw something?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the pass in the end zone to Mark Clayton and how that play developed; looked like it was tipped. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a damper does this put on a season where you would be won a Heisman Trophy? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're so used to Jason's numbers just being off the charts for about 12 games and then these last two games were not quite as well; will people look at that, seeing the defenses you've faced?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you please sum up what you said to your team at half-time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Derrick, two-part question.  Coach, I would like to you address this, too.  Looked like Derrick was all over the field and your team looked in the last two games like it lost its swagger.  I know you're playing better competition but it didn't look like your team had that swagger until that last drive to tie up the game? </p>

<p>	Q.  Would you talk about wanting to get the ball in Clayton's hands toward the end of the game and particularly that 4th and 11 catch that kept you alive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, is this the best defense you've faced since you've been at Oklahoma?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, can you talk about your pride about playing for Coach Stoops? </p>
<p>	Q.  Jason, was that as frustrating a half as you've been through offensively, you guys have minus three yards, total offense in the 2nd  quarter? </p>
