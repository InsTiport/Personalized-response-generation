<p>	Q.  Coach, can you tell me who Adrian Peterson reminds you of and why and also who Reggie Bush reminds you of and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the challenge to your offensive line, specifically with Cody and Patterson inside and whether or not they're the best defensive line you'll see this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk just in general terms why the NFL is so intriguing to college coaches?  Not you in particular, but --</p>
<p>	Q.  Nick Saban, for instance. </p>
<p>	Q.  Compared to this time last year when you guys were getting ready to play in the Sugar Bowl against LSU, do you notice anything differently about the emotions of your team as they prepare 24 hours now away from the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it help that you and your staff have been all through this three times in the last five years, to relax and know what's going on?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you go about the next 36 hours trying to keep the kids from getting too anxious and up for the game perhaps before they need to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess this is a good problem to have, but y'all really haven't been behind all that much this year.  Is that overrated, the ability to be behind and not panic?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because a lot of these games that we've seen so far have had blocked kicks and turnovers, is that something -- predictably the kicking game, is that something you guys have really focused on and it's easy to sell them on because they've been able to watch these Bowls?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bob, speaking of the kicking game, when you led Colorado 28-0 in the Big-12 Championship game, before you faked the field goal, did you give any thought to letting Harvey kick it just to get the first one out of the way to prepare him for a situation that may occur tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Against Kansas State and A &amp; M you had some special teams mistakes.  How much do you think those scores because of that magnified the problems because of the secondary?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some important things you took away from coaching with Steve Spurrier at Florida?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the incredible hype around this game, do you have to have a conversation with your team that goes something like, "Guys, we don't have to do anything extraordinary to win this game, we just have to play our game"? </p>
<p>	Q.  So what are your three keys to victory for tomorrow?  Do you have three of them set up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who was the best coach you ever saw and why?</p>
<p>	Q.  Every kid growing up playing ball dreams of the big game, the big moment.  Some people dream of the same thing as a coach, coaching a big game, coaching the big moment.  Any time in your youth or young career did you dream about a certain situation or a certain big game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the length of the season that your teams typically play each year, are you supporting of adding a 12th game in the regular season every year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma had been in a little bit of a lull before you took over but then you won a National Title in your second year.  Can you talk about expectations changing among the fan base since you've been there?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of comparisons have been made between the similarities in the two teams.  To your knowledge are there any similarities between your coaching staff and their coaching staff or your particular styles and the way you handle your teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  With this being your third opportunity to win a title, do you consider yourself a dynasty?  Do you feel like you need to do it over a longer period of time?  What's sort of your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about earlier that coaching aggressively.  How much does that trickle down to the players and their confidence when you guys go for a fake or a 4th down, the fact that you guys are sort of playing to win instead of not playing to lose?  Does that enhance a player's confidence as far as the game is concerned?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had talked earlier about I guess we'll call it your romanticism about the Orange Bowl.  SC is a long time traditional power and most of us grew up with McKay, Robinson.  Was there any feeling you had about them growing up and is there an extra kick in this game that you're playing SC for the National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Big 12 is 4-2.  Do you think that bears out the strength of the league or is that any kind of reflection of league strength?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked just a minute ago about some of the great coaches you've borrowed from like Gable, Wooden.  Does that include Switzer and his telling you, "Don't expect to win this every time"?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who else besides Matt Leinart and Adrian did you go head-to-head on them with, and has there been a case where you were one of the coaches where you were walking in while they were walking out, something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the 12-4 record against Nebraska.  I guess that was sort of a barometer, even you admit that.  Texas, is that something maybe you'll look back in years and people will say that was your barometer, and did you pull for Texas the other day in the Rose Bowl?</p>
