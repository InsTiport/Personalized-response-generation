<p>	Q.  Who will be assuming field goal duties for the game?  Is it going to be Garrett Hartley?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel with a game that's so evenly matched that could very well come down to a kick that this is a true freshman who has never attempted a field goal? </p>
<p>	Q.  What will you tell him if you're down by two with only a couple seconds left if USC calls a time out?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not too many guys anymore win the Heisman and then come back and play another season.  Can you talk about the year Jason White has had and how he might have been better than he was the year he won the trophy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had an incredible run at this time once again in the history of Oklahoma football, your third time playing for the National Championship since you've been the head coach, and you've often talked about the great history at Oklahoma.  Do you feel this is another historical time in Oklahoma's football, another era where Oklahoma is at the pinnacle of college football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the difference for yourself coming into the Orange Bowl than it was a few years ago?  If I remember, everybody was sort of picking Florida State to win that game, and you kept saying that you thought you guys had a really good chance.  Is it a different position to be in when you're the underdog and a decided underdog than when you're given an equal shot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you explain the position switch of Jammal Brown, what you saw in him, and also, how receptive was he to that when you talked to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you go into what all went into the decision to take the red shirt off of Marcus Walker, and have you gotten the results that you hoped for from doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't like to use the word compare, but could you kind of discuss the --</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm trying to get a comparison of the two quarterbacks in this case, some of their skills, what those guys can do, what throws they like and how they quarterback a game. </p>
<p>	Q.  You replaced a couple guys in the line-up down the stretch.  Apart from just on the field coaching and stuff, do you have to do any counseling?  Do you have to talk with those guys, try to keep them up, or do you just sort of let it --</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Carroll has talked a lot about enjoying the match-up against another top coaching staff.  How do you feel about that?  And also, what things do you like or admire about what Pete has done in rebuilding USC?</p>
<p>	Q.  I heard Jason make the comment that after losing the last two games last year he suspected people wanted him to give the Heisman back.  How did that sentiment make you feel?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that you've coached Peterson for a year, what's the one quality as a running back that you most appreciate of him, and is there any attribute that he has that even surprised you that you were getting when you recruited him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there a point maybe during pre-season or what have you when you envisioned maybe him having the kind of year that he's had, or is there just no way to see that coming?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of talk about the historic element of this match-up, "greatest bowl game of all time," all that kind of stuff.  Does that get you personally juiced up more so than say the Sugar Bowl or more so than four years ago?  Do you feel a certain zip that you haven't felt before?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about USC's receiving core and maybe some of the specific challenges that those guys present individually?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have said that your offensive line is the best in college football in a number of years.  I'd like your opinion of that.  Is it the best you've seen in a number of years?  And then just to talk about the challenge of Patterson and Cody and what SC is able to do with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Adrian, is the fact that you guys haven't used him as a pass catcher, does that keep him from being kind of a complete back right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see that coming in the future?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised Norm Chow is not a head coach somewhere, and what is his national sort of reputation?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, kind of go into some of the coaches, I guess starting with your father obviously, who have influenced you, maybe you've patterned yourself after, guys you've worked with or worked for. </p>
<p>	Q.  With all the attention with Jason White and Adrian Peterson, do you think Mark Clayton has been lost a little bit in the shuffle?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you match these two teams up, what are a couple of the key areas that we can look for?  What do you think will be the most important things in this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you can talk about the pressure that Reggie Bush puts on a defense with the many things that he does for USC. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you said early in the season you didn't have a dog house but Mo was a guy that didn't dress for some days because you didn't feel he deserved to.  How far has he come this season?  Is he coming out of the woods?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about your working relationship with your athletic director?  I know he hired you, but it seems like you guys have been on a pretty good run since you've been together. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe the versatility of Mark Bradley and all the roles he plays for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems as if you and Adrian are as close as a true freshman and a head coach could be.  Is that true?  How would you describe how that relationship sort of evolved as the season went on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously when the Florida thing happened, you made it very clear that you were happy, that you wanted to stay at OU.  When you see reports that Nick Saban gets a $5 million deal and control of personnel, does that stir anything in you about the NFL and taking a look?</p>
<p>	Q.  Larry Birdine made some goofy comments last week.  Does that displease you more of what it could do in this game and this week, or did it displease you because of the setting it put the program in?</p>
<p>	Q.  You made him off limits here in Miami.  Is that just punishment for him or keeping him from saying anything else or what?</p>
