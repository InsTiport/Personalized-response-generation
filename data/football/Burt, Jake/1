Boston College - 45, Richmond - 13
Q. By the time you got to the end zone, percentage-wise, how much of that was you were elated, and how much of that was you were tired?
JAKE BURT: I honestly -- I mean, I was tired before that play, but once I got there, I was just elated. I was so happy to be in the end zone.
Q. Can you just talk about the use -- I think -- what is it now? Five touchdowns for A.B., five different receivers, two tight ends and a running back -- like you guys can do this with a lot of different targets, you know.
JAKE BURT: Yeah, we're just really good right now at putting different pieces of the puzzle all over, keeping the ball spread out, keeping our run game proficient, and that's been the key for us because it's hard to game plan for one person when you play us.
Q. And I'm serious too, like I don't know what play number that was on that drive, but how long had you been on the field, and what is that like? Because you already had these responsibilities. I can't remember which play number that was.
JAKE BURT: We do a great job preparing in practice. Coach Addazio always makes sure we're pushing at a fast tempo. Coach Bajakian is always getting the plays in fast. So we're used to getting deep in those drives and being able to make plays deep in those drives when the defense gets tired.
Q. After such an emotional game last week, getting ready for Richmond this week with Kansas coming up on Friday, how different is the preparation during the week?
JAKE BURT: Preparation is the same. Every week you're just looking to get another win. As Coach always says, it's really hard to get a win in college football, and we've got a great bunch of guys who love ball. So every day we just go out there and play as hard as we can.
