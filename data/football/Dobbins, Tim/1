<p>	Q.  Mike (inaudible) with the Fort Worth Star Telegram. For Nick, many years at this time you have been there, players have been defending the program, talking about the lack of respect that you get, and now you are second in your division, and a lot of people think you have got a really good chance to win it. Do you feel that that respect is now justified, and talk about the reasons why you think you may be that good. </p>

<p>	Q.  You talk about you have a lot fewer questions.  I wonder if you could talk about the quarterback position. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Steve from the Lincoln Journal Star.  First publication that picked you to win 12 North, how comfortable are you in that favorite role, and do you feel like you belong there? </p>
<p>	Q.  Bret, would you talk about how much better you feel about the offense second year under a new offensive coordinator and the experience that you have gained. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mac, with greater expectations, will you coach differently, talk to these guys differently? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about, obviously, a lot of your upswing a couple years ago was due to Seneca.  Can you compare Bret's ability to his, and where he stands at this point in his career. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you find a big difference when you, Iowa State, recruited?  Did kids want to pay more attention?  Also, did you notice a perceptive change (inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given the disappointment of the Missouri game last year, what did it tell you about your team that you all were able to come back and win the bowl game, and how important is that as far as setting things up for this year? </p>
