START_OF_INTERVIEW_TEXT







Q.   When you look at Florida State defensively, the fact that this has two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks, does that mean anything to you if there is another one on the other sideline? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not at all, I'm focused on doing what's best for our team. 

Q.   When you look at Florida State defensively what captures your eye?   Their defensive front is probably bigger than anybody in the Pac 12 that you played against.   Anybody come to mind when you look at their front 7? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's tough, they're athletic, but for us we got to focus on our game plan and execute it. 

Q.   How important is the tempo of this game, Marcus?   You're going to have different referees, how important does the Coach think is getting out fast going to be success for your offense? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's going to be important for us.   We got to focus on that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   He's a great player.   What he's been able to do over his career is incredible.   His record as a quarterback, you know, says a lot about his game and what he's able to do.   He really has that command of the offense, and whenever the game is close, you can rely on that guy to make plays. 

Q.   What about the story line that he's a bad guy and you're a good guy? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I don't think of that in any way.   My interactions with Jameis have been good, so that's not my opinion and I'm not going to focus on that, just like he won't focus on it either.   We're going to focus on the game and playing the best we can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, without a doubt.   We have all the confidence in the world, ever since he stepped in as a head coach.   We understand that he always wants the best for us and when you have a coach that really believes in that, that makes you feel good as a player.   As we continue to move forward, all that confidence just helps us get prepared for games. 

Q.   What's the timetable for when you will decide whether to go to the NFL?
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Whenever the last game is.   I will take a couple days with my family and we will hash it out and figure out what's best. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Be not really, honestly I try not to focus on that.   I understand that that can become a distraction especially with the game coming up and I didn't want to pay attention to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I really don't care about legacies, so that's opinions of others.   It's not something I really care about. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Definitely.   Team chemistry is always pivotal in any sport, and I think with our relationship as teammates and the character of these guys have really made us successful this year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   That's other people's opinions.   I just focus on what I have to do and what's best for this team.   I'm not going to change who I am, I'm going to continue to do what I think is going to help us out. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Sure.   I don't know.   That's, again, other people's opinions.   Honestly I don't care about that.   As long as these guys in here understand that I'm going to play my best for them, that's all that matters. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   They're athletic, they have a bunch of guys that can make plays.   They find ways to turn the ball over.   Really they've just got so many guys that can make a difference in the game. 
We're going to have to be prepared for that.   They're going to come out and be aggressive so we got to make sure we understand our game plans and execute whatever is in front of us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not at all.   It gives a lot of guys an opportunity to get healthy.   You play 13 games in the season, it's an opportunity to lie low for a little bit, relax and get healthy and recover for whatever is next. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I mean, I grew up on that beach.   I spent a lot of my free time there.   Whenever I go home, I try to get there as much as I can.   I was able to go when I went home once which is nice.   As long as I get in the water, for me, it's always nice to relax. 
Definitely Sandy Beach is a part of my life and I try to get there as much as I can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   We didn't have any questions.   We had a lot of confidence in those guys.   There were a lot of young guys but they had big‑play potential and we're all dynamic players so we didn't have any questions, we just wanted to move forward.   They've played well for us this year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I guess so.   It is what it is.   I just try my best to answer questions to the best of my ability. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not at all. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   You know, to go through adversity, that can always strengthen a team and for us to be able to fight through that game and fight through that loss helped us this year and brought this time a little closer.   Like I was saying earlier, team chemistry is huge.   To be able to do that and build those relationships up, it's helped us be successful. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Nope.   Sorry. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I mean, it starts with the coaching.   Coach Greatwood really gets those guys prepared and we always have a mantra around here of "next guy up" and that group, that offensive line group was dedicated to playing the best that they can.   I'm proud of those guys for dealing with that adversity all year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Again, I mean, that's other people's opinions. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Of course, I think you wouldn't be playing this game if you didn't have the competitiveness.   Yeah, I don't know, I don't know how to answer that question.   Again, that's other people's opinions.   As long as those guys understand how I feel and understand that I'm going to play my best for them, that's all that matters to me. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Of course.   Yeah.   I mean‑‑

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA: ‑‑ yeah and I'm a competitive person when it comes to anything, if it's video games, cards, you know, I late losing.   Doesn't matter what it is.   I would say I'm definitely a competitive person, and that's kinda how I've always been. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, you know, being a part of the offense for three years, you know, you really understand why you're doing certain things, why you have these plays against certain coverages, why you have these plays against certain fronts.   I can't thank Coach Helfrich and Coach Frost enough for helping my understanding of this offense.

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Definitely the coaching and the amount of time that they have with us in preparing each week.   Without the amount of preparation and the scout team giving us the looks that we expect, I wouldn't be able to know where to put the ball or be able to find the soft zones or places to be safe with the ball. 
Credit goes to a lot of the coaching and the scout team guys for allowing me to be able to do that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's surreal.   It's been a blessing.   The amount of support and the amount of people coming up and saying "congratulations" is unbelievable!   I'm very thankful for it.   I'm sure when the season is done I will take a little bit of time and reflect on it and kinda enjoy it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not really.   I mean, you know for me it was just something‑‑ that award really just says a lot about this team because without those guys I wouldn't have been put in that position. 

Q.   When the season is done are you going to take time and possibly let it sink in and think about not coming back, moving on to the NFL? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Hopefully I will find ways, if I can, to go home, if not, to hangout wherever I'm at and have my family around me and I will take a couple of days to make that decision.   It will give me a day to unwind and process everything and give me another couple of days to make a decision that best fits my family. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I don't know if they needed me!   I think‑‑

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Um, you know, I would hope that kids back home would look not only at myself but guys like Koa Ka'ai or Miyashiro, guys that have been there and hope that they realize that they can kinda find opportunities on the mainland and take that and run with it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   A little bit.   I kinda met him once but it was NFL and a long time ago. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Just, you know, be yourself and don't let these awards get to you and always find ways to get better with your teammates and improve.   Again, I can't thank these guys enough because they helped me do that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I'm just excited to play the game.   I'm excited to be a part of the Rose Bowl.   This team has had a great year, and hopefully we can continue to play within our season and really just to have fun with this game.   It's going to be a great game and I'm excited. 

Q.   Do you enjoy all this? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   No, not really! 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Well, you know, I don't like being in the limelight.   I don't like the spotlight.   I would prefer just to go about my business and not have to deal with some of the stuff like this. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It wasn't much different, you know, I really wanted to focus on maybe getting better with my footwork and also, you know, finding ways to get better with these guys, but, you know, my preparation has been always the same and my mind‑set has been the same since I've gotten here and for me it's been successful so I don't feel like I need to do change. 

Q.   What was your expectation throughout the season for yourself and the team? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   You know, our goal was to win the Pac 12 and be a part of the playoff.   Now that we've done it, you know, we want to continue to improve on it and, you know, as a team to be able to achieve your goals is a lot, and the thing is‑‑ and I think I can say this for a lot of these guys, we're not satisfied with that.   We want to continue to get better and hopefully be part of the National Championship!   That being said it's awesome to be part of this team and hopefully we can continue our season.

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I would say probably just from, you know, where I grew up.   We always kinda‑‑ when I‑‑ where I grew up, it's always been if one guy is successful the entire state is successful.   Some of that stuff I really took to heart and this is a great example of it.   For me it's easier to handle some of this spotlight stuff when the team gets it.   Honestly, they deserve it, because without them, none of this stuff would be possible.   I'm really thankful for them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Thank you. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, Bralon has done an awesome job of coaching up the younger guys.   We have so many young athletes outside and his ability to kinda coach and lead has been awesome. 
He's really helped us out, helped that young receiver core out and even though he hasn't stepped on the field he's really made an impact this year. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? 

Q.   Is the preparation for two bowl games rather than one different?   How does it affect you guys? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not really, we gotta win the first one in order to play the second one.   So we focused on this game.   We're not worried about whatever comes next.   We go through the same process that we have the last few years of preparing, and hopefully it's successful and hopefully we do get to that second game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I mean, like you said, I don't play defense, so my main focus is playing within this offense, playing to the best of my abilities, and just going out there and trying to put this offense in the best situation that I can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Well, every athlete that's a part of the University of Oregon understand the contributions that those two made.   And without them, we wouldn't be wearing the stuff that we wear or be in the buildings that we're in.   For me, I just wanted to pay respect to them for the amount of contributions that they made to the University. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?   I couldn't hear you. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I mean, I don't know.   You know, winning the Heisman wasn't my doing, it was this team's doing.   I hope, with that being said, I hope that the team realizes it was a team achievement and hopefully it gives us a better foundation for this week in preparation. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's a dream come true!   As a kid, I dreamed of being part of the ceremony, and to win it was an incredible feeling and really just something that I will remember for the rest of my life. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Not at all.   I'm focused on our offense and playing our game plan to the best of my abilities.   Really just not trying to worry about what Jameis is doing because that can kinda affect your game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I mean, it would be wrong for me to say one specifically but there have been so many people that have reached out and have given their support and I'm truly grateful for it and that has really just helped me through this entire process. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, you know, growing up I was a huge Michael Vick fan, lately I love watching Aaron Rodgers play.   That being said I hope I can emulate both those guys in my game.   The way Michael Vick uses his legs and is able to throw out of the pocket really changes games.   The way that Aaron Rodgers is able to sit in the pocket and make throws that not at lot of people can make I hope I can be half what those guys are and emulate it into my game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It would be incredible.   To be in the Rose Bowl, to feel the tradition and the history, it's going to be an unbelievable feeling and it's going to be really exciting. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Just said hello.   He told me congratulations, I told him thank you and really that was kinda the gist of it.   It wasn't much more than that. 

Q.   Talk about your leadership on the field. 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, I've come a long way in that standpoint, being the quiet guy that I was my freshman year, and it took a little bit of me to step out of my comfort zone and use my words as an influential tool.   It's come a long way but there is always ways to get better and I'm looking forward to that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It was great!   I mean, I'm still full!   The food was awesome, the people there were great!   It was a great atmosphere and fun to be a part of. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Oh, man, there has been so many‑‑ going to Disneyland was fun, ‑‑ was great, just to hangout with the guys has been awesome, so many things.   It's been an awesome week. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   A little bit.   He's a busy man, he's got important things to do.   But he does chime in every now and then and express his support, which I'm thankful for and it means a lot to have him check in on me every now and then. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Right.   This group of young receivers took it upon themselves to kinda find ways to get better in the off‑season and for me I was glad to be a part of it.   It really helped us out, and especially this year to getting better and to find ways to get better together.   Being able to go through an off‑season together really helped us during the season. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I met him at the Manning Camp, and I saw him again at Disneyland. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   At the Manning Camp we introduce ourselves and when we were at Disneyland he said congratulations and I expressed my gratitude for the most part‑‑ like I said, our interactions have been great, he's a nice guy and I hope the best for him. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   No, not at all, no, not at all. 

Q.   What's this entire experience been like, the Heisman Trophy to the Rose Bowl? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's been unbelievable.   Each day has been filled with a lot of fun and it's been great to be a part of it.   Now that we're here at the Rose Bowl it's been fun preparing for this game, we're excited for it and we're looking forward to getting in the Rose Bowl and playing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   How you doin'. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yeah, I'm looking forward to being done and getting ready for the game.   It's all been pretty surreal.   I've said that so many times to you guys but it's been an awesome experience and I'm taking it for what it's worth but I'm ready to grind it and get ready for the game. 

Q.   Do you feel like your team takes queues from you, the way you carry yourself? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I don't know.   If they do, I hope I'm leading them in the right direction. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It will be great.   He's had a good couple of practices this week.   He looks great!   He looks healthy, and he's going to be a huge asset for us. 

Q.   Seemed like he wasn't thrilled with the way the last half of the season went. 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Definitely. 

Q.   Your thoughts on that?   Somebody else mentioned they were there for him and so forth. 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It's tough when you are an athlete and dealing with injuries and I think for him he's motivated to go out there and play well.   For us, the main thing was kinda being there for him and I think right now he feels good and he's excited for the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Um, I don't know.   If you ask these guys if the jerseys matter to them, then I guess so but for us, we're just excited to be part of the game and excited for whatever we're wearing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   The University of Oregon has been incredible from that standpoint.   They have helped me, had people with me the entire way, laying out my schedule every day and making sure that I get the obligations that I need to get done, done.   At the same time helping out and if I don't need to do certain things they tell me I don't need to do them.   I can't thank the University of Oregon enough because this time can get a little hectic but they've made this entire process easier for me. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Yes.   When I got back to Eugene, just being part of practice again helped me mellow out and unwind a little bit.   Like I had, the University of Oregon has done a great job with that.   I can't thank them enough, really, because they've helped me funnel into my normal routine and feel part of the team again. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Thank you. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I'm sorry, could you repeat that? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   It feels great!   It's an opportunity for us to achieve some season‑long goals and for right now we're focused on this game at hand, focused on playing to the best of our abilities and going out there and hopefully continuing our season. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Incredible.   It says a lot about their coaching, says a lot about, you know, who the players are that makeup that team.   They have a bunch of winners and it's going to be tough for us.   It's going to be a tough game.   Like you said, it's a true testament to how they play each and every game and their ability to finish. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Sure.   For them, they've gone undefeated the last two years and no one has been able to beat 'em. 
With what they have been able to do, you know, that's tough.   No one else has done it, and I feel like, you know, as a fan, I feel like, yeah, they have been extraordinary. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Thanks for asking. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   No.   (Laughter.)

Q.   Do you have a New Year's resolution? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Winning the Rose Bowl.   It would give us an opportunity to move on to the National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   I'm counting down in my head, don't worry about it! 

Q.   (No microphone.)
MARCUS MARIOTA:   They're very athletic, they got a bunch of guys that can change the game with their abilities.   They have a knack for turning the ball over and we have to be prepared.   They're going to come out and be aggressive, so for us we got to make sure we execute our game plan. 

Q.   What's this experience been like for you? 
MARCUS MARIOTA:   Unbelievable.   It's been an incredible experience and it's been an awesome ride and I'm very thankful for it.   Thank you guys.   Have a good one.
