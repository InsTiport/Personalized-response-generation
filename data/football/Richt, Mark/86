<p>	Q.  How does Blake Barnes figure in your system at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) D.J. at the controls? </p>
<p>	Q.  The loss of Davis and Thurman and Pollack takes three great players out of the defense.  Does this cause you have to rethink what you are going to do this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Phillip Fulmer was talking yesterday about coaching staff having to spend a lot of time this summer scouting four new coaches in the SEC.  You have to play Spurrier in the second week. 	Have you guys spent some time looking at the Florida tape, and does it make it any easier or less work to scout them given what his tenure in the conference already? </p>
<p>	Q.  The first couple of games, Boise State may come in ranked higher than yourself. Can you talk about the challenge that your team faces in playing opening at home like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I did the math right, you only have 13 freshman on your roster this year; is that correct? </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Doesn't that make for a bump four years down the road? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I am just curious of your reaction, Spurrier came in yesterday and told us he wanted to be back flat and humble? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) What they did with Auburn running backs last year, running them and Cornell Williams, does this give you any idea or more convenience with something different with all those tailbacks you have? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, is it an over statement to say this has been a crucial year for Georgia football because you don't have David Green, you don't have David Pollack, kind of corner stones of the championship teams? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, if you could talk about this recruiting class with the problems you have with recruiting class, what concerns you the most that's going on in this recruiting class?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the same time, Mark, between that and having some of your players in legal problems, are you concerned about the percentages that Georgia's program, maybe things are out of control? </p>
<p>	Q.  No problems in staff?  As the head coach how much is that your personal responsibility? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the situation surrounding Jamar Chaney why he was denied admission to Georgia, and then I heard that you called Sylvester Croom and sort of vouched for him; is that true also? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, on the discipline issue a little bit, kind of tying in that, can a coach just be a coach anymore, a motivator, and what's the skill set that you maybe never anticipated you were going to need when you first started getting into profession? </p>
<p>	Q.  Outside the team, the demands on you also? </p>
<p>	Q.  Good morning. </p>
<p>	Q.  In general terms, how are offenses try to attack defenses now in college football maybe differently than 10, 15 years ago?  I know you are offensive guy.  How has that evolved in college football?  What are defenses trying to do to match it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach has this been the most difficult summer that you have had at Georgia, and is there something in place that you are all trying to do to prevent this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when it comes to some of the guys that you lost, Green and Pollack in particular, how tough is it to lose those kinds of players, and, in the same vein, how important is it for the program to try to continue on since that's part of college football and not miss a beat so to speak? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, what is having the experience of guys like Max up front do for D.J. stepping in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, is there going to be an adjustment period for D.J. because he has not played all that much or expected to hit the ground running?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, when you win the SEC championship and finish third in the country as quickly as you were able to do, does this setup an impossible standard in fans' minds after that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Another Shockley question.  Last year it seemed like you kept him involved, even though you had a quarterback of great caliber, almost out went out of you way to keep him involved.  What was you philosophy managing D.J. in the last couple of years and was it within an eye toward this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, you were asked earlier about different ways offenses are attacking defenses now.  From what you seen on tape of Boise State is that one more of your needs, schemes you have seen recently?  Is that a good example of what you are talking about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, which is going to be harder to replace, the on the field production of Pollack and Green or their leadership? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, could you just share who the best motivator you have ever been around and maybe a story about how they were able to motivate you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anybody in general?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, what kind of discussions did you have with Max about whether or not he was going to be going to the NFL or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned that you felt like there were a lot of players in this team people just didn't know about yet.  Can you talk about who a couple of those players you think might be and also talk about the wide receivers.  I assume that's a position one of those guys is going to step up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mark, on the subject of offenses, have you had a chance to watch Irvin Meyers offense and what are your impressions of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you were speaking a second ago about the wide receivers. 	Can you tell us how many reps they'll get, maybe get their chance to play? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you mentioned Leonard Pope.  Can you talk about what you are expecting out of him this season?</p>
