Miami - 14, Boston College - 27
MARK RICHT: First of all, congratulations to Boston College.  Coach Addazio and his team did a great job.  Got to give them credit.  Came out like gangbusters on both sides of the ball, did a nice job.
We thought we had taken their best shot.  By halftime we were down by three, felt we were in pretty good shape actually.  Just wasn't able to follow through.
I know we had a ball tipped.  I think quarterback got hit while he was throwing.  I can't even think of all the things that happened.
The most disappointing thing is first-and-goal at the nine, not being able to score the touchdown to put us within six.  That was tough.  Just didn't happen.
I really don't understand the targeting rule very good, because if there ever was one, sure looked like it to me.  But that's part of football, and you got to live with it.
Y'all can ask whatever you want to ask.
Q. This team is 10-0 a year ago.  Since then you've lost six out of eight to Power 5 schools.  What's happened?
MARK RICHT: We got beat.  We got beat.
Q. Coach, you had the time off to do some scout work and things.  Did that not go as planned?
MARK RICHT: Some things we got better at.  In the end, we just didn't execute well enough to win.  That's both sides of the ball.  That's special teams.  For the most part looked like special teams had their moments.
But, you know, everybody's got some ownership in this thing.  All you can do is go back to the drawing board and keep working hard, looking at the next opponent, get ready to play ball.  That's all you can do at this point.
We're all disappointed.
