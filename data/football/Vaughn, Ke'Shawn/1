 Q.  Ke', when you come out of the locker room like that and get a 75-yarder first carry, at what point in a play like that do you know that that's going to the house?  
KE'SHAWN VAUGHN: I mean, halftime, we talked about that they flow heavy to the ball. So we knew that we had to cut up somewhere so we went outside zone, see the cut, take it. Went 75 yards.   
 Q.  You played, looking a week ahead, you played the Tennessee game a little bit last year, left with an injury. Important that you're coming off a good game going into that one for you?  
KE'SHAWN VAUGHN: Very important that as a team, we're coming off a big win. I felt this was something we needed going into a rivalry game. We're going to keep up here.   
 Q.  Ke'Shawn, do you pay any attention to your alma mater in high school and what they're doing this year?  
KE'SHAWN VAUGHN: Yes, I am. What are they, 13-0? Two more games to state. Hopefully they can be the best Pearl-Cohn team in history. So that's a good thing.
