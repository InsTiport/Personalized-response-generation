<p>	Q.  Mike is a little ahead at this point; what is the distance between him and Robert, the quarterback position? </p>
<p>	Q.  Starter earlier in the season and really fell down in the department chart R rebuild his confidence what kind?</p>
<p>	Q.  When I got there I obviously wanted to instill an attitude in our first meeting with the team; [] how much of did everyone how much is real is how much is?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about adjusting, having the talent when you got to the Ole Miss.  Of course you came from a program that obviously against Oklahoma.  Was there an adjustment for you coaching Ole Miss after being there for --</p>
<p>	Q.  With the other coaches also here; Spurrier, Fulmer; do you feel that you are kind of under the radar or a little overshadowed today?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coming from south Louisiana, why don't you tell me about that background work ethic that you learned down there. </p>
<p>	Q.  You have a lot of player position evaluations in spring, will you continue that in August or is it too late to keep switching positions for players?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's been noted for recruiting.  What are your impressions about recruiting for Southern conference teams?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the biggest challenges you face in building the program you want to build?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a first year head coach are you glad that the instant replay is in effect?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a two-part question.  First off, there's been a great exodus from talented kids from the State of Mississippi to other places in the SEC over the years, and secondly, are you finding much resistance when you talk to kids convincing them that championships can be one at Ole Miss? </p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of a specific things do you see Patrick Willis that make you think he is going to be a special? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think there should be something across the board as to how to report injuries?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on what Rick was asking, is there a culture shock?  You have Miami, Syracuse, Los Angeles, now Oxford.  Can you talk a little bit about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Very quick two-part question.  One, have you had a chance set down guidelines for coaches because you had a couple of problems with your coaches, and two, do you think those problems could be a black mark that could be used against you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think those two coaches arrested for drinking can that be used against you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Young men in the 21st century, how do they respond to your style and how do you think they respond to enthusiasm of the sort that you seem to have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of a second line, coming in as a new coach, your team was mostly recruiting another staff or another head coach; how do you sell yourself?  </p>
<p>	Q.  Coming in for the new program you got a new schedule to play now.  I know you are gearing up for opening day, before you get into that, are there Saturdays you have looked at in the schedule that jump out at you, that you are excited to get to? </p>
<p>	Q.  How did your head coach, what's one or two things that you didn't expect that you had to learn real quick to be successful? </p>
<p>	Q.  One thing that you said in your opening I wanted you expound on some, you said "I don't think the quarterback position will be that important as to whether we win or lose." </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a couple of questions ago about needing a couple of days to kind of set the tone.  Can you give us specific examples or habits or trends or a player by player basis, things that you saw that you put your stamp on right away? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Coach Mazzone being heavily involved with the quarterback situation.  Ultimately it is going to come down to decision.  Take your recommendations as regards to a starter. </p>
<p>	Q.  How hands-on are you going to be with defense and specifically so? </p>
