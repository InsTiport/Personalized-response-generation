 Q.  Ed, from down double digits first time this season to up double digits, what changed?  
ED ORGERON: Great game. We had some bad field position in the beginning, but we started clicking on offense. We figured out what they were going to do. Now we're moving the football. We had some critical stops with our defense. This is a heck of a football game.   
 Q.  How do you build on that momentum?  
ED ORGERON: We've get the ball in the second half. We've got to go down the field, we've got to score and we've got to stop them. We've got to keep on playing for 60 minutes. We knew it was going to be like this in the Championship Game. Geaux Tigers.
