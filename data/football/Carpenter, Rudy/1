		   COACH DIRK KOETTER:  Obviously we're very excited about the way it turned out.  A little iffy there in the first half, but these two guys right here rallied the troops there in the second half and really, really proud of the way our guys competed and hung in there. 
 It's a battle, we had a bunch of guys go down tonight.  Dale Robinson was reduced to just a shadow of himself.  He's had a real bad thigh bruise that he has not been able to overcome.  We lost Stephen Berg, our starting guard real early in the aim with a separated shoulder.  You could see Carnahan limping around on that foot that's been broken that whole second half of the year and he's been playing on it.  We lost Mo London to a concussion.  We lost Caldwell, I'm not sure exactly what it was, but he was out the whole second half to.  Have these guys hang in there and keep going. 
 I thought Jamar did a great job of getting the defense.  Rutgers had us off-balance the first half with their shifts and motions and we were screwed up about half the time and we didn't tackle very well.  I thought Jamar did a great job of taking charge; Derek, in a leadership role; and the skinny guy to my left, once again, tonight he played awesome. 
 Q.  Rudy, I notice your left arm is not in your left sleeve, you played like a boxer who played 15 rounds but would not go down.  What kind of a beating did you take and how did you feel about the game you played?
