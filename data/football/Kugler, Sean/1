THE MODERATOR: Questions. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: It was a devastating blow for us. But we got to respond better than that, guys got to step up and make plays in his stead. We can't let the loss of one guy let it affect our team the way it did. 

Q. Any feeling on how long he is out?
COACH KUGLER: I'm not a doctor. They're checking him out right now. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: I'm not a doctor. They're checking him out right now. I'm not going to answer anything else. I'm not a doctor, all right? 

Q. I know you haven't looked at the video of the game, can you pinpoint what went wrong?
COACH KUGLER: We got to do a better job of tackling in space. Too many penalties for my liking. 
The possession time, those things weren't in our favor. We didn't have sustained drives. We had a few, but not enough, certainly not enough to keep an explosive offense like them off the field. We gave them two chances with fumbles. We turned it over, with penalties. 
Not our style of football. Thought we had a great running game plan. It changed in a hurry when Aaron went out. Again, when that happens, other guys got to step up and do the job. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: I felt good about us moving the ball. Same things I'm telling you right now. I felt like we needed to tackle better in space. I was very concerned about Arron being injured action and he is, so.

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: Yeah, anytime that you get your tails whipped, I just told the team, I've had my tail whipped, too, it's how you respond is how you're judged. 
I know we're going to be facing a team that's gearing up for us. We need to gear up for them. We need to overcome the loss of Aaron Jones because I don't know how long he's going to be out. We have to rally as a team and overcome that. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: Yeah, they're a quick‑strike team. Again, we moved the ball efficiently, but we didn't move it with sustained drives when we needed to. You can't give them the ball back in the form of a fumble, you can't give them the ball back in the form of a turnover, which we did twice. Three‑and‑outs in the third quarter. They're just too explosive. They took advantage of it. 

Q. (Question about next week's game.) 
COACH KUGLER: That's no matter who we're playing and whatever the next game is. 
We've got to learn from this game. We got to correct our mistakes, come up with a great plan. 24 hours we're on to New Mexico State, period. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: We have great speed. You know, looked like it at times. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: You know, I haven't got to it. I haven't sat down and talked to the staff about things that we're going to do. Those are things we'll discuss as a staff when we get back. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: Very similar. 

Q. (No microphone.)
COACH KUGLER: Well, we had to make a complete adjustment because our starting tailback was out. We had to divy up the carries as far as who was going to get the carries, those type things. We went with our game plan. They did a better job of stopping us in the third quarter, so hats off to them. 

Q. Any positives you see right now?
COACH KUGLER: I don't see any positives when you get beat 69 to 20 and lose your best player. I don't even know how to answer that question. 
Thanks.
