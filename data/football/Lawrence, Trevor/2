Q. What's the biggest advantage of being in this position for a second time around, being in this spot?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't know how big the advantage is really. I think it's just from an experience standpoint it feels good knowing you've been here, kind of how the week is going to go. Other than that, I don't think it helps too much. The game is going to be won on the field.
Q. (Indiscernible) these games on the field?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: You just get so focused on the next one, and being great where you are and just winning the next game. You don't really think about all the ones that you won before and what you may win again.
I think it's just you get so focused on winning the next one that you get caught up in that, which is it's a good thing. And then after the season it will be nice to reflect, but now is really not the time to think about all the games that we've won. We've still got one more.
Q. (Question off mic)
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's awesome. It's a cool thing to be a part of. I think we'll look back years down the line and just think about how special this time was for college football, but for Clemson really, especially. So I think it's a really cool thing to be a part of.
Q. Remember the last game you lost back in (inaudible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, for sure. I've talked a lot about that these past couple of weeks. Everybody's been asking. I remember that for sure.
Q. What's it's like even though you won up to that point?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It sucked, it was in my senior year. It was in the playoffs, it was at home. It sucked.
Q. (Inaudible) the last time there was a battle two quarterbacks from
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Obviously what he's done speaks for itself. And anyone that's watched him knows he's a special player and just a great player. So I think people get a little too caught up in just me versus him. It's us versus them as far as a team. So it's going to be the best team's going to win the game.
And he's a great player and obviously we're both going to impact the game, but at the end of the day the best team's going to win.
Q. What's the difference between that and (inaudible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: There's a lot of differences, all around the board these guys have more speed, LSU does. That will be a challenge. But they also do a little bit more as far as coverages and mixing things up, disguising than Ohio State did.
Ohio State kept it simple but they just did a really good job what they were doing. They were in cover 3 and cover 1, and they threw in a couple different things, but other than that they kept it pretty simple. They were really good at it. LSU, they mix it up a good bit.
Q. You also ran the ball a lot more than (indiscernible)
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, during the game it wasn't too bad. You're just playing, you're caught up in the game and just trying to find a way to win. But the next morning you definitely feel it. Really sore. That was one of the most the sorest I've been after a game. It was just a hard fought game, a lot of fun to be a part of.
Q. How is the extra week of preparation, the playoff and final championship game, does it help, hurt, in between?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it helps, especially for us. We were in a four quarter game, down to the wire. Everyone had to play the whole game and just had some guys just a little bit dinged up and bruised up. You want to have some extra time. I think it worked really well.
And then our flight got delayed on the way home, too. We didn't get back until really late the next day. So it was nice to have an extra week.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, it was.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: For sure, I think the biggest thing is making our possessions count, at least trying to get a field goal every drive. You don't want to punt too much with an offense like that on the other side.
But at the same time we trust our defense. And I think we've got a really good plan. And our defense is always ready. So we trust those guys. But it will be really important when we get a stop to capitalize off that score points and not just punt the ball right back to them. I think that's the biggest thing, just playing complementary football.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: For sure. In these games, we've got to play well, especially as a quarterback. Gotta play well if you want to win. Not just me. A lot of our guys. A lot of our players just got to play well. On the biggest stage, that's when you've got to have your players play well.
That's the biggest thing is just the guys that need to, you know like me, Travis, receivers, everyone, the O line everyone has to play well if we're going to win this game.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's been crazy seeing everything go full circle, just being here. Was in California last year. And coming back, it's been a crazy year. It flew by, but also you look back, it's, like, this has been a grind. It's been one of the longest seasons ever. Actually I think they say it's the longest season Clemson's ever had.
It's been long but it's been awesome. This year with these guys is really special, this group of seniors. Wouldn't want to be here with anyone else.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: From Cartersville just my immediate family but I've got some family coming from all over, family in different states. We'll have a good bit of people here.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I had about I got about five extra.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think when I watch him, the best thing is just his ability to extend plays. Obviously from the pocket he's really good. But just his ability to, when everything breaks down, to extend the play, either run or keep his eyes downfield and complete a pass. I think that's really special.
Then just the way he plays the game, he's really smooth, really accurate. You don't really see him missing, overthrowing guys. He's just a really good player. I think those things, especially his accuracy are really impressive.
Q. (Question about next season)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it's just people who don't understand college football and what I came here to do. And just to be a part of a school like Clemson and a team like this is really special to me. I wouldn't throw that year away to just sit out in case of injury or whatever it may be.
So I think just those people don't understand the position that we're in and it's not just about money or whatever. It's about just being part of a team and really enjoying being with the guys that you've been here with the past couple of years.
Q. Part of that, too, is being a quarterback gets the most attention, being the competitor you are personally, the player (inaudible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Definitely. I never thought about sitting out or doing any of that. I don't want to do that. So for me, like I said, it's just being with these guys that I've been with the past few years and really finishing and trying to go out on the right note.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I think just realizing, just enjoying the moment where I am right now and realizing I have at least one more year, maybe two. So it's just not that close yet and just enjoying where I'm at. This time is special, like I said, just for Clemson and for college football.
This is a really cool thing we get to be a part of. I think if you look too far ahead you miss out on the joy of this moment.
Q. What's the best part of this for you? You guys get a chance to (inaudible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: The best part has just been you come to school and you have dreams of winning a National Championship and doing all these things. But it's been cool to see everything come to reality and everything you work for.
And Coach Swinney, he'll tell us at the beginning of the season if we do this, do this, we'll be in New Orleans, and you believe it and you know you've got a good team. But to actually do it. And same thing last year, to do it and prove yourself you can do it it's been really special.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's true, anyone can win on any given day but it's the way Coach Swinney has built this program, we prepare the same way every week. That's the biggest thing. Doesn't matter who we're playing, what time of year it is. We'll prepare the same, like it's a championship game. We've done that.
But we've had some close games and on any given day anyone can beat anybody. So you've just got to really prepare well and take everyone seriously, and that's been something I feel like we've done a good job this year.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't think it was necessarily anything happened. I think we just maybe got a little more focused, maybe whatever it was, I think we just we played well before that, too. It was just that game. We were a little off. We weren't playing complementary. Made some mistakes.
I think that was the only thing just didn't play a really good game that game. But I think before that and after that, we played really well and really left no doubt.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I got to watch the first couple drives but then it was before us, so we had to go get ready for the game. But got to watch a little bit of it and obviously saw the highlights after. It's impressive when you can beat anyone that bad, but especially in a playoff game.
So just shows they're really efficient offensively. They're scoring almost every drive. And defensively they've been playing really well, especially towards the end of the year.
So just they're a great team all the way around but that's how it should be. In a championship game you've got two great teams, and that's just the way it should be.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think a couple things. I think it gives us a lot of momentum going into next year, winning this game, but also this group of seniors and juniors that may leave and just all those guys that won't be here next year, I think it's a really big game just to cement their legacy in Clemson.
Three National Championships looks a lot better than two. And just what they've been able to do. I forget how many wins they've had; the senior class has been really special.
But really just the biggest thing is just a goal we set out for. And I don't think a lot of people really believed in us necessarily. And we believe in ourselves and just worked for it and it's going to be really special to be able to accomplish that.
Q. How much respect (indiscernible) Joe Burrow (indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I've got a lot of respect, especially in his journey and what he's had to go through to get where he's at, really worked for what he has. And he does a lot does a lot of things, really accurate, really good in the pocket, keeps his eyes down field.
And also running the ball, he does a good job finding plays outside the pocket and you're taking what the defense gives him, as far as if there's a running lane or whatever it is. He's really good at that. Throws on the run really well. Just anything you can think of he does well pretty much.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Does it make a difference? Yeah, I think the biggest thing, like I said, is just having that experience. It might help a little bit just with what to expect and all that. Once you get on the field, after the first play it's all even. It's a game. It doesn't change anything how big the stage is.
But I think just maybe knowing what to expect is the biggest thing. And being here before, we've played in these games. We know it's don't make the moment too big. I think that might be our only advantage as far as that goes. But I don't think it makes a huge difference honestly.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I lost the spring game, too. People kind of forget about that one. But it's what you dream of doing, especially on this stage and in college. Even I didn't really necessarily dream of this, what I've been a part of.
So I think it's really cool to see what some belief can do. It starts from the top down with Coach Swinney down to our team. If you can believe it then you can do it. And that's just what we do. And I think it's been really cool to experience this brotherhood on this team, this community of Clemson. It's been awesome.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't take a lot of pride in it, just doing everything I can to win. And sometimes that's what it takes, especially when you're playing really good teams, you have to be the equalizer with your legs.
They did a really good job in our run game, Ohio State did. They did some good things. I think just being an equalizer, being able to run the ball. Keep them on their heels is really important. And just doing whatever I can to win.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Same thing with him. He wants to do whatever it takes to win. And we needed him to catch the balls and run and make some plays in the passing game for us to win. And he did that, wasn't the biggest night rushing but he did other things that really impacted the game, him doing that and his versatility really helps us.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: For sure, I mean it is an away game. It's what maybe an hour for them down the road. And I mean it's just you wouldn't want it any other way. It's really cool to be able to come to New Orleans, such a cool city, and play in a game like this and especially the other team an hour down the road. It's going to be really cool. The environment in there is going to be awesome. And it's pretty much like a road game, though, because it's so close for them but we're really excited to be a part of it.
Q. The National Championship experience, I think I heard your head coach kind of downplay (inaudible) is it an advantage that you guys have experience?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think some of our guys do have experience, older guys, obviously, have been here four times now, three times. So but like I said, I think the game's won on the field. That kind of goes out the window once you get on the field. But as far as preparing and knowing what to expect and the schedule and just knowing how much time, all those things, that can have an impact. But once you get on the field the game's going to be won out there, not in the years past. It doesn't really matter too much.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It is weird how it lined up, it's like fate. Both of us are here, in their home state. It's pretty cool.
Q. LSU's defense, what do you see there, they have unique athleticism, the best you've seen or just your general thoughts on their defense?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: They're really good, just their speed. I think from their back seven is really good and up front, they have some good pass rushers and really good big guys that can move, too, and can make some plays. And especially in the run game I'm sorry about that especially in the run game but also in the passing game, rushing the quarterback. So they're really good.
Then obviously their secondary gets a lot of talk, and they're really good players. Just all around the board, all four of those guys are really good and can cover. They can play man. They can play zone, whatever you need them to do.
So just a really good team. But like I said, in this game it's what you expect. They're definitely going to be a challenge because they're so good on every level.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Whatever, maybe some communication things, making sure, me, the running back, O line, all on the same page. Couple times where that hurt us. But also just playing a team like Ohio State with those guys up front, especially Chase Young, it's just hard to protect for long enough to get some downfield shots.
So that's the guy that was up for the Heisman and can be really tough. He did a really good job. His stats weren't great, but he was there all night. Chase was on my back pressuring me. So I think just when you're playing a guy like that, it's really hard to hold up for a long time.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Just keeping them on their heels, mixing it up and just receivers doing a really good job getting off releases and for me just putting the ball where they have a chance. And also whether that's over the top, back shoulder or just whatever, whatever we need to do just to make that happen will be important.
Q. Defensive coordinator, what makes him so great in terms of shutting down?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Just his ability to break down the team, goes in watches him sees things people don't normally see. He sees strengths and weaknesses that, if you're not him, you can't even see what he's talking about. So I think just his ability to see those things and to really find like weak spots in offenses is really special and just he's super committed. He's in there the most probably out of anyone watching film, preparing. And just, I mean, he works for it. Everything that you see him do, all these schemes that he puts together, it's because of how he works and how he prepares.
Q. How much have you heard about this guy and how he got out of the state of Louisiana?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, a lot. We're back home for him. So I know this is special and it's a really cool way to finish this season for him to be able to play in his home state and then also, like I said, he's got a way, LSU is the school in state and he went to Clemson. It's weird how everything worked out, but it's really cool.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Not really, thought about it a little bit especially because Tee and Amari are from there, but for me it was never it wasn't like a down to the wire Clemson or Tennessee. I don't really think about it too much. But I did grow up a Tennessee fan. I thought about it before.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I was a Tennessee fan. My mom's family is from Tennessee. So growing up that's the only thing I really knew was Tennessee football. Watch them all the time. I think when I got middle school or high school kind of started just I guess when I got offers and stuff I kind of quit being a fan.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think you go different places and as a fan you don't really see certain things. But when you're a recruit and you're picking where you want to go, it's going to be your life for the next four years, you want to go somewhere where you just vibe with the people and you feel like it's home and I went to Clemson a lot. Went to Tennessee a couple times. Just really felt like Clemson was home. It was about the people. Didn't really matter that I was a fan growing up. It comes down to where you feel the best at.
Q. As a quarterback, do you admire the way Joe Barrow plays the game?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: For sure, he's a great player. Just his ability to extend plays, extend the pocket. He's really good, really accurate. The year he's had kind of speaks for itself. But I think it's also cool his journey to get here and what he's had to go through it's really cool. But, yeah, he's a great player and it's going to be a good match-up.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I'm really happy for him, first of all, excited that he'll get that opportunity. And I think the best thing about him is the kind of person he is and just everyone says that, but it's true. I got a chance to talk to him a couple times. Just really cool the position he's in and just he's really down to earth, just a really good guy. But he's a great player. He's going to do well. I'm excited to watch him and hopefully he gets back healthy quick. But he's a great player when we played him. I know it was a challenge just how accurate he is and his threats down the field, just really hard to prepare for that. But he's going to do great.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Not really. You have a new team the next year. We lost a lot of those guys, new guys that weren't here. So you can't really lean on that or you'll end up getting beat. We just started over and said this is a new team. Like this team hasn't won anything. That was last year's team that won that. So that was what we had to just start over.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's kind of hard but you realize like I mean after the game for maybe a week people care that you won and then after that it's like, okay, who is going to win next year. Everyone's already talking about next year a couple days after. So it's not as hard as you would think to kind of move on and transition and say now let's do it again this year. It's really not that hard because everyone else is, they don't really care about last year anymore. They want to see who is going to do it again or win next year.
Q. Who wins in a 40 yard dash between you and Barrow.
LAWRENCE: I don't know. I haven't really seen him I haven't watched enough to see him actually break out and run a long I have no idea, honestly. I really don't know.
Q. (Question off mic)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's really special, not just for the guys that were here last year. Obviously it's really special for us to have the opportunity to do it again. But the guys that haven't been here, it's really cool seeing the freshmen that weren't here last year getting to experience it. And then also just, like I said, it's cool being a part of something where you set out to do at the beginning of the year, you had these goals and you feel like you're the only people that really believe in it, and it's cool to be able to actually accomplish those things and get to the moment to where you get to kind of decide what you want to do, want to win the game or not. It's really cool to have the opportunity to win the National Championship, for sure.
Q. How different is (indiscernible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: You know, I don't think much has changed besides the team we're playing is a lot different, obviously, so that's a big difference. But the moment is -- it's special both teams. It's really a cool thing to be a part of. Both are a little bit unique, but the same in just the moment and how special it is.
Q. Was there anything about the experience that you understand now that makes you better prepared?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I think just not making the moment too big. I don't think I did last year, but just really learning from last year that playing in the game and being able to win the game is just realizing it's just another game and not making it too big, but taking in every moment, as well, and focusing on the moment and not the magnitude of the moment. So that's going to be really fun just to be here with these guys and really just enjoy it and not put pressure on ourselves but just enjoy being here.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it's just -- I mean, every week is different in football. You never know, like just the teams you're playing. It's just different every week, so you've got to come every week with the same mindset of preparing and playing just one game at a time, and it's kind of easy to lose focus of that for sure. So I think just for me the biggest thing was just staying locked in and focused and realizing that I want to finish better than I started and I want to take this momentum into the postseason, and that's when we play our best is this time of year. It's a big thing for us, it doesn't really matter how I started, how we started, we just want to finish well.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't know. I don't know, honestly. That's a tough question. Do you mean like National Championship? I think it's cool the different places we get to know. Last year we were in California, in Santa Clara. It's way different than here, so it's cool getting to experience both sides, just the culture. I think that's probably my favorite part is getting to go to new places and you get to do it with guys that you've been in school with for a couple years and guys that become your best friends, so I think that's the coolest thing.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Just a grinder. He's like the ultimate team guy. He doesn't get any recognition, but just comes to work every day, and whatever he's doing, he tries to be the best. So when I think of a guy like that, just a really good teammate, and he's one of my best friends, so just -- he's really special to me, and I think just the way he works, he's very selfless. It's really cool to see.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I'm ready. We've had a lot of media days, a lot of -- we had a couple at the Fiesta Bowl, then this one now. I'm ready just to practice and get to the game honestly. This isn't like a bowl week experience. It's condensed, so we're ready to just do our prep and get out there and play.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think just -- I don't know if I'm necessarily tired of it, but the most asked question I think is just if our experience helps us. I think it's kind of a loaded question. Yeah, it does in some ways, but then again, when you get on the field it doesn't really matter. But I think that's probably the most asked one. Yep, and obviously he's really good, and it's hard to kind of put into words what he's done and how special he's been.
Q. How comfortable are you with this experience compared to a year ago?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it's just different because it's a different team and just a different dynamic of who we have on the team. But it's similar in the moment and how special it is. But also I was saying like it's cool being in a totally different place like New Orleans compared to Santa Clara, so it's really cool.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: We did, we had class Wednesday and Thursday. We started on Wednesday. I mean, the first couple days of class aren't bad. It's kind of just syllabus day, so you don't have to do much work, but it's going to be hard transitioning back when we come back from this game.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think we needed it. We played in a tough, four-quarter game down to the wire. A lot of guys had to play the whole game, and I think we needed that extra week. But it does kind of make it more challenging as far as school goes.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Not really. Not off the top of my head anyway. I think their speed is really special, and their linebackers are special, and then obviously their secondary is really good. But then up front, their D-line, the big guys that can move, and then they've got a really good pass rusher. Just all around the board, they don't really have any weak links. I said that against Ohio State, too, but just both teams are really good, and they're going to present challenges of their own. But I think the most impressive thing is their speed and just sideline to sideline.
Q. Perfect time for me to come in and ask you, you're a tiger, LSU Tigers, Frosted Flakes, their mascot, the Tigers. I'm going to give you some facts, you tell me which tiger it is.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Like LSU Tiger or Clemson Tiger?
Q. Or Frosted Flakes. This tiger recently got a bowl game named after him.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Frosted Flakes.
Q. This tiger has graced the cover of GQ. You can't say yourself.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Still one of the tigers, though? LSU Tiger.
Q. Tony the Tiger, 1974. This tiger has a daughter named Antoinette.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: LSU Tiger?
Q. Tony the Tiger. Did you know cereal mascots have entire families?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I did not.
Q. In 1974, this tiger was named Tiger of the Year.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Tony the Tiger.
Q. You're sensing the theme now. Before he became a mascot, he was almost beat out by a kangaroo.
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Tony the Tiger.
Q. Any profound cereal thoughts?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Frosted Flakes is good. I like Frosted Flakes.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think really everyone goes by that North Carolina game, but that was special in just -- but everyone talks about it as far as what happened after that, what changed as we played -- everybody thinks we played a lot better, but I think just the biggest thing was seeing how we handled that, and we have kind of a young team and just seeing how we responded. We didn't play great but found a way to win. I think that really showed up what we're made of, and it was really good for us.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Not really. It just solidified what we thought. You don't really know until you're in the moment is the biggest thing, and seeing how we handled it, it kind of proved to ourselves we can win whatever way we need to, whether it's by a lot or whether we have to pull it out at the end of the I think it just solidified that.
Q. The Manning camp, I know it's a helter-skelter weekend, but did you have any time at all to meet Joe?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: A little bit. That was the first time we met, so we met and we hung out a little bit, and I was roommates with Jake Fromm, and Joe and Jake are pretty good friends, I think, so he was around a little bit. We got to talk, but we didn't hang out for a long time or anything. But we did get a chance to meet, and we talked a little bit.
Q. Is it pretty crazy that all these quarterbacks are in the Manning pass academy and two are now playing for a National Championship in New Orleans?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, it's really cool. It's a cool experience just to be in Louisiana, in New Orleans, playing a team from Louisiana. It's really special.
Q. How does the experience from a year ago help you guys?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I mean, I don't think -- at the end of the day, when you get on the field that kind of goes out the window. But as far as preparation it might help a little bit just because you've been here before, you know how the schedule goes, you know how much time you have once you get here and all that, but once you get on the field, that goes out the window.
Q. 16 days from the semifinal to the championship, that's a long stretch. How have you managed that, and how have you treated this in terms of scheduling?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It just gives you a little more time to rest and recover from the last game, which helped a lot, but also you have more time to prepare, so I think you get to break everything down a little bit more. You're not as rushed on your preparation, which has been really nice.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, obviously we have great receivers, and what they've been able to do this year has been cool, but we have so many different weapons. Even our two deep, three deep, all those guys can play, so that helps us a lot. But it doesn't change really between any other game plan. You still have to go and you've got to win your match-ups, you've got to make those plays. I've got to throw a good ball, put it where they can get it. I think the biggest thing is just making those plays that we need to win, and if the ball is 50/50 we've got to make them and just as far as for me, taking care of the ball and just putting it in the best place where they can get it.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, it's really cool. It's a lot of fun when you have guys like we do, just to -- when all else fails, you give a guy a chance, most of the time he's going to go up and get it.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, yeah, we prepared for a four-quarter game down to the wire. Got to win it at the end of the game, whatever we have to do we're going to be ready for. But yeah, I mean, they're a great team, and you wouldn't want it any other way. You want two great teams playing in the National Championship, so it's the way it's supposed to be.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: What have I done differently? There's not really much I would change. I think last year, we handled the moment really well, and as far as me, I think I prepared well. But maybe the biggest thing is just taking it in a little bit more, especially before the game, and just these couple days before we play, really enjoying being here with my teammates and not getting so caught up in the game that you forget to have fun. I had fun last year for sure, but if I want to focus on one thing this year, it's really just enjoying it.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't know. I mean, that's hard to -- it depends on all the rules and how -- all those little details of what you can and can't do. It just depends on what got passed. But I think definitely it would be different. There would be some opportunities available that would be cool, but I don't honestly really think about it. I'm just enjoying where I'm at, and whether it gets passed or not, it's just -- it's whatever to me, honestly.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, I've thought about it, especially when all the talk was out about how it's eventually going to be passed, just don't really know when. So I've definitely thought about it, and I think it would be a cool opportunity for guys, but it would also be hard to manage how much you can make or what you can do. I think it would be tough.
Q. When you watch the tape of LSU's (indiscernible), does it amaze you he's only a freshman?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, he's really good. Just his ball skills are impressive and the way he carries himself, like he's an older guy, like he's a senior. That's the thing that impresses me the most. When he makes a play, he's not like freaking out celebrating. It's just the normal for him. So I'm really impressed with how he plays and just his ball skills are really good.
Q. What does it take to win a championship?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think everyone does it in their own way, but the common denominators are just being a winner as far as just on the inside and believing you can. I think that's the biggest thing. And then also just toughness and playing for your teammates. I think that's the biggest thing is if you're playing for yourself, you're not going to get very far, so just playing for the guys beside you, and I think those are the main things.
Q. Where does the confidence come from?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It comes from your preparation, what you've done to get here, all that you've been through, your experiences. And then also the guys around you. You have a lot of confidence in them and the work you've put in and all those -- I think just all the great players around me is what gives me a lot of confidence.
Q. (Indiscernible). Do you feel that pressure? How do you handle that?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think the biggest thing is just believing. If guys see that you still believe, I mean, for example, an Ohio State game, I think it's -- in a situation like that, we're down 16-0 and guys see that I still believe, there's no doubt that we were going to win that game to me. So when guys see that, they really think, hey, we can still do this. I think that's the biggest thing is having belief but also showing it and letting other people see that.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, yeah, I met him out at the Manning camp this summer. We got to talk a little bit. That was the first time I met him, so we got to hang out a little bit.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: For sure. Not based on our interaction. It wasn't much. But the way he's played this year and what he's been able to do on some of the biggest stages. You definitely see that.
Q. What do you think about the team's social media policy? (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It was last year, but this is my second year. I'm kind of used to it now. I think it's really good. It limits how much we're on it, and there's a lot of stuff on social media that's distracting and stuff that people are saying, and it's just good to not really read it for the most part. So I think that's really good for us.
And then also it kind of keeps us focused so we're not worried about posting things or getting into it with someone. So I think it's good for us.
Q. If you guys didn't have the policy, do you think you would be (indiscernible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't think I would personally, but I can't really speak for everyone else on the team. I'm not sure, but I might most a little bit, but it wouldn't be a lot in the season.
Q. Do you think you'll post right after?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah. I mean, maybe not right after, but within the next couple days probably, yeah.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I don't think so really. I think we're just as motivated, whether we're winning or losing, but really it does get more real in that moment when you're losing and you're down a couple scores. It's like, all right, now we've got to make some plays. If we don't start scoring season, it's going to be over. That was the biggest thing was more of a sense of urgency, like okay, now is the time, we've got to start making plays and we've got to get back in this game.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I think it's just -- I was telling them before, just believing, and that starts with really -- that starts inside, but also with Coach Swinney, and he just instills in us such a culture of belief, believing it can be done, and that's the thing is it doesn't matter what the score is, we always believe until the very end, so that's the biggest thing is believing you can do it.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it's similar just in that they're really good players, but they have different styles. The defenses they play are different. But both teams had really good players in their secondary, so I think that's the biggest similarity.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, yes, but also you have Fulton, too, the other corner, you have Jacoby Stevens at safety, so I think they have great players everywhere, and when you play a good team like them, a great team like them you can't really focus too much on one guy because they've got the other 10 guys that are really good, too. It'll just be -- taking care of the ball will obviously be really important, possessions will be huge in this game, but really just making the plays that are there, and we're going to have to win our match-ups.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, maybe a little bit. I think -- they played Jalen Hurts, who's a really good running quarterback, and they did pretty good in that regard. So I don't think it's going to necessarily give them any headaches as far as preparation. But Jalen Hurts is a really good runner, so I think they've kind of dealt with that and prepared for him.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Not really, just whatever it takes. That's what I see myself as, whatever it takes to win.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think it's been a good amount of time just to get recovered, rest a little bit. It was good for us for sure. But I think the biggest thing just with the young guys is they've played a whole season now. They're not necessarily young anymore. But just they haven't been in this moment yet, so just telling them, don't let the moment get too big. It's just a game. And when you get on the field it doesn't really matter how big the moment was, it's still just a game and you've got to go play it. That's the biggest thing is just not making it bigger than it is.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: You just prepare the same way you have for all the other ones. If something is working, why change it, and that's how I see it. You've got to prepare the same way, and that's what I'm doing is just preparing the best I can in this time that I have.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: No, it's awesome. It's just really a cool experience to get to go to these different places. We've been to Dallas, to California, Arizona, and now New Orleans, and it's really cool to get to be a part of that and also get to win some big games in the process.
Q. What do you do to mentally prepare yourself before the game?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think the biggest thing is just staying focused and really using every bit of time you can to prepare, then kind of right before the game, disconnecting and just taking some time to lock in and not necessarily look at anything or study anything but just have your time by yourself. That's the biggest thing I do.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I mean, I have before, but not really now. Just you get so caught up in where you're at and trying to win the next one and you're preparing as best you can. You don't really think about things that far ahead. But definitely in the off-season it's cool to look back on what you've done but also to kind of look ahead. But I think it's important not to look ahead too much, so I don't know how much time I'll spend doing that.
Q. Do you spend any time (indiscernible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I haven't really thought about it yet. I'll think about it in the off-season because that is important to get better in the things you need to get better at. But I think the biggest thing is just continuing to be me and trusting in that, not trying to do too much but also realizing there is some room for improvement for sure. It's a mixture of that, just trusting yourself and having faith in who you are is enough, but also you want to get better for sure.
Q. What can you be better at?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I think just recognition as far as defenses, and then also in our own offenses, just knowing all the little tiny details is just something I'm always trying to learn. And then just footwork and keeping my eyes downfield and all those things, accuracy, are things that you can always work on.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: I've been happy with it. I think the team needed it as far as just we lost a lot of guys last year that were big leaders, and it's just something that I needed to do if we were going to maximize our potential. So I think I've done a good job of stepping into that role and I can definitely grow more in that. But I'm proud of the way that I've led and not necessarily the most vocal or rah-rah guy, but I think I lead by example, and that's the biggest thing.
Q. (Indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: No, it was easier last year just to stay -- being a freshman, you're young and you're new to everything and you haven't been there long, and it's easier just to stay in the back and just play, and that's all you've got to worry about is just doing your thing and the other guys are going to do theirs and it's good. But this year it's been cool. It's been a challenge for sure, but it's been really cool to have to step into that new role.
Q. How do you think this environment is going to affect you as a team?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's just going to be like a road game. We've played in some big games with a lot of fans that are against us, so it's not going to be much different. But it's going to be really cool, and a unique experience being able to play in Louisiana, playing a team from Louisiana.
Q. So this year LSU has been (indiscernible).
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I think when you have a team like LSU, they're just historically -- they've always been good, and the last few years haven't necessarily been what they were, and now they're back and they've had an unbelievable year. The things they've been able to do is really special so I think they deserve the attention, but it's also media, fans, everyone just kind of wants something new. We won last year, and it's kind of like, all right, who's going to do it this year. So I think it's a mixture of those two things, but definitely know it's not discounting anything they've done. They've had a really amazing year.
Q. Is that something you've talked about is what to use as added motivation?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Maybe a little bit, but we've just been trying to focus on us and what we want to do, our goals and just believing we can do it more so than thinking about them and the recognition they're getting.
Q. How valuable was last year's experience?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: You're asking just about the experience of playing in this -- yeah, I think it'll help as far as just knowing just the days you have to prepare and maximizing that and knowing how the schedule is going to be. But I've said a couple times, I think it's just when you get on the field, that stuff doesn't really matter. That doesn't win. It's not really that big of an advantage really. That stuff doesn't win. It's going to be won on the field.
Q. Last year at this time Shaun Alexander came up to you and told you that you were going to be the freshman of the year. That's kind of a leap of faith before you beat Bama. Did that give you any charge, any pride in being the first ever freshman of the year?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It was awesome. Obviously Shaun is a great guy and we've talked a little bit since then just back and forth. I've seen him a couple of times, and it's been a cool relationship to be able to build. But I mean, yeah, it was cool to have someone to have some faith in you, so it was cool.
Q. We saw the first edition of the new Trevor. You're a lot bigger and stronger now it seems than you were a year ago. Did it take some time to work with that new strength, kind of like a jump shot when a guy lifts weights --
TREVOR LAWRENCE: No, it wasn't really that, but yeah, I've definitely been working really hard to try to gain some weight. I gained a lot of weight before my first season, and then I've gained probably seven or eight pounds or maybe a little bit more from the first to the second season, so that's always been something for me, I've always had to gain weight, always trying to get stronger. But yeah, I don't think it really was a big adjustment necessarily.
Q. That last drive against Ohio State, they don't hit you like that in practice. Can you just talk about that moment and just how -- did it just happen, or was it something that you knew two or three steps into it was going to happen?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: It's just you get in the end of the game and you have that mentality like whatever it takes to win, you want every yard, you're fighting for every yard because it all matters at that point, so that was my mentality was I want to run the ball, I'm going to get as much as I can get, and I'm not really thinking about sliding in that moment because in that game every yard matters. So that was my mindset.
Q. How much of a difference does No. 7 make to their defense?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: He's really good. I mean, Thorpe winner, I think just his play speaks for itself. But there's a lot of things he does that you don't really see. It seems like he's a really smart player. I don't necessarily know what they're coached to do, but it seems like he's always where he's coached to be and has a ton of pass breakups, and really a physical player and in the box he'll come downhill trying to play the run. So he's really good and really physical. I think that's the biggest thing as a safety it's important to be physical, and he does that really well.
Q. Studying this defense, have you seen a difference (indiscernible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, I think it's like any good team. I mean, you want to play your best at this time of year, and they're doing that, and especially on the defensive side, they're playing their best football now when it really counts. That's a really good quality for a team to have. But yeah, I mean, you see that they have been playing a lot better. I don't necessarily know what it is, but I think they're playing more sound. They've always been physical and always play with a chip on their shoulder. But they're a really good team for sure.
Q. How do you break down what they do (indiscernible)?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: He's really good. Like I said, he just seems like he's older, like he's a senior from the way he carries himself, and he makes a play and doesn't make a big deal of it. It's not all show. He makes a play and just goes about his business. So I think that's a cool thing to see, but also his ball skills are really good, especially for a freshman. He's physical, all those things. He's a really good player.
Q. (Indiscernible) now he's the guy chasing you in the ACC?
TREVOR LAWRENCE: Yeah, he's really good, and you kind of see a freshman playing like he did, you see that mentality he has, he's always attacking, and he's not scared of the moment, and I really like that about him. He's a gamer for sure.
