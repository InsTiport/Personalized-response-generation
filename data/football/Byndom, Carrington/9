  THE MODERATOR: Questions for Carrington Byndom. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I definitely do. After playing the first week, you definitely see things you have to improve on. I think we'll go back to the drawing board this week and we'll make sure and correct all these things for this upcoming game. 

Q.   Played a lot of young guys. As they have one game under their belt, maybe they play better the second game. 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I definitely think so. You go out there first game, you have first-game jitters, you're a little nervous and everything. I think the more and more you get snaps, the more and more you get reps, the more calm and confident and everything you'll be next game. 

Q.   You get this first interception under your belt (indiscernible). 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: There's two sides to being a corner. You have to be able to cover receivers and you have to be able to stop the run, tackle and things like that. 
It's not the first thing. But I'll get my opportunities. 

Q.   What do you think when you hear 'option attack' headed your way? 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: You just get on the ground pretty much. You know, we know they're going to run the ball this week. That's their main goal. We will try to stop the run. That's the goal. 

Q.   Not as much fun, though, is it? 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Any game's fun. If they're passing the ball 100 times, running the ball 100 times, it's a fun game. We'll be amped up and ready to play the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Back in high school. We played a wing T team. That was, what, three years ago. It's been a while. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Connor Oakridge. 

Q.   It's going to be a physical week of practice. Even though you're playing an option team, a lot more running backwards than forwards? 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Probably so. We're ready for the next challenge. We'll be ready to play. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Does that count for all positions? 

Q.   Yes. 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I definitely think as a whole, that's one of the goals we said, is being more physical. That's one thing we try to do in the course of a game, is bring the boom. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Definitely exciting to get that first hit out of the way, that first lick. That was an exciting time for me. 

Q.   How do you think you guys did overall? 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I mean, I think overall we played real well. We did our goal. We completed our goal. That was to prevent points. We prevented 17. Our offense scored 37. So we did our job. 
As far as the play, we could have started out a little faster. But things happen and we slowly, you know, controlled that. So I think, you know, we just need to go back to basics and I think everything will be fine. 

Q.   (No microphone.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I come each game and I'm ready to play. I think other guys can see that and it makes guys want to follow. Being a leader on the team, that's what you have to be. You have to step up and you have to perform like great players should. 

Q.   Tough guy now? 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Trying to be (laughter). 

Q.   The 82-yard touchdown, does that light a fire? After that, things turned around. 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: Kind of like a fluke play for us. But we just told each other, It's time to go. Everybody gets focused. I think that's what we did. Coach Akina started talking to us about changing momentum. I think that's when the interceptions came. 
I definitely think it kind of lit a fire on your nerves, but at the same time I think we knew we needed to step up and play. 

Q.   (Question regarding Josh.) 
CARRINGTON BYNDOM: I definitely think he has great ball skills, efficient hits. He's a good cover corner. He's playing safety for us. I think he can do both. He knows both. So he's definitely a great player for us to have. 
He's not the most outspoken person.
