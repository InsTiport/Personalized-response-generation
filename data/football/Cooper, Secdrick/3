THE MODERATOR: Questions for safety, Secdrick Cooper.   
 Q.  Explain your emotions and getting back on the field with your guys tonight.  
SECDRICK COOPER: Right now I'm encouraged by the defense.  Seen a lot of good things out there, just have to focus on tackling the ball carrier and not giving up the big play.  I felt like we did a good job, decent job defensively, as far as filling our gaps and coverages, but like I said, the big plays and the missed tackles was a down for the day.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
SECDRICK COOPER: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
SECDRICK COOPER: You know, it was kinda -- wasn't, um, much of a -- what am I trying to say here?  It wasn't really we kind of fell off, like I said, it was the missed tackles and the details toward the end of the game.  Look at the scoreboard, and we was kind of down, but it was just like detail, missed tackles.   
 Q.  You are the most senior in the defensive backfield.  When you go into the defensive back meetings and you look around at younger guys, and they're watching film, what do you hope to teach them about being ready?  
SECDRICK COOPER: Teach them to learn from this game.  We got plenty more games to come, and you can step up next week.  Just don't let it bring you down.  We've got -- like Coach said, we have 24 hours to mourn the loss, get it out of the way and comeback stronger next week.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
SECDRICK COOPER: Yeah, he's talented.  Probably one of the best cornerbacks we have right now and, you know, in the future, he has a real bright future.
