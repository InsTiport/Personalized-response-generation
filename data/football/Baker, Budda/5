BUDDA BAKER: We weren't really worried about how many plays we were doing.  Every time we were on defense, they tried to get a stop and did a great job of handling the ball and running down the field. 
Q. So you guys were without some of your regular guys to start there.  What is the mindset when you take the field like that?
BUDDA BAKER: The mindset is next guy in, same person.  Whoever we're playing with, the mindset is next guy in, and do what you've got to do.
Q. Thoughts about Christian McCaffrey?
BUDDA BAKER: He's a great back.  He read the holes, went slow and hit it.  They use him everywhere, passing game, kick return.
Q. Anything different from what you saw on film?
BUDDA BAKER: From Christian?
Q. Yeah.
BUDDA BAKER: I saw on film that he's a great back, a great receiver.
Q. What makes him so hard to stop?  I mean, just the size and the way they execute?
BUDDA BAKER: Stanford?  Yeah, probably they just don't leave the ball up.  They're smart.  They've got very smart O-linemen, very smart running backs.  They don't fumble.  They don't really make mistakes.  So you've got to grind with them and try to stop them.
