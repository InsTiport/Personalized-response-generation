BUDDA BAKER: Got to be a team way to win the game.  You can't just win the game on defense or offense or special teams.  It has to be everyone.   
 Q.  Obviously, you never want to lose a game, but is it almost like you were glad to be able to get that wakeup call before it's too late?  
BUDDA BAKER: Of course I'm not glad about losing, but I felt like it was good for us.  We got smacked in the mouth.  Then for everything we were saying was how are we going to respond.   
So after that game, you know, we had our talks and all that type of stuff and we were just ready for practice that next week.   
 Q.  Have you seen much tape of the USC-Alabama game?  
BUDDA BAKER: Yes.  Watch a lot of college film, NFL film and all this type of stuff.  Just trying to make me a better player.  He loves Ronde Barber.  He coached him and all that type of stuff.   
 Q.  Do you see any similarities between your game and Ronde's?  
BUDDA BAKER: Yeah, of course.  He can play any position.  He can play safety, nickel, corner.  And that's how I feel like I can play.  He's smart.  I feel like I'm smart and all that type of stuff.  So I feel like there's a good amount of comparison.   
 Q.  Coach ever gotten you in touch with him, Ronde?  
BUDDA BAKER: We met him before.  So he came to a practice so we all met him, talked to him, asked questions and all that type of stuff.
