Q. Coach Sark will be the new offensive coordinator after this playoff.  You guys know him, you've been around him.  There's got to be a good comfort level there.
DAMIEN HARRIS: He's been here for a good amount of the year.  But like I said, as of right now, Coach Kiffin is still our offensive coordinator so we're working with him and he'll be in place for us.
Q. Right now, it's all about Lane Kiffin, Damien Harris, running back for Alabama.  This Washington defense has been awfully good all year.  What jumps out when you watch these guys on film?
DAMIEN HARRIS: Just how fundamental and sound they are.  They're in the right gaps.  They're where they're supposed to be when they're supposed to be there.  They don't make a lot of mistakes.  It's hard to play against a team that executes so well.  I think we'll put in a great game plan and we've been working hard this week.  So we'll be able to execute against them and make plays.
