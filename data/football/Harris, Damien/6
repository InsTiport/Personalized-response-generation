 Q.  How do you feel about people skipping the bowl game to prepare for the draft?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: All these guys just skip to decide, Well, I'm not going to play in the bowl game to protect my draft stock.  I mean, if John Allen decided he didn't want to play in the game, I mean, we wouldn't be happy with that.  Reuben, any of these guys that we know are going to have very successful NFL careers, if they were just like we're not going to play, that would kind of feel like a disrespect to me.  And I know these guys wouldn't do that, and I wouldn't do that to them.   
So I think that that kind of is an indicator of how you feel about your team and how you feel about your teammates.
