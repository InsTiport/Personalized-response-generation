 Q.  Welcome to Atlanta.  I know this is exactly where you wanted to be.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, it's great to be back in Atlanta.  It's kind of where we started the season.  And going in it's where we knew we wanted to finish, so it's a great opportunity for us to be back here.   
 Q.  Talk about Monday night and how great the team effort was to get into this position?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It was a tough game and I think we really played well.  We knew we needed everybody on the team to give their best effort in order for us to have the success that we had on Monday.  So it was great to see a lot of guys come out there and play with a lot of energy, a lot of passion, a lot of toughness for four quarters so we could win that game.   
 Q.  Georgia, obviously, physical, tough, kind of a mirror image?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It's another tough game.  It's the last game of the season.  We're one of the last two teams practicing and playing for another opportunity to win another game.  So we're looking forward to it, we know we're playing a great team, and we're looking forward to the opportunity.   
 Q.  What have you seen on film of this defense?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: They're your typical SEC defense.  They're tough in the trenches, they've got a lot of team speed, they move side to side really well, they just do a lot of things, they can pose a lot of challenges for your offense.  So we know we need a great game plan, we need everybody to go out and play with the best fundamental execution in order for us to have success on offense.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We knew the challenge we would be faced with.  We know that it's good for us to kind of keeping in the swing of things, that way we don't get complacent and dwell on the last win too much.  We're excited to be here and we're glad for this opportunity so we're really looking forward to it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I mean, we have confidence in ourselves and the way that we play.  The fundamental execution that we play with, the details, and all the things that we come into the game with, that's what makes us confident.  We know they're a tough defense.  Oklahoma obviously has a great offense and they were able to have success.  But we're not really looking at what they did, we're trying to focus on what we can do to have success on offense.  We have confidence in ourselves as players, we have confidence in the coaches to put us in the best position to have success.   
 Q.  How rewarding was it to beat Clemson?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It was very rewarding.  Not necessarily because we got an extra game on Clemson, we're 2-1 in the series, but the fact that we have the opportunity to play for another National Championship.  So we're not really focused on that game anymore, it happened, we enjoyed it for 24 hours, and now we're looking forward to our next opponent.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It's good because a lot of times you hear coaches say, act like you've been here before.  And we have had the blessing of being here before, so we know what to expect in games like this, we know what it's going to take and it's just about if we're willing to do it.   
 Q.  How great is it to be on this stage at this time?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It's an amazing opportunity.  We're really thankful to have this opportunity.  We're thankful to be put in the playoffs.  And we made the most of our opportunity last Monday, so we're looking forward to another opportunity to show that we think we're the best team in the country.   
 Q.  If there's one thing about this team that got you here, what would it be?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think it starts with the coaches.  Having the trust and the faith in the coaches to put us in the best position to be successful on offense.  I think that kind of starts what we want to do and then it's up to us to go out there and execute the fundamentals that they provide us with.  So I think all of those things combined, I think we have done a good job of that and we look to do that again on Monday.   
 Q.  Talk about Jalen.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: That guy over there?  Jalen's obviously a great player.  I don't think I need to talk much about his athletic ability and what he does on the field.  I think the biggest thing, the biggest compliment for Jalen, is his leadership and that leadership role that's really stepped into this year.  Last year he led basically just based off his ability.  He was a true freshman, 18-year-old kid that kind of came in and it's hard for somebody in that position to step up and be vocal, be that vocal leader off the field that you need.  But I think over the last year he's really done a good job of stepping into that leadership role, being a guy that's not afraid to speak up in team meetings or address an issue that we have as a team.  So I think that has really cemented his leadership on this team.   
 Q.  You guys have a lot of running backs.  Georgia has them too.  Talk about that.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Both teams have great players at all positions, so we hear about their guys, I'm sure they hear about our guys.  But at the end of the day we know it's two great teams, great coaches, great players, playing for a National Championship, it's a game, just really who wants it more.   
 Q.  What's the most important thing coming in the game to focus on?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: One thing that Coach Saban has talked to us about all week is not necessarily focusing on the results.  You want to focus on the things that you have to do in order to have success in games like these.  If you just -- if you go about it just based on what you want to happen, thinking about winning the game, you're not going to be focused on, what do have I to do to do my job, what do I have to do to make this team the best team that I can make it.  So I think that the biggest thing for us is just focusing on those things that we need to do to be the best people that we can be for this game.   
 Q.  In other words, the process?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Sure.  If that's what you want to call it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't really understand what people -- what more people want from him.  He's led us to a National Championship two years in a row, in his first two years here, so.  He's broken almost every school record we have, he's broken national records.  I don't really know what people want him to do.  But at the end of the day we stand behind Jalen and we know the type of player he is, the type of person he is, so none of that outside criticism matters.  Everybody gets criticized.  That's just a part of the game and a part of the business that we're in, but none of that matters to us.  You can go ask him, I guarantee you it doesn't matter to him at all.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I mean it is his team and it's been his team since day one last year.  That particular situation against Mississippi State, you kind of look at what he said.  He told us to either get on the bus or get off and then he led us to win the game.  So that's proof right there that what he says he does and he takes his game very seriously.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
 (Laughter.)  I think that's the most blunt way I've ever heard that question be asked.  Do I want more carries?  I want to win.  This game is so important to us as a team.  Individually, we all want this game more than anything.  I don't really care if I get one carry or a hundred carries.  Whatever it's going to take to help this team win this game, that's what I want to do.   
 Q.  Is the SEC down this year?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: The National Championship game is the last game of the season and only two teams get the opportunity to play for that and both teams are from the SEC, so I don't think there's any problem with this conference.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: When one conference has so much success, I guess people kind of get tired of that, but I mean there's nothing we can do about that.   
 Q.  What are some of the biggest challenges that the Georgia defense presents to you guys as running backs?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: They got a good front four.  They got good interior linemen that take up space, make it hard to have good run fits and things like that.  They obviously got a great linebacking core, starting with Roquan Smith.  He won the Butkus, great player, he's kind of like Reuben for us last year.  He plays with a lot of explosiveness, very instinctive, a very good football player.  But they propose a lot of challenges on our offense.  But we know that if we go out there and play with great fundamental execution and play the way that we're coached to play, that we'll be able to have success.   
 Q.  (Question about the President coming to the game.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I mean if he wants to come then he can come.  It's not -- I don't even know how to answer that question.   
 Q.  How important has the wide receiver group blocking for you been?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Obviously it's great for our -- it helps our team have success on offense.  And when you got guys that can block on the perimeter, that's what makes the difference between a six-yard run and a 60-yard run.  When you got guys on the perimeter blocking corners, safeties, outside linebackers, and just making things more explosive on the running game.  In turn we want to block for them.  We want to pass protect and in the passing game, that way Jalen can find open receivers.  If they catch screens, we want to block for them.  I mean it's all, we all want to work together and do whatever we can to make this offense as successful as possible.   
 Q.  Are you concerned about any of the protests that might be here with the President being here.  Is there any concerns about any of that?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't think Coach Saban is as serious all the time as people think.  He has a lot of fun with us at practice and the meeting room, he jokes around a lot.  When it's time to be serious, of course he's serious.  But he does a great job of balancing that with interacting with his players, showing his players his human side.  And I don't think that he likes to show you guys that side, because most of the time you're talking to him it's in a press conference or you're talking about winning games and stuff like that, so he's focused on that.  But with us he does a great job of just showing us his human side.  And we don't get caught up in the whole Saban's this, Saban's that, he's always in a bad mood, we don't get caught up in that.  We know how he is and we love him and he loves us and he treats us like men, so we're really glad to have somebody like that as our coach.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We don't -- I mean, I don't want to compare them to anybody else.  We played a lot of great defenses this year and they're going to be no different.  They've got a good front seven, guys in the secondary that can make plays, so.  We played a lot of great defenses this year, but we expect this to be no different.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Coach Saban's done a lot of this stuff on his own.  I can't take any credit for that and I know that we can't.  But he's done a great job in his coaching career and his resume is second to none.  But being able to be a part of something like that, I think that would be truly special for this team.  Coach Saban does a lot for us and he cares about us and he loves us, and he treats us like men, so I think helping him accomplish something like that, being a part of the journey to help him accomplish something like that, I would cherish something like that.  I know a lot of guys on the team would too.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't know.  Maybe, maybe one day I can get a job working on TV talking about football.  I'm only saying that because Tom Rinaldi is standing right beside me.   
 Q.  With Damien Harris we have talked about this before, but you paint such a vivid picture.  The walk from when the game ended in the title a year ago to the locker room, what did you see?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I saw the confetti flying, I saw fans running on the field, I see guys celebrating, getting ready to hold up the trophy.  You see guys pouring Gatorade on their coaches.  I mean everything that you dream of having, you see it on its opposite end and you're kind of looking from the outside in like, that's not us, that's what we came here to do and somebody else is doing it right in front of our face.  So that was just -- that was a feeling that I'll never forget and I know a lot of guys will never forget and that's something that we want to eliminate from happening ever again.   
 Q.  What's the challenge in the tight turnaround?  You guys have been in these games before, but this is the tightest turn around from the semi to the title game.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think the biggest thing is getting guys rested up.  That was a tough game that we played on Monday, a physical game and a tough game that we played for four quarters.  So I think one of the most important things is to get guys rested up, guys that need treatment, guys that are a little banged up, getting those guys healthy and getting ready to turn around and play another great game on Monday.   
 Q.  Between then and now, what was your most nervous time?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't know about nerves.  Anxiety is at an all time high.  This is the biggest game that a lot of us have ever played in.  So I think just walking in the tunnel right before the game starts, anxiety is going to be at an all time high.  This is a moment that we have all dreamed of as kids, so that anxiety gets out on the field and to have the opportunity to play for another National Championship is going to be through the roof.   
 Q.  Talk about that anxiety.  What does that mean to you?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: As soon as you step on the field it all kind of goes away, because we're playing under all these lights in front of thousands of fans, but at the end of the day the way I look at it is this is a game that we have all been playing since we have been eight, nine, 10 years old.  This is another game of football.  People ask me all the time, are you excited for the game?  Are you nervous?  And my response is always, it's just another game.  Sure, we have the opportunity to hold a National Championship trophy at the end, but it's a game of football, it's what we have been doing for years.  So that anxiety before the game is just being ready to go out there and compete against another great team.  And that competitive nature, I think, is something that creates that anxiety.  But I think that once you step on the field and once you get your feel for the game it all kind of goes away and you just play the game of football like you have for 10, 12 years.   
 Q.  What have you seen from Jalen this year?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think the biggest thing I've noticed from Jalen is his leadership.  Obviously, last year he led by example.  He led based off his athletic ability and things he could do on the field.  But over the past year I really seen him develop as a vocal leader, a guy that's not afraid to stand up in team meetings and a guy that's not afraid to voice his opinions and call people out for not doing the right thing or not preparing or practicing to the standard of what we want to do around here.  So I think that's the biggest thing and that's the sign of a true leader, somebody that can go against the grain, not necessarily be worried about, well, is this guy going to like what I have to say about him instead of I have to encourage this guy to do what's best for the team.  So that's something that we've all noticed and something that I think has cemented him as one of our true leaders of this team.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: You can say that.  I think that's just part of him growing and maturing as a person.  People forget, he's not even 20 years old yet.  I think he's still 19.  So I think he's just growing up and that's a part of being a good quarterback and being a good player.  You have to grow up and mature.  I think that he's doing that at a very rapid pace and I think it's been good for our team this year.   
 Q.  What did you think when you heard the President was going to be at the game Monday night?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I didn't really think much of it at all.  It's the President, but it's just somebody else attending the game.  So hopefully he's cheering for us.   
 Q.  Any feedback on the impact of social media as you prepare for this game?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: In regards to what?   
 Q.  Is it a distraction or a benefit?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't see it being very beneficial.  But you don't want to read too much into what other people have to say.  It doesn't matter what other people have to say.  None that have matters to us.  I guess it really doesn't have that much of an impact.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: You're talking about just in the game, National Championship game last year?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I remember that conversation.  Yeah, it was motivation, not necessarily because -- Bo was playing really well at that time.  And one thing about us is, I've told you a lot of times that we are a very unselfish group so whoever is playing the best at the time that's who we want to play, because that's who puts us best -- in the best position to have success on offense.  So it's more motivation because I saw him playing at such a high level that I wanted to compliment him.  And that's kind of how we worked throughout this year.  But in that moment I was like this guy's playing so well he's on fire.  So that motivated me as a player, because I want to live up to the standard that he's creating, the standard that he's setting.  I don't want to go in the game and there be a drop-off just because I'm in the game and he's not.  So I think it was more motivation that way instead of oh, well, why am I not getting more carries, why am I not in the game more.  It was just motivation to play better and to be a better player for this team, because I wanted to play up to his level.  I wanted to kind of match his intensity.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I felt it.  We had a lot of success in that game and we really feel like we dominated that game from start to finish.  We had a couple plays here and there that we would like to get back and we thought that we didn't execute the way that we should have, but there were a lot of guys that were just hot and a lot of guys that were just making plays when they needed to be made.  So I think that's just kind of been the motto of this team.  Whenever your number's called, whenever your name is called and the play has to be made, you have to make the play.  So there are a lot of moments in that game where a lot of different guys were able to do that and I think that really helped us win that game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Maybe, maybe just a little bit.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, anything that we can do as running backs to impact this offense in a positive way and to be assets to this offense is what we're going to do.  We know -- we knew going into that game we would have a couple screens, a couple things in the perimeter to keep things out of the interior.  We new Clemson had a good front four and a good front seven, so we wanted to do things to get things on perimeter, get the ball out to the playmakers.  So whatever the coaches ask us to do, we're willing to do it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, you could say that.   
 Q.  Have you kept up with him over the years?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I actually have.  Me and Coach Stoops kind of still remain -- or maintain a relationship and we're still pretty cool, so we talk every now and then.  Talk about what's going on with them, talk about what's going on with us.  He's told me good luck before games before.  And it's good to catch up with a guy like that that I was so close with in my recruiting process.   
 Q.  (Question about his decision to go to Alabama.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It was tough.  It was extremely tough decision.  It came almost up to the last minute, so it was clearly a tough decision.  But at the end of the day I felt like I did what was best for me and I'm obviously happy with my decision.  Playing in my third National Championship in three years, I think I made the right choice.   
 Q.  The last year Kentucky didn't sign a player from Kentucky.  Does that surprise you?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I guess.  I don't know.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: You can say that.  Coming from a place where there's not -- it's not seen as a big football school and -- or a big football state, everybody focuses on basketball.  But to come from a place like that and kind of show that there can be some talent if it comes out.  But I mean, yeah, sure, I guess.   
 Q.  Did you play basketball growing up?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I did.  I played up until my sophomore year in high school.   
 Q.  What made you switch?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I knew for a long time that football was what I wanted to do.  It was just being a kid and loving playing the game of sports, being a competitor.  I played basketball, I ran track, I did a lot of different things.  So just being that competitor, I wanted to do as much as I could.  But then after a certain point in time I kind of realized that I had to focus on one or the other.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Did you say on the field or off the field?   
 Q.  Your relationship on and off the field.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think that it's good for us to -- first of all, we're a very close group.  And one thing that I talked about earlier is on the field we like to compliment each other and there's never a time where one of us wants more carries, none of us complain about well, I'm not getting the ball as much as the next guy or I'm not playing as much as the next guy.  And at the end of the day we're so close that we know that whatever is best for the team that's what needs to happen.  So we're not necessarily concerned about who gets what carries, who gains the most yards, who gets what touchdowns, things like that.  I think that that's good for our team.  It's been beneficial for us.  We all want to compliment each other.  If a guy goes in and has a lot of success, each and every other guy, they kind of look at it as motivation because they want to play up to that guy's level.  Last year at the end of the season when Bo started to have a lot of success, that motivated me and some other guys in the back field because we wanted to play up to the standard that he was playing to.  So I think that that's kind of a testament to how close we are.  There's never any complaining, like I said.   
Off the field, we like to get together, we like to hang out, we like to have fun just like anybody would assume.  Like I said, we're just a close group of guys and it's been an honor to play with these guys, it's been an honor to grow close with these guys and to have the opportunity to win another National Championship with them.   
 Q.  Is there a little extra motivation going up against the guys that Georgia has?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Oh, no, we respect those guys.  We know that those are two great running backs, and we know that they have got a great running back core.  But our motivation is holding the National Championship at the end of the game Monday.   
 Q.  Georgia's defense.  What do you see in it and what's it going to take for Alabama to win?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: They have a tough defense and we played a lot of tough defenses this year, so we don't expect this game to be any different.  We have had to overcome a lot of adversity versus a lot of teams that we have played, and we know that they're going to present a lot of challenges to us on offense.  But we feel like if we play with the right fundamental execution that we'll be able to have success and do our part on the offensive side of the ball and give us the best chance to win a National Championship.   
 Q.  How similar is Georgia's defense to what you see every week?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Very similar.  Very similar.  Coach Smart is -- he's one of Coach Saban's prodigies, so obviously a lot of things that he does, it comes from Coach Saban.  He's learned from him, so we know a that it's going to be a lot of things that we see every day in practice.  Like I said, we feel like we practiced against the best defense in the country every single day, so we think that that will give us an advantage in this game and we think that it will give us opportunity to go out there and play with better fundamental execution and do all the things that we need to do in order to be successful.   
 Q.  Are you comfortable in this National Championship environment doing it all the time?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Oh, yeah, I mean you know coaches say you want to act like you've been here before.  And we have been blessed with the opportunity to actually have been here before.  This is my third year now, so we know what it takes to win games like these and we also know what it's like to lose games like these.  So I feel like we're in the best of both worlds.  I think that gives us an advantage and it will give us an opportunity to go out and play to the standard that we feel like we need to play in to win this game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Definitely.  We started the season here and at the beginning of the year we knew the National Championship game was in Atlanta, so we wanted to start here and finish here and we got the opportunity to do that.  So now it's all about finishing.  We know we only got one game left, so it's one of those games where you put everything on the line.  We know it's going to be a tough game in a tough environment.  It's basically like a home game for Georgia.  We know that it's going to be that way, but we know that our fans are going to come support us and make it an even playing field, so we're looking forward to the opportunity.   
 Q.  Is it maybe a motivating factor, the fact that they may be will have more fans?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Based on our fans, I don't know if they will have more than us.  Even though it's a home game for them, I still think that our support system is going to show up in full force.  And we're lucky to play in front of such a loving environment and fans that support us no matter what.  So we feel like they will come out and they will motivate us and they will be in our corner and we're looking to get a win for not only ourselves but our fans that support us.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We won the game.  That's what we're happy about.  We had a lot of success on offense and regardless of how we do that or what it takes, whether it's running the ball a hundred times or throwing the ball a hundred times.  Whatever it's going to take for us to win the game and have the best fundamental execution on offense, that's what we're focused on doing.  We don't really care who gets the ball, who has what kind of success.  As long as an offense we're -- everybody's doing their part to make sure this offense is successful, to give our team the best chance to win the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Not really.  We respect those guys.  We know they have two great running backs.  Well, they have more than two, but we know that they have a great group of running backs over there and we respect those guys.  We have heard about them all week and we know that they're going to go out and they're going to play really well.  But our motivation comes from winning the game and playing for the opportunity to win another National Championship.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think it's just a testament to everything that Coach Saban talks about day-in and day-out.  The process is something that he preaches all the time and I think that that shows our job as players is trusting and believing in him and his process and doing everything that he's coached us to do and tells us to do.  It shows, the results show, it's our third National Championship appearance in three years.   
 Q.  What are some things that you do as a pregame ritual?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Just focus.  None of the outside things need to distract this team.  We're a hundred percent locked in on what we need to be focused on right now.  We know that we're blessed with the opportunity to even be here.  So we don't want to take this opportunity for granted, we want to be a hundred percent dialed in, locked in and focused, so that come Monday night we'll be able to come out and play our best football.   
 Q.  What's the one song that you have to play before a game to get hyped up?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: One song?  I listen to a lot of different songs.  If I had to choose one I would probably choose maybe March Madness by Future.   
 Q.  Someone else just said that too.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Who said that?   
 Q.  I forgot who.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Just some guy?  Okay.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I saw Reuben after the game last week and it was the first time I had seen him in a while, so it was good seeing him.  We always have a lot of guys that are off in the next level and playing for bigger and better things, playing for Super Bowls, making Pro Bowls, things like that, but they always end up back supporting us in games like these.  So I think that that's a testament to this program and everything, all the fundamentals that this program is built off of, having guys that they're worried about making the playoffs right now and things like that, but they're coming back to support us in games like this.  So I think that shows the whole family side of this whole process that Coach Saban talks about day-in and day-out.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
 (Laughter.)  Yeah, it definitely has.  Reuben did a lot for me before he left here.  Reuben's kind of -- he's become a big brother to me, so I'm very thankful and appreciative to have somebody like that in my life.   
 Q.  Could you see Saban as a Senator or Governor or President or something like that?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I've been asked more questions today about politics than the past couple months.  But I think he does -- I think his job is a football coach.  I think that's what he's supposed to be doing.   
 Q.  Can you describe the full emotion from last year to this year?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think one good thing about us is we have been here before and I think that that's kind of works to our advantage.  Coaches always talk about, you want to act like you've been here before, but we've been blessed with the opportunity to be here the past three years.  So you don't want to get caught up in emotions.  We know that this is the biggest stage that we can be on and it's the biggest game a lot of us have ever played in.  So there's no emotions, there's no pressure, there's no anxiety -- well, there's no anxiety yet, I'm sure there will be some anxiety in the locker room before the game, but right now we're just taking it all in and just focused on the game.   
 Q.  Do you have any message for the fans?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Message to the fans?  Just support us to the best that you can.  We know that this is like a home game for Georgia, but we know that our fans are going to come in full force and do nothing but support us.  So this game is not only for us, this game is for the people that come and support us week-in and week-out and that have been there for us all year.  So we're trying to make you guys proud.   
 Q.  What do you expect the pregame message to be from coach?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Same as always is.  This is game that we're going to go out and have to play a full four-quarter game and it's not going to come easy.  Nothing that you want comes easy and just things like that.  We know we're playing a tough opponent and we know that this is a game -- this is the toughest game that we played all year, so we need to go out and play with the best fundamental execution, the best focus, the best toughness, all those things that he preaches week-in and week-out and that's what's going to help us win this game.   
 Q.  Do you wear contacts in the game?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I do, I do.  Everybody thinks that these are just for show, but they're actually prescription.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I appreciate it.   
 Q.  Do you like to give your eyes a rest?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No, so I used to wear contacts all the time, but then I got -- my eyes started getting irritated, so I just switched up to glasses.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah.  When I was younger I actually used to wear goggles like Eric Dickerson.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: None of the running backs are banged up.  All of the running backs are fresh.  All of us are ready to play in a game like this.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, he's good.  He's good.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Right, yeah, yeah.  No, I think he'll be fine.  He's practicing, he's been doing really well.  So we're looking to get him back.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We set the tone for sure.  He set the tone.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, I think it's good to do that because it just shows that we're not going to come out and try to trick you.  Regardless of how good your defense is we're going to come at you and keep coming at you until you just either give up or we break through.  So, I think that we did that a lot at the beginning of the year and kind of got away from that a little bit toward the end, but I think that we're --   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: That's all it is.  Like I said, we're not out here to trick you, we're not trying to trick you, we're just going to come at you and going to run at you downhill, be physical and things like that.  So I think that that's something that we want to do in this game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: He's just like Reuben.  He plays just like Reuben foster.  Reuben might have been a little bit more athletic, but he plays like him.  He's good, he's really good side to side for his size and he runs with great speed.  He's -- I mean he creates all kind of trouble.  So I watched a lot of tape on him, just specifically him.  When I watched their defensive film, I look at him because running backs, linebackers --   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, we thought we would play in the SEC championship for sure.  So we watched a little -- I watched a little film on my own just on Georgia, because we knew that they would come out of the East, so I watched some of their games.   
 Q.  Was that one guy that you watched --  
DAMIEN HARRIS: You got to respect guys like that.  You have to respect guys like that.  He does a great job.  We know he's going to be a heck of a challenge for us on Monday, but we're looking forward to it, honestly.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't want to sit here and say that we rival these guys.  We know that they're a great running back group and we know that they have a lot of great players.  I've had people ask me if that motivates us as running backs to play better.  Our motivation comes from winning the National Championship.  We want to do whatever it takes to put our offense in the best position to be successful.  So we respect those guys, we respect their game, we respect what it takes to play this position at a high level.  So we're -- it's good to see guys like that having success, especially a guy like Nick Chubb, seeing what he went through in the past year and a half or so and seeing the way he's fought back through adversity and seeing the way he's persevered and he's playing at such a high level right now.  It's good to see guys like that.  Like I said, knowing what it takes to play this position at a high level.  So we respect those guys.  We know they're going to go out and they're going to play hard on Monday, but so are we.  So we're looking forward to the matchup.   
 Q.  When you see those two, what are some things about their game that y'all kind of respect?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Well, there's a lot of things.  We could break down film if you want to, but they both run, they both run angry.  They're both hard guys to bring down.  Chubb is more of a physical runner, runs through tackles, makes people -- doesn't necessarily have to make people miss, he just runs through arm tackles, he's hard to bring down, has a lower -- good lower explosion, things like that.   
Sony Michel, he's kind of like a speed back.  Once he's in the open field, it's hard to catch him, so he can make people miss, he can catch out of the back field.  They compliment each other really well and they play really well together.  We know that our defense has, they have a tough job on their hands, but we're confident that those guys are going to be able to go in there and kind of put a stop to everything that they have been doing.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We all kind of possess some of the same qualities.  I think a lot of those qualities are things that you have to have to be a running back and have success.  So I wouldn't say that we're like them or they're like us, but there's a lot of things that they can do that we can do and vice versa.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: That's a good question.  I would have to think about that.  I would just like to see the performance in general.  It doesn't really matter what song.  I've always been a Kendrick Lamar fan.  So just seeing him get to perform, this being the first halftime performance in the college football playoffs, I think that would be a pretty cool experience.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Top of the head?  m.A.Ad city.  That's old Kendrick.  That's like young, young Kendrick.   
 Q.  Do you think they will let y'all out a little early so you can catch some of it?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: He's right there if you want to ask him.   
(Laughter.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No, I don't have any thoughts on that at all.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't think there's that much pressure at all.  I think whenever you get in the process of Coach Saban he prepares you for situations like this and he prepares you to be faced with all kind of adversity and he kind of challenges you to grow up and mature and embrace the position that you're in.  So I think that he's tested us and challenged us to live up to any sort of expectation or any kind of pressure that we may be under and so we're in situations like this and we're comfortable in these kind of environments.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I mean the process that Coach Saban has established, I mean it kind of speaks for itself.  I don't think there's anything that I can say that can give any more credit than what it's worth.  But like I said, he's just challenged us as men to handle these situations and he says to act like you've been here.  We have been blessed with the opportunity to actually have been here for the past three years, so I think that gives us a little bit of an advantage.  But also everything that he's done to prepare us for this situation, I think is really going to especially us in this game.   
 Q.  What was the message in that process leading up to the Clemson game?  Was it any different?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think Coach Saban's message is always the same.  It's, you got to take what you want.  Nobody's going to give you anything and you have to earn everything that you want.  So this game is going to be no different.  We know we're playing a great Georgia team in the biggest game that we've played all year, and maybe in our careers.  And so we know we're going to be faced with a lot of adversity, but like Coach Saban said, we just have to take it.  It's not going to be about what they do, it's going to be about how we come out and play, the intensity, the toughness, the determination to not be denied what we want.  Those are all fundamental things that are going to help us win this game.   
 Q.  Since you've been here in the playoffs, you've got to play lots of different teams from different leagues.  What's it like to get to the final game of the season against another SEC team?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: We don't really -- we're not really focused on who we're playing.  We're thankful for the opportunity to play in another National Championship.  We wouldn't care if it was a team from the NFL, as long as we are here playing for another opportunity to win, to play for another National Championship, we're excited to be here.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Everybody was kind of -- I didn't know what was going on.  I was kind of sitting in the locker room and everybody was just getting ready for practice and all of a sudden Coach Saban -- or not Coach Saban, but Coach Cochran comes in with a runner-up trophy from last year.  And he's just holding it and everybody's just walking around.  And he didn't even say anything.  So we're all just kind of looking like, what's going on?  And he starts talking about we're not coming here for participation, this is the participation trophy, and that's not what we are here for and then he smashes it on the ground.  So I think that sent a message to our team.  And I hope people realize that we're not here to play for second place.  That's kind of how we finished up last year and that's not a feeling that we want anymore.  We're not here for participation, we're not just glad to be here under the lights and not worried about the results.  We came here to win and that's what we plan on doing, so that's just kind of the message of our team right now.   
 Q.  All teams have the goal at the beginning of the year to win the National Championship.  What is it about Alabama that gets them on that stage year after year?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think it's just the process.  And when you have a team that trusts and believes in our coach the way that we do in Coach Saban and have you a coach that's been and had so much success and done all the things and accomplished all the things that he has, I think that when you put those two things together it creates nothing but an opportunity for us to be back here year in and year out.  So I think that Coach Saban does a great job with us and as players we do a great job of trusting this him and believing in the process and doing everything that he tells us to do and we get to be back in these situations.   
 Q.  So you have an opportunity to do it three times.  Is that a big advantage for you?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think it's a huge advantage for us to have been here before.  A lot of times you have coaches say, act like you've been here, before but we don't have to pretend, we have been blessed with the opportunity to be here before.  We have had the opportunity to be here before, so I definitely think that gives us an advantage.   
 Q.  Is there a teacher that made an impact in your life?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Wow, I've had a lot of great teachers.  Let me think.  How long do have I to answer this question?  I'm trying to think from high school, because that was really a big time in my life.  Can you come back and ask me that question again?   
 Q.  You can speak in general how teachers and that profession is so important in shaping a student athlete's life?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think it's a huge -- I think teachers are a huge asset to us as children growing up and people of the future.  People, I feel like people get so caught up in the football side and the athletic side of what we do, but first of all, we came to college to get an education.  And I know that all of our parents would be pretty upset with us if we came to college and didn't get our degree.  So I think the teachers that helped us to get to this point and then, obviously, our college professors and things like that and all the people that try to educate us into being smarter individuals and better people in the long run.  I think that's obviously a huge advantage for us to have, and I think that we have a great education system, and I think that the people that are involved in it, I think that they deserve a lot more credit than what they get for sure.   
 Q.  Our tag line is it only takes one.  Do you believe that one teacher can shape a child's life?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think so.  I think that when you have -- you think of kids in certain situations, there's a lot of times when it it's just that one teacher, that one educator, that helped turn their life around and helped them get into a better situation or helped them as people.  So I definitely think that one person can make the biggest difference in the world.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It's a lot.  I actually -- I was here back in May, because I went to Migos and Future concert.  So Migos, Future, East Atlanta Santa, all those guys are definitely on my playlist for sure.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No, he's spring of 2015.  He was two years before me, so.  He was probably the reason why -- I've been thinking about it, it's like I want to seek Omega.  And at the time I was just -- I didn't know much about frat life at all.  And Reuben -- and I don't know if you know Jay Ree, they were both on the team at the time, so I kind of got with them.  And I was like well, tell me about your frat, because I was just thinking about Greek life in general.  And so they started talking to me about them and that.  And me and Reuben were real close at the time so he just kind of -- he didn't really push me in that direction, but he was like if you do decide to go Greek, definitely seek Omega.  Because he was talking about how it changed his life and how it made him a better person, a better football player, and just how it affected his life as time went on.   
 Q.  Where are you from?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Where am I from?  I'm from Kentucky.  So, yeah, he definitely did.  He definitely kind of helped me out and helped me get to where I am today, for sure.  He helped me see it through.  For sure.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, I mean, we're matching.   
 Q.  Do you get tired?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Do I get tired of the media?   
 Q.  Yeah, the whole thing.  
DAMIEN HARRIS: You know, it is a lot, but I think that this is an opportunity for us to show ourselves without a football in our hands.  I think it's a great opportunity for football players and athletes in general to show their human side.  Now people know what I'm like without a football in my hand, without being on the football field.  So I think it's a good way to express yourself.  You can look at it from a business standpoint, it's a good job -- or it's a good opportunity for you to invest in your future.  If this is something that you want to do, say you want to work for ESPN one day or SEC Network and have those future opportunities, I think this is a good head start on that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I mean, I don't know.  I wouldn't mind working for ESPN one day.  Maybe talking on SEC Network talking about football.  The game of football has had such an impact on my life, so why stop whenever I'm done playing.  Why not continue on to do things in the football world, talk about football, break down football, be an analyst, commentator, things like that.  So get to work events like these.  So, I think that would be a good opportunity.   
 Q.  What's your major?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Communications.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think that just shows the mindset of this team.  We're not here for participation, we're not just here to play in the game, we're not just glad to be here.  Although we're thankful for the opportunity, but we came here to win and that's what we plan on doing.  That just shows the mindset of this team right now.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It did.  We don't like being runners up.  So I think it was a good message from him to us and I think it's kind of embedded in our minds right now and just that moment I think it's something that we'll take into this game and remember why we came here, we came here to win, not for another participation trophy.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No.  Not at all.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No, we feel like if we play our best football we play with our best fundamental execution we think that we're the best team in the country.  That's what we came here to do.  So we don't think we're the underdog, we don't think we're out matched, we feel like we're just where we need to be and we feel like we're in the best position to win this game.   
 Q.  What stands out about their defense?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: A lot of things.  They got a great front seven, they do a lot of different things that can pose challenges for an offense and we know this is going to be a tough game, we played against great defenses all year and we don't expect this to be any different.  We know what it's like to be in games like this and we're just really looking forward to the opportunity.   
 Q.  Do they remind you of any team you faced?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Everybody's different.  We played a lot of tough defenses but everybody proposes different challenges.  So we expect this to be a tough game and we're looking forward to being able to go out there and play against a great team.   
 Q.  Do you think the experience of being in this game three times before will make a difference?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I think so.  I think one thing about this game, when you look at it, we have been on both sides, 2015 we were able to come out and one the National Championship.  Last year we finished in second place.  So I think being on both of those sides kind of shows this is what we want and this is what we don't want.  So I think we'll take that with us into this game and I think we're focused, I think we have had a good time in practice since the Clemson game and we're ready to play in this game.   
 Q.  Is it weird to face a coach that was in your huddle basically is now lined up against you?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Not really, because he knows what we do but I think Coach Saban knows a little bit better what he's going to do, considering he learned it all from Coach Saban.  We're happy for Coach Smart and when he left we were glad that he had the opportunity to go on and do something better for himself and do something that he thought was best for himself and his family, so he's done a great job over there and he's had a lot of success, so we're really happy for him and it will be good to see him and just play against him and things like that, but at the end of the day we came here to win this game, so maybe we'll be cool after the game.   
 Q.  What is the biggest key to winning this game?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Fundamental execution.  That's the name of the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, well, there's no sense of appreciation or gratitude yet.  We haven't finished the season yet.  So we have one more game, if we come out and win the National Championship, then we can reflect on and be happy about all the things that we have accomplished the.  But as of right now we still haven't accomplished the main goal, therefore we're not really focused on our accomplishments up to this point.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Well, I think that that relief, I don't think we have that feeling of relief when we play really well, when we come out and win a game because that's what we expect ourselves to do, we expect ourselves to come out and play our best football every single game and so to get to this point and -- I see what you're asking me, I get what you're asking me, but like I said, we're not relieved yet, we're not, we don't have any sense of satisfaction until after this next game, provided it's the outcome that we want.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
 (Laughter.)  Oh, current ex-girlfriend that I'm trying to make my girlfriend again, so.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Yeah, please, tell her I want her back.   
 Q.  When the is last time you ate a Honey Bun?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: When is the last time I ate a Honey Bun?  Maybe last June, before the season.  I'm not lying.  So after the Auburn game I came so close, I almost gave in, I did.  Because I was kind of like, man, we just lost, we have all this time before we potentially play another game again, I can work it off if I eat one.  But I actually called my mom, I was in a gas station and I saw a Honey Bun, I called my mom, I said mom, I want this Honey Bun so bad, should I do it.  And she was like, if you do it then you would have wasted all this time, all this willpower and all the things that, all the things that you gave up in order to have the success that you had.  So I listened to mom, mom knows best.  So any time your mom tells you to do something, always do it.   
 Q.  How would you describe SEC football?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: First of all, the only two teams playing this season, the only game that's left, two SEC teams are playing, so obviously all the talk about the SEC is this, the SEC isn't as good, I kind of think that that's proof that that's not true.  But it's going to be a tough, physical game for four quarters and we know that going into this game that we're playing a tough opponent we're playing a team that's greats on offense, great on defense, have great specialists on special teams, so it's going to be a tough, physical game and we have those things as well, so it's going to be a great matchup and I am looking forward to great game.   
 Q.  Is it a source of pride for you guys that the team on the other side is from your league?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Not necessarily.  We weren't really concerned with who we played or who else made it to the National Championship, we were just focused on getting here ourselves and we knew whoever we played it would be a tough game and like I said, we're looking forward to the opportunity.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: See, now you put me in an even worse position, because he's right beside me.  So if I do it and he overhears it, then I'm going to get chewed out for it.  So I think that, go ask Rashaan Evans.  And tell him that I told you to ask him, because he gives a much better impression than I do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Can I guess it?  No, no, no, go ahead and ask me.   
 Q.  What's your go to Chick-fil-A order?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: My go to Chick-fil-A order?  Do you want me to tell what you it is?  It's a number eight, no tomato.   
 Q.  Combo?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: Combo.  With water, Polynesian sauce, Chick-fil-A sauce, large fry.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't eat Popeyes as much -- I really don't eat either, but if I had to choose I would probably say Popeyes.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I don't know.  I don't go enough to know what my order would be, but I would just prefer, if somebody said you only get Popeyes or Zaxby's, I would pick Popeyes.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: No, no.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: To be honest with you, Coach Saban hasn't really had to talk about it that much because the way the season ended last year was so much fuel and so much motivation coming into this year.  Obviously it's been a new season, but I would say in the off-season that was kind of our motivation.  We didn't finish the way that we wanted to so the whole off season program, whether it was in winter conditioning, fall camp, summer program, all we wanted to do was finish, finish every play, every rep, every snap.  So I think that that's been our motivation going into this year and now we have the same motto, we made it through a lot of adversity and a lot of hardship and a lot of obstacles, so we're in the National Championship game playing for the opportunity to have another National Championship title and all we want to do is finish.   
 Q.  Who is the most unheralded guy on your team?  
DAMIEN HARRIS: I would never do that.  I think at this moment right now I would actually say Shaun Dion Hamilton.  The fact that he's not able to play, obviously because of injury, the leadership that he's shown to this team throughout all of that over the past years, even when he got hurt last year and even more so this year his college career ended up short just because of an injury but its way that he still tried to motivate this team and the way that he still tried to motivate us to play our best football and show us what it takes to be a true champion and a true, somebody that follows the process of Coach Saban, I think that that's his, his character is unmatched and I think that he's done a great job and he's one of the true leaders of this team.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
DAMIEN HARRIS: It's a huge blow whenever you lose one of your starters, but it's just kind of that next man up mentality.  We have had to deal with that all year and we have had a lot of injuries, a lot of adversity, so I think that it's good for us to have that mentality, guys are going to have to step up, so that's kind of how it's been all year.
