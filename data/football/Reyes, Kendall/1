		   KENDALL REYES: Everything has been really good so far. We're all excited and hopefully win will game.

 Q. What kind of challenges does Oklahoma pose for you guys? 
 KENDALL REYES: They throw out punches and bunches. They are very up tempo. They throw a lot of looks at you. They get rid of the ball fast. And you always got to be on your toes against this team. 
 We will just be physical with them and try to slow down their pace of the game.

 Q. Are they similar to any team you played during the season? 
 KENDALL REYES: They are definitely different. There are similarities in different ways. They are definitely a different team than the teams we have faced this year.

 Q. What are your feelings of being here and your team's opportunity to show yourselves? 
 KENDALL REYES: We are definitely excited. We are pumped. We have been practicing for this game forever, and we feel like we are ready. We just want to go out and play Saturday.

 Q. When was it that you guys had the light click on and something changed? 
 KENDALL REYES: Just our attitude changed. We kind of got sick of where we were. We knew we had a talented team. We weren't playing up to our potential. Enough was enough. 
 And just then our team's mentality changed to finish out the season strong.

 Q. Oklahoma is saying they had the best year in the last three, four years. How do you see this as an opportunity? 
 KENDALL REYES: Those are the past teams. This is a new season. So, I mean, they're definitely pumped to play this game as much as we are. That has no effect on me.
