 Q.   Talk about your uniforms?   
AARON HENRY:   I truly love them.   I think at the University of Wisconsin, we're very traditional, and this is something subtle, but very noticeable when you actually get up on it.   I really like the new uniforms, and I'm hopeful we can go out there and play well in them.  
   
 Q.   Have you seen the Oregon uniforms?   
AARON HENRY:   I have seen them on the internet and whatnot, and people have been sending me links to them.   But I'm sure they're probably going to look better in person.  
   
 Q.   Are you curious to see whether those helmets are reflective?   
AARON HENRY:   I didn't even‑‑  
   
 Q.   And therefore distracting or disorienting?   
AARON HENRY:   I didn't even take account into that.   At the end of the day, if they are, you've got to still go out there and deal with it.   I don't think they're going to be a challenge to us at all.  
   
 Q.   You don't think so?   
AARON HENRY:   No, not that I can think of at least.   But I mean, I think we played against teams with pretty shiny helmets, and I don't think it's going to be a problem.  
   
 Q.   What is the Rose Bowl experience like going through this a second time for a second straight year?   Is it any different from what you noticed a year ago?   
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir.   I think for media day, I didn't have a booth, so that is one of the major differences.   But it's a really good time out here.   We've been having a fantastic time.   
It's a little different from last year just for the simple fact that when we got out here last year, I know for me I was so like in awe.   First time being in L.A., being among the stars and just kind of flabbergasted about my surroundings.   
We were living in Beverly Hills, you know.   Often times you see Beverly Hills on television, and you think the world of that place, but I think now it's like okay, been here, done that.   It's kind of like a business vibe.   
I'm dealing with a lot of people, but I'm not overly excited about it.   I'm kind of keeping it mellow and just chill, and I'm kind of taking everything as I approach it.  
   
 Q.   Did you go to the Laker game last night?   
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir, I did go to the Laker game.  
   
 Q.   What was the favorite thing so far and why?   
AARON HENRY:   Man, I want to say my favorite thing so far was practice.   You guys are probably wondering why.   Well, we had a special guest in Erin Andrews, she showed up there yesterday.   So I think whenever you can have Erin Andrews show up at your practice, that's always a plus.   I'm sure most of you reporter guys, whenever you see her, you're really excited.   But me and some of the guys are definitely a fan of hers.  
   
 Q.   So you're putting Erin Andrews ahead of the Laker girls?   
AARON HENRY:   Oh, yeah.   I was a little closer to Erin Andrews than the Laker girls, so the view was much better.  
   
 Q.   Everybody has a different theory as to what the key of the game is going to be.   In your mindset, what do you think will be the key to success?   
AARON HENRY:   Well, Oregon has the ability to change the tempo whenever they like.   So I think the big key for us defensively is making sure we get lined up and get the calls.   That's going to be most important.   Yes, we're going to have to tackle on the field.   Yes, we're going to have to play solid football and make turnovers, but we have to start by doing that by getting lined up.   
A lot of teams when you watch the film, a lot of teams are running around this way and that way, and they aren't really set before the ball is snapped on a lot of times when Oregon scores touchdowns.   So for us, if we can force them to drive the ball down the field and get lined up and just play football, I think we'll be in a great position.  
   
 Q.   If you're going on the reality show, say the Amazing Race, which one teammate do you want with you and why?   Who is your partner?  
AARON HENRY:   Oh, my gosh.   This is probably going to be crazy, but I would probably have to say Andrew Lukasko.   The reason I would choose Andrew Lukasko, there is something about that dude.   He's got a desire.   He's one of those guys first of all, he's going to keep me alive.   Second of all, he's going to be able to do things that normal people probably can't do.   His will and desire to win is crazy.   
So I would definitely have to go with Andrew Lukasko he's also a fellow DB of mine, so...  
   
 Q.   How about De'Anthony Thomas?   Can you talk about him?   
AARON HENRY:   The guy's ability to make plays and make people miss, I mean, they do a great job of getting him the ball in open field.   A lot of their quick throws are like extended run plays for that guy.   I mean, the guy has an ability to be a flat‑out football player.   
Any time you have the key like that, you don't really draw up a play for them, you just kind of give them the ball.   I think Oregon does a good job of getting them the ball.   For us to go out there, it's going to be key for us to go out there and make sure we go out there and tackle.   When I say tackle, I don't mean one guy making the tackle, I mean a number of guys just flying to the football.  
   
 Q.   Any instance last night at Lawry s?   
AARON HENRY:   No, sir.   We didn't have nobody choking, thank God.   I think Travis Frederick did put down eight prime ribs, which is ridiculous.   I mean, he ate a lot of food.   I was only able to put down one, and I was struggling with that one.   But we didn't have nothing crazy like they did the night before.  
   
 Q.   You talked about Erin Andrews.   Is that your best memory of this week?   
AARON HENRY:   I don't know.   There have been some pretty good ones.   Of course the Beef Bowl was great.   Going to Disneyland and being around Coach Chip Kelly and some of the Oregon guys was great.   
I don't know.   There is something about Erin Andrews.   This is my third time seeing her this year, and it never gets old.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of Chip?   
AARON HENRY:   I thought Chip was a great guy.   He was laid back.   He was cool.   He definitely seems like a player's coach.  
   
 Q.   What about your new jerseys?   
AARON HENRY:   I love them man.   It's something traditional and very, very subtle.   Wisconsin is going to be Wisconsin.   Everybody loves to change their jerseys and come up with new styles.   But Wisconsin will stay true to ourselves and stay who we are.   
It's a very, very subtle change, but I think it's definitely keeping up with the latest fashion.  
   
 Q.   During the season, you had the special gloves(Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   Yeah, the guys were going crazy.   I guess we got gloves for the first time that had a W on the palm.   And it was flat out ridiculous.   It was like we were having a party in the locker room.   
But guys love these jerseys and we're so excited to be here and be presented with the opportunity to play in the Rose Bowl.  
   
 Q.   Have you seen Oregon's helmets?   
AARON HENRY:   No, I haven't.   I haven't seen them, but supposedly they're reflective and they could potentially be a problem with shining in your face or something like that.   But I think for us that's going to give us‑‑ it's going to make them more of a target.   It's definitely going to give us a better chance to see them.  
   
 Q.   Did you go to the Lakers game last night?   
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir, I did.   The Lakers game was great.   I had a pretty good camera, so I was able to get Kobe Bryant, and Carmelo Anthony, and a couple of nice shot that's I had.   It was sweet to be able to go to a game.   I mean, Kobe did damage, man.   He's going out as one of the best.   He played a really good game.   Carmelo's shot is ridiculous.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember last year (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir.   Most definitely.   Like I was saying here earlier.   Coming in here last year, a lot of guys were bright‑eyed and didn't know what they were getting into.   A lot of guys were just excited about the fact that we were here.   But this year guys are more focused on at the end of the day it's going to boil down to winning.   
The Beef Bowl was great, going out, seeing Erin Andrews at practice was great.   Going to a Knicks game was great.   Going to Disneyland was great.   But I think it's going to be meaningless if we don't go out there and win.   
So I think the focus this year is let's go out and focus on football, and I think that's what guys have come to do.  
   
 Q.   What kind of challenge will Oregon be?   
AARON HENRY:   I think it's pretty clear cut.   Oregon has the ability to change tempo from slow to‑‑ or from fast to really, really fast, something we haven't faced throughout the season.   But that's probably one of the major challenges just for the simple fact that was something we really haven't gone against.   
But I think for us, in order for us to go out there and be successful, it's going to boil down to us going out there and getting lined up and ready to play football.   I think it's clear and evident we often go out there and just play and have a good time and create turnovers.   But it's really going to boil down to once Oregon get that calls and starts flowing within the game and changing the tempo, we have to be able to adjust to it, and really move on the fly.  
   
 Q.   Last year in the TCU game (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   It's clear they're two different teams just for the fact that Oregon has the ability to change their tempo.   With TCU they stay true to just what they do.   They kind of move down the field slowly but surely, And Oregon is one of those teams that's trying to score extremely fast.   They're trying to generate points off our mistakes.   
So I definitely think from last year what I learned is a turnover can change the game.   I don't know if you guys remember, but it's something that definitely stuck out in my head.   I had a dropped interception last year in the Rose Bowl game.   So I was extremely upset about that just for the simple fact that when you're in a game of this caliber and you're a proclaimed play maker, you have to go out there and make those plays.   
So if I'm presented with an opportunity to go out there and have one of those game‑changing moments whether it's to make an interception or recover for my team, I have to do it in a game of this magnitude.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   Oh, my goodness.   Any time you have a guy with the ability to throw extremely well and to run really well, he presents a number of problems.   
But he does a really, really good job of running that offense well too.   He does a really good job of getting those wide receivers the ball or handing the ball off to the running backs whenever they do their zone read play.   He's a great, great fit for the offense that they run.   But I think for us going into these last few weeks of game prep and even throughout the season, I think Russell Wilson has really prepared us for whenever we do face a dual‑threat quarterback like this.   
It's very, very hard to simulate a guy like that if you don't have him.   And being that we have Russell, he's given us a great look.   And seven on seven, this guy's scrambling, and having us cover wide receivers longer than we usually would in a regular game.   So I think it's been good work for us.  
   
 Q.   Have you talked about the offense and the way you'll approach it?   
AARON HENRY:   It can be kind of irritating, you know.   But I think you've got to take it for what it's worth.   At the end of the day, people like to see points and high scoring games.   Nobody really‑‑ well, nobody on our side looking in gives the defense any credit.   But I think at the end of the day when our offense goes out there and puts up 40, 50, 60 points and the defense only gives up 15, I think it's, of course, it's a little bit of both sides.   
But it is what it is, you know.   We have some guys on our offense that have been doing some tremendous things for us.   I'm fine being a defensive guy myself, I'm fine with the offense getting all the love, man.   I don't mind at all.   But at the end of the day, I just want us to go out there and win.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   Yes, ma'am, most definitely.   I think one of the key things in a game like this, being that if we were to face them in a week, not only their tempo, but the dynamic of their offense.   They run so many different formations, so many different sets and plays.   
I think Coach Chip Kelly does a great job of creating these old‑school formations and running plays out of them.   I think if we only had a week for it, I think we would have prepared for it, but I don't know if we would have been as prepared as we were having at least a month to prepare for them.   
On top of that, being in great shape, being in really, really good football shape and going out there.   Whenever they do change their tempo, being able to run with them.   I can only imagine having to prepare for a team like this in a week, but that's what our defensive coordinators get paid for.   To work on the fly, and when an opportunity is presented like this, they really have the ability to shake things up and move with the flow.  
   
 Q.   Your journey to this game has been long, and now is it bittersweet that it is here?   
AARON HENRY:   Yeah, it is bittersweet.   Knowing this is my last college football game, I'm still taking it all in.   It really hasn't sunk in.   One of the players asked me did I realize the last practice we had at Camp Randall was my last one, and I didn't.   I'm kind of really in the moment.   I'm enjoying it, but I'm not really stuck on it.   
My biggest thing is going out and winning this game.   Being that it is my last one, I just want to go out on the right note.   I think being when I was younger in the program, we always talked about sending the seniors out the right way.   In order for me to go out the right way, I've got to go out there and play some of the best ball that I've ever played, and do the things that I've been doing.   
   
 Q.   Do you guys feel like you were locked in?   
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir, most definitely.   Me personally, I don't think the game could be any closer.   A lot of us are really excited.   It has been extremely long prep.   But I think it's been beneficial for us.   Some things that we probably wouldn't have seen in a week when we had two, three, four weeks to prepare for, we're finally able to see it.   It's finally coming up.   
It's been a really good time thus far.   We had a chance to get a lot of good film work in.   I think most of the players are ready and excited to go out there and play.  
   
 Q.   Talk about last year and how has it changed this year?   
AARON HENRY:   I just think it's changed the mentality.   Last year we were really focused on‑‑ I think a lot of people were surprised that we were even out here.   A lot of people were excited that we were out here.   I don't want to say surprised, but excited that we were out here in L.A., having a good time.   But this year there are more a lot of people talking about a business trip.   
We know we have a job at hand.   We know we have a job to get done, and outside of everything that's going on, we've been taken care of.   Police escorts, Erin Andrews, Knicks‑Lakers basketball games, Disneyland, the Lawry s, Beef Bowl, it's been amazing.   
But I think once I leave here, my fondest memory, if everything goes as planned, is playing in the Rose Bowl and getting that win.   So that's really what it's going to boil down to.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   I do remember it like it was yesterday.   My cousin was telling me any time he Googled my name and went to the images section, they had my picture of me walking off the field with my head down and Coach B. from the Rose Bowl.   
So it's very devastating.   It's very upsetting.   You put in so much work and you get right there.   You get within arm's reach of it, and you miss it.   So it was very, very devastating.   But I know this year I don't want to walk off the field with that feeling.   I've always asked myself throughout this past year, what could I have done better?   How could I have helped us win that game?   So I know I've got to leave it all on the field this year to ensure that I don't have those feelings when I walk off.  
   
 Q.   Talk about putting the ball down?   
AARON HENRY:   Put the ball down.   That's something that Coach Dave Huxtable came up with when we first came here.   We were looking for an identity for the defense.   Coach Hux talked about put the ball down.   And the motto was anytime, anyplace, anywhere.   We don't care who you are, we don't care what rank you are, we don't care what people are saying about you.   Just put the ball down and let us play.  
   
 Q.   How has that affected you?   
AARON HENRY:   It's huge.   It's huge, on the outside looking in, according to the media, the game's already won.   So for us we really could care a less.   We just want to go out there and play football.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   No, I don't think so.   Not for us at least.   At the end of the day, the game is still played on the football field and played in between those lines.   Yeah, they do have fast guys, but those guys are human just like we are.   So we can just go out there and do what we've been doing, I think we'll be successful.  
   
 Q.   When does the fun stop and the business begin?   
AARON HENRY:   I think you have to be able to balance between the two of them.   It's kind of pretty much fun throughout the whole process.   This whole experience is fun.   Being able to go to practice, believe it or not, being able to go to Disneyland, being able to go to the Beef Bowl, and the Knicks games and being around your teammates the last time watching film, I think it's definitely a combination of both fun and seriousness.   Because at the end of the day, it's just going to boil down to us winning this game.   
But in a bowl game setting, it's very, very hard to just say, okay, I'm only going to be serious when you're in the atmosphere of being around a bunch of kids signing autographs.   
So I think you have to be able to balance the two and just take it for what it's worth.   When you go out there to practice and go out there to work, you work.   When you get out on the football field and get out there for the game, you go out there and play your all.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the game, what are your expectations for this year in the game?   Talk about the intensity and the focus?   
AARON HENRY:   I think for me personally going into this game compared to last year, I think we always have the mentality of going out there and winning.   But I think we approached it differently than how we approached it last year, so the preparation has been completely different.   
So, yes, we've been watching film, but I think the mindset of the players has been extremely different.   All the guys came out here with a business like mindset.   Last year we were so close, but we let one get away.   So this year, to ensure or try to ensure that doesn't happen again, guys are watching that extra film.   Guys are not really staying out.   They're making sure to get extra rest.   You know what I'm saying?   They're making sure they get the cold tubs after practice, so the small details we didn't pay attention to last year are definitely full circle and in full effect now.   
It's just an honor and a privilege to be back here for the second year in a row.   And more importantly, man, I'm just trying to go out on a right note.  
   
 Q.   How focused are you personally?   What have you done and what changes have you made?   Have you how have you elevated your game mentally?   
AARON HENRY:   Of course, mentally I think I've definitely in the past year being that we did lose that last year's Rose Bowl game, I always ask myself what could I have done better?   So I made sure I became a student of the game.   I've been watching film like never before, trying to get a tip on these guys.   Every little thing I'm asking my DB coach on.   Does he have any tips for me or any clues about what these guys like to run out of certain sets or so.   
So I've definitely took notice of the big picture realizing that this is my last game I'm going to be playing in collegiately.   I'm trying to take it for what it's worth and enjoying the process while I'm doing it.   
But the biggest thing for me is staying in that film room and making sure I'm taking advantage of that.  
   
 Q.   What has your inspiration been in life, and who is your inspiration in life?   
AARON HENRY:   One of my biggest inspirations in life, of course outside of my faith, I'm a very, very solid believer in Jesus Christ.   I play for the audience of one, you know.   
But prior to even knowing Jesus Christ, the woman who introduced me to him was my grandmother.   So my grandmother's going to be at home watching this game, and that lady has definitely made me believe and pushed me to the limit.   
So whenever I go out there and play, it's solely for Christ.   But I know that she's watching, you know what I'm saying?   So that's my inspiration.  
   
 Q.   How has your offense changed your defense?   Does it change your role at all?   
AARON HENRY:   I think at the end of the day it does kind of change the role a little bit.   But at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to making sure we get lined up and making sure we tackle.   If we can get lined up, get the calls and tackle, on top of that generate turnovers, I think we're going to be in a great position.   
What they do is something that we really haven't seen this past year.   The only team I can compare them to is Michigan, just because they have Denard Robinson, and some of the things they do are very similar.   But they have a very dynamic offense.   They do some things that a lot of teams don't see on a week‑in, and week‑out basis.   
But I think it will be a great challenge for us and we're looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   Their goal is to pressure the defense.   How do you balance that?   
AARON HENRY:   Well, they say pressure busts pipes, but pressure also makes diamonds.   So I think for us Oregon does a great job at‑‑ they're trying to speed up their tempo to make you make a mistake.   If you can make a mistake, they can score touchdowns.   
So to make sure we don't make any mistakes, we've got to make sure we're all on the same page, and we communicate.   Most importantly, we've got to make sure we lineup.   Because I've seen on film a number of times, guys running across the field and not knowing where they're supposed to be or getting to a spot late.   That tempo, once they get it going, they're really, really good at it.  
   
 Q.   They want to get in space and how do you practice that?   (Inaudible)?  
AARON HENRY:   Yes, sir.   We have been doing a lot of conditioning to ensure that we all run to the ball.   The biggest thing in a game like this is having pursuit.   I'm sure tackles are going to be missed.   It's football.   But if we can have everybody running to their leverage as hard as they can whenever a ball is thrown, we can ensure that if he makes one of those guys miss or one guy makes somebody miss, somebody else is there to clean him up.   We can't have one guy running to the ball and everybody else kind of lolly‑gagging or whatnot.   
It has to be a complete team effort, like this defense has to play.   In order for us to be successful, we have to play as a unit and we have to run to the ball.   It's not going to be just one guy.  
   
 Q.   Sheldon was telling me about the supersonic drills?  
AARON HENRY:   Oh, yeah.  
   
 Q.   How hard is that?   What happens the first time you lineup against that?   
AARON HENRY:   Oh, man, I was kind of shocked by it.   It was almost unrealistic.   Any time you have an offense‑‑ well, you have two offenses and we're down the field covering the play, and the other offense is already lined up, ready to run another play.   It was extremely difficult.   I'm not even going to sit here and front to you.   
But I think our coaches are preparing us for the worst.   Preparing us for the toughest situation that's going to be presented to us, so that when it is presented to us, we're not in panic mode.   You know what I'm saying?   
I think they're preparing us for practice to be way harder than the game as far as from a tempo standpoint.   Any time you can simulate a game in any sense, it's going to be beneficial to us.  
   
 Q.   How does it change communication, whether it's from the sideline to the huddle or within the huddle?   
AARON HENRY:   It has to be that much faster.   The coach have to get it out faster.   The players have to make sure we're all looking to the sideline and we're all on the same page.   So that's one of the biggest things.
