 COACH PELINI: Congratulations to Oklahoma, to their program, their football team. It was a hard-fought game. They earned it. We had our opportunities, and we didn't get it done. We came close. Our kids played hard. I'm proud of our football team and the effort they gave. I'll open it up for any questions.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Pelini.   
  
  Q. Bo, did you make the right call at quarterback starting Taylor?   
 COACH PELINI: Yes.   
  
  Q. Why did you go with Taylor?   
 COACH PELINI: Because he's our starting quarterback, and he was healthy.   
  
  Q. The second to last possession, you're at the 39, 3rd and 8. What did you feel you needed to get to get in range there?  
 COACH PELINI: We thought we were in range, that is the shame of it. But can't take a sack in that situation.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about Taylor's performance and his effort tonight?   
 COACH PELINI: Gave great effort. There are some things he could have done better, obviously. But it extends well beyond the quarterback position. You know, he thought he did some going things. He did some things that, obviously, we'd like to have back.  
  
  Q. Looked like you had fake punt that you were going to call there before Oklahoma called timeout. Could you talk about what the call was and what you were thinking in that situation?   
 COACH PELINI: No, I'm not talking about that. Next question.   
  
  Q. You feel like you guys let one slip away building that 17-point lead and then, obviously just held to three points the last two and a half quarters?   
 COACH PELINI: Yes. Like I said, I thought we had our opportunities. We didn't get it done, and fell short.   
 THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
  Q. Talk about Rex's play again, he seemed to make some great runs there especially out of the Wildcat in the second half?  
 COACH PELINI: Yeah, I thought Rex played well. He did some good things. Obviously, the fumble hurt us. We just did too many things out there to overcome it and beat a good football team. We put the football on the ground too many times. We lost the turnover battle, and took some sacks in some big situations.   
 We left some points out on the board. We just didn't make enough plays. We didn't do what was necessary to win the game.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about the level of disappointment with this, the goal?   
 COACH PELINI: It's pretty obvious what the level of disappointment is. We came in here to win the Big 12 Championship. We didn't get it done. The kids are hurting, and it's a pretty obvious question, isn't it?   
  
  Q. Could you talk about Taylor's efforts throughout the game tonight?   
 REX BURKHEAD: I thought he led the huddle really well. He got us in and out. He's a tough kid. He was competing out there. He got us ready to go, and, I mean, we just didn't finish. But I thought he played well.   
  
  Q. The quarterback thing was a big topic all week. Can you shed some light on what your thought process was and when you came to a decision?   
 COACH PELINI: I knew who was going to play on Monday. I just didn't feel it was the right thing to share. He had a good week of practice. He practiced all week, and I didn't feel that people were entitled to know that he was going to start.   
 Our football team knew he was going to start. I was pretty -- I was about 90% sure that he was going to go, but you never know when somebody has been hurt. You don't know what's going to happen throughout a week of practice.   
  
  Q. You said he was healthy? Did you feel like he was --  
 COACH PELINI: He ran around fine. There was no question on his health.  
  
  Q. Roy, can you talk about your long touchdown run, how that play developed and what happened?   
 ROY HELU JR.: It was just really good blocking. And I think Brandon or one of the receivers made a really good block down field, and I didn't do too much.   
  
  Q. Can you just talk about the way Landry Jones threw the football? Looked like he made some pretty big time throws out there tonight to get the ball around the yard?   
 COACH PELINI: Yeah, I thought Landry made some good throws. He's a good football player. He has some good weapons around him, and he's going to make plays. You're not going to sit there and hold the football team with those weapons to zero points. But our defense I thought played well.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about your defense a little bit and how they played tonight? It seemed that they kept you hanging in there as much as they could.   
 COACH PELINI: I think I just addressed that, but I thought our defense played very well. And I thought they did a lot of good things out there. It's a good football team. Good offensive football team we played tonight.   
  
  Q. When you guys took the sack and then OU was called for an offside penalty, and you had the ball at the 45, did kicking a field goal there cross your mind from 62 yards?   
 COACH PELINI: Yeah, I mean, you look back I wish we would have. But we got the ball back, so, you know. If you kick it there and they have that kind of field position, the game's over. I thought we could stop them. We did. We got the football back. Had an opportunity and didn't make the most of it.   
  
  Q. Jared, can you talk about Oklahoma's offensive tempo and what kind of problems, if any, they gave you?   
 JARED CRICK: We knew coming in they'd run a fast tempo offense. We had practiced for it; we were ready for it. I didn't think they caught us off guard at all. Just for the preparation that we had against it. And we saw it against Oklahoma State, and again last year when we played Oklahoma. So we were ready for it.   
 I don't really think their fast tempo of offense really hurt us by any means.
