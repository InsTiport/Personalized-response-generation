  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   How much of an edge did it give you?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I still have that edge.   Nothing has changed.   I'm still going to do the same things.   Nothing has changed.   Couldn't have done anything I've done this season without my teammates.   That comes down to playing solid team defense. 

Q.   Does that come to you every day, causing a fumble with Mariota, that nobody expected you to be here?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   It definitely does.   Coming into the season, I think they expected us to finish like 10th in the PAC‑12, something like that.   You never forget that as a team. 

Q.   Did you have those magazines inside the locker room?   Anybody come down here and seen the team play?   You're in the Fiesta Bowl. 
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I know.   I mean, coming into fall camp, even spring ball, we said we were going to surprise a lot of people this year.   That's what we're doing. 

Q.   Coach Rodriguez is known for his offense.   How much pride does he take?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   He takes a lot of pride, special teams, offense, defense.   He's a great coach. 

Q.   The team is pretty young.   You're in the Fiesta Bowl.   How excited are you about the future at Arizona?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I think it will be great.   For me personally, I still have a lot of things I need to get better at as an individual. 
I think as a team we're going to be really good.   Have to continue to work hard and not get complacent. 

Q.   How exciting is it to be in the Fiesta Bowl, being in Arizona?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Definitely, it's really cool.   Arizona hasn't played in a Big Ten bowl game since 1994.   I think we're trying to put Arizona back on the map. 

Q.   What do you think of all this attention you've been getting?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I can't do anything but help my teammates.   That's how I'll answer my question for you. 

Q.   What would a win in this game do for this program? 
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Yeah, I think it will be great for the Arizona football program.   Haven't been a big‑time football game for a long time. 

Q.   You know what's at stake, it's just time to play? 
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I think we're all eager to play.   We haven't played a football game in nearly a month.   We're ready to get out there and play ball. 

Q.   Does it feel like a mini training camp, like the season is starting over?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   We call it bowl game camp.   Yeah, I mean, I definitely think we're all eager to get out there. 

Q.   When Coach Rodriguez was recruiting you, they were the only ones offering you a scholarship?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   They were the only ones.

Q.   Was it as simple as saying, I'm going to Arizona?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   The cool thing about Arizona, there was never any gray.   One day they called me up out of the blue and said, Hey, we want to offer you.   Never had any letters or emails.   They saw my film, liked it, offered me. 

Q.   Do you use it as motivation?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Yeah.   Recruiting, everybody thought I wasn't good enough, fast enough. 

Q.   Now you're winning all these awards.   Is it like you proved everybody wrong?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Sure it is.   End of the day, I'm not going to change.   I'm not going to get complacent.
