  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You're getting double and triple teamed, how are you able to put up those numbers?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   That goes back to team defense.   As long as I'm doing my job and the guy next to me is doing his, we'll be all right. 

Q.   Tevis had a brother at Boise State. 
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Jared is a great dude.   He plays hard, hardâ€‘nosed.   Just a good football player. 

Q.   For you as a defense, phenomenal season.   The last time you were on the field, things didn't go your way. 
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   For me personally, I still have a really salty taste about that game.   I just want to go out there and play ball again. 

Q.   Are you thinking about the stage you're playing on?   Only game on New Year's Eve, does it mean anything to you at all?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Just another game.   Going back to playing football when you were seven years old.   Remember why you play the game. 

Q.   Where does your drive come from?   You make a mistake, play your way back in.   Where does the drive come from?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I mean, I've had that since I was a little kid.   I mean, just my parents, my dad always told me, Go as hard as you can, you'll have no regrets.   Have fun playing football. 
I think that's the biggest reason.   I'm just having fun out there. 

Q.   Is it fun to have success with all that dedication?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I can't do it without all the guys on the field. 

Q.   What about the game for this program, what does it mean?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I think it will be cool.   I think the last time they played in one of the big six bowls was 1994, '97.   It will be cool to be back in one of those bowl games they haven't been at in a while.

Q.   Where does the name Scooby come from?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   My actual name is Phillip.   They call my grandpa Phillip, my dad Phil.   Then when my dad and my grandpa were all in the same household, when I was a baby, it got too confusing.   Scooby, it stuck. 

Q.   Why do you continue to use Scooby?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I didn't think about it until I got to college.   Your name is Scooby?   I was like, Yeah, my name is Scooby.   Never thought anything about it.

Q.   There's not a Scooby Wright III?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   That's because I'm Phillip Wright III (laughter). 

Q.   Do you know where Scooby came from?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   When I was little, I got teased.   Then I got big and didn't get teased too much longer (laughter). 

Q.   What do you see from the quarterback from Boise State?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Calm, collected.   Doesn't make too many mistakes.   Gets out of the pocket, gets a first down when he sees space. 

Q.   You've faced several of those guys this year.   Quarterbacks that can run.   What challenge does that add to it?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   Just make sure you stay in front of them, don't let them get in open space.   I think that's the biggest thing. 

Q.   Did you all drive up as a team yesterday?
SCOOBY WRIGHT III:   I flew in straight.   I'm from Northern California.
