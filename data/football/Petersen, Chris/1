  Washington - 13, Stanford - 23   
CHRIS PETERSEN: Well, credit to Stanford. They just executed their plan a heck of a lot better than we did. Kind of felt like dï¿½jï¿½ vu, about two years ago, coming down here, very, very similar. They held the ball. Converted, you know, opportunities when they need to on third downs, those type of things, and on offense, we got knock going.   
And so we got into no sort of rhythm and again, credit to Stanford. They hold the ball. They keep you on the sideline. Kind of start pressing a little bit and you know, you really got to be efficient on offense and we certainly weren't tonight.   
I thought special teams was a stalemate, and we probably didn't tackle well enough on defense and we certainly didn't, you know, get anything done on offense that was -- what we need to do in terms of running the ball or explosive plays or anything like that.   
 Q.  Did you think at least the beginning of the game, the defense was playing really well? You stopped them twice on the goal line?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Yeah, I thought we played well on defense in the red zone. Swelled up good. Made them kick a couple field goals. You know, then they did a pretty good job there.   
 Q.  What has to change to get the passing game going?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: That's a good question. Dropped balls. Have to give our quarterback a couple more answers, too. A couple times he was standing back there with not answers -- couple that with protection stuff and he was running around, a couple guys didn't make plays for him and when you're not going to get the ball a bunch, you'd better capitalize.   
 Q.  When you talk about giving him more answers does that start with receivers getting open?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: I think it's everything. We'll look at the tape here but like I said I know a couple times, we just got to cut our losses. He threw a couple good balls in there that we didn't make plays on. We've got to do a better job, there's no question, in the pass game.   
CHRIS PETERSEN: I think in some ways, and not just offense, defense, I think just across the board. I think they played more physical than us and did a better job than us, I really do.   
 Q.  The offensive line --  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Yeah, did a great job. They did a better job than we did.   
 Q.  Watching you guys play SC last week, you guys were really impressive. The change from week-to-week surprising.  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Yeah, surprising to us, too. Different style teams. Like I see -- I mean, nothing surprised me in terms of environment. Everything we talked about, styles of offense, styles of defense, everything they were going to run, all that stuff. We didn't execute well enough.   
 Q.  What is leading to the tackling issues? Is it technique? What's going on there?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: I don't know. Like I said, we'll put the tape on and figure that out and going to have to work a little bit harder in practice for sure.   
 Q.  Did you see on 36 pass attempts, so many are going to Aaron, what does that tell but the rest of the receiver core?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: I don't know. We need to look at that, too. You know, figure out if we're throwing the ball, moving one guy around too much to do that. But you know, like I said, I think the quarterback just goes with his read, so we'll take a look at all those things.   
 Q.  With Richard and his injury, that appeared to be pretty significant?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: You saw what I saw. I didn't even talk to the trainers. I know he was in pain.   
 Q.  Knee? Ankle?  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Down -- it wasn't his knee. Somewhere in his foot or something like that.   
 Q.  The decision on fourth down at halftime to go for it.  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Which one?   
 Q.  The first drive of the second half.  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Yeah, thought we could make it. You know, we had to score points. We have to score touchdowns in the red zone. You know, kicking field goals, that's not going to beat this team. You know, fourth and two, fourth and three, think we can make it and we didn't.   
 Q.  When you sent the punt team out --  
CHRIS PETERSEN: Wanted to go for it and had a miscommunication with the punt team.
