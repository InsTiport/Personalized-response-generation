 Q.   You a big hockey fan?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   I'm a big Detroit fan.   There's a lot of Michigan and Ohio things that go on in our team.   I just became a big hockey fan.   
   
 Q.   Have you ever skated?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   Yes, I skate.   I could never play, though.   
   
 Q.   Would coach give you a shot?   
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   I didn't talk to him about it.   I'm not fast enough.   
   
 Q.   Would you want to talk to Anaheim about it?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   I guess so.   
   
 Q.   Put you in the net.   
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   Anything is worth trying.   
   
 Q.   How important can this be, winning this game, for making up for the season maybe?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   Winning this game means a lot for the program.   We won our bowl game last year.   This season, to win this bowl game.   We should have finished strong.   But it also gives us confidence going into spring knowing that we lost a couple games, but we won our last game.   
Just having that confidence going into the spring carries like the confidence we had for our summer workouts last year.   
   
 Q.   Have you made any type of decision what you do after this game?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   No.   But I've been considering coming down to‑‑ I haven't, but this week I've kind of been thinking about it.  
   
 Q.   Who have you reached out for advice?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   Coach Dantonio.   I talked to some of the older guys.   A couple of people back home I talked to.   But nobody seriously because I never really come down to it.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   That's one of the biggest parts, besides my college life.   That is the biggest part of my life right now.   
   
 Q.   How has becoming a dad made you want to step up and work harder and provide for your family?  
WILLIAM GHOLSTON:   When we first got here, I knew that everything that I did was not just for me.   I wasn't just representing myself, Michigan State.   Every time I walked, I'd be walking with the guy next to me.   
I guess it gave me a better sense of maturity, realizing that I always realized I'd be playing for Michigan State, but
