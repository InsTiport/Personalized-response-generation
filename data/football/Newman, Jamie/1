 Q.  Congrats on the win.  
JAMIE NEWMAN: Thank you. Thank you.   
 Q.  (Question)  
JAMIE NEWMAN: Yeah. Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you predict having an easy one?  
JAMIE NEWMAN: I mean, we had an easy one last week. That doesn't matter anymore.   
Every week is 1-0. The goal is to go 1-0 every week, and that's what we do.   
 Q.  You anticipate running the ball as much as you did?  
JAMIE NEWMAN: I mean, I do whatever is necessary for our team to win. If that means running me 20, 25, 35, that's fine with me.   
 Q.  (Question).  
JAMIE NEWMAN: Well, I mean, the next play, you know what I'm saying.   
 Q.  The guys from the outside, they made a couple of catches. What were your thoughts on the touchdowns?  
JAMIE NEWMAN: I mean, those guys, you know, like I said, all year long, they're hard workers. They do their job. They're where they're supposed to be all the time. There is no choice but to give them the ball.   
 Q.  Three games, that have came down to the last play, decided in the last minute. What's it about your team that you're able to pull these games out.  
JAMIE NEWMAN: I think it was very smart. I think we're a very smart team. I think we know our situations very well.   
Offensively when we get the ball, 8 minutes left, we know we have to shoot the clock up, use all their timeouts like we did, defense is going to do a great job.   
 Q.  (Question).  
JAMIE NEWMAN: I mean, it was great. You know, our guys did a great job. My tight ends did a great job getting open on third down. They all did a great job today.   
 Q.  (Question).  
JAMIE NEWMAN: It's great. You know, as much as those guys are doing on the outside, it opens up in the middle. All those guys are getting more opportunities the more they throw the ball away from those two guys.   
 Q.  What are you going to do for the week off?  
JAMIE NEWMAN: Prepare for Louisville.   
 Q.  That's it?  
JAMIE NEWMAN: That's it.
