<p>	Q.  When Pete came to you and said, hey, come join me at USC, what drew you there?  What impressed you about Pete?</p>
<p>	Q.  The National Title game often becomes a defensive struggle, even if you've got two high powered offenses.  Why does that happen, and will it happen Tuesday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Congratulations on a great year, first of all. </p>
<p>	Q.  You do a great job of utilizing all your personnel from utilizing Reggie Bush to LenDale White and all the great talent that you have.  Talk about your mindset as you go into a game and you've got all these pieces to a puzzle.  Are you tying to take advantage of the individual or is it a product of the system that you plug an individual to?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could talk about -- so much has been made of so many of the match-ups, individually and star power and all that kind of thing, but in terms of your offense, talk about some of the things that you have to establish, and maybe without giving away too many secrets, some of the things that you can exploit or stay away from on the Oklahoma defense. </p>
<p>	Q.  How has Matt handled the post-Heisman attention?  It's been something he's been dealing with all season leading up to it, and have you kind of shared with him any of the past experiences you've had in dealing with the guys who have gone past --</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just curious, you mentioned that when you were in Raleigh you were commuting back and forth to your family in Utah.  Do you still have your family in Utah and are you still going back and forth?</p>

<p>	Q.  Matt, congratulations on winning the Heisman. </p>
<p>	Q.  Last year following Jason White when he won the Heisman, he tried to be as normal as possible when he returned to practice and things and dealing with the media and just going about town and going to restaurants and things.  Are you trying to do the same thing, or do you find you're having to make adjustments now as the Heisman Trophy winner?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, a lot has been made of Oklahoma giving up a lot of yards mid-season in the secondary.  As you've looked at their tape, I'm sure you've watched every game they've played this season.  Are they a better defense in the secondary since they've made some changes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt, Pete mentioned it yesterday and Norm mentioned it today.  Could you talk a little bit about what it was like last year watching Carson Palmer go through this two years ago, how that helped you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, you were along with Matt during the Heisman run and all of that in New York.  Is he telling us the truth?  Has he been the same guy since he's won the Heisman Trophy, and if so, could you expound on it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Alex, a lot of talk about this game, huge match-up, two Heisman winners, two National Championship coaches, best match-up of all time.  Is that the kind of thing players pay attention to or can sense, have an appreciation for?  Is this different than last year, the Rose Bowl anticipation?  How do you view the game in that regard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, we know so much about you and Matt and some of the guys here.  What's the most overlooked or under appreciated part of your offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Alex and Dominique.  When you guys watch NFL games this year and hear people talk about the great athletes who are playing tight end and how that position has been increased in importance in the NFL, does that make you guys just that much more eager to get there and show what you can do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie, not everybody can play wide receiver and tailback both.  I guess you consider yourself a running back, but your unique talents allow you to do both.  Have you had to try to develop wide receiver skills as well as your natural position of running back, or does it just come natural for you, that when you line up out there you're able to do it?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for Matt.  I wonder if you could talk about Reggie's importance as a receiver, kind of bridging the gap for you guys until Dwayne was ready not having Mike Williams available this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned the line, and I'm going to direct this one to Sam.  How do you think the line has developed this year?  You guys had a lot of focus put on you because of all the great talent around you.  How has the first year starting gone for you and for a lot of the other young guys on there?</p>

<p>	Q.  Matt, obviously you guys want to take that one-game-at-a-time approach, but if you were in our position, if you were in a fan's position, could you see or can you see with all the elements involved that many could consider this an unbelievable match-up, a game-of-the-century-type of situation, and if so, why would you feel that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is for the big guys basically.  Oklahoma prides itself on having a good pass rush and I think they're pretty good up front.  What's your impressions of Oklahoma's front four or front seven, Sam or however you guys want to answer that? </p>

<p>	Q.  Norm, this game-of-the-century talk, you've been around a long time.  How do you see that?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is LenDale coming along and are you comfortable with your situation at tailback at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just to follow up, if he's not there, how does that change things?</p>
<p>	Q.  Recently a lot of Heisman Trophy winners have struggled in bowl games and National Championship games.  Is there anything in Matt's makeup that makes you confident that that won't happen to him?  I think the last three Heisman Trophy winners have all lost their BCS Championship games. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you please talk about the Oklahoma defense, what your impressions of it are going into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any one particular game where you felt that you could be at ease with the offensive line, that you said, okay, these guys get it now and I don't have to worry about them?</p>
