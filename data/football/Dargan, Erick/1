Q.   What's the first thing that you did?
ERICK DARGAN:   Drove through the roses.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Nah, just something to keep in mind there, while we are here.   It's where we come from, the other side of the mission.

Q.   (Indiscernible)
ERICK DARGAN:   Enjoying the experience, taking it all in.   Understand we are here on business.   Just having fun.   We post pictures.   But I don't really look at the contents or nothing.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   By far B.J.   I don't know.   B.J., he's crazy with Instagram.   It's all fun. 

Q.   What's practice been like, up close with coach?
ERICK DARGAN:   The same, we're not ashamed how we're practicing, because it's the way we practice is different.   And it helps us throughout the season.   So we just modify things a little bit.   But other than that, we're just getting out there.

Q.   I know you're a big college football fan.   Do you watch Florida State, hear the chant, the chopping?
ERICK DARGAN:   Yeah, I'll watch them.   The chant, "ahh, ahh," I don't know, it's kind of cool.   They got something; we've got something.   So I don't know. 

Q.   Do you feel like the fans (indiscernible), you guys now the #backtoback (indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   One thing after this game, we definitely have support for them, everything that we play.   Go finish up.   And everybody's supportive as a unit. 

Q.   (Indiscernible).

ERICK DARGAN:   I think we had a pretty good amount of people from southern California. 

Q.   Is that where you're from?

ERICK DARGAN:   Northern. 

Q.   Is this where you wanted to go? 
ERICK DARGAN:   No, definitely.   When I was a little kid, I definitely dreamed about playing on a big stage like this such as the Rose Bowl.   Basically living a childhood dream of mine.   Basically means a lot to play in this game.   We have a lot of history to add on to the game, it's important to me. 

Q.   Talk about defense.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   Our defense likes to win on defense.   We play every game how we want to play on defense, but I think we made improvements each week.   And that's something we pride ourselves on is getting better, correcting the mistakes, fixing the problems. 
But definitely the game is going to come down to defense.   When you're playing two high power offenses that can score at any given moment and have the athletes to do it, it's going to come down to whose defense can get the most three and outs.   Definitely defense is going to play a part. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   You know, we play pretty good teams, as you get behind, it's definitely hard.   But Florida State, they play hard, from start to finish.   That's something you have to give them credit on. 
They're going to play to the end of the whistle.   And each week, in and out.   So they're going to play regardless of what the score is, they're coming to play.   We're going to get their best, no matter what. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Unbelievable athlete and quarterback.   He's able to make the plays.   Can throw the ball anywhere on the field, whether he's running away from pressure on the run, he's looking to throw‑‑ he's a big guy. 
He's there to put the ball in tight windows.   So we've got a quarterback that's able to put the ball in tight windows and do what he does, he definitely has your attention and you have to respect him.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Try to throw different looks, but you have to stay in pressure.   The same as the receivers, they have got pretty good receivers out there, Greene, O'Leary, and the other guys.   They've got playmakers.   And we have to have playmakers on the field at one time, mixed with two great backs, it's going to be hard but you gotta get the job done. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   His work ethic.   He's always there, able to make plays, when his number is called.   (Indiscernible) throughout the season.   He shows what he can do week in, week out. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   It all starts with his preparation and leadership.   Marcus, he's a team player.   So is the rest of our team. 
When we've got a guy like Marcus, he's one of a kind, you really want to go out and make plays and help him.   It's have fun, enjoy the experience.   It's always a pleasure to be next to Marcus and playing with him.   You gotta capture the moment.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   He likes to joke around.   He's actually a pretty funny guy.   We all laugh a lot with him.   He's serious.   But he's also laid back.   He likes to have a good time.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   Yeah, definitely. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Kind of.   I'm not running the whole show on defense.   So as he is on offense‑‑ as defense, being in the secondary, I'm a safety, I take it upon myself to make sure everybody knows what the call is and the communication, being across the field. 
That's one thing we have to do in this game is communicate.   In an offense often like that, and what they do, we have to have our game communication. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely, when you have a guy, especially Ifo, what he can do out there, is definitely a loss because you lose experience and a guy that knows what he's doing. 
But Ifo and Troy Hill, they really do a good job helping the young guys understand and to make sure they know what they do. 
The way we practice, everybody is looked at as a starter and expected to produce while they're out there.   Definitely, but we got the guys to do it, to step up.   It's the next guys up, just gotta perform. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   Our whole secondary make sure each other, whether it's the older guy or older guy or younger guy, we just look out for each other, make sure everybody knows what they're doing.   We just want to be as complete a secondary, that's what we pride ourselves on, making sure everybody knows what they're doing.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   We got like two or three.   I think we've got the best backfield in the country when you look at our running backs and look at our quarterback, our tight ends and our receivers.   So it definitely helps us out when you can go to an offense such as ours, (indiscernible) another high power offense.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Understand, it's not all about football.   It's about school.   Coach Aliotti, Coach Neal they guaranteed I was going to graduate. 
I was up in Oregon, graduating was important to not just myself, but to the program and my family.   And that's big.   It's more of a family. 
Everybody looks out after everybody.   And it's been that way since I've been here. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   But when you come, you get the feeling.   It's something about the program.   It's a real family Oregon program.   We look out for each other.   From day one there's nothing but love, the other guys taking you under their wing and looking after you.

Q.   Where are you from?
ERICK DARGAN:   From Pittsburg, California.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I'm not a big fan.   I'm a big fan of the jersey and stuff.   But when you make an important decision like that, you can't make it based on the jersey or what you're wearing.   You gotta do it about the coaching staff. 
Coach Neal, he's been like a mentor to me, father to me.   Means more than football, it's all about life.   I think he's one of the best out there because for him it's not just about football.   You gotta learn life's lessons.   When it comes down to it, he's going to be there for you.   And he's a man of his word. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   No, because every one of the systems is not a good fit for everybody.   What drew me to Oregon, it's really the coaching staff and the players, when I came on my visit, I felt like I belong here.   And that's something I didn't get in a lot of other places. 
Good schools.   But when you come here, it's a little different.   Eugene is a good environment to go to school.   Give back to the community and have fun. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   We're all brothers back there.   When you lose somebody like him, it hurts.   But one thing about it he was a strong individual.   The same day, he wasn't crying or anything, he was up and laughing and joking like nothing ever happened.   That's one thing I appreciate about Ifo because him being strong helps us move forward.   Knowing we gotta do it for him. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   It helps a lot.   This decision is not about the game, it's about the long haul.   Some games‑‑ situations happen, sometimes people aren't going to be able to play.   And the next guy has to step up. 
And I think our coaching staff do a good job of preparing everybody and making sure everybody still gets along, everybody has to roll on the team and has to understand that.   Guys from Marcus to myself, to the walk‑ons, everybody working every week, everybody is treating you the same.   It's not like we're treated different becausewe're playing a lot.   Everybody's treated the same.   And that's what we pride ourselves on.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Well, you do but you don't.   Because the next guy's up.   You have to keep mentoring the guy, make sure he's ready to go in the game. 
At one point I think it was said that we lost seven starters.   Honestly, I didn't even know it got to that point where it was seven starters that was out.   But you just make‑‑ you have to be able to step into the mix and produce the same, if not better.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely, I've been here before.   But you definitely enjoy the experience and enjoy the experience with your teammates. 
We like to have fun.   But at the end of the day we're all here on a business trip.   I think we know that.   We can have fun, but we have to also stay focused.   We're not done yet.   We gotta keep it going. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I think our end guys have a pretty good head on their shoulders.   They understand what's their mission.   Stay focused, enjoy the experience. 
I tell everybody, enjoy this.   It's not often you get to come here and be in a Rose Bowl.   Enjoy the experience, but also stay focused. 

Q.   (Question about Rashad)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I think Coach (indiscernible) receiving didn't really start coming on.   Jameis has been finding him.   He can make plays, too, just like Greene.   But they've got a talented freshman receiver.   Some don't play like freshmen.   (Indiscernible).   Greene‑‑ you have the whole receiving corps.

Q.   (Question about the matchup issue with Nick O'Leary)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I think for the majority of the season we had a tight end ourselves.   Pharoah Brown, he was playing just as good. 
He gotta help prepare for tight end.   So it's not our first tight end we've seen like O'Leary, but playing in the game it is.   Everybody on the field.   When you have something like that, you definitely have to respect them and put a body on them, bang them around. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   We wanted to pick up where we left off.   We had a pretty good practice.   Good on that.   Don't want to come back, talking about motivation over, getting back into our group.   It was pretty easy to get back to the green light, little wrinkles, knock off some rust.   But other than that, it was pretty much‑‑

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Each time you get to play with a group of guys like we have out here, you definitely have a hunger.   For me, I just go out there and I like making plays with my team, celebrating with them. 
And like everybody making plays on the field, we have a lot, it's a tie game or whoever is on the field, we just want to have fun. 
And we honor that.   The game is a big game.   This is bigger than the last week because you have to play at your best at the stage like this.   You want to give it your all and be able to make plays.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Yeah, coming into the season, the work we put in, it was pretty good.   When the time came‑‑ do a run in on the fly.   It really helped.   But during the season, I don't look forward to playing in the Rose Bowl because we have to win each week.   So I just really focused on each week, game by game, and we picked our heads up in December see where we're at and we're here, we're right where we want to be. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   It's the same how it's been, one corner moves up.   We still practice the same, still rotate the same.   Everybody got to play as a starter.   We gotta up our game that much more. 
When you lose a guy like Ifo, it's not easy replacing him.   But I think we've got the players to do it. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   A quarterback.   Connor Halliday is probably the best one, because he's a gun slinger.   He's able to throw the ball in tight windows too.   But overall we haven't played a quarterback like that, to be honest with you.

Q.   (Indiscernible)
ERICK DARGAN:   He can run if he has to.   He's a great quarterback.   He's smart.   He's able to find open windows and take defenses apart and put the ball in tight windows.   Very accurate.   Throw the ball deep, short, anywhere on the field.   You got a quarterback like that, you gotta come ready to play.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I think that's one of his tricks.   When you go out and make plays, it's easy.   We all feed off of each other.   When the offense is off there rolling, we want to get our time too. 
So we compete with the offense, who can make more plays.   But he's a quiet guy.   But he says a lot through his emotion.   When the time cracks down and he needs to step up and say something he can do it at the right time.   He's a very leadership guy. 
I think he is able to learn from more‑‑ so that's why he's so powerful.   But he's a good guy.   We like to make plays with him.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   Kind of unexpected.   I forgot what week it was but we just came off a win.   I think it was a pretty good win.   And he brought everybody in like, look, you played good but it really wasn't good enough.   The way we practiced, it's not good enough.
Everybody gotta step up, including himself.   When he said everybody gotta step up, he's not excluding himself.   Like he always start with myself, starting with myself and that's the kind of guy he is. 
He's always improving.   At secondary we compete with Marcus a lot.   Trying to pick them off.   We know if we can pick them off we can pick anybody else off.   If we can compete with them, we're doing the right thing.   But, yeah, he definitely steps up and brings us up as a group if something isn't right. 
Coaches sit back and let him know because they know it's right.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely, Marcus is better.   7 on 7, me and him and the secondary, we all are competing.   We tell each other, we're coming after him.   He tell us, too. 
After we kind of joke about it, you got a quarterback like that, someone that can do anything on the field that you don't even know about, like when he flipped, it was a surprise, like what are you doing? 
I think a lot of people were shocked he flipped, didn't want him to flip, but it kind of surprised, showed he was willing to do whatever for his teammates.   And that means a lot.   When you got a quarterback like that, helps with the other quarterbacks.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   The way they compete from start to finish.   They've been behind in some games.   But they don't let it determine their season. 
Jameis throws a pick and then they come back and score a touchdown.   When you have a quarterback that's able to fit the ball in a tight window, and sometimes they don't go the way he wants, and they get a pick and come back, make another play, it shows that they're willing to fight for each other the whole game.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely.   I can definitely respect the team because the fight is in and they're willing to make plays, going to make plays.   Gotta contain them.   We definitely respect the effort.   We have to give it our best.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Some similarities.   I would say two completely different quarterbacks, because of style of play. 
But both quarterbacks make throws all over the field.   They can use their feet to get away from trouble.   That's what I pretty much say. 
I mean, I don't know Jameis as a person, but on the field, looks like he's a competitor and he's willing to do for his team, whether he's hurt or not.   And when you gotta a player like that, you have to respect. 
But Marcus competes with our whole team on and off the field, whether it's playing video games and stuff.   He doesn't like to lose.   And nobody on our team like to lose.   So I think when you got a lot of people that don't like to lose there, they're willing to do to get the "W". 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   When you are on defense, you have to be able to stop whatever they throw at you and that's what we prepare ourselves for.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Good combination.   When you've got some players like, that was able to make plays and got two running backs, they balance things out. 
Gotta come ready to play.   You know who they are.   Gotta give them our best, because we know we're going to get theirs.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Playmakers, no secret about it.   Royce is a playmaker.   He runs hard.   And Christian is a playmaker too, he runs through arm tackles, makes you miss, get to the end zone.   There's similarities about being playmaker. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   It was a family.   The day when I got here, everybody treated me nice.   When I was on my visit, I felt more comfortable about being successful in the classroom and getting a degree. 
And that's what I set out to do.   And I've done it.   Coach tried hard to help me.   And I think our coaches have always been there for me, with our players.   Whatever we go through, everybody's going to be there for each other as a family.   That's what we all do.   People feeling comfortable and being part of a family. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Everybody gotta step up.   We can't have any bad practices as a secondary.   But people being strong, helps us out.   He's a strong individual.   We talked yesterday.   He's already trying to get back to be with us.   That means a lot. 
He's willing to be with us despite what he's going through and keeping his head up.   As a secondary, it's like a brotherhood. 
We do whatever for each other.   And when you got somebody out there they do whatever for you and it's not there, it hurts.   But kind of made us stronger, brought us together to understand that we have to play together and step up. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Not yet, but we look forward to seeing them, too.   We'll see. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I can't try to do too much.   I have to play my game, let the game come to me and make the plays that I'm able to make.   And the same thing, don't try to do too much, just play the game, do your job, and get the job done.   The rest will take care of itself. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Instagram. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Doing pretty good at this point. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Pretty good.   Pretty good food.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Well done.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Keeping my composure, playing within defense, making plays. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Just put a body on them.   Whoever is on defense, the defensive strength.   But we've got corners I believe in and the team believes in, that will get the job done. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Definitely I think our coaching staff do a good job making sure we hit our peak, doing what's needed. 
But we're ready.   I want to play, not just me, but our team wants to play a game a couple of weeks ago.   We stay ready to play and our coaching staff do a good job making sure of that. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I don't know.   I think the Michigan State win and playing against Arizona and winning how we did at Stanford.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   My teammates and my coach. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Stepping on the field, just enjoying the moment.   Understanding that I'm here.   Not that I'm just here, but I'm here with my teammates. 
A lot of us are playing in front of a crowd like this, had tears.   So it's like a dream come true.   Capturing the moment. 
My parents.   My brother.   My teammates.   My coach.   A lot of people played a part in inspiring me.   And I'm able to learn from others.   That's what helps me on and off the field.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I can't think of one off the top of my head.   I try to learn something new every day.   Whether it's myself‑‑ I look at how other people, how they do stuff, how they're successful and trying to figure out how I apply that to my life to be successful. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I haven't heard that.   But who's a good guy.   Haven't heard that, two high power offenses, they come out, go head to head, whoever can come out on top, they're going to come out on top. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   He's a competitor.   He's like that.   If we get up, not going to try to run the ball, to get out of there.   But they're going to stay true.   They've got playmakers.   When you're playing against the best, that's what you want, you want to be in a game like this.   Growing up, you know, you want to be in games like this. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   It's a pleasure.   You're getting ready to play in history.   It's not too often you get two Heisman quarterbacks, two quarterbacks, Mariota and Jameis caliber.   You've just got to enjoy it and watch the show. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   They did in many different ways.   Understanding that you can't just show up and expect to get a W. 
We have to go back and regroup.   It hurt us.   We never want to feel that feeling again.   We knew what we had to do.   And I think it really kind of shows that when we played in the game that we was hungry for them.   That's something we wanted. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Because everybody knows that Marcus deserves it.   In our opinion he deserved it two or three years ago.   So we're just happy for him. 
And it's really a family.   When we see one of our brothers succeeding and getting the attention such as him, it means a lot to us.   And we just want to help everything come true that he ever wanted and we wanted for him. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   No, because it's always the next guy up.   But we believe in each one that's there.   So it helps. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   Doesn't slack as a player.   It's been a family, helping each other, mentoring each other, understanding that staying after practice and understanding we need to work on the technique or helping each other do this or that better, it really helps.   Helps for the long run.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   It's been tough.   When it got tough, when we came together, it really made things easier.   When you look at a guy and he's struggling, you want to give up, you look at another guy and he's doing it, you're like I'm not going to give up, I'm going to push through it and get it done for my brothers.   And it shows on the field, when we come together we can accomplish anything.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   He's done a lot.   He's an unbelievable quarterback.   When you have a quarterback like that, can throw the ball in tight windows, it's impressive.   So we gotta get a handle on some balls, knock some balls down, pick some balls off.   But ultimately you've got to confuse them and contain them.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I definitely haven't seen too many teams rattle them for the whole game.   And honestly I don't think you can. 
When you got a quarterback like that, staying in the pocket and take a hit from a safety or linebacker or even "D" lineman and deliver all the time, you've got to respect that and understand he's an unbelievable quarterback.   You just gotta give it your best, go out there and make plays.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   You know, we have some corners that can step up that have been in the fire early.   Ifo, he do a good job helping other people out.   It's not all about himself, as a secondary unit.   So we just gotta prepare everybody like they're starter, understand like you have to be yourself as a starter.   That's what we've been doing all season.   So it helps. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I'm loving it.   I'm loving it.   Enjoy being a part of the Rose Bowl first playoff game.   Early in the season, we put our heads down.   At the end of the season we look up and we are here where we knew we were going to be. 

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
ERICK DARGAN:   I walk around.   Just enjoy the feeling, looking at the different rides.   Me personally I'm a roller coaster guy, was just walking around.
