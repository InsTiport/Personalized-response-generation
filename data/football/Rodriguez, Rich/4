Q. Was it a tough assignment tonight the way Stanford plays offensively?
RICH RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, somewhat.  I'm sure we're undersized, certainly, and that wasn't a good match-up.  But that's an excuse.  We didn't stop anything they wanted to do.  They wanted to throw, they threw.  They wanted to run, they ran.
Q. What did you think of Jerrard?
RICH RODRIGUEZ: He competed.  He was bothered by a little bit of a hamstring or something because he didn't have the same burst, and I could tell that early on.  He tried.  He competed well, but we didn't execute well.
Q. It seems like you guys tackled a little bit better than last week.
RICH RODRIGUEZ: We did?
Q. Maybe not?
RICH RODRIGUEZ: From my vantage point I didn't think we got off tackle well at all.  But that starts with us as coaches.  We're going to evaluate everything.  Like I said, I'm going to evaluate my staff, myself, the players.  I think you need to do that anyway.  We normally do that on the open day, but we don't have one of those, so it's about time for us to regroup in a hurry and see how we can get better.
Q. Did Stanford surprise you in any way?
RICH RODRIGUEZ: Nope.
Q. Did they stack the box defensively?
RICH RODRIGUEZ: No, they played what we thought they'd play.
