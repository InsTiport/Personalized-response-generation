   THE MODERATOR: We have defensive end Tim Jamison.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Man, I'm still feeling hurt from that game. But we got it behind us. We watched the film on it. We corrected all the mistakes we had to do. We went out and had a great practice yesterday, last night. We focused.   
 We got a big game. Good thing about it is it didn't hurt our Big-10 record. I mean, we still 1-1 in the Big-10. All our goals are still in front of us.   
 We face a ton of teams who are still in the race right now, like all the teams undefeated in the Big-10 we've still got to face.   
  
  Q. Was it a feeling of disbelief or...   
 TIM JAMISON: Yeah, disbelief. I didn't see that coming. We as a team didn't see it coming, but it happened. It was just a bad moment. It was terrible.   
 But it's behind us now. They came up with the victory. Give them credit. We've got to press on. We're not going to dwell in the past too much longer. Got to get ready for Penn State.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Well, our defense, I feel they're working to get better each week. It's funny, when we watch film on teams, they come out and do a totally different thing on Saturday. So it's the ability to adjust to the things we didn't see game planning for that week. I think our ability to do that shows great character on our part, to adjust on Saturdays to what we didn't see on film.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Yeah, actually they did. Leading up to that game, they wasn't a spread team, they were more of a 12-personnel, run-downhill team. They showed up on game day to be max protection, three-step drop, a lot of that. It was good on our part to adjust at halftime. The coaches came with a good game plan to shut it down in the second half.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: We talked about it a lot. Like some of the players making comments saying, Appalachian State, at least they won three national championships in their division.   
 It hurt. But a loss is a loss. Like I said, we can't dwell on the past any longer. Give them credit. They won. They beat us. Our job, especially me as a senior, is to make sure everybody keep their confidence, to keep pushing them in practice. I feel like their confidence is not lost. I feel like they're mad, they're motivated, they're anxious to go to Penn State and play that great team.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: I mean, he'll retire when he wants to retire. You got to face adversity. Just happen to be a senior when coach came. They have a lot of faith in us. There's a lot of talk about coach hasn't got his players. But I feel he's doing a great job, coaching us like we his own. We're going to bounce back from it.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding watching the last game on film.)   
 TIM JAMISON: No, I get that feeling like it's not us 'cause the talent that we have, it's like, man, you see it in practice, why is it not coming together in the game? You all know like what it is. But I feel like they're going to get it. They're going to get it. We have a lot of talent.   
 These games we lost, it shouldn't have happened, it shouldn't have occurred. But I feel like they'll get it.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: This would be the week to get it. This would be the week to get it. Like I said, the Toledo game, the thing about it, we're still 1-1 in the Big-10. We still play our next six games, those guys are either undefeated or on track to win the Big-10. Our goal is still in front of us. We're not going to lose sight of that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Well, watching the film, you know, our D line got a lot of double-teams. They max protect. They just dinked us, throwing little dunk passes in there, whatever. Everything we saw in the game we saw on film. We just got to correct it. Coaches coached us up on what we need to be coached up on.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Well, you know, to a certain extent they did. But that's just going to drive us to work that much harder in practice because since they're going to max protect, we're going to have to get different schemes that is going to help us in those situations, so...   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: You got to talk to coach about that. We do whatever he tell us to do. I'm sure he saw it and we gonna adjust to it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Actually, man, I fell asleep like around 7:00. So, you know, my brother, I talked to him about what happened. But I didn't want to watch anything. I was in that moment to just sulk, get it all out of my system, get ready for Penn State.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible)  
 TIM JAMISON: I mean, you know, just prepare for 'em. They a great team. They got a lot of weapons, a lot of things they can do. But they're going to speak a lot about us when we face them this weekend. Our confidence is not shot. We're anxious to play this great team to see what we can do at their home.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: At that point, that don't really make a difference. I know the team losing against Toledo, they feel Michigan is down this year, everybody feels they can take a shot against Michigan. That's what we've got to keep in our head, everybody is going to get everybody's best shot. We just going to keep on practicing hard.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Yeah, I mean, we're Michigan. Everybody want to take a shot at Michigan every year. But, you know, they feel like new coaching staff, young offense, young team, this is our year. I'm pretty sure everybody feels like that. That's what's going to drive us to keep working harder as a team.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 TIM JAMISON: Yeah, they're young. I mean, all the time. We always go to our young quarterbacks because they take the most heat out of everybody. So we always go up to them and we make sure, especially KC, our kicker, because he had a tough time. He probably felt a lot of heat. But he's a senior. I look to him as a leader on this team.   
 You just go up to them every day, we're going to get you the ball. Keep on pushing. Stuff like that.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
