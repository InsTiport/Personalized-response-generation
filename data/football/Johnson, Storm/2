  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   What has Coach O'Leary been like as a head coach?  
STORM JOHNSON:   He's a head coach.   We follow him.   
   
 Q.   You obviously made a big decision a few years back to come here from the University of Miami.   Have you thought back to when you made that decision, what went through your mind when you made that decision?  
STORM JOHNSON:   I do.   I just focused and don't regret the decision I made, just move on from there.   
   
 Q.   You've been in the backfield most of the year, stepped up a little bit.   How much have you helped Blake Bortles?  
STORM JOHNSON:   It goes hand‑in‑hand, opening up the pass, opens up the run.   
   
 Q.   You are playing a high‑powered offense in Baylor.   Obviously you want to try to keep that offense off the field.   How important is the running game?  
STORM JOHNSON:   It's very important trying to get first downs, keep the time of possession going.   Everything is focused on that.   
   
 Q.   Personally for you what does it mean to be in the Fiesta Bowl, representing the university in its first BCS game?  
STORM JOHNSON:   It's very exciting.   We enjoy being here.   
But our main focus is to get the win.   
   
 Q.   What would a win mean for you and your university?  
STORM JOHNSON:   It would mean a lot to everybody.   Just to cap it off with a win would be fantastic.   
   
 Q.   You have knowledge of the big three.   Is there room in the state of Florida for the big four?  
STORM JOHNSON:   Yes.
