Um, they're -- they're good as advertised.
SONY MICHEL: A great, physical team that, you know, we expect nothing but hard-nosed football from them. They have all-around good players from the interior to the perimeter guys. Those guys play well together. We respect them offensively and we are looking forward to the match-up.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: This was our goal coming back. We knew it was going to be a long journey for us. Ultimately this was our goal to get to the national championship. We're here, we're trying to take full advantage of it. At the end of the day we gotta finish. We gotta finish what we started.
Q. What are the keys to the game?
SONY MICHEL: We have to play physical football. There's not going to be no tricks about it. Hard-nosed football.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It feels good to be here in Atlanta. It really doesn't matter where we are, because our fans are going to travel. They've been traveling well all year. I commend our fans for being so supportive throughout the years, especially this year, they've been there.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Um, I mean, that's their personnel. They have all-around good players. We're just going to have to manage the ball well, and I think that's going to be the biggest challenge we're going to have to face as an offense, managing the ball.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Not necessarily, just have to -- scoring is the ultimate objective, but, I mean, our goal is just to, you know, just to score when we did can.
Q. Season, you've been with the team what are a while. What's one thing the fans may not know about this team?
SONY MICHEL: I'm not sure. I don't know. This is what they get. I mean, I'm sure they know it all.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, yeah, we lost early in the season, but that wasn't -- that was the challenge we had to overcome, but I mean, just from off-season winter workouts we had to overcome so many challenges just from going through workouts that we didn't want to do as a team and doing a lot of things coach put in front of us, had to meet standards that the copies of set for us and just to see these guys overcome a lot of those obstacles, it was a blessing that we overcame that one.
Q. What's this week been like?
SONY MICHEL: It had to be just pure focus, focusing on this game. This game is what we've been looking forward to. This game is what we gotta hone in on, we've got to dedicate, we've got to sacrifice just for this game.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I won't say too many take-aways. We've got to go into this game and play clean football. When I say "clean" I mean executing our plays well because in the end we've got to do what we've got to do. We're not going to change-up anything, just play fast, physical football.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It's an advantage because that win can easily linger around and kind of affect the focus of this team. That's why it was important for the leaders on this team, the coaches, even the players to understand that we've just gotta hone in on Alabama and our focus is Alabama.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It's a lot. I mean, this team is not about me and Nick, it's about players that can go out there and play football and make plays for the Georgia program. Because the ultimate goal is to win. Individual accolades, those just come. It's impressive, it's amazing that guys can have success with their teammates.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I've been sharing time all four years that I've been here so it's not nothing new to me, it's not new to anybody here. It's probably not nothing new to anybody that every played running back at the University of Georgia because there's always been multiple running backs having success at the University of Georgia. We're used to it. There is always competition.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Not at all, I mean, a big play is good for this team. Any big play can lead to a touchdown and a touchdown can lead to points on the board. Points on the board lead to a victory and that's the ultimate goal.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Yeah, when my time is called. It's not like I see him make a big play and I want to go in there and make a big play. If he makes a big play and be don't score that means he's on fire. He's got to stay in there and finish the work he's done.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: How do we prepare? It's all about our preparation and our practice. We have to have good practices, physical practices, gotta be locked in on a game plan. As long as we're prepared with the game plan and if we're physically there, mentally there, I'm sure we will be prepared.
Q. How do you prepare for a defense like Alabama?
SONY MICHEL: Just like I said, it all starts in practice. Practicing more physical.
Q. What do you make of all the distraction?
SONY MICHEL: It's a big distraction. It takes way from our focus and our focus is Alabama. That's what comes with it. Being in a national championship, it comes with a lot of distractions because you've gotta hear about the past game, it's hard to move forward when people keep bringing up the old games, people keep bringing up the old plays you made. A lot of things in the past can affect the future, it can affect the future, what you do now. Like Coach say he's been preach to go our team "be where your feet are" and we've got to focus on our task at hand.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I think we've been doing it all year. SEC team that play great opponents, a lot of great SEC opponents so we're used to it.
Q. (No microphone.) Talk about your decision to come back and what does it mean? What message did that be send to the younger players?
SONY MICHEL: Our decision to come back was just to come back and try to leave a legacy. The message that was sent was just, you know, we came back to work and we're excited to work with those guys another year. They was excited to work with us. Our whole focus was let's get to work and kinda buy into this program and let's try to get as much accomplished.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It means a lot. Those guys are always around, they come to our practices, they talk to the team, so it's always great to have alumni comeback and just be around the team, to see the people that laid down that foundation for us.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: The last time we played Alabama we lost. That's the most be important thing that I can remember. It's important for us to kinda just -- it's not really -- I won't say it's a revenge game, but use some of that to see what we can work on to improve more.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: We know that it's one of the best teams in the SEC. We're one of the best teams in the SEC. So they're similar to us by their physical play. It's going to be a very physical game, four quarters and that's what we're expecting.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Keeping the main thing the main thing is, you know, being composed, playing physical, playing fast and disciplined. That's the main thing.
Q. How does the run game get going?
SONY MICHEL: The run game gets going by executing, all 11 guys on offense executing their task and this thing should be rolling.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Just by being running backs, we are always together. We are always competing with each other, trying to get better by competing with each other. Our relationship built from there.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, I don't know what he describes as dirty because he's not like, filthy. (Chuckles.) I don't know what he describes as dirty, I don't have no problem with it.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I'm not sure, it's hard to tell. The only way we will find out is Monday. I envision this team making plays.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Uh-uh.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: He told Coach first. I don't know what he made his decision, he didn't know when I made mine. He told Coach first.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No, his decision not didn't have anything to do with my decision. We went through our evaluation process of how we was evaluating the whole process of wanting to come back, and we both made the same decision.
Q. What's the week been like you for you personally, scoring the winning touchdown in the Rose Bowl?
SONY MICHEL: This past week has been me getting back to work, focusing on what I envisioning for a long time. The national championship getting a chance to play in the national championship, one of the best teams in the SEC, so this week has been great. Another opportunity for me to play another game.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Not at all. Just about winning in the stadium? No. Because the past is not going to affect the present, is not going to affect the future. We still have to come out and play.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Fast, physical team. That's what everybody sees weekly from them. They're good, very physical team, a lot of great players.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Jake Fromm just played his part. He played his role great this we're, did a tremendous job by stepping in as the quarterback and just, you know, being a leader on this offense, being a general on the field, leading us to this point.
Q. Talk about the running game, not just you and Nick but the stable of backs that you guys keep bringing in.
SONY MICHEL: It's been effective, you know, because it starts with Coach Chaney, then it goes from the offensive line and the receivers doing perimeter blocking. It's been effective.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Staying -- I won't say staying will be necessary for everybody. It's all about the situation they're in. Everybody got different reasons for leaving and staying. I mean, just, you know, pray about it.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It means a lot. Somebody you work hard with. I mean, you know, we all grind as a team. We've all been through a lot as a team, and it means a lot to be able to have success with people that you been through a lot with.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, I didn't know much about him. I heard about him when he committed to Georgia but I didn't know much about him.
Q. Did you have first impressions about him?
SONY MICHEL: He was a good running back. He was there. He did what he had to do. I didn't see him much but at the practice field because it's not like we room together.
Q. You may go down as one of the most prolific duos in history. Does that mean something to you?
SONY MICHEL: It may mean something later on, as I look back, but right now I'm so focused on this game it really haven't hit me.
Q. Is there talk about keeping a routine with everything that's going on? Is it tough to keep a routine?
SONY MICHEL: Not at all. Coach Smart does a great job of keeping us focused, keep reminding us of keeping the main thing the main thing. There shouldn't be anything that distracts this team from a national championship. That's what everybody dreams of, everybody has the goal of playing in a national championship so anything that detracts them from that is just crazy.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: First, you know, it would just -- it means a lot just to be able to bring a national championship to the University of Georgia, just to see these guys, how hard they worked this season, the off-season, and to see it all pay off.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: There's a lot of guys on this team that you guys don't talk about. We get credit because we play on Saturdays but those guys that play on the "look" team give us the best look of other teams which help us be prepared to play those other teams.
You got quarterbacks like Stetson Bennett that can emulate running quarterbacks that we played all season, it helps our defense. When you got guys on defense that can emulate good linebackers, good "D" lineman, give us a good look it helps. We got so many guys out there that really don't get no credit, but we know they are there. Sometimes that's how life is.
Q. The offensive line, can you talk about the holes you see sometimes? Does it surprise you? Like there was one this past week that you had --
SONY MICHEL: It doesn't surprise me because I see how hard these guys work in practice. It happens -- most of the things that happen in a game happen in practice. It may not happen exactly the same way but it's almost like -- it's very similar to the situation.
Q. What went through your mind when you went into the end zone with that winning touchdown?
SONY MICHEL: That the game was over and I was ready to go home.
Q. What are your emotions like today? How are you preparing?
SONY MICHEL: I'm just preparing by working on my craft in practice, you know? Trying to work on ways, you know, we can affect this defense. That's the key to preparing for this game.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: What I remember? We lost. That's the biggest -- that's the only really memory that I have from it.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, it means a lot. It just shows how hard this team has worked to get to this point. Even though it's a different team, I think this team deserves to be in this position right now.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Like the national championship? I mean, at the end of the day, it's a football game. We're playing a very good opponent. We played many good opponents this season, and as long as this team takes it as another game, we will be fine.
There's a lot of distractions that come with this game, that's the only difference but the field is still 100 yards, still the same size, nothing changes about this game.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No, not at all. It's just another opportunity for us to just, you know, get honed in on a game plan.
Q. Talk about where Nick grew up.
SONY MICHEL: It's just a small town, nothing much there. It was eye-opening to me to see where Nick comes from.
Q. What did you guys do there?
SONY MICHEL: Nothing much. I mean, just hanging out. We were there just for a short period of time but we were hanging out, enjoying each other's company. As a college football player when you go back home you're not trying to do too much. You're just trying to rest.
Q. When was that?
SONY MICHEL: I'm not sure of the exact date. I'm sure it was around summertime.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Not sure.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No. No, I haven't.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Hopefully, one day. One day.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Yeah. I mean, just to -- just by having practice and thinking about preparing for one of the biggest games, our last game as a team together. This feels like a game week. Not having to stay in a hotel for so long and do a whole bunch of events. This feels like a game week.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, yeah, we're familiar with where we practice at but it's about us getting quality practices in. We can practice at home but not get quality practices in and it won't mean anything. We could practice way and get good quality practices and it means something, so it's about getting good, quality practices in.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Playing fast, physical football for four quarters.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I'm cheering for Todd Gurley.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Um, that's a tough question. I don't think I have a favorite.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Monday night's big. It's the biggest opportunity we have as a team to be the last two teams standing, to get another opportunity to play another college football game. It means a lot. It should fire these guys up to get rolling.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Just all around. We expect it to be a four quarter, fast, physical football game, nothing less. It's going to be like team run, team pass, all over. I don't think nothing too special is going to be going on just some hard-nosed football.
Q. Given the way you guys like to play physically isn't that exactly what you look forward to Monday night?
SONY MICHEL: Yeah, looking forward to it. Guys got to come prepared and strapped up, ready to play.
Q. Does that feel different than your approach going against Oklahoma?
SONY MICHEL: Not at all, we haves have the same approach, no matter who we are playing.
Q. What's the thing that jumps out to you when watching film on Alabama?
SONY MICHEL: Just they're all-around good players.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Mind-set, we had to have that laser-like focus and be focused on Alabama, just get ready to play a physical game and be ready to execute the game plan.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I'm not sure. How does it help me save myself? I mean, I don't look at it as saving myself, because every chance I get I'm trying to lay it on the line for this team.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No, nothing that happened last week can help affect this game at all. It can only be a distraction to this game. This game is a totally different game. We gotta prepare, get ready to prepare for a good, physical team. It all starts with how we practice.
Q. Kirby came from Alabama, Jeremy Pruitt, their defensive coordinator, obviously came from Georgia. You've got two coaches in this game that basically know every single player out on this field. How unique do you think that is, given their background?
SONY MICHEL: It's kind of expected. It's college football. Coaches are moving around all the time. I'm sure this is not the first time this has happened. I'm sure it happens almost every week where coaches are facing players that they coached. So it's not something we really think about, it is what it is.
Q. How are they different personality wise. You went up against Jeremy's defenses in practice for a couple years. How are they alike and how are they different?
SONY MICHEL: I'm not into comparing their likes and differences. They're both great coaches. Coach Smart is our coach now and he's been doing a tremendous job with this team.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Jake is not worried about proving anybody wrong. That's always going to be the story because somebody needs a story to write. I think he's going to continue to do what he do. Yeah, he's going to make mistakes and yeah he's going to make plays.
Q. How do you sum up what media day is like as a whole with all of these people here, fans all over the place, what is it like for you to be surrounded on this podium?
SONY MICHEL: I feel like a flashing light because my team is down there and I'm up here. Up here -- I gotta be up here with all the lights on me while they are down there so I feel like a blinking light.
Q. Is it a strange feeling?
SONY MICHEL: I mean, it's not strange, it's just a lot of attention that kinda can be a distraction.
Q. What do you have to do to make sure it's not a distraction?
SONY MICHEL: Just gotta get our refocus as soon as we leave this place.
Q. Is your personality like your mom's or dad's?
SONY MICHEL: I think a mixture of both.
Q. Were they athletes?
SONY MICHEL: My dad played soccer, my mom, she is a nonathlete, yeah.
Q. How would you describe SEC football to those who have might be tuning in for the first time around the country and may not be familiar with it?
SONY MICHEL: It's going to be physical. Physicality is the only way to describe SEC football.
Q. Style of play different? Any different than elsewhere around the country?
SONY MICHEL: Yeah, but I think everybody has evolved into being a downhill football team, no matter what conference you're in. Everybody gotta run the ball and pass the ball just to try to be successful so I think all around, every conference is kinda becoming to evolve to be the same.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: There's a lot of pride to know they're from the same conference, from the SEC, what we represent here at the University of Georgia and it's impressive and I'm excited.
Q. This is your last go-round, your last game. How are you taking this?
SONY MICHEL: I'm just trying to take advantage, really, trying to take advantage of this opportunity because it's the last time. Last chance I get with these guys, last chance they get with me. It's the last time this team is every going to play a football game with each other, the same, exact team. I'm excited. I'm taking it all in, and I'm just ready for this game Monday.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It's been a pretty cool relationship. It's been a journey all four years we've been in college we have been playing with each other. We have had ups and downs and we got to experience those times together so I thought it was pretty interesting.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Just making sure we're prepared. Just being in practice and encouraging each other to work on our craft, just going back to the basics and focusing on our specific techniques as a running back.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Just for this team to win a national championship.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Oh, yeah, I mean, we have confidence that we can play with them, but, you know, you always got to respect your opponent.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: We played some great defenses. I mean, of course they're different because they had different players but, you know, they're similar to Auburn.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It's big, just because it's my last time every getting a chance to be in this position in college football. I think our young guys are taking advantage, also, because they know how much hard work it took to get here, so they're going to try to continue this legacy on in the future.
I think they're focusing on this one.
Q. What have you seen out of Alabama's defensive line?
SONY MICHEL: That they're big, guys that can run to the ball well, physical, hold their gaps. I think our offensive line is going to do a great job of trying to --
Q. Is there anyone who stands out to you?
SONY MICHEL: No, nobody, not necessarily. I think they play all-around good football as a team, as a defense. They execute their game plan very well.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, I had a lot of uncharacteristic moments this year. It may not have been a fumble but there was a lot of game to be played so I had to keep moving forward.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: We're prepared for it. Everybody on this team that plays a role, that has a role to play, they're prepared for it. I play special teams. It's something I've been doing since my freshman year so it's nothing new to me.
Q. How big is that for a team? You don't see that with a lot of teams, putting one of their offensive stars on the special teams. How big is that?
SONY MICHEL: To win games you want to have your best athletes on the field. There's a lot of teams that has their stars on special teams.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I think it's pretty interesting how this season played out. I think these guys work hard, fought hard this season, handled a lot of adversity well this season and deserved to be here.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I'm sure it feels wonderful. They always present, no matter what we're doing, obviously. They've been -- they traveled well this season. They've been supportive this season, and I just commend them. I thank those fans out there cheering for the Bulldogs.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Touchdown in overtime? I've seen it a lot. I've seen it watching film, seeing how well everybody executed that play.
Q. How about the block you got from your quarterback?
SONY MICHEL: Yeah. I seen it. He did his job. It was great for him to give that extra effort.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Playing in the national championship game.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: That was the vision, but, you know, at the end of the day we knew it was going to be a long journey so we couldn't be like, have our whole mind-set on a national championship. Our mind-set was to lead this team in the right direction to have a chance to number a national championship.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Just looking back at it? It was destined to be, how everything played out from the decisions made to the work we put in. It was worth it. If we would have made the decision but didn't put in the work it wouldn't have been worth it.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It means a lot to me just to be able to say I have a Rose Bowl win under my belt. That's the ultimate goal.
Q. How did that prepare you for this Monday?
SONY MICHEL: It kinda don't. It's a different game. It's a different environment. You've gotta just -- it's a different opponent. We gotta go back to the drawing boards and prepare for this team differently.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: He's a players' coach. A coach that is very approachable. Anybody on this team can approach him about anything.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I guess it can be. It's going to be talk that SEC is down but having two teams from the SEC in the national championship is pretty unique.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I mean, nationally there's a lot of great teams out there, but, you know, just in the SEC because I'm in the SEC I can speak for them. We play good opponents week in and week out, so it can be tough at times.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Uh-uh.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I didn't hear much about it, just seeing what we were after.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Yeah, just as running backs working hard. It's a pretty cool accomplishment that, you know, we can probably reflect on later in life, but our biggest and best accomplishment is making it to the national championship and making it to this game and hopefully win one.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: He's been getting a lot, you know, with everybody in this running back group competing with each other. He doesn't treat anybody different. I'm sure nobody wants to be treated differently. The best man wins, the best man plays and we all just have fun doing it, have fun competing and having fun playing the game of football and have fun playing with each other.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: It wasn't hard at all, because to play in a national championship game and think about a game that you played already, it's mind blowing. Everybody's goal is to play in a national championship so why would you think about any other game?
Q. What's it like as a running back to go against a physical front like that? Do you think about it differently given the personnel you are going up against?
SONY MICHEL: Our mind-set is every game is the same. We expect to play four quarters of physical football every game. To know that this team has the same mind-set it's going to be fun. We're looking forward to the challenge. As a running back, I'm excited to play against an elite defense.
Q. You and Nick have a unique relationship. A lot of running backs don't share the ball as much as you do. What is your relationship with Nick and what does it mean to you?
SONY MICHEL: It's pretty unique just to have somebody to compete with. Just to have somebody there to, you know, to make sure you are on your toes, you know? At the end of the day I got his back, he got my back, just like any teammate out there that's on this team. We play for each other and we play for the University of Georgia. It's not really about trying to outshine one another, it's about trying to get wins.
Q. They will play a lot of running backs, does that make it nice to know that you can play a stabling of running backs? Is it good to know that you have a deep stable you can turn to in a game like this?
SONY MICHEL: Yeah, all of our backs are going to be ready and prepared to play on Monday, and to give the opportunity that everybody gets a chance to play is going to be exciting.
Q. It's unique that you comeback to Atlanta for this game and there are hundreds of Georgia fans in this area. Is it great to be in front of a "home crowd" for Monday night?
SONY MICHEL: It's pretty cool to be in front of a home crowd. Most of the time when we are away it feels like we are in front every a home crowd. But it means something to me and means something to this team to be able to play in front of our fans.
Q. The fans have been watching the touchdown you scored in overtime over and over again. Have you allowed yourself to enjoy that at all this week?
SONY MICHEL: I've seen it. I seen it over and over on social media, not necessarily on TV, but it was just pretty cool to see the way the game ended.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: Um, I don't know. He likes to have fun and likes to laugh, really. He is probably very quiet and probably quiet over there. He just like to have fun. He's not too much of a person that likes so much attention. He just likes to enjoy himself.
Q. Talk about your music and talk about what you listen to going into a game?
SONY MICHEL: I don't have any specific hype song. I kinda just have a playlist of music and whatever it shuffles through I'm probably going to listen to it.
Q. Any freestyle in you for the national championship game?
SONY MICHEL: No, I don't have no freestyle in me.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I don't remember because I try not to acknowledge those situations. I don't try to bring up those situations.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: No, I mean, everybody was just encouraging. We had so much football to play. Everybody have my back, I knew my teammates have my back, just like I got their back. It was not something that, you know, that was going to break this team. Everybody was just kinda -- kept their heads up and kept playing football.
Q. In that moment, though, you must have felt disappointed in yourself? Or did you forget about it and move on?
SONY MICHEL: As soon as the play was over I forgot about it because there is nothing I could have done to change that.
Q. (No microphone.)
SONY MICHEL: I got it from one of my old teammates, Keith Marshall. He told me about it. He told me he was going to do it, and I made a play my freshman year on special teams and that was the first thing that came to my mind was just to do that.
Q. You guys have a lot of your best players playing on special teams. How important is it to the identity of the program. Obviously it impacted the Rose Bowl. Some coaches say it's equal to offense and defense but you guys actually seem to treat it special.
SONY MICHEL: Special teams is very important to this team, very important to being able to win games so to not have your best players on special teams is almost like you're not trying to win.
