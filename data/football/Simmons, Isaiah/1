 Q.  What stands out when you watch Joe Barrow in the pocket hit his receivers? What stands out to you when you watch him on tape?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He doesn't have very many flaws in his game. Everything he does he does it with precision. Very good with his legs. And obviously his arm, he's amazing as well. Just his ability to extend plays and also his poise in the pocket is really great.   
 Q.  You have one of the best quarterbacks in America going against him every day to prepare for a quarterback like Joe Barrow?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yes, helps but at the same time two completely different quarterbacks. It's hard to prepare.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: In football now I feel like that's the name of the game. If you look even in the NFL, all the quarterbacks that are able to extend plays are the ones that are the most successful, like the Deshauns and Mahomes and Jackson. So I feel like now being a quarterback (inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, it's a lot more harder now.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It was really hard. I always played a bunch of different positions, but it would be offense/defense-wise. But just being able to do it in college has been something(inaudible). I never really wanted to limit myself to one position if I could (inaudible). So it's a challenge for me each week having to learn everything. But it's something that I enjoy.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I believe we have more, like, eye to eye. I think I can do anything. I think he agrees with me as well. It's mostly him putting everything on my plate and seeing what I can do and maybe not the things that I'm not as good at, more than just us communicating on what I can do and can't do. Always test it out to, see how it goes.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I love rushing the quarterback, but I like coverage as well. I don't think I have a favorite.   
 Q.  Barrow -- watching him, (inaudible) shredding the defense?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: They're a really, really explosive offense that can beat you in any kind of way. The main thing I think about when I watched that game is just you have to play your A game when you play them. Just a little mistake, small mistake maybe wouldn't be a factor in a different game, like a regular season game, it can be the game winning play in this game. You never know.   
That's probably the main thing is just like a little small mistake could be a touchdown.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, maybe it was against Auburn or Mississippi State. He stepped up in the pocket and made a jump like on the money. It was great though. (Inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: The size, making sure Joe doesn't run and the receivers are covered up. You also have to account for the running backs. A lot of teams don't really feature the running backs in the pass game too much. So gotta make sure he's covered.   
 Q.  You're obviously one of the leading Tigers. You're playing the Tigers. Probably know a lot about Tigers. I want to ask you about specific Tigers. Ready for Tiger trivia?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Don't know much about them.   
 Q.  Which Tiger was recently given a bowl game named after him -- Tony the Tiger, the Clemson Tigers or LSU Tigers?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Probably the bowl game, Tony and the frosted flakes. I'm going to go with Tony.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: We're in enemy territory here. Everybody here is an LSU fan.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: My last game was a road game. It was like, 70-30, Ohio State, Clemson. I'm sure this one will be worse, I would assume. We're in Louisiana.   
So -- this one is a little bit different, though, because it's like almost like we're in another country. Everyone here is LSU. There's not really many of us. But I would definitely say it's like a road game, most definitely.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah. On defense we call it a road dog mentality. You've got to bring a completely different game to it -- not anything special necessarily but just a different mindset. It's just like we always do like Rocky comparisons on our team. It's like when Rocky fought Drago. I guess we're in Russia.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He's a quarterback with very little flaws in his game. He's human, of course. He messes up at times. But he can beat you anyway you want it. You name it, he can probably do it.   
His ability to extend plays with his legs and his accuracy on the run and his poise in the pocket and his decision-making. He's a really smart quarterback. Better bring your A game when you play him.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Definitely, you always want to affect the quarterback in any game you play, no matter who you're playing. I wouldn't say it starts there, but that's definitely the thing in every single game we play. (Indiscernible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It's good for preparation but I'm so antsy to play. I hate just sitting around waiting to play. But time's here now. I wouldn't really say I like the extra time, honestly.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah. I graduated. So I haven't really had nothing to do. I've been all good.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: We know what we're here for. This is not a bowl game. We had our bowl experience in Arizona where you can go out, have fun, do fun things. We're here for business this time.   
We've got an early curfew. Everybody is okay with it. We actually wanted the early curfew. There's not really much more that needs to be said, I don't think. This is just straight business. It's not a bowl experience. That's the best way I can put it.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I mean, Joe Burrow stands out a lot. Everybody knows how great of a quarterback he is. I don't think I need to say anything more. Great receivers, great running back. They can beat you in many ways. So really good offensive line, experienced guys. Big, strong guys. They won the award, huge trophy. They just have a great offense as a whole going down the list.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I wouldn't call it intimidated, but it's a challenge. I wouldn't say I'm scared. Don't ever want to play scared. But it's a challenge just being able to do, to stop the things that they do.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Different feelings, different like (inaudible) feelings at all. But previously in my career I don't really have any sacks. I really enjoy getting sacks. I feel like they're special. But interceptions, they're special, too, because they don't come along too much either. So I'll stay with interceptions.   
 Q.  (Question about LSU and the backfield)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Got to fit your gaps. He can run a long ways. Or also just like his route running is great, his vision is great. Smart guy. He's like a receiver. He has a receiver's skill set, but running back (indiscernible). Pretty special.   
 Q.  Everybody talks about how accurate he is. What do you see from his ability to scramble (inaudible)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, he extends a lot of plays with his legs which is great for any quarterback to be able to do. The way he does it is really special. His accuracy on the run is very good. That's the main thing because he's a guy who may not strike you as being fast but he's actually a really, really great runner.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Run our plays correctly.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think my role is just as important as anybody else's. If our end doesn't do the right thing, if our plays don't go right, I think it goes for every position on defense. And I wouldn't say mine is more important than anybody's. It's all the same.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, absolutely. I love the challenge. Each and every week that team brings you a different challenge, and I just accept whatever it is and try to overcome it and conquer it. So I'm looking forward to being able to -- I guess (inaudible) the air raid offense because we've always had a thing where our DBs were not very good, our weakness. So it's going to be good to see how we match up, just everybody across the board.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Ever since I've been at Clemson that's how it's been. We always get the, "We don't play anybody," this and that. But I feel like we do pretty good when we get these games where we (indiscernible) somebody and be able to say it.   
And at the end of the day everybody puts on their cleats and jerseys and helmets the same as everybody else. So you can say we don't play anybody and make that a factor of what you said, but, I don't know, that doesn't really bother us; we're used to being that team.   
It's funny because there's an article that was like how 13-0 Clemson team wouldn't make the playoffs. So people don't really want (indiscernible) anyways. So we get used to it. We're like the red-headed stepchild in other groups. There's nothing wrong with it with me.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Of course, it helps you prepare if you're going against great competition in practice, but I would say our main thing would be from just like being here before. We know what we have to do mentally, physically, with nutrition, just taking care of your body, rehab, rehab, things like that.   
(Indiscernible) that's probably the biggest advantage, it's more than that. Because they have great players (indiscernible) as well. Those go hand in hand?   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He actually said it before I could say it to him. So, it was great, me and him are on the same page. (Indiscernible).   
I feel like it was the best thing for me and the team as a whole just because we're so deep at safety. We play four safeties a game now. And all those guys were still there when I made my switch. So, I feel like it was very beneficial and I don't regret it at all.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I wasn't really too knowledgeable on like the D line stunts and the things that they do. So now just knowing all that, how everybody fits in the run game, I think that really helped elevate my game because I know what everyone does.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think the question is more like where do they not challenge you. They can run the ball. They can throw the ball anywhere to -- from their tight end to all their receivers, their running back; Joe can run it. I think it's, like, where do they not challenge you versus where is the challenge.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It's funny because (indiscernible) came up to me and said, you've got the look on your face. And I was, like, I ain't making no plays, but I'm still doing my job.   
So sometimes when you're a football player you've got to learn that you can be the guy making the play even if you're not physically making the play. And just keeping that mindset and seeing my teammates eat.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I was just like anxious to make a play. (Inaudible) not trying to do too much. If you try to do too much you gonna get beat.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He was just telling me to relax, it was going to come to me. Nothing I could do.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, more and more as the game went along I felt like I started getting more action, started to get some tackles and pressures. And then I got (inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Absolutely.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I felt like we had a football team (indiscernible) in America, and now (indiscernible) in the country. No one here is on our side. I think that's very obvious. It's like we're in a different country because I mean we're in their home state. (Inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, I played it my whole life. Nothing's different now. So I'm just going to keep doing what I do.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, it's a challenge we're definitely going to accept. They're the most efficient offense but we're the most efficient defense. So it's going to be a challenge. Just like how they can beat you in any kind of ways is really what the main challenge is. It will be great to see how we match up against them.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Statistically, I'm really not sure. But I mean they're a completely different team. So I don't want to compare.   
 Q.  (Question about culture)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Culture, best way to put it. We're not teammates. We're brothers. We have a great culture, a loving culture. Best is the standard. That's the standard we live by there. Trying to do everything the best way we can (inaudible).   
So really big family atmosphere everywhere you go regardless of the people on the team, just staff members at the university, just regular students, everybody, just like a big family there.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: (Indiscernible) year at Clemson. And I think this is my second Heisman winner that I'm playing. The other quarterback was Lamar Jackson. And it's crazy how different they are, but it's also how big of a challenge it is. So I'm excited.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: How smart he is. His decision-making, his poise in the pocket. His ability to scramble, accuracy on the run. I could go on and on down the list, but he doesn't really have any flaws in his game. That's probably the biggest thing.   
 Q.  (Question about high school and dominating).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I feel like we do a lot of things. He's so smart at what he does that I feel like at times he thinks like an offensive coordinator more than the defensive coordinator, I feel that's the best way to describe it.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I feel like it shouldn't be any other way. I'm not a fan when I see a high scoring game. It's just a good challenge to both of us on both sides.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: How much they feature him in the run game. I like to think of it as a running back on the (indiscernible), and also a running back's skill set. (Inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Trevor, he's a really mature guy. And I know he was going to do whatever was best for the team, best for him as well. And when that happened, I wasn't really worried. I had a lot of faith in Chase Brice as well. He came in and won the game for us before. So things like that happen in football. I just like to control what I can control.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think this is almost like worse than an away game. It's like we're in another country. Everybody here is an LSU fan. We probably won't -- we'll have some fans. Our fans travel. But I'm sure that LSU people bought up all the tickets. It's definitely like an away game in another country.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: We just turn the music up extra loud just, like, so we can deal with the noise, honestly. But on defense I don't really have to worry about that because they're going to be quiet for their offense. But offensively, on their side of the field, they have the music up real loud to give them noise. (Inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Personally, I feel like I can play any position, even though I'm not built like a D tackle or anything. But in my mind I think I can play any position. It's really more just taking on the individual aspects of the game. I don't know if that answers your question.   
 Q.  (Question about keys to winning)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think about 15 (inaudible) whatever. They're probably happy to see a matchup on a linebacker.   
 Q.  (Question about describing LSU)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: They're all elite players. They make a lot of really big plays, every single one of them. And I would say a huge piece of the puzzle is their offense.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I feel they really use everybody a lot. I can't really differentiate or pick apart which ones are more --   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: We're in their home state. So, yeah.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I kind of like it. It's like us against the world. That's kind of how it's been all year. People didn't want us to make it, I think, from all the talk. But I personally enjoy it -- just everybody against us.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I've always wanted to play LSU just being here throughout my years. But I think it's more, like, it's kind of funny, same mascots, everything.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I can rush the passer. I can play man coverage, zone coverage. I think that's really everything. But fit the run.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I've spotted him a couple games, yes.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: If you ask me, I think I can do everything, but that might not be true. It might not be true. Mentally that's just how I think. So, yeah.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I get that question asked a lot. His ability to scramble especially on the run. His poise in the pocket and just his ability to extend plays. His decision-making, he's just a really, really smart guy with a great athletic ability. And when you get that, you get a great quarterback, or a great athlete, whatever.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: You see a lot of people miss a lot of tackles on him. Instantly I was like -- I saw how big he is because I met him in person and everything, but he's a strong guy. You can obviously see he's real strong, has a real strong base.   
A lot of people just -- from safeties to D linemen. So I think people really like sleep on that. He's a big, strong guy. To me he looks like he's hard to take down.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: People running free. It's like he doesn't even see them and he still stays up, throws them off, whatever it is.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Real tough. He's a quarterback that protects himself. But he'll also get some dirty yards too. That's really good to see (indiscernible).   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I have no idea.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: They've both been talked up to be the best offenses ever. So however you want to compare them is how you can. I kind of just look at the little things that they do.   
 Q.  You guys fared pretty well last year.  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think we did all right. Not too bad.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I like that I get to do everything -- blitz, play man, drop in the zone. I feel like it's like a dream position. They let me do everything. Yeah, there's always like the offensive lineman that gets to run the ball. I'm the guy on defense that gets to do everything, you know. It's really nice.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think either Michigan or Nebraska.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah. When I took my visit here, took my visit to Clemson, (indiscernible) this is where I want to be. It had everything I valued, education-wise. Our graduation rate is crazy. I think you can count on two hands the amount of people, the amount of four-year seniors that haven't graduated.   
Obviously there's guys that go three and out. Coach Swinney is a man of faith. That was a really big for me.   
And then the football there, that was the last thing to worry about. The football and the culture, everything was amazing. Everything I wanted in a program.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, I feel like the message in high school (inaudible) didn't matter at all. (Inaudible) on campus (inaudible) I didn't really go to (inaudible) the (inaudible) stars mean nothing to me. I mean, when you have guys like Hunter Renfrow -- I don't think he had any stars and he starts for the Raiders.   
(Inaudible) and I could keep going on down the list. Even Travis. Travis is a big, strong guy. Look at him now. Stars don't really mean anything, I don't think, because when you get there, like you're not going to get a starting job just because you're a 5-star. You've got to work at it. Stars don't mean anything.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It was actually really hard because I'm used to being like that guy. I'm used to always playing, being one of the best players on the field. And when I got there, it just wasn't right. It wasn't right for me to play here.   
Coach Venables wanted me to -- and Coach Swinney (indiscernible) redshirt. At first it was really hard for me, not being able to play games and everything. But I think it worked out for the best. I think I became a better student of the game and (indiscernible).   
 Q.  (Indiscernible) your defensive coordinator, is he the best guy out there?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I mean, I do think he's the best. But there's like -- the way he thinks, it's like how do you even think of things like that? I don't know. He's so creative at what he does. I feel like he thinks more like a offensive coordinator more than the defense.   
 Q.  When you go up against an offense how much motivation -- (indiscernible)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It's just like a great challenge. They're the most efficient offense. And hopefully we can just, like, limit their scoring, slow down their scoring and give ourselves a shot in the fourth quarter.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: (Indiscernible) don't talk to him.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, he's the second Heisman I've played before. Both of them have brought a great challenge to the game. I'm excited.   
 Q.  (Question about pass coverage)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I don't know. I play a lot of man.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I have to be on my A game. He's a really good receiver. Probably make as little mistakes as I possibly can.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He's intense at all times. (Inaudible) everything. He's a perfectionist. He puts so much stress on that at game time. (Indiscernible) how it feels. Really, really intense at all times.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He was the first person I met, actually. He came to see me at my high school. I could tell he had a ton of energy and he hasn't lost a bit of it.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: He's our scout team quarterback. So he does like a lot of (inaudible) things, sometimes he'll keep running, stiff arm us, do whatever.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: So like a lot of times he'll scramble out. He's done this a couple times this year. He'll scramble out with the ball. And then he'll run, do some, like, crazy throw.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: No one's ever tackled him to the ground. I think Tristan, Tristan tackled him to the ground.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: We just go so fast. (Indiscernible) to tackle.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: My theory, I don't know. I don't know. My role is no bigger than anybody else's. So, really, I just want to do my 1/11th in this game, just my (indiscernible).   
I just want -- my goal for this game, (indiscernible) the win, not to prove anybody wrong, but just to play my best that I've put together all season. And I feel with that, bring the energy to the team and defense to where we're all (indiscernible). I don't know. I guess nothing's really changed.   
 Q.  I believe that you guys have to play some man coverage (inaudible) third down to allow you to get to the quarterback. Which offensive player at LSU -- (inaudible)?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Yeah, I don't know. I'm really looking forward to all of them because they all bring like a different challenge. They've got a big physical tight end, Ja'Marr, obviously everybody knows what he can do; Jefferson, they know what he can do. (Indiscernible), what he can do.   
So I don't know. They've all got like a little different game to them. So I'm really excited to play each and every one of them honestly. I don't know anybody more than (inaudible).   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I feel that's what gets them going, makes his blood flow. He's so passionate about this, just everything he does, he does it with a passion.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Very unique team.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Hopefully give ourselves a shot.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Just like the preparation and things, just like our experience throughout the years of us being here helps us with the little things, like the mental aspect. You don't want to overload yourself and mentally drain yourself physically -- rehab, (indiscernible), things like that.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I don't think the attention is better. Nobody expected us to be here. We get that a little. We haven't played anyone kind of thing. I don't feel like we've had any pressure. Nobody expected us to come back here and go back to back. So I feel like we really just haven't had any pressure.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Nobody was really down or doubted each other, thinking that we wouldn't be able to come back. But we weren't expecting to win that game either, so just have to play smart.   
 Q.  You are the underdog?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Like I said, nobody expects us to win. It was something like 93 percent of the bets were LSU. So nobody expects us to win. So we don't have no pressure. So we're all pretty much excited about playing.   
 Q.  What about Dabo and his program cause you guys to be so much more successful?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think it's the culture he's instilled with us. We're more about doing things the right way. Just about that mainly.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It was bad news. Barely say anything about it, I guess. That's what everybody says. Probably the biggest thing. But I guess since we beat everybody, they say we don't play anybody. But like LSU beat everybody, too. Ohio State beat everybody. So --   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Them saying that, it means nothing at all. The people writing that or saying it on TV, like, they're not -- they don't practice with us. They don't practice with LSU. They don't practice with Ohio State, Oklahoma. They don't -- none of them -- they don't practice or anything. The media, it doesn't mean much to us. Can't pay attention to that. You get caught up in that, then you worry about the wrong things.   
You bring a skill set to -- got to play your A game, that's probably the best I can put it, obviously.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: If you don't come with it, then he's obviously going to beat you, you know what I mean?   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: It's a blessing that I got to play. But I'm really excited. I'm really excited for this challenge, with the receivers, quarterback, the running back, all season. So it's going to be a fun game.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: This is my third National Championship Media Day. This one's different for me because now I'm on stage and I've got me a Dr Pepper. When I'm on the stage, I'm sitting around.   
 Q.  (Question off mic). The way you play and the different positions, the athleticism, how do you look at the two?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Obviously the challenge is crazy because nobody's been able to do it. So I would like to believe that I would be able to. I'm going to try to do what I do and shut it down. That's the biggest thing.   
 Q.  How do you describe them?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Being explosive. I think that's the only way to describe it. You see what they do to everybody each and every week. So just the challenge they bring from every single receiver to the tight end, running back, Joe, you might (inaudible) coverage down, 15, 20, just being able to really cover the whole field, including the running back, because a lot of teams don't feature their running backs.   
From Joe's running ability, gotta cover the whole field. Yes, absolutely.   
 Q.  (Question off mic).  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Never seen them like this, but when it comes this time of the year he's always really, really intense. So it's been a year since we've had him like this.   
 Q.  What does this moment mean to you?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: This moment is really special, being a kid from Kansas, I'm kind of like the hometown there. We kind of get overlooked in football. But it's really, really special. My dad always gets real emotional at times like this. He always says how proud he is of me. But it's really, really special and I'm glad my family gets an opportunity to come here and see it. Essentially my last game.   
 Q.  What's your greatest college moment?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: Man, I would probably say my first start. Either that or senior day. My first start, it was just crazy because growing up, playing a team like Clemson, this is like a dream come true playing for a time like this, and just senior day, coming so far and just moving -- (inaudible) just rolling through and (inaudible) and how emotional that time was just like all the bonds that we had, just the friendships that I'll have forever.   
 Q.  (Question off mic). What are the typical questions that get Dabo fired up?  
ISAIAH SIMMONS: I think the main thing that fires him up is we don't know anything, I think that gets him really going, when people doubt us, kind of like the questions like that, that really gets him going. He comes into a team meeting, you can tell something --   
He really likes to get out what he has to say, regardless if you're talking or not. So I think in this clip he's making his point right now. He likes to put exclamation on things, I think that's what he's doing right now, dropping a mic and walk off.
