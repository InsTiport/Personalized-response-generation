Notre Dame - 28, Wake Forest - 7

DAVE CLAWSON: Obviously we're disappointed.  We outplayed them, we outgamed them, we had the ball longer.  But we beat ourselves.  We had a pick six.  We gave up a 98-yard touchdown run that we had two guys miss a tackle.  We had the ball twice on the 1 yard line and came away without any points.  You know, we had a personal foul in the end zone before the half, which takes at least three points off the board.  You know, we catch a punt inside the 10-yard line, our first possession starts with us on the goal and the 5.  Those are things that I'd say well-coached football teams don't do, and we didn't -- Notre Dame is a very good football team.  They don't need our help, and we gave them a lot of help tonight.
