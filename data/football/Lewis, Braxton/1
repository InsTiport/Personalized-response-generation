Q. A couple times in that third quarter, you guys made them take 15, 16 plays to do it. What did you think of the effort of the defense today?
BRAXTON LEWIS: You know, it was relentless, and I think that's a reflection of who we are and the culture we've developed. Like you said, making a team drive it all the way down the field is really hard, and that's what gives us the opportunity to play good defense.
Q. Because the offense had a couple quick-strike drives, one-play touchdown drive, two-play touchdown drive, I think you guys were on the field for 30 more plays, how were you able to stay fresh? Is it just another continuation of showing that depth?
BRAXTON LEWIS: Yeah, and that's what it is, showing the depth. We had a lot of guys step up today. Tayvonn Kyle played his butt off, made a ton of tackles, made some good coverage plays. You have DJ, young safety, stepping in, all those young guys being able to rotate in helps us out in the secondary, and along with the D-line and linebackers, as well.
Q. Braxton, what has changed from being stuck 20-zip at Baylor to today?
BRAXTON LEWIS: You know, just playing as a team. I think we played a lot more team football today. When the defense does good, the offense does good. When the offense does good, the defense does good, and it's a reflection of how the game turns out, our character and who we are.
Q. What is there still to do defensively for you guys? What didn't go right today?
BRAXTON LEWIS: Just came down to the little details. Obviously they made some plays on both sides of the ball, and that's where we're going to win is in those margins. Being able to work on those, perfect those and really grow in that area will help us out a lot.
