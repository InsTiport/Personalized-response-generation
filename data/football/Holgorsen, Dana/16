 SYRACUSE   38
  WEST VIRGINIA - 14 
   
 Q.   Your thoughts?   
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Yeah, discouraging.   There were some times out there I thought we were playing pretty good defense, but you know‑‑ tricky, over and over and over again and we run the same play and we didn't have the same success that they did.   You know, any time you get out‑rushed by 300 yards, you're going to have some problems.   
   
 Q.   What effect did the weather have?   
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Obviously it had some effect.   You know, they didn't throw for many yards, either.   It's hard to pinpoint one thing I think.   Did a poor job of overcoming adversity and there was a lot of adversity and we did a poor job of it.   
The surface was not good.   It was sloppy out there and it was wet.   You know, you can't just sit there and pinpoint‑‑ the O‑line had a hard time of sitting down and receivers had a hard time running outs.   It didn't look very good.   The team with the best running game is going to win and they clearly had the better running game.   
   
 Q.   With the weather‑‑  
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Yeah, he felt better getting underneath, just because the ball was wet and he was a little bit more comfortable with Braun underneath.   That was not the game plan going in.   We were going to do probably a little bit more of it.   I just tried to hard‑count him some.   
But as the game went on, he just started feeling a little bit more comfortable with it.   We took care of the ball.   We have all year; we had one turnover tonight that I can remember, but that one was a bang‑bang play that was called the other way.   
We did a good job of with ball security and the one thing about what we have done all year is we have done a good job of that.   He just felt more comfortable.   
   
 Q.   Being coaches are always on the sidelines trying to find the adjustments and an answer, how is it with the same play over and over again, standing on the sideline after a high school football game in a lot of ways where a play they are going to keep running over and over; how tough is it for to you stand there and watch?     
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Pretty frustrating, they were kind of trying to mix up their calls, try to out‑gap in some situations, but they just did a better job with us on the line of scrimmage.   
And the one thing about what we have been able to do all year defensively is be able to control the line of scrimmage.   Our pass defense was bad but our run defense was okay.   Being a game like this where you have to have to rely on your run defense to help you win and you're not able to do it, it's pretty frustrating.   
I give Syracuse credit.   They did a better job of controlling the line of scrimmage and they did a better job of running downhill.  
   
 Q.   After the way you guys started, what do you take away from what's happened since week five in terms of going into next year?   
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Well, a lot.   We'll evaluate everything and see where we are at.   We are in a new position.   This is new to us.   And Syracuse was not new to us, but the conference was new to us.   We are going to learn a lot more about what happened in the Big12 this year.   Moving on from here, it's a little bit more about that than this Bowl game playing against Syracuse.   
We have to re‑evaluate a lot of things in our program to see what we have to do to get better to compete in the Big12.   
   
 Q.   Syracuse looks like they recovered outside‑‑ really effectively.   Trying to counter that and get the ball down the field a couple of times and the incompletions, was the weather doing that, or did you have something else to counter what they were taking away from you?  
COACH HOLGORSEN:   I don't know if I understand the question.   I mean, a lot of the stuff that we did tonight didn't work.   You know y is that?   Probably a lot of different variables, and I can't sit here and pinpoint one person or one thing.     
All of a sudden our scheme is not very good or any of that.   We just did a poor job of executing, which is overcoming adversity, which is what separates a good defense from a great defense.   They were motivated to play.   The bottom line is, our team didn't overcome a lot of things and didn't do enough to stay in the game.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a hold on Clay, and what did the refs tell you?   
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Yeah, not going to commenton that.   It all falls into one category.   I mean, you get behind the chains, you get calls, you get called back, you have to keep continuing to play and we did a poor job of overcoming.   
   
 Q.   Following up on an earlier answer, you mentioned reevaluating a lot of the program moving into next season and being able to compete in the Big12, are there any immediate things that you can recognize right away that need to improve heading into the off‑season?   
COACH HOLGORSEN:   I'm not going to discuss them now.   Our seniors‑‑ each and every one of them, those guys have overcome a lot.   
They overcame coaching changes and they overcame conference changes and they mean a lot to me and the coaching staff and we appreciate what they have done and they always come back from a program that we are going to take a couple of days off, start recruiting which is going to eat up about 90 percent of our time, 95 percent of our time over the next month and then we'll have some time to get back and start working on 2013.   
   
 Q.   Opening up in the third quarter, you guys are in it, despite some errors, were you okay, or did you think you left some points out there in the first quarter, first half?  
COACH HOLGORSEN:   Well, definitely, we did.   We had one touchdown in the first half, and the conditions weren't good, but that doesn't mean we can't move the ball and be successful, and we were.   A lot of the things, what were the reasons for that, there's a bunch of different reasons.   We didn't do enough offensively to put ourselves in position to be okay in the first half.   Did we leave a lot out there, yeah.   
In the second half, they offensively in the second half did what we expected to do for four quarters and we just didn't do it.
