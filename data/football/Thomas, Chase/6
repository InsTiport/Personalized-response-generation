Q.   Have you used the collective intelligence on this team? 
CHASE THOMAS:   I definitely think our defense is pretty sophisticated for the college level.   I guess it shows how much faith our coaches have in us as players.   We know that we can understand it and we can grasp the concept of each scheme. 
I think we have over eight different coverages over the years.   We have various amounts of blitzes and stuff up front.   Being a student at Stanford, I definitely‑‑ the coaches realize what kind of players they have and know that we can handle all the information. 

Q.   Do you remember something way back in the fall that just really kicked your butt? 
CHASE THOMAS:   My computer science class I took, intro to computer science and this perception class I took this last quarter are probably the two hardest classes I have taken at Stanford, just because the perception class was with great depth about the eye and neurons and stuff like that.   I wasn't really expecting all of that.

Q.   You have a bunch of smart kids on that campus obviously.   Chelsea Clinton went there.   Is it your perception of it that if you walk around as a football player on that campus, that it is at different than a state U? 
CHASE THOMAS:   It is definitely different.   No question about that.   Andrew can walk in a classroom, no one will notice him.   That just shows how much‑‑ I mean, that's not to say football is not important at Stanford.   Our fans have been great there year. 
Everyone at the school has their own thing that they are incredible at.   It doesn't have to be sports.   My freshman roommate made apps for the iPhone.
