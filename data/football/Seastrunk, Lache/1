		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   Thoughts going into the game?
LACHE SEASTRUNK:   You got to be poised, focused and confident, not take nobody lightly. 

Q.   What is your impression of the UCF team?
LACHE SEASTRUNK:   They got a great defense.   That's going to be the toughest thing, not going to sleep when you're running with the ball, make sure it's tucked away.   Anybody can tuck it out. 
We have to keep our eyes and ears open.
