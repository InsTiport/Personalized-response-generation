 Q.  I know you guys have faced some big ones in the Big 12.  What do you see on film?  
K.J. SMITH: Yeah, they're big guys, especially their right tackle is a good-sized guy playing tackle out there.  Mainly the difference, the biggest part is about the tight ends and the extra guy they have at the end of the line and the shifts they do is the biggest part we've got to get ready for.   
 Q.  Playing a Group of Five team, and you guys in the Big 12, what's the thought when you heard you were going to play against Boise State?  You played Oklahoma and Texas and big schools.  Playing a team from a smaller conference, what was your thought when you heard you were going to play Boise State?  
K.J. SMITH: Nothing.  Face our opponent each week, prepare like we do for every team.  It's just the biggest challenge was the shifts and things like that and just getting lined up and knowing your assignment, basically just learning about we've got to face a new team we don't see on a regular basis.  So just getting ready and being prepared.   
 Q.  What about the quarterback, what have you seen on him?  
K.J. SMITH: He sits in the pocket likes and to throw the ball.  Doesn't scramble too often.  So that's what we've seen.   
 Q.  They're nine points being undefeated.  What type of challenges -- you've played good teams, how do you think Boise State fits into some of the opponents you've played this year?  
K.J. SMITH: It's something you've never seen before.  A lot of shifts, a lot of motions, a lot of different formations.  You've just got to be on point and know what you're doing at all times and getting lined up and being quick with it and staying true to your technique.   
 Q.  Who are the teams that Boise State lost to this year?  
K.J. SMITH: Boise State lost to?  They lost to Wyoming.  I don't know the other one.   
 Q.  What is a potato?  Is it a fruit, vegetable, fungus or a weed?  
K.J. SMITH: It's a root.  So I'm guessing it's a vegetable.   
 Q.  That's right.  And then Idaho potatoes, they grow in the ground, on a bush or on a vine?  
K.J. SMITH: It's a root so it's got to grow in the ground.   
 Q.  What is the capital of Idaho?  
K.J. SMITH: I don't know that one.  I couldn't even guess on that one.   
 Q.  Who is the head coach of Boise State?  
K.J. SMITH: I don't know that one either.   
 Q.  What are the borders of Idaho, what states border the state of Idaho?  
K.J. SMITH: Wyoming.   
 Q.  That's one.
