Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Quarterback that's going to distribute the ball.   I know we played a lot in the Pac 12 but it's something about that team and the fight in them, so that's what I think it really is. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   No, they put him all over the place, X, Y, and then slot and at the third receiver in that slot, motion him around a lot.   They do a lot with them and they try to get him the ball because he's a playmaker so I feel like that's how we have to key in on him, and O'Leary, I feel that's what we really need to work on. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   We just got to be able to recognize it and account for him and tell our linebackers if he's in the slot we got your back and if he's in the receiver we got to help each other, too, so that's what really affects us because we have to understand the match‑ups that he goes into that slot or that third receiver, that's the biggest thing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Um, I mean, it's not really the game, we talked about it in spring ball, what we wanted to do, and we had a plan and the seniors came out and they said they wanted us to come out and play physical and be a dominant defense and we had that understanding.   We made our mistakes early on in the season and we wasn't playin' full, complete games and Coach started kinda harping on that, "Y'all not playin' these games complete."   We need to play perfect games, we were makin' a lot of mental mistakes so I would probably say later in that Michigan State game early on we wasn't playing our game and we came out in the second half and tried to step it up, and things like that, and that's when I really felt like he put an emphasis on, we got to play complete games, and things like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Man, that was hard!   That's our brother.   That's family, especially in that secondary.   He's our leader, our brother, you know what I'm sayin'?   It was hard but after the surgery we went all in and talked to him and he had a strong head and he soothed us and let us know he's going to be all right and he's going to be right here with us and I'm sure he will be eventually with us here, his work ethics, based on his mark he showed us the way throughout the whole season throughout his four years here so I mean we just gotta keep it going, so his present skill is with us really. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, we just got that whole next man up mentality and now it's the next man up.   So you get your opportunity, just excel in that opportunity and I feel like Seisay and Dior they're going to rise to the occasion. 

Q.   Is that something they try to teach you from the moment you get on the field is the next man up thing? 
TROY HILL:   Yeah, as a player, you know, you never know when your time is comin' and they always harp on that, you never know, so you got to prepare yourself and be ready for your time because you never know.   You look back at it, we have quarterbacks go down in the past, when I wasn't here and they always had somebody come up and injuries happen to like Pharaoh and now Ifo so we always got to be ready. 

Q.   You must have a list of guys that have gone down.   You've lost so many good players. 
TROY HILL:   I mean, I feel like as our team we rally around each other.   When we understand one person get hurt in there, everybody else has to step up and bring that game, especially a player like Ifo, everybody on the defense know we got to bring our game to the next level so I feel like that help us out a lot. 

Q.   You said Ifo soothed you guys, what was he saying? 
TROY HILL:   Just the words, "I'm going to be all right."   Because when you think about it, protected first round, you never want to see that happen, that's our leader, especially coming into a big game and we was just talking to him and he was like, "man, I'm going to be all right, you guys are going to be all right," we just got to work hard, and I know personally Ifo was a hard worker and one thing that got me is he told me, I got to work harder and I don't feel like I worked hard enough to this point so we all got to work harder, and if you going to work hard to get healthy, we all got to work hard.

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   And me personally, seeing him on the practice field, seeing him work in the summertime, I know his mind‑set and how his grind is, too. 

Q.   Is that in the back of your mind in practice? 
TROY HILL:   Sometimes, because you ‑‑ he puts that leadership in and I know how he workin' and I'm going to have to work as hard as him and push the younger guys that's going to be able to step up in his role to do that, too, so that's what me and Dargan are trying to do out here. 

Q. (No microphone.)   An offense like that?   What is the similar offense you have faced to Florida State or Jameis? 
TROY HILL:   He's a winner, no matter what they do or how many interceptions he throw he's always in the game and there are athletes all over the field that pose a threat no matter what.   If you mess up in a line they got playmakers that can make big plays at any time and I don't think we've seen an offense like that, because of the amount of athletes they got out on the field that's kind of separating them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I feel like he's a good route runner, he's a great route runner and he can separate you and make the big plays and finish. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Just because the time that he understand where his quarterback wanted him to be, him and Jameis Winston from what I seen on film they got that connection and Jameis understand how he going to do it, so I feel like that's what makes it difficult because he's cut some things.   You can't never look in the backfield and see one move because he can cut on you and make it harder. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, a lot of people‑‑ yeah, a lot of people don't understand.   We look at them as veterans now, just this late in the season, they have all that playing time, we look at them as veterans and we expect them to be able to perform in the game so I feel like that helped in a way. 
Even though we missing our leader in the secondary a little bit throughout the season but it gave us a chance to be able to prepare for this and we ain't gotta worry about nobody with no experience coming into the game so I feel like that helped us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   No, do everything you can, throw different looks, try to schematically scheme Jameis so he can't understand where the open players and the one‑on‑one's is at so I feel like you gotta do a lot.   It's going to be hard to stop him but you got to put bodies on him, put line backers on top of him when you can and reroute him and everybody got to do their jobs and do their technique. 

Q.   Did you have the mentality that Ifo was the No. 1 corner and you were No. 2 and now you're the shutdown guy? 
TROY HILL:   I never, not me, I never took that mentality, I always felt like I was number one because I'm out on the field at the same time and if I ain't performing, what does that mean?   I always took it like I'm the number one and he the number one and I feel like I always tried to play to his standard.   He the leader, he set the standard and we all tried to play up to him, he was the one who set the tone for that role. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, just being a playmaker, you want to make plays so I feel like sometimes he just want to make plays and he don't‑‑ he just throw the ball sometimes.   It's a good thing, that you do want to make plays and everything like that, but sometimes it can affect you.   Him as a playmaker, that's his mentality, he's going to throw that wherever he feels like that's going to be. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, sometimes.   Sometimes, like in the‑‑ I watched this one on TV when I seen the first day of the Louisville game, when he do that pass for the touchdown, that's a great pick but that's that playmaker mentality, I guess. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   From what we was talking about, he said he was going to be out here with us as soon as he can, hopefully he gonna come up here soon. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   That was big, because you know what I'm sayin'?   He's our No. 1 tight end and big time and still trying to be out here and supporting and show he's with the team so that was big.   That's another incentive that we gotta play for our brother. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Man, I mean, it was big.   You lost so many key players in that game.   We had to understand that it was going to be people that was going to step up and gotta be the next man up, can't dwell on it because there is nothing you can do about it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah.   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   You can never go up on them, if you go up, you have to put your foot on them and keep pushing and trying to kill 'em, but it's going to be hard because they do got that fight and that "dog" in them, that pose a threat at any time because one mistake and they back in the game and another score and it's a tie game, back in the game, you know? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Honestly‑‑

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Maybe that Washington State game, where we had to play and fight the whole game, from just off the top of my head. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Arizona, we lost, and we played a few of them where we had to play 60 minutes the whole game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, because like I said, mental mistakes, later in the game, a lot of people, like when you first come out, first quarter everybody got that energy, they juiced for the game and you on point, but you go back to your training at the end of the day and once you gone for that long of a period in the game it's easier for you to make mental mistakes because you playin' longer, especially with our offense, we're on the field so fast it's easier for us to make mistakes and give up big plays, so we focus on what we need to do and what we need to do for communication so I feel like we're ready for that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, I mean, exactly, you doin' good so hopefully! 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, for me it made me grow as a player.   I mean, as a DB if you ain't never had a time when you beat then when it do happen you don't know how to react and how to bounce back from adversity, so I feel like it's helped me out a lot and looking back over the years, I'm going to get you the next time, so I feel like it honed me and made me grow as a player, honestly.

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah. 

Q.   What do you remember about that game, that experience? 
TROY HILL:   Honestly the, the first time I remember, it was probably like the second drive he shook me on the goal line, ran it in for the touchdown so I was like, man, but I bounced back, and it was a great experience coming out and winning with my team.   That was probably the best experience after that, but played a good game, and I feel like I played a good game and hopefully I can come out and do the same this game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Um, yeah, I mean, I haven't got a chance to watch a lot of USC film because we didn't play 'em this year but I know they're similar because they got athletes all over the field and that's big, you know what I'm sayin'?   Then they got the great quarterbacks out there at UCLA with Brett Hundley, and he remind me of Jameis a little bit, but not too much, because Jameis when he scrambling his eyes are always down field and you never know, he got that fight in him, that winner, we played a lot of different great offense, I can't say they're similar to Florida State, we played a lot of great offenses and our conference was strong, so I feel like it prepared us for the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, so, 'cuz we got a lot of different‑‑ that help us a lot because Florida State got a lot of different type of receivers, short, speedy, route runners and all different receivers so that prepared us for the game because I feel like we seen everything you can see out of a receiver because I phrased every different type of receivers you can see, you got Kaelin Clay over there at Utah, he's a speedster, I feel like we faced a lot of different receivers within the Pac. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   It forces you to put your safeties in the box and that represents the play‑action game and creates the one‑on‑ones on the outside and we're going to have to win those one‑on‑one's if we are in those situations because we got to stop the run, you can't let a team run the ball on you and you gotta respect the run and I feel like it's going to open up the pass more and you got a great quarterback in Jameis Winston, you got a great quarterback, so you just gotta be on point in your secondary honestly and read your keys and not try to go in the backfield looking in the backfield because you think you're going to stop the run and honestly, you got a receiver running past you now, I feel like that's opened up the play‑action game. 

Q.   Best tight end in the country.   What do you think of him when you see him?   How good is he? 
TROY HILL:   He's real good, that offense go through him, 80, the running game that offense go through him.   They gonna try and give him the ball especially, I'm sure they feel like they got better athletes and everybody, but at the end of the day we got to play and hold him accountable, make sure we check for him, know where he at on the field and play the game after that. 

Q.   You a golfer? 
TROY HILL:   I try, but‑‑

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I heard about it but this ain't golf, though! 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, our practice was like, man, that's our leader!   He's got everything, first‑round draft pick potential and just to see that happen to a player and not even just as a player, like as your brother to see your brother go down like that, it kinda hurts you, like, man, that's my brother, I don't want to see nothing like that, what's going to happen to his career?   What's next for him?   He let us know he going to be good, strong, work harder, and he is prepared to have the greatest come‑back ever so he let us know we got to work harder.   Everybody know we got to work harder because he's a big contributor to our defense. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, the body frame, the ability to throw that ball so far like 60, 70 yards on the run, however they going to do it.   So that's really what it was. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
Man, it's going to be hard, because you can escape traffic and whenever you think you got that tackle, somehow watching film, he get him out of everything, you can't just tackle his legs and everything like that because he can like I said get out of that and keep his eyes down field and throw the ball 60 yards so you got to stay up on him, I guess. 

Q.   You talked about their ability to come back, which they have done all season, is he part of that, having a quarterback that can escape the rush and make plays?   Is that part of the reason that you think they can come back? 
TROY HILL:   Yeah, I think so, because of that mind‑set and the play‑making ability, once he do get out of traffic he lookin' down field so I feel like he will his team with him because of his play‑making ability and his hunger, so I feel like that's a real part of their ability to come back, honestly. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   What's up.   Good, you? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Florida State fan, huh?   Okay. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Man, hopefully.   Hopefully that's the game plan.   See how it goes. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Man, that's probably a big threat and he bring a will the of mismatches because of his athletic ability.   He's big but he got a lot of athleticism and if you watch his film, his routes, they're not slow, he can run routes and do things that a lot of other tight ends in the country can't do so that's going to be a big threat and they like to‑‑ from what I see I feel like they like to go to him a lot in the red zone so we gotta know where he at on the field, recognize and play after that, don't just‑‑ a lot of players leave their best players open, so key in on the best players and not let them do things, hopefully. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, he got nothing but athletes on his side that he can throw it to.   That presents a big threat.   He won the Heisman so he obviously won it for a reason and when he's on, he's on, ain't no telling what he can do.   You got to take focused, hone in on those athletes or at least stay on slow 'em down.   They're going to be hard to stop completely but you at least got to try to slow 'em down and try to get them off their timing, like I said when Jameis is on he's on, that part is the biggest threat. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, just that will to make plays, probably, that hunger to make plays.   You never know, he got a lot of young, freshmen receivers who probably don't understand the whole game yet, still got a lot of growing up to do, so that's what it probably really came down to and trying to make plays, like I said. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Man, if he come your way you got to take it, you can't let it fall out your hands.   Honestly we watched film yesterday as a group and we seen in the Miami games and other games where players just dropped those picks and that would have been game‑changing and probably put the game away so when that opportunity come you gotta capitalize on it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, we just got to play our game plan, honestly.   That's what it's going to come down to, play your game plan and execute after that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Great running back, fast, got moves, can do it all, come out of the backfield, catch the ball so we're going to have to lock in on him, too. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I don't think so because we got three great D linemen, if you ask me.   They underrated if you ask me.   I don't think so, our schemes, that we work on in practice and the coaches prepare us so well to understand what our weakness is in our defense to try to make them strong and that's helped us, because we seen what we got to do throughout season and now we here for a reason. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I just play my fame, I don't think about what they going to do, hoping they going to make it easy on me and get that pressure, honestly, what they lining up in, that don't matter for my coverage because at the end of the day I got to make plays on the outside so I don't think about it like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I don't know what it is about that man, but he clean it up in the am second half and something about him that makes him a winner and that's what I feel they too in the second half, they all come together whenever they down, they never get down on themselves, a lot of teams when they lose they put their heads down or when they are losing they put their heads up and give up, but that's different with that team, I feel like they fight harder when they're down. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, probably just the level of execution.   They execute more because they down, they got to, so you gotta execute harder, that's what really make 'em win, I feel like. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   No, our coaches prepare us for those type of things and at the end of the day like you say, you got to execute, so I mean you can't really think about it like that, I don't think about it like that, I feel like we can win any game, close, blowout, down, so I believe in my team, I'm sure we all believe in each other, so I don't think we think like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, it's just media.   I don't really pay attention to it, honestly.   I believe in my team and what we do at our practice.   I know we're capable of it, that's just a media game, honestly. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I'm just playing, I'm like, let's go, we gotta execute, if you think like that, like, oh, I'm nervous, that's what you fail.   We gotta go to the next play and our coaches let us know you can't get too up or too down, you gotta play the next play. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I mean, not really.   Coach ‑‑ got his ways of coaching and Coach Kelly got his ways of coaching and that's the only difference you got different permits but within our system everything kinda been the same, we been working everything the same. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   For a little bit, but I mean, a lot of people you heard the whole, we going to do the in‑house thing, so that kinda made it easier for me and I was just ready to play. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah.   Man, that's great, because that's a lot of times when you change defense, coordinators, everything changes you got different position coaches, different everything so I felt like it was a good thing that they kept it in house because everybody knew what we wanted to do here at Oregon and they built the foundation early and they kept it going. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   I don't think it's hard at all because Seisay and Dior being playin' all year so I feel like there was a time they not under the spotlight because Ifo went down but if you look at the film, they played a lot, I been hurt, Ifo been hurt, so it don't matter too much about that, it's just the next man up and we communicate at practice and overexaggerate at practice just to get ready for the game so I feel like it don't matter that much. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
TROY HILL:   Yeah, because he was our vocal leader, he is our vocal leader at times, you know what I'm sayin'?   He understands football so much now it's taken us so now you got to expect the person behind him to come up and you going to lose that because they might not Ifo been here four years and he got that advantage.   Thank you.
