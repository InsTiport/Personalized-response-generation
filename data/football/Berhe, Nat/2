NAT BERHE:   Well, again, the scheme that Coach Long set out (inaudible) basically all we did really on defense.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DEREK LARGENT:   Well, it's really huge because how they play, they're really physical.   I think we had a little extra motivation today since it was the seniors' last home game, so we had to do it for them tonight.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DEREK LARGENT:   Yeah, I mean, definitely, but still excited to buckle down and try and stop them.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   That's what we preach around here.   Every game is a big game.   Boise was fun, but once we won, we got on the plane and we started thinking about this one.   It may be hard to believe, but that's what we preach around here.   Now we focus on the next game on our schedule.   It may be two weeks away but that's all that matters right now.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   Each one, you kind to want to get off your feet and recover a little bit, got some injured guys, get healthy again, and just be full steam, ready to go to play Wyoming up there.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
NAT BERHE:   I mean, I think we built a lot of confidence throughout the season, and I mean, after the Boise State win, I think the defense has just been‑‑ sky's the limit.   And today we just wanted to‑‑ it's a team game.   Not too long ago we couldn't stop the offense and the offense was scoring for us, and this game we stopped their offense.   But it's a team game.   We just keep getting better.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
NAT BERHE:   I think guys are just‑‑ it's a whole confidence issue, really.   I think guys are finally realizing that we're really good on defense.   So just a whole confidence thing, really.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
NAT BERHE:   Oh, yeah, I was chasing him.   I was just like, man, please don't get tackled, please, and we scored, and I kind of jumped on him a little bit.   I was excited.   I was excited.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
NAT BERHE:   Yeah, how long was the return?   Yeah, so you've got to be happy for him.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
DEREK LARGENT:   Well, it was huge because they're picking up however many yards they were, and getting the 4th down stops were really huge, so...  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, I guess you could say that.   That was our game plan going in, just to be able to run the ball and keep the ball on our side, and then you know, in the second half we kind of dropped the ball there, myself especially.   I didn't play as well as I should have.   We want to get those things corrected.   We're going to look at the film and work on it as best we can and just be ready to go for an all‑around complete game for Wyoming.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   I'm not surprised at all.   The seniors we have on this team are unbelievable leaders.   We have leaders in each class that we can look to.   We came together and gelled as a team real well over these past six games, and I think this team is just getting started.   We've got Wyoming coming up now and the Conference Championship and that's exciting so we're all happy.   But I never underestimated this team.   I believed all along we could go out and win every game, and we try to do that, so I'm not surprised at all.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   No, I didn't (inaudible) for us to try to get back.   It's my job to put guys in that position to make plays and be successful, and I didn't do that well enough in the second half.   The defense was on the field for a long time and really thankful that they played a great game like they did.   We had a good game plan, Air Force did and they played hard, but there's still a couple things I left out on the field, a couple plays I wish I could get back.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ADAM DINGWELL:   Yeah, we spoke briefly, nothing out of the ordinary.   I see him all around, but it was great to see him out there on senior night.   So it was good to have him out there.   We talked briefly.
