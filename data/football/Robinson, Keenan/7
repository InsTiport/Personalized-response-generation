  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I don't think it would really be motivation for me. I think the motivation for me is the fact that we won our first two games and that we're building upon something fresh and something new, a new start, a new team, a new season. And for me, I'm just worried about winning one game at a time, taking one game at a time, making sure that we win the next game, which happens to be UCLA, no matter what happened last year.  
 I think what happened Saturday, that gives us great motivation going to the next game because we can see that we can come back from behind and win a game and use our defense to fuel the offense and be able to win games even though we strike adversity.   
  
  Q. Last year was a big blow, a big turning point (indiscernible)?   
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I mean, not really, because it's a whole new team. We have 19 to 20 guys that weren't here last year and are playing and taking an active role on this team. So it's a whole new team as far as a whole new season. So I'm not really worried about what happened last year. I'm just worried about starting fast this year, getting out in front of them in the first quarter of this game and then hopefully wear them down with our defense and wear them down with our running game on offense.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: Actually they took what we gave them. We weren't efficient in some of our gaps and some of our schemes, so that gave them a chance to make some big plays in the running game. This year I feel like we'll be able to be more precise with our run fits and be more clean than we were last year, and that will help us in the run game because once you stop the run game, you can make them a one-sided team, much like we did Saturday with BYU.  
 UCLA was a pretty physical team. They had some bigger linemen. But every team that we've had had pretty big guys, so we're not worried about the size. It's the fact that they want to run the ball and pound the ball is what makes it more physical than other teams.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I definitely am. One, the fact that we play in the Rose Bowl, and two, the fact that we play these guys who beat us last year and beat us at home, I'm definitely looking forward to the chance to play them again and beat them obviously. I don't really worry about how we win, I just want to win, and as long as the defense plays well, that's really what I'm looking forward to.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: No, not at all, because those guys have had so much growth within the two weeks and within the fall camp, and those guys I feel like we'll be prepared to play on the road. They're really guys, they don't seem to me like they let the outside affect them in the way that they play. They usually stay pretty focused. They're not really distracted guys, and they don't really get distracted I should say, and I feel like they're playing like they're 20, 21, even though they're 17, 18 years old.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I definitely am. Last time we played there we didn't win the game, but this is a new season, new chance. They'll be a team that we lost two last year and winning in a place that we lost last time we were there.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I was one of those guys that I actually traveled every now and then in the summer to visit my grandparents and visit other family members, so I had had flying experience when I came here. But some of those guys, they come from the country, and all they know is dirt, trees and horses and cows. A lot of those guys probably don't have much flying experience as some of us, but I'm sure their first time they'll be able to get over the fear of flying if they have it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I mean, even guys that have been on a plane before it seems real hard, especially on takeoff and especially when we land. That seems to get them.   
  
  Q. In the second half you guys have really turned it up a notch in both games. Is that a matter of getting comfortable in the game along with what Manny is trying to do as coordinator?  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I think it's more the fact that the thing that hurts in the first half when the game is going slow, that that's why we're able to get the changes as well as we are in the second half. We come out of the locker room, we have about ten minutes to prepare, make any changes we want to and just be able to make some key critical changes in the game plan which help us in the second half when we come out. So when we come out we have a new game plan, we have new coverages, we have new blitzes that we're able to throw at the offense which helps us execute better until 3rd down and just be in a position to make better plays on defense.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: I love it. The guys are playing fast, physical, especially up front. We're probably playing eight to nine guys a game which last year we stayed with our regular four guys. So every play is like a new D-lineman in there in front of me, and all those guys, I trust them because I seen them in practice. I seen their work in the fall camp. I know they can execute the game that coach gives them. As far as like linebackers and DBs go, those guys are making big plays. AP has a big interception, Diggs has a big interception, Emmanuel Acho all had a chance to get interceptions, which hopefully later on in the season we'll be able to make. That's good we're getting our hands on the ball because that means the plays are there, we just have to take the next step and make them.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: We were very confident because we knew once we got them to get off the field on 3rd down, we had a lot of three-and-outs, we knew that the momentum was swinging in our direction and we could continue what we had been preparing for all fall camp and the first two weeks of practice and we would be just fine. If we don't let teams score then they can't win. So we knew that if they scored again once they got to 16, we knew if the offense scored once then the game was over.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 KEENAN ROBINSON: He's a guy that I've always known would be a good D-lineman, a good interior player for us. He works hard in practice, he's a big guy and is a guy that can make plays in a game when you need him. He had a big sack Saturday and he's a guy that -- I think he had the most points on defense, which gave him the most valuable player on defense. He was the best player that night on the team, and I feel like he's a guy that we're going to need him to play that way for the next 10, 11 games or so in order for us to have a chance to win. He's a guy that I'm glad he's playing the way he is because when D-linemen do their job, it makes it easier for the linebackers and the DBs to do their job.
