  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (Question regarding the injury and being taken out of game.) 
STEVEN GURROLA:   They all supported me.   They understood. 

Q.   Did you give Carter any crap for the incident?
STEVEN GURROLA:   I was like, Dang, you got famous off of this (laughter).   It was weird seeing Carter. 

Q.   He threw up on the ball?
STEVEN GURROLA:   He threw up on the ball.   It was perfect.   He went down, went up, snapped.   Dang! 

Q.   Was there a TV in the locker room?
STEVEN GURROLA:   They turned it off.   I think they turned it off.   I wasn't going to look at it anyway. 
I was just sad.   I was like, Man.   I was emotional. 

Q.   You just kind of sat there?
STEVEN GURROLA:   I sat there, waited, got on the bus.   First one on the bus. 

Q.   Do you feel like your last two years here give you a chance to play at the next level?
STEVEN GURROLA:   Yeah.   Especially with Coach M, the way he taught us all the fundamentals, you know, I'm going to keep trying to pursue my dream, try to play. 

Q.   How much has Carter played and how confident are you?
STEVEN GURROLA:   He played a couple games since last year.   He played the Oregon game.   Played a couple games this season. 
I'm confident.   He knows better than me.   He is the one who taught me how to read the defense.   He taught me when I got here.   I respect him for that. 
I'm going to back him up 100% this game, going to coach him up.   Practice is hard.   Me and him, going hard with him every drill. 

Q.   What does this season mean to you?
STEVEN GURROLA:   Well, I mean, it was always the goal to be the PACâ€‘12 champions, go to the Rose Bowl.   We took it one game at a time.   That's how I took it, too.   Can't overthink.   We're going to play them, have these guys next. 
I just took one game at a time.   I think that's what we all did.   That's what we had to do. 

Q.   What makes you a good leader?
STEVEN GURROLA:   I honestly don't know.   I mean, I'm not very vocal.   I don't like to talk.   I just like to do the right thing on the field and off the field.   I think that's why they picked me.   I don't know. 
I picked everybody else (smiling).   They're all good leaders.   All good leaders. 

Q.   What do you like about Terris, how much he was able to help?
STEVEN GURROLA:   Terris is strong.   He runs fast, runs through people.   It helps us.   During the Washington game, I see him just go through holes, work.   I'm like, Dang. 
Nick is there, so... 

Q.   It takes a mature guy. 
STEVEN GURROLA:   It's good.   He's trying to pump up the program to win.   I'm doing the same thing right now, so I know how it feels. 

Q.   What do you think of some of the younger players?
STEVEN GURROLA:   Levi, he needs to mature a little bit, get with things.   You know, he's a freshman. 
Layth, he works hard.   But Layth, he's really mature.   I think he's going to be really good.   He can be a good tackle, a good guard.   He has good feet.
