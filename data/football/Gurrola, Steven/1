  THE MODERATOR:   Questions.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
STEVEN GURROLA:   Coach preaches about being hard‑edged, playing hard every game.   We've been doing that all year.   
   
 Q.   You played in the PAC‑12 championship.   Didn't go the way you wanted it.   What lessons can you take from that game and apply it to this game?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   Lesson we can take is just take every play at a time, think about one play at the same time.   Coach has preached that.   
I think that's what we need to do instead of being overthinking, being pressured.  
   
 Q.   Was there a reason that Arizona was able to win 10 games this year?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   Like I said, playing one game at a time, playing hard.   
   
 Q.   You missed the first half of the game.   Phoenix guy, Glendale Community College, what was it like?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   I got over it.   I'm here to help out Carter and I know he's going to do a good job.   
   
 Q.   Are there things you will be especially paying attention to?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   I'm going to be looking at the D‑line and, of course, Carter.   He's going to have a lot on his plate.   
   
 Q.   At halftime you'll be as fired up as anybody?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   I'll have the best half of football I've ever had.   We need to get our feet across the line of scrimmage as an O‑lineman.   
   
 Q.   What is your impression of their team?  
STEVEN GURROLA:   They're a hard‑nosed defense.   Every dog has his day.   Every player has to come to play every day.
