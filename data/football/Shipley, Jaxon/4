  Q. Are you looking forward to the game on Saturday?  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I am. I think all of us are really excited for our first road game. Especially as a freshman, you know, just everything is already a big deal for us right now. This first away game, especially at the Rose Bowl, is going to be really fun for us, and it's something that we're all looking forward to.   
  
  Q. Have you ever been to the Rose Bowl?   
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I was. It was at the National Championship game. That was a lot of fun.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I was in the stands. I was in the family section. I think it was -- it was pretty good seats, around the 50-yard line, I think.   
  
  Q. Did you have any idea that (indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I didn't. I had no idea. I really didn't know what to expect. My thought process coming into this when I got here was just -- I think I needed to make some plays, that's what I thought. I needed to prove myself and just go into each day with a confidence that I can get the job done. So far I feel like the season has been going pretty good for us, so I'm just really excited, and hopefully I can play a big part of this team.  
  
  Q. Is it easier than what you expected?  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: It's kind of like now like I'm going through this process where I haven't really thought about any of that yet. I'm just kind of going through things right now. Hopefully I'll look back on this at the end and I'll be able to judge that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Yes, sir. Well, I think they didn't really give us any extra time. For some teams I think they may have -- well, it's not like a Bowl game where you get there, you get there a couple days early and then you get to go do stuff, go to the beach and stuff like that. But I think we're leaving here at 11:45 on Friday and it's going to be all business up until the game on Saturday.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Yes, ma'am, I do. I feel like we've made a lot of progress so far this year, and we're going to have a great week of practice and hopefully start off fast and get things going. So we're really excited to get to play UCLA, and hopefully the outcome will be in our favor.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I think so. I think that we're going to take that momentum from the second half and hopefully use that to our advantage.   
  
  Q. You didn't have to follow your brother in high school. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Well, I didn't really worry about following in footsteps. I kind of just want to take my own path, and that's one of the things my brother talked to me about growing up was don't feel like you have to follow in my footsteps and live up to what I've done. So one of the things I've been trying to do is just have fun and not really worry about what he's done.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Oh, yes, sir, but it's just one of those things where my dad got a different coaching job at Coppell and then he got another coaching job at Brownwood, so I didn't have the opportunity to play at Burnett, but I had a lot of fun at Brownwood. It was one of the funnest places.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: It happens every day, so I'm used to it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Yes, sir, I did. It was one of those things where it was kind of in our family. Jordan had been wearing it for as long as I can remember and I started wearing it originally because Jordan wore it. Now I think it's one of those things where I've had it so long I don't want to give it up. But if I do eventually have to give that number up, that's fine with me. But it's just something where I feel really comfortable in the number 8.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Extremely excited because he finally got his opportunity. Nobody knows really what the situation is going to be like next week with the quarterbacks and we're just going to leave that up to the coaches. But as for Case this last week when he was throwing in the game, I think he did a great job of executing what he was supposed to do.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)   
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Well, like I've been saying, Case came in with a lot of confidence and with a lot of energy, and he was motivating us as soon as he got in the huddle, telling us that he's going to lead us down the field and that we're going to score and we're going to win this game, and that's exactly what happened. We did win that game.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Well, you know, I think with Case in there, after all that had happened and then Case got thrown in there, I think it really shouldn't matter for all those other positions because their position doesn't really as much depend on the quarterback. I think they need to get their own specific job done. I think for is us as receivers, I don't think it really should matter who's throwing the ball. I think it's our job to make plays no matter who's throwing it.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Definitely. If somebody doesn't do their job, you know, their job isn't -- if you're a backup, you need to be ready to play at all times and you need to know what's going on because you could get thrown in that game.  
  
  Q. Is that encouraging?   
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I think it's very encouraging. Like I said, you need to be ready at all times, and so I think you need to have the mindset that you're going to play every time you're going into a game preparing for a game if you're a backup because you never know when you'll get thrown in there.  
  
  Q. Talk about Marquise.   
 JAXON SHIPLEY: Marquise is great. I love Marquise. He brings a lot of energy and he's extremely fast, which is good for us. We need -- we'll take all the fast players we can get. I think he's going to fit in great.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I think -- I didn't throw a great ball. Everybody knows that. I had my gloves on and I wasn't used to it. David made a great catch, and if he wouldn't have caught that ball, who knows what the situation would have been. But we got that 1st down, and that's all that matters.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 JAXON SHIPLEY: I wasn't surprised because we've been practicing all week, and when that was called, I just knew that me and David needed to make a play right there.
