  MIKE FINN:   I have a statement that Miami put out yesterday.   I'll read it now for those of you who have not heard it.   Basically Coach Golden says: 
I want to sincerely thank our studentâ€‘athletes and families who not only stood with the University of Miami during this unprecedented challenge, but subsequently volunteered for the mission.   They shouldered the burden, exhibited class and exemplified perseverance for Hurricanes everywhere. 
Further I would like to express heartfelt appreciation to our staff and families who did not subscribe to this challenge three years ago, yet courageously adopted it as their own.   They have brought the utmost professionalism, resiliency and integrity to our program. 
More importantly they continued to recruit and represent our world class institution with class and dignity in unprecedented circumstances. 
Lastly, it is with gratitude and humility that I say thank you to our administration, the U family everywhere, the entire South Florida community for their unyielding support our young men and program over the last 28 months. 
That's a statement from Coach Golden yesterday regarding the NCAA decision.
