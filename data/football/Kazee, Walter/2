LEON McFADDEN:   It's great to go out with a win.   The team played physical, and we harp on playing for our seniors, and our seniors led from the front and led by example.   I can honestly say I'm proud of our team for coming together and having us win today. 
WALTER KAZEE:   We were coming out here just playing our hearts out and actually having something to play for.   It's been great. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
WALTER KAZEE:   It's the whole offense just does a great job.   Our linemen did a great job blocking at the line of scrimmage and our tight ends did a great job blocking out there for us.   It's not really‑‑ it's really on them that we were able to do this. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
WALTER KAZEE:   I'm fine, just hurts every now and then.   Just get off the field. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
WALTER KAZEE:   Just little tweaks, twisted ankles. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
WALTER KAZEE:   Yeah, I think it'll be good for all of us having a bye week.   We've been going at it for a long time, and it's going to feel good for everybody to get a break and rest their bodies and come out strong for our last game. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LEON McFADDEN:   I mean, it's really big.   Coach Long is always talking about being physical and how a physical team‑‑ whoever is out‑physicaling one another, we're going to be successful.   Those were big stops.   Like they mentioned earlier, they punt very rarely, and for us to get them off the field was a good thing. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LEON McFADDEN:   Yeah, we mentioned that before the game, this being our 500th win, I heard about it during the week, and everybody was motivated to come into this game, being senior night, and sending all the seniors off with a big win.
