<p>	Q.  Does finding a punter by asking for volunteers change your attitude about using the scholarship and how you feel about that, going out and actively recruiting them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when you came to Baylor and where the program was then, how far have you come and how far do you feel like you still need to go? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is a question for Moe and Colin.  You hear people say from time to time that Daniel is one of the best athletes on your team.  If he wasn't punting and wasn't so valuable there, what role would he play in the defense?  How good would it be?  What kind of player do you think he would be on your unit? </p>

<p>	Q.  Chip Brown, Dallas Morning News.  This question is for Guy and the players.  Can you put the Texas A&amp;M victory in perspective for us as you go into this season, maybe how you build on it and just what that victory meant to the program? </p>

<p>	Q.  Hey, Guy, I wonder if you would talk about the difficulty turning the program around, considering every other team in your division went to a bowl game last year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Guy, when you talk about the A&amp;M game in terms of recruiting, did you have any kids sign?  You said the A&amp;M game is what changed their minds about that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Morriss, can you talk about the development of your offensive line in the spring.  I know that's a unit that worked really hard to upgrade and what does Will Blaylock bring to that group? </p>
<p>	Q.  After two years at Baylor is the job any different or any more difficult than what you anticipated going in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Moe and Colin, can you all talk about trying to stay and keep your confidence and everything, and you haven't won more than three games (inaudible)?</p>


<p>	Q.  Coach, just for you and your student athletes, student athletes first, number one, there has been a lot of attention on Baylor about the success of other teams on campus, basketball team, tennis team, et cetera.  Are you guys feeding off of that?  Are you getting support from fellow student athletes?  Your coaching staff has been relatively stable.  How big a factor is that in building your program as well as influencing and selling it? </p>
