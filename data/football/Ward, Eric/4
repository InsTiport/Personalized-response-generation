Q.   Can you just talk to us about the three touchdowns? 
ERIC WARD:   I was just running my route.   Like Coach Brown tells us, just run your route as hard as you can and expect the ball.   I was doing what I was supposed to do.

Q.   You talked a little over the summer about Seth's increased confidence.   But it seems like everybody now is getting to see that out there.   What have been your thoughts about the way he's played the last two games? 
ERIC WARD:   I mean, the way he's played, we're just following his lead.   So of course you want your quarterback doing good, then that makes it easier for everyone else to follow his lead and do good as well. 
So I mean, I'm proud of him.   I know he's capable of doing way better.   I know he's going to get better as the season prolongs.   So it's just you've got to just take one game at a time.

Q.   Which of the three touchdowns was the hardest tonight? 
ERIC WARD:   Probably the post, because the way he was playing, I wasn't used to it and I never ran it outside.   So I just tried it and it worked out for me.
