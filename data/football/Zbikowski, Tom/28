<p>	Q.  How many family members will you have up there on Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  No ticket requests, I'm sure? </p>
<p>	Q.  How crazy is "crazy time" up there? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you react to that then? </p>
<p>	Q.  As a player, how do you view playing the No. 1 team in the country with the longest winning streak? </p>
<p>	Q.  We were talking to Coach Weis.  He said one of the biggest jobs he had last week was convincing the team that it could win.  Do you need to get a collective amnesia about the last three results?  I know you weren't around for all of them.  Is the team believing now?  What sorts of things was Coach telling you? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do the words "fake punt" mean to you after last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  They did. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weis obviously wasn't there.  Has that been discussed among the players at all, a revenge factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weis made a big deal of the fact he did not want the players -- he wants you to be excited, but he doesn't want you to be too excited.  He wants you to be ready to play the game, but not too ready.  How do you walk that fine line between being excited, but not too excited? </p>
<p>	Q.  As an offensive player, when you look at Southern Cal and all the things they can do, what is your reaction?  Are you impressed?  Shocked?  What do you think about watching their team offensively? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were there last season, you knew Charlie Weis was coming in as coach.  He's known for the passing game.  Were you at all concerned about what your role was going to be?  I have to assume now you're happy with what your role is. </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people around the country are curious about how this team could be so much improved this year with a lot of same bodies.  Are you new players under this staff?  Are you in a sense reborn?  How did it happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did he tear you down before he built you up?  He mentioned the first thing he did was embarrass the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Teams have moved the ball on USC in recent weeks, more through the air than on the ground.  Are you encouraged by what you see? </p>
<p>	Q.  Everyone talks about how complex Coach Weis' offense is.  When you first got a copy of the playbook, how difficult was it?  How long did it take you to fully understand his philosophy? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Corey Dillon.  Once you got the playbook, could you start to see why certain things worked for the Patriots? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do they go over the history of Notre Dame with you this week, let you know the big games they've played in, the big games they've won?  Do you hear from former players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Weis was saying earlier he wants his team to take on his attitude.  Do you get that sense, that you have become a little more brash in his mold since he's taken over? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that was missing maybe the past couple years, that swagger that you seem to be developing again? </p>
<p>	Q.  He was saying a key against USC is you can't let up, you have to -- if you see they're vulnerable, just keep going because they're going to keep scoring, and no lead seems to be too big for them.  Is that the thought you take?  If you've got them down, keep pushing? </p>
<p>	Q.  What impresses you about USC's defense that the average fan watching on television probably doesn't notice? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about how this year when you were in the huddle, a play gets called, you are supremely confident it's going to work.  Last year or the year before, was there a feeling of breaking the huddle and kind of hoping it was going to work? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you believe in leprechauns? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people are thinking that the Notre Dame mystique might be the edge in the game.  Do the players think that at all?  Obviously you have to go out and block and tackle.  But playing at South Bend, the history of the USC series, does that play a little bit into your confidence factor? </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you remember the fake punt late last year against USC?  What was your reaction to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  More than your memory?  A little bit of payback if you get a chance? </p>
<p>	Q.  They were up so big in that situation.  In a rivalry game, it was almost like, "What is the point?"  What went through your mind?  Was it discussed among the players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why is this team different this year from last year with basically for the most part the same players? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did that start with winning the first game?  When did you start feeling like this team is going to be different?  Did it happen before you played Pitt? </p>
<p>	Q.  Where does this game rank for you, them being the two-time national champs, all the history between the two programs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this game one of the reasons you wanted to go to Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything different about Coach Weis compared to any other coach you've been under, whether high school, college, whatever? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of the media expectations weren't as high for this team compared to how Notre Dame is doing.  Did you pay attention to that?  Was it a motivating factor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your secondary.  How much better is it this year than last year, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your impression of Linehart? </p>
<p>	Q.  I asked this question to Maurice Stovall.  I asked him if there's one play or series of plays that really stood out to him in terms of Brady Quinn, something that he saw that maybe we don't see.  He said he has made some calls, audibles, in terms of picking up blitzes that have impressed him.  Have you seen him pick up a particular blitz where you said, "I can't believe he picked that up, I didn't see it coming"?  Is there something that stands out in your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see something in Brady this year that you haven't seen in years past? </p>
<p>	Q.  What has changed that we're seeing it now as opposed to before? </p>
<p>	Q.  We hear a lot about Coach Weis' swagger, that he's very opinionated, the nasty attitude.  Does he show you another side at all?  He's obviously a big family man.  Do you ever get that sense from him or is it just football? </p>
<p>	Q.  Has he ever talked to you at all about his experience where he had to fight back from a health crisis, and people didn't know if he was going to make it for a while?  Has that been something he kept to himself? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two great runningbacks in Bush and White.  What do you see in what they bring in terms of weapons? </p>
<p>	Q.  It will be a team effort and the offense will have to carry its part.  From a defensive standpoint, are you looking at it, if you can keep them from putting up their average, stop some drives, get a couple turnovers, that could be the difference?  Obviously, your offense can put up points.  Are you thinking, if the defense can really do a great job, you have a good chance to win? </p>
<p>	Q.  It's cool if we say you predicted a 3-0 shutout? </p>
<p>	Q.  How can you banish doubt and fear going into this game?  What is it like on the practice field? </p>
<p>	Q.  You say previous results have nothing to do with it.  A lot of the same bodies are on the field at the same time.  Do you feel like you're different players with this staff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see the second half of Arizona State? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anything to worry about there? </p>
