Q. Talk about the back field for you guys?
LUKE ANTHONY: It was pretty evident as soon as you got here that he was going to add a different dimension to the offense.  Tracy is a pretty good power back.  Billy can bounce an inside run and take it 60 yards like he did tonight.  You know, you just make plays that are nothing into something just because that speed is crazy.
Q. Takes a lot of pressure off you?
LUKE ANTHONY: Oh, yeah, for sure.  When you hand him off the ball and his first drive of the night, and he takes it 65 yards and stiff arms a dude to the ground, he makes it pretty easy.
Q. People got to worry about that, and then you have another guy that you didn't have last year.  I mean, he really stretches out the field.
LUKE ANTHONY: Oh, yeah, we move him around so much in different places in our offense.  We throw him in the slot.  We'll send him motion out of the back field.  We'll start him outside.  So we don't let teams really just single-handedly take them away.
So with our versatility in offense and skill set, I think it's a pretty good match.
Q. Talk about the long touchdown pass.  That had to be a big relief for you guys in the game, and it got you back into it?
LUKE ANTHONY: Absolutely.  It was pretty funny.  Alex Lofton who plays corner on our team, he was telling me that it had been working in practice all week.  And he told me before the game, that play's going to be a touchdown tonight.  Sure enough, call it, and the first time and only time we call it for the night, I see D.J., set him up on the out, and I knew he had to use his speed and go catch up the ball.
We were in a pretty big hole there, so it was a great momentum changer for us and it allowed us to hang into the game for a little longer.
