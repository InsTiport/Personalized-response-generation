THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Zach.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel you were prepared?   
ZACH KLINE:   Yeah.   You know, getting ready, feel it in the stomach.   That was just adrenaline starting to kick in.   
I had the helmet on, just getting the line set and ready.   Just a transformation of looking, walking, soaking it in, telling Jared what's there.   
   
 Q.   How difficult was it for you?   
ZACH KLINE:   As an offense, yeah, it was difficult for us to move the ball.   But they're a great team.   They're an amazing team.   
But, you know, we just get a rhythm, get out of rhythm, get a rhythm, get out of rhythm.   It was kind of this skippy rhythm that we just couldn't zone in and march down the field, like our first drive.   
   
 Q.   How do you think you played?   
ZACH KLINE:   I thought I played, you know, okay.   There was a lot of routes that I could have hit, that I should have hit.   I thought I could have played a whole lot better than what I did.   
I didn't put any points on the board, so I didn't do my job as quarterback.   I'm disappointed how I played.   I'm disappointed how the team played this whole season.   Everybody is.   
But the upside is there's just a lot of room to get better.   There's nowhere to go but up from here.   It's going to be a good off‑season 'cause we know what it feels like to be the worst.   Hopefully we're going to know what it feels like to be the best soon.   
We just need to work as hard as we possibly can 'cause we know what it's like, the bare minimum to be the worst.   We have to put in three million times more than that.   
It's going to be a tough off‑season.   But we just got to look ahead.   We have to flush this whole season away and look ahead.   If we dwell on the past, it's just going to infect the whole team, get in our heads, our confidence will be down.   
We have to stay confident.   We wish this season we played with a fight and confidence.   Wish we could have gone out well, the way we wanted it to, a winning season for the seniors.   Next year we have to capitalize on it.   
Going in, seeing my best friends crying, knowing that's the last time they're ever going to put the pads on, it's eerie.   It's very different.   For me, I have a lot of time.   I'm going to be able to put the pads on in a couple weeks.   
It's just really weird.   It's strange to see that these guys are never going to play football again.   We're going to carry that into every single day, every single workout, every single time we go to class.   You're not playing for yourself; you're playing for the guy next to you.   
You always hear that clichÃ©, but now it's very real for a lot of the guys, including myself.   
   
 Q.   With you and Jared both being freshmen, do you intend to stay at Cal?  
ZACH KLINE:   Yeah.   I want to stay here.   I want to do whatever I can here.   But I'm going to have to make a decision that every player in my position's going to have to make.   You know, I don't know what that is.   
I committed here for a reason.   I committed here really early here for a reason.   I love Cal.   I'm a Bear through and through.   If there's an opportunity that is greater than the one here, you know, I'll have to make a decision.   I don't know what that decision is yet, so...   
   
 Q.   You mentioned helping Jared when he was in the game.   Did you find that Jared was helpful to you when you were in the game?  
ZACH KLINE:   Yeah, yeah.   The quarterbacks rely on each other.   It's different 'cause, you know, it's a lot easier to go up to the other quarterbacks.   That's just a player speaking.   
But it's been very helpful to have Jared on the sidelines.   I think it's been helpful for Jared to have me on the sidelines, as well.   We can say something to Jared in a way that's a little bit easier than some of the coaches can.   
   
 Q.   Sounds like you're kind of leaving the door open for a potential transfer.   
THE MODERATOR:   Let's not go there right now.   Let's talk about today's game.   He's already answered it once, so...   
   
 Q.   Do you think you received a fair shot?  
ZACH KLINE:   Today?   
   
 Q.   The season.   
THE MODERATOR:   It's the same question.
