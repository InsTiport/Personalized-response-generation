COACH GUNDY: Pretty exciting game for us.  Just really proud of our players.  They did a great job at halftime.  Coaches did a really good job of staying calm, making adjustments.  They took the majority of the allotted time at half to stay in the shower, not actually showering, but stay in there and make the adjustments.
