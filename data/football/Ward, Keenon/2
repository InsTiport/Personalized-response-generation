 Q.   Was this the most frustrating loss this year?  
KEENON WARD:   I'd have to say it was.   I mean, we came out and played pretty well, and it was obvious that we should have won that game.   When you lose games like these, it's pretty tough.  
   
 Q.   What kind of looks did they give you in the second?   Did they change anything up?  
KEENON WARD:   No, they didn't do anything different.   They came out, and we knew what they were going to do, they just capitalized on a couple big plays and we gave up points when it came down to it.   
   
 Q.   Give us your overall assessment of the second half.   
KEENON WARD:   I thought we played well.   We had a new package in with ‑‑ it's called speed package.   We had like 60 Bs in.   I thought we played well.   We came in, we made tackles when we had to, we broke up the ball so I felt like we played pretty well.   
   
 Q.   You guys were ahead for so long by one to three touchdowns.   Did you feel like y'all possibly relaxed at all?  
KEENON WARD:   I felt like we could have put them away early.   We gave them the ball‑‑ we had the ball two times in the red zone and didn't get any points of out of it, threw a pick, just little things like that where we could put teams away and we were not doing it and just keeping them alive.   
   
 Q.   How difficult is it to get this team back and focused?   
KEENON WARD:   It's going to be tough, but we're all here for one reason, and that's to win, so we're not going to stop until we do.   We've just got to come in tomorrow and start working again.   
   
 Q.   What was your emotion like when you saw that kick come off his foot?  
KEENON WARD:   The kick?   
   
 Q.   Yeah, the last one.   
KEENON WARD:   I couldn't tell if it was good or not, and I looked back, and it was just a perfect kick.   You've got to give it to him.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like you made progress today from a defensive standpoint just with the way that you guys played and the effort that you had out there?  
KEENON WARD:   Yeah, I felt like we played well.   Like I just said, our defense came out and got stops when we needed to, and I feel like we're getting better as a defense.   You can't be too mad at that.   
   
 Q.   What was the difference late?   How were they able to put all the points up and score 17 points there at the end?  
KEENON WARD:   It was just a few big plays, a few busts on our end.   They caught the ball and just got points out of it.   I'm so proud of our defense.   We played well.   We've just got to eliminate the small plays, because it'll turn into seven real quick.  
   
 Q.   What was the game plan going in?  
KEENON WARD:   Yeah, we've been playing good receivers.   Last week we had Lockett at the X, but we came in knowing that they were going to throw him the ball.   I felt like we did a good job for the most part on defending him.   He had a big play at the end, but I felt like we played pretty well against him.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you guys just ran out of gas in the fourth quarter given how much time you spent on the field?  
KEENON WARD:   I wouldn't say that.   I feel like we just didn't make plays when we needed to, and that's what you have to do to be a really great team, and that's what we're going to strive for.
