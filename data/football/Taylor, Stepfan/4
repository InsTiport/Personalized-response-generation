 Q.   Does it play a big part in this game because of you guys trying to control the ball and keep it away from them?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   If we need to run the ball or keep full‑time position, that's what we are going to do.   That's the coaches' decision.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be on a team that can do all the versatile things that this team can do?  
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   It is amazing.   Especially when the tight ends that we have, running down the field and doing seams, it is amazing to do that.   
A lot of people are diverse on the team.   Not one person is scoring all the touchdowns.   It is spread out.  
   
 Q.   In your season, how would you describe your season?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   Okay season.   It could get better.   Come back next year and work in the off‑season and get better.   Doing what it takes to get the win.   
   
 Q.   You are in a BCS game for the second time.   Do you feel a lot more comfortable?   Does it make a difference the second time around?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   Second time around we know what to anticipate.   So I guess you could say it is more comfortable.   Really focus on the team, getting extra film time in.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of what you are going to face Monday?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   As far as defense, a turnover machine.   We really need to focus on that and keep the ball high and tight and keep it up strong.  
   
 Q.   Coaches been stressing that this last month?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   Especially in the running back room.   When we have the ball, we have to keep the ball high and tight and don't have it low.   They have proven they can get it out.  
   
 Q.   They have 42 takeaways.   That's incredible when you think about it.   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   Very incredible.  
   
 Q.   Can you see on film how they do it?   
STEPFAN TAYLOR:   The players there, they just have a natural ability to get it out.   They see the players have the ball low.   So we just to keep it high and tight like coaches have been stressing to us.
