WASHINGTON   28
  STANFORD - 31

COACH SARKISIAN:   I would say, in part, really entertaining football game, I would imagine, for everybody involved.   I thought our kids exuded enormous hearts.   Thought they played hard, thought they showed the fight that is innate in this program.   It's not superficial.   I think the heart they displayed tonight to battle back against an excellent football team, I couldn't be more proud of to be their head coach and the way they played and the fight they showed. 
It's unfortunate the game had to come down to a judgment call like that.   That part was unfortunate because it was two good football teams battling and competing with one another, and I wish the game would have gotten won on the field and not in the booth upstairs with some guy that didn't get to feel the emotion and the hard‑fought football game that that game was.

Q.   Did you get an explanation? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   No.

Q.   Were you told anything by anybody you had upstairs the way they saw it? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   They saw what we saw on the Jumbotron.   It was ruled a catch.   To determine it not a catch, they have to overrule it and determine that it wasn't.   From my vantage point, it looked like it was pretty hard to overturn it.   But, again, I didn't get to sit 50 yards up in a booth and play a video game and make a call.

Q.   The special teams just overall your take on it? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   Yeah, we just didn't cover.   Man, we knew this kid was a good returner.   We thought we were going to fit the returns well, and we just didn't.   You know, it's unfortunate that that played such a factor in the game.   But you have to play all three phases.   It's not just one or the other.   It's not just O or D.   You have to play all three phases.   We didn't cover well tonight at all.   We didn't kick great either, and that set up the lack of coverage.

Q.   The last kickoff there, did you guys contemplate an on‑side opportunity there? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   We did, but we had all three timeouts with a little under 3:00 left, and we felt like we could get a stop, and sure enough, we did it.   We left ourselves in a good situation.   We had two minutes left to go in the game with the ball in our possession on the 33‑yard line.   We practiced that every single week.   That exact situation.   We were performing in it, and it just didn't work out.

Q.   What did you think about how Keith handled himself tonight against this defense? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   I thought he was an absolute stud tonight.   I thought that he showed the heart that this entire team plays with, but I thought Keith really exemplified that.   I thought he showed tremendous leadership.   When we fell behind, to battle back and to make throws and critical throws with a tremendous defensive front, pass rushing him.   I was proud of him.   He played a good football game against an excellent defense.

Q.   Did he hurt his finger late in the game? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   His thumb, yeah.   His thumb was bothering him.

Q.   The play to Austin, it was on third down, the drop?
COACH SARKISIAN:   I didn't have a great view.   It wasn't his finger.   It had nothing to do with his finger.   I didn't have a great view, so I don't know exactly what happened.   I was behind the play.

Q.   Even though you lost is this one of those games you come away feeling like you proved something? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   No, there's no awards for losing.   We're a proud football team and we're proud of the way we played, but we came here to win the game, and unfortunately, we didn't do that.   So we have to show the ability to handle the adversity of a tough loss like this against a tough football team and learn from some of the mistakes we had.   Be proud of the way we played and have the ability to get back on the horse and go play another excellent football team next week. 
I think the thing that we proved to ourselves is we can beat anybody in the country.   That to the point of where you prepare really well and you have good game plans and execute, you can do that.   So now we have to try to get back on the horse, start preparing for Oregon, and get ready to play another excellent football team a week from today.

Q.   What did you say to the team? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   Similar stuff to that.   Similar stuff to that.   I told them I was very proud of them and proud to be their coach.   They made me proud on that sidelines of the way we continued to fight, the heart that they showed, to continue to fight back.   I mean, what a tremendous play on the 3rd and 1 stop by our defense.   Just a really just proud of their effort.

Q.   Can you talk about the penalties a little bit? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   There's a lot of them.   I don't know.   It's hard for me to comment until I look at the film.   I have to look at Darrell Daniels' block.   I don't know until I look at the film on some of this stuff.

Q.   How frustrating was it every time you got within three for a stretch, Stanford just bounced ahead and got a touchdown? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   Sure did.   The couple of them that were big ones, obviously, the touchdown at the end of the first half I thought was really big for Stanford.   It was a heck of a throwing catch for those two kids.   I thought Marcus was in pretty good throwing position. 
But great throw and catch.   We claw back in and they get the big kickoff return to return it all the way back.   Get great field position again, and put our defense in a short field.   But that's what good teams do.   When you play good teams, they're going to fight back.   They're not going to just let you keep steam rolling them.   So, again, I thought our guys continued to fight as well, wasn't good enough.

Q.   The sky kick near the end of the half, did you just want Cameron to just get that maybe 20 yards?
COACH SARKISIAN:   About 20 yards further.   Just didn't execute it great.   Got to practice it more.

Q.   He's asked to get that ball out of the end zone.   Was that kind of the goal on the kickoff? 
COACH SARKISIAN:   He hasn't been a hundred percent health‑wise, and I think it affected him some tonight.
