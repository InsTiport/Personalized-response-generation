  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (Question regarding injuries.) 
BLAKE BORTLES:   It definitely happens.   Like a fifth‑year senior that comes back and gets injured. 

Q.   The Louisville game, you guys were down, you said, We're going to go down the field and score.   Was that something you actually felt or something you wanted to encourage your team about?
BLAKE BORTLES:   It was something that we had done.   Against Louisville, we were successful the whole game.   The only time they stopped us was the pick in the end zone, our first drive.   I threw a pick in the end zone.   We really killed ourselves that game. 
That was the week, too, we had worked the two‑minute drill way more than we usually did.   It really paid off.   Very confident in the offensive line to get the job done.   It was kind of a thing to get them fired up. 
Good thing it turned out the way it did. 

Q.   They weren't actually worried?
BLAKE BORTLES:   No.   I thought we could go down the field and score. 

Q.   If you hadn't, would you ever say it again (laughter)? 
BLAKE BORTLES:   Good thing it turned out the way it did (smiling).
