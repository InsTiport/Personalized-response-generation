RONNIE HARRIS: It's very hard to explain.  The way he was just pacing it just seemed like he had something on his mind that was bigger than the game.  I just, at that moment, I don't know, something came over me just said, coach, just let it out.  If you have just an outburst of passion, you don't know how much energy that gives to us.  And he's answered the bell.  He's been doing it and he's getting us a lot of, I would say way more ready for these games just by his passion.  He has a lot of influence over us, not that he's understanding that more this year, but he's just being himself out there, he's having fun, he's backing up his boys now.  And when you have a coach like that, ready to show his passion and eager just to be happy, you're going to work every day.
