COACH MUSCHAMP:   Well, first of all, I want to thank the TaxSlayer.com people and, the Gator Bowl has been an outstanding week.   Lot of fun.   Great to be in the state of Florida and in Jacksonville.   Rick and Greg and his staff have done a phenomenal job for us, for our players.   They've had a great time.   Twenty four straight winning seasons in Florida, exciting four straight bowl wins.   First time ever in Florida history, sending the seniors out the right way.   
We've got a lot of good kids in that locker room.   We've got guys that have had a frustrating year.   The realization of this whole thing if you want to see big pictures in the last two years of the University of Florida, we're 15‑11, that's unacceptable.   That's what we are.   
We've had a staff and a guy that bon two National Championships, a heck of a football coach.   We're one game's difference from last year.   We're 7‑6, we were 8‑5 last year.   So sometimes I think you've got to put your realistic glasses on where you are as a program right at this point.   It's not where we're going to be very long.   I can assure you of that.   Moving in the right direction.   
I'm very pleased with the attitude and the effort and the drive of our young men, and I think they kept fighting in the game; they kept doing it the entire season.   
I don't think you can turn the tape on and watch a team that wasn't giving effort.   Weren't trying to play with the right kind of toughness.   Wasn't always what we wanted at times.   It's frustrating times.   I appreciate our administration and what we're trying to do.   
I've said it before, and I mean this sincerely, we're not building a team, we're building a program.   That takes a foundation to start.   It really does.   You stay the course of what you're trying to do, and what you believe in and the hard core values of what you want.   It isn't always what you want.   You get criticized and those sort of things.   That's part of the deal and part of being the head coach of the University of Florida, and I fully accept that.   
So excited for our football team.   We need to get better, and that starts with me.   Our entire organization, 7‑6 is not acceptable at the University of Florida, and we're looking forward to getting started on January 9th.   We start school and we'll have a good team meeting that day and get these guys ready to go.   That's when our season starts for next year.   
It's good momentum.   I think there are a lot of guys out there as far as knowing their opportunity to come to a place like Florida and get an outstanding education, play for a great staff, and be a part of a winning tradition.   And we're going to do that.   
Special teams is huge.   Andre's kickoff returns blocked extremely well.   D.J. Durkin does the best job in the country on special teams.   Week-in, week-out momentum changers and putting our guys in situations to be successful.   The blocked punt was a great design to get some guys free and changing things in the game.   
Third down conversion offensively was good, especially early in the game.   Defensively we converted some things.   We could have tackled and hemmed the quarterback up, we would have done some more.   Six sacks and 12 tackles for a loss, we gave up some things early in the run game.   They did a nice job in their bunch set with what they were doing.   We adjusted to that.   
You know, so just, again, pleased with the win as we move forward and I'll open it up for any questions.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the scene on the field after the game?   You guys have not had a lot of fun especially in the last few months or couple months.   Just players were hugging, players were smiling, players were kissing their moms.   Can you just talk about that?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Well, again, I think that close counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and that's really about it.   You don't come close in football.   The team gets tired of me telling them they're close.   You look at these six plays, eight plays, 10, 12 plays in a game.   If we can capitalize here and take care of this here, I think they're tired of hearing that.   
I think we did that today.   We made it interesting like we were running in mud rushing the quarterback there a little on that last drive.   But, again, I think that that's a sign of our team fighting through it.   I told them in the locker room, I don't want anybody to forget this season.   I don't want anybody to forget the frustration.   Tough times.   The guys that weren't committed to our program wanting to do it the right way, to do it our way.   
As we move forward and understand the type of commitment it's going to take to be successful and to do the things you've got to do to be successful.   It's hard to win.   Those are easy words to talk about, but they're hard to do.  
   
 Q.   You talked about building a program and not a team.   What did you see out there today in terms of either improvement from the season or something going forward?   What did you see that makes you think that you're heading in that direction?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   I don't think it's one day.   I'll be honest with you.   There wasn't one thing out there that I saw.   It was a culmination of things that you see through bowl practice and even during the season.   We didn't get the results we always wanted, but I'm kind of a process oriented guy in how things are going, and I'm looking at attitude and character and guys buying in and athleticism and play‑making ability.   I also can take into consideration some of the things you got to as a coach.   
No one wants to talk about those things.   But, again, anybody can state the problems.   It's my job to solve the problems.   Anybody a third grader can tell you what the issue is, find out how you solve the problem.   
But the point being, I think we've made tremendous strides in some areas.   We're where we want to be now.   We're making some improvements, yes.   Have the guys bought in?   Yes.   We go to bowl practice and flat out teed it up and scrimmaged and got after it.   
I mean, we're a 6‑6 football team.   A lot of times in a 6‑6 football team, they don't really want to do that.   It's not really what they want to do.   It's not a senior thing.   They all went after it.   They all practiced hard.   
Those are the things to me that are promising as we move forward.   Again, when you see the locker room after a tough defeat and whether it was in Columbia or in this locker room back in October or it was in Auburn, Alabama, there were some hurting guys in that locker room.   That's when you know it's important to them.   You know you've made some strides.   
But, again, it's just one day, so let's don't get ahead of ourselves.   It takes time to build it the way you want to get it.   Again, patience is not a good word around here, but sometimes you've got to exercise that, especially putting the state of the last two years back‑to‑back.   
   
 Q.   Will, did you feel like this game illustrated what you've been talking about all year as far as needing big plays and takeaways on defense?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Well, we got two and there were two really momentum changers in the game.   We didn't capitalize on one of them, but sure, they convert a third down.   We get a nice trip on the ball.   We get the ball going back the other way.   
We come right out.   John takes a shot down the field to Omarius, we flip the field immediately and get the ball down there and get three points.   No question a game changing, momentum changing six sacks, 12 tackles for a loss.   We're doing a better job of playing blocks up front, although we didn't at times in the first half.   
But, yeah, we've got to make more momentum‑changing plays for our football team defensively, but again, special teams was fantastic.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of this as the final act for Chris Rainey here?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Oh, Chris is an outstanding player.   You look at his time at Florida and the play‑making ability, he plays in space, special teams, his effort.   You go out to practice every day.   I mean, the guy practices hard every day.   Gives everything he's got, and he loves being a Florida Gator.   Honestly, if we could extend his eligibility to five years, I think he'd love to stay in college and play in Florida.   That's the type of guy he is.   He likes playing for the Gators.  
   
 Q.   Would you talk about the job that Brian White did as your coordinator putting together a game plan that worked?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   It's not his first time.   He's done it on the big stage in the Rose Bowl, and he did it in Wisconsin for Barry Alvarez.   Brian's an outstanding football coach and certainly under consideration.   At the end of the day, we're going to hire the best fit for the University of Florida as we move forward.  
   
 Q.   Your pass rush today was a success.   Is this what you were looking for throughout the year?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Sure.   You'd love to have six sacks in every game, but I think a little bit of it was to pressure the quarterback to keep edges for his escapability.   He's an outstanding athlete and a guy that's going to continue to progress as a player, very reminiscent of three or four years in the Fiesta Bowl, Terrelle Pryor, a very similar type guy.   Not as tall, but a similar type athlete.   We had to do some things to create edges and not let him escape as much.   Late in the game, you saw where he was able to escape, he created plays.   But we ran out of gas there.  
   
 Q.   How would you evaluate how Sharrif played on the inside?   Is that something that you would want to keep him back there?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   No, he's going to play both.   In our league you play against a team like Ohio State, and they want to run the two‑back runs, you've got to have somebody setting the edges in the end.   
So he'll continue to play both and continue to turn the best combination of guys this year, the best combination at the end of the day.   I can't answer that for next year yet.  
   
 Q.   You said 7‑6 is unacceptable, but it's more acceptable than 6‑7.   How important was it?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   I think it's important for our players to put in an awful lot of work and effort to get some gratification of winning a football game against a good football team.   
To go out and fight through adversity like we have this year in several situations and having opportunities during the season and not closing the deal and getting it done, we're tired of being close.   To be able to go win a game like that against a quality team was very important.   It's something that helps your confidence and builds your momentum.   
It's not going to affect one game we play next year.   So I don't believe in momentum for the next year, I think, momentum for the off‑season, momentum for recruiting.  
   
 Q.   Was there any hesitation going for the field goal when you were inside the 5 there and knocking on the door?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Yes, there was.   The big thing I've talked to Brian on the head sets.   I said if we're inside the 1, we're going for it.   If we're not, we need to make it a 2 touchdown game.   If it was, it's a two‑touchdown game where they take the lead.   So, yes, we talked about it on the head set.  
   
 Q.   Now that the season's over, do you have a timetable to fill the openings on your staff?   Are you close to that?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   I'm very close on the strength.   I've just got to finalize some things and get with Jeremy.   After that, the offensive coordinator, I've got no timetable.   I'm trying to work through that and make the best decision for Florida.  
   
 Q.   Andre, can you talk about the kickoff return for the touchdown and what you saw there?   
ANDRE DEBOSE:   The kick return, Coach Durkin just called the play and I just followed Demps, and he just kind of led me to the promised land for the touchdown.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember anything from that program at all for a motivation for your guys?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   No, no, playing for Florida ought to be motivation enough.  
   
 Q.   What happened to you guys on offense there right before halftime?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Well, I told Brian‑‑ and Brian that we were going to take a knee and start the first.   When we flipped the possession off there and the squib kick.   So I said to Brian, let's take a shot and throw one in the end zone.   
So we wanted to switch to throw Jacoby in to throw the ball down the field and not John can't.   We just want to take a shot down the field.   
Well, off the timeout differently, the white hat in our league will tell the quarterback in the huddle, I'm starting the call.   Whereas the crew we had, which was outstanding, all right, you have to check for the white hat to start the clock.   We had two issues in the game off dead ball where they go from 25 seconds to 40 seconds.   It's my fault of not educating John and our quarterbacks to be ready for that situation.   
It's just a different crew.   They did it differently than what our league does.   That's just the way it does.   So we had delay of game, and I told Brian, let's take a knee going into halftime.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how after all you've been through for five years, to go out wearing not a Cincinnati Reds hat, but a Gator Bowl hat, a champion hat?   
JOHN BRANTLEY:   Yeah, we had our ups and downs.   The last couple of years haven't been the best.   But I just stuck with my teammates and coaches, and we made the best out of it.   Just to get a good win against a good team like Ohio State, it almost makes the season kind of worth it.   Just to go out with a high note, for those young guys to go into the off‑season.  
   
 Q.   Andre, you came in highly touted as a game changer when you first got to Florida.   You had to do just that today to close out the season, what did that mean to you?   
ANDRE DEBOSE:   It meant a lot to me.   I just tried to do anything that I can do to help the team.   You know, I just had an opportunity today to help the team a lot.   So it feels great.   There is no feeling like it.  
   
 Q.   Were you surprised with what John had to go through in terms of his injury and in terms of thing that's John has had to deal with.   Changing offensive line and skill guys all around him, what he's had to endure this season and the way he goes out?   Maybe about his pro prospects as well?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Well, I think, first of all, John's a true Florida Gator.   He dreamed about playing in this program.   His father and his uncle played, and it was somewhere where he wanted to go to school to play football here and have a career here, regardless how football turns out, he's going to be successful in life because of the way he was raised by his family.   
A lot of guys in our society nowadays when things don't go their way, the easiest thing to do is point a finger rather than look in the mirror.   A lot of times it's very difficult in our society nowadays for people to take the high road in a lot of situations.   I tell you, John's done that.   
It's not always fair being the quarterback.   I always say there is no different position than any other position that is‑‑ that's not really true.   It is different.   You've got all eyes on you, and you get way too much credit when things go right, and way too much blame when things go wrong.   
So from that standpoint, John handles it.   He doesn't complain.   He doesn't point fingers.   He handles it, and takes the criticism and moves to the next game.   
So from that standpoint, it hasn't been around other situations where it wasn't that way, it's refreshing to have a young guy in our society that's willing to do that.   And I think he'll have an opportunity to play on Sunday.   I think somebody will give him that opportunity.   
Again, it's not always John's fault or the quarterback's fault.   We've got to play better in some other areas and put our guys in situations to be successful.  
   
 Q.   Just injuries from the game, starting with Xavier Nixon?  
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Yeah, Xavier's going to be okay.   He just tweaked a knee there, and Chaz will be fine.   He got an ankle.   Chris Johnson had ribs, and we got a little thin there at offensive tackle.   
I asked Frank if he wanted me to dress out, and he said no.   And Jaylen Watkins came back in the game, but he got banged up there.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the play of Jonathan Bostic today ?  
COACH MUSCHAMP:   Jon's played very well all year.   He's played really well all year.   He's been very consistent.   We put an awful lot on the Mike linebacker as far as making calls and getting in and out calls.   They do a nice job of shifting in the game.   They were transferring the tight end and change of formation.   They did a really nice job of that.   
I thought Jon had a great command of what we were trying to do.   That wasn't just today.   He's done it all year.   He's been very consistent all year, he and Jelani both.   
   
 Q.   Would you talk about the game plan with your defensive line and how you were able to get people free that you haven't been able to do early in the year?   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   We did a nice job.   Dan does a nice job every week of creating some one‑on‑ones, and the guys want one‑on‑one blocks.   They're a big offensive line.   They were leaning on us in the run game.   They created separation in the run game and did a nice job of it and created holes from early.   
But if we can get them into loose‑down situations, second and third and long and create some one-on-ones, and Dan did a nice job of that.  
   
 Q.   Andre, I think it's three career kickoff returns for touchdowns.   Can you just talk about your knack for that and how you developed into that role?   
ANDRE DEBOSE:   It did take a lot of practice and just believing in your blockers and believing in your coach.   Our coach really pushed it into us on special teams and how important it is.   I take pride in being a specialist and just, you know, going as hard as I can for the team.  
   
 Q.   Andre, on that kickoff, did you have any trouble fielding it and catching it?   
ANDRE DEBOSE:   The way we were aligned, they kind of kicked it over my head, so I had to adjust a little bit.   But it wasn't too bad at all.  
   
 Q.   John, you mentioned kind of not being everything you hoped and some ups and downs?   How do you hope you'll be remembered in your time here?   
JOHN BRANTLEY:   Not so much how they'll remember me, but I'm not the only one out there.   My teammates and the seniors that we went out on a positive note.   These young guys who have years to come here in Florida and they keep building off this win, and they've got a bright future ahead of them.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible).   
JOHN BRANTLEY:   Yeah, I mean, that's a good possibility, but those guys have been loyal to us and loyal to the program.   I'm definitely going to miss playing on Saturday, that's for sure.  
   
 Q.   John, you got to end your career in a game playing.   Your dad ended his career with an injury.   Scotty ended his career with an injury.   How important was it for you to be on the field and actually play and end your career?   
JOHN BRANTLEY:   I got one up on them, I guess.   
COACH MUSCHAMP:   He's a lot tougher than his dad and Scotty.  
JOHN BRANTLEY:   That's for sure.   Don't let Scott fool you (laughing).
