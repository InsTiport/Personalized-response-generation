<p>	Q.  (No microphone.)</p>



<p>	Q.  Tommy, why are the participants in a fight not identified?  Why is that not subject to video review? </p>
<p>	Q.  On the plays you determined are not reviewable, for instance like the pass interference, "Nothing we can do about that," why? </p>
<p>	Q.  What will be the format in Bowl games?  You said non-conference opponents can have a choice, but in Bowl games? </p>

<p>	Q.  For either of you, are you comfortable whether it's a minute or 90 seconds, if it's an end-of-the-game play, for lack of a better example, had there been instant replay in '95, had replay shown that Warrick Dunn actually made it in, could you have actually reversed it at that point?  People are on the field. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a cost estimate for the replay systems, personnel?  Have you hired all of your replay officials?  How many of them are there? </p>

<p>	Q.  Tommy, your clip showed two clips of the Virginia/Fresno State game.  There was a play at the end of regulation where the receiver was thought to have gone out of bounds and come back in.  Just want to confirm, do you know the play to which I'm referring? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will coaches and offenses have any opportunity to hurry up and run a play if they think the call is going to go against them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you say there was a minimum of four cameras? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could there be a situation where some places have four cameras and some have eight? </p>
<p>	Q.  Intentional grounding in terms of the tackle box is not reviewable? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why is that any different?  It's a positional thing compared to something like a goal line or backward pass.  Why is this an exception to that positional-type ruling? </p>




<p>	Q.  There have been instances obviously in which you had to come into the office on Monday, look at a whole bunch of stuff for a controversial call, ascertain if they got it right.  Will all these analyses be able to be made instantaneously or will there still be instances where you have to come in the office and huddle with people and look at film all day to make a call? </p>
<p>	Q.  John, could you bring us up to speed on the progress, if any, on discussions between ESPN and various cable systems regarding ESPNU, which I know has several ACC games this year.  Negotiations regarding cable companies and ESPN? </p>
