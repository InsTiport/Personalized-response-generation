 Q.  Talk about today, your players definitely showed a lot of grit in the second half?  
DAVID BAILIFF: You know, there's a lot of -- you hate losing.  But there's a lot of obstacles we hit this week, and some of these kids really had a very gutty performance to even come out here and play.   
We've just got to get some guys back, get healthy, learn from this one.  Got FAU coming to town.  But we do, we need some guys back.  We need to get that -- we need to just, like I said, learn from it, keep improving.  This one's a hard game.  It's a hard lesson, but some of these guys, I'm quite proud of.   
 Q.  You have a lot of freshmen that played their first football today because of injury, sickness, etc.?  
DAVID BAILIFF: You look out there sometimes defensively there's five of them.  But it's football.  You don't win with a healthy club.  We've got to step up and it up to us as coaches to get them ready to go.   
 Q.  I'm sure you challenged them at half-time, several guys came out and definitely we could see they were playing all the way through four quarters?  
DAVID BAILIFF: I tell you, a couple of them came out here in the first quarter and that stomach virus hit them.  They just kept trying to play and they kept trying to play and just, you know, we've got to get all that stuff behind us.  We've got to keep improving and we've got to try to get a win at home next week.
