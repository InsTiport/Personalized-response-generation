Q. (On Spencer Sanders.)
CHUBA HUBBARD: Sometimes he's a little hard on himself. He's still a young player, so you can't point fingers at anyone. He did a great job, and I support him 100 percent as my quarterback. But you know, we'll just take this as a learning lesson. I know he will, and he'll be better next week and I'll be better next week, as well.
Q. Did you anticipate as much pressure as they were putting on you up front?
CHUBA HUBBARD: I mean, yeah. I mean, I expected a lot of that. I mean, I knew they were going to try to shut down Tyler and load up the box and stuff like that. That's just how it is. We've got to be able to work with that. You know, we'll be okay. Live and learn, right?
Q. What kind of pride was there in the way you guys did fight at the end?
CHUBA HUBBARD: Yeah, I mean, that's one thing, we hold ourselves to play to the end of the whistle. We did a great job, obviously. It was just a little too late, and I wish we brought that a little earlier. But you know, I'm proud of my boys. They're fighters, they're warriors, and I'm lucky and blessed to be on this team to be able to fight with these guys.
Q. What were they doing up front to get pressure? Was it different stuff than what you guys had seen on film or fairly similar?
CHUBA HUBBARD: I mean, every week a team has their own new thing. You know, they just did a great job. We came out slow, like I said, and you can't do that in the Big 12. Teams get out fast. Like I said, live and learn, and we've just got to be better next week.
