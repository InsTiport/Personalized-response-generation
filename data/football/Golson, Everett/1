Q.   Everett, (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   It definitely hurts.   I think it hurts more so for the seniors, my classmates, guys who don't have another year.   That's how they kind of leave.   That's their lasting impression at Notre Dame Stadium.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, he just said obviously he loved us.   He's proud of the way our guys fought.   I think that was the consensus message from him and Coach Kelly is that we did a good job controlling our attitude and our ethics.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I mean, it hurts.   It hurts.

Q.   What went right on the first two possessions in the third quarter, and then everything after that? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think we definitely got back to running the ball a little bit more.   I think that opened up a couple things for us.   We had a couple run‑pass options where they were going five in the box and we were running the ball and getting some good yardage.   I think that's what went well for us.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   It's cool.   I'm good.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, but, no.   I mean, I think we did some stuff to hurt ourselves.   I mean, you can't take it away.   They're a good defense.   They do pretty good things.   No. 3, he does some good things.   So they definitely are a good defense, but I think we kind of shot ourselves in the foot a little bit.

Q.   Talk about Will (No microphone).   He seemed to come up big for you guys again today.   Talk about having him? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I said it before.   Will is a dog.   I mean, in crunch situations, in crunch time he's going to ball out.   I think he did a great job for us today.

Q.   Did you see that touchdown he made? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I did.   I did.   That's kind of one of those things where I was thinking I get Corey Robinson, my 6'5" guy a shot.   The guy tipped it, and you see Will come out of nowhere and take it.

Q.   What do you talk to the younger players about keeping their heads up? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I mean, I can say some clichÃ© things, but I think everybody just has to keep their head up.   We've got a lot of young guys that have a lot of potential.   Going back to your question, just a test of what Ken was saying in his message, we have a lot of potential.   It's kind of one of those things where it's kind of heartbreaking for us to lose, but you can't stay down because we do have so much talent.   We've got to still play with confidence.   We've got to still play aggressive.   I think if we do that, like I said, the talent is there, so I think that will kind of show itself.

Q.   Have you ever lost to them before? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   No, this is a first for me.

Q.   How do you describe the feelings? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I don't know.   Like I said, I don't like losing at all.   That's kind of one of those things.   But you've got to, I guess, take it in stride and see the positives from it.   I still say day‑in and day‑out I love our team.   I think we fight hard.   Maybe we just definitely got to come with it a little bit more in the first quarter and not put ourselves in holes and then try to come back from it.

Q.   What are some of the positives that you can take away from this? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   The attitude.   I think I guess one of the first times I saw just the energy on the sideline, Breezy getting hyped.   He made some tremendous catches today too.   So I think he did a great job.   Just seeing kind of all the young guys around me and how bad they want it, I think that inspires me.

Q.   Coach Kelly said that the snap looked like a bad hold.   Will you talk to him at all? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I talked to him vaguely about it.   I think he took accountability for it.   I think like I said, that's one of the messages you want to really try to get from him as a quarterback, you have to take responsibility for it.   So I think he's done that.   You know, he still progresses, so he's going to be good.

Q.   Was he frustrated at all? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I wasn't in his mind, but it's a big pressure moment.   Like I said, he's still progressing.   He's still getting there, but I think the most important thing for him is for me to just keep a positive mental state.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, like I said.   He took accountability for it.   So, like I said, that was a positive in itself.

Q.   The touchdown, what did you see, how did the play break down with the catch by Will? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I was trying to get out and give my 6'5" wide receiver a chance.   Ended up not going that way and tipped ball.   That is kind of one of those things where you're taking a big risk, especially during that time.   But I think it was something that we probably needed at that time.   But like I said, Will came out of nowhere and made a great play.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Oh, yeah.   I mean, I think our relationship is definitely‑‑ those guys are like my brothers.   I came in early.   I was kind of between with those guys being in their first years and things like that.   So like I said, it just really hurts for us not to bring one out for them.

Q.   That moment when you get to run out there and hug your family.   What's that moment like? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, it's a great moment, for sure.   It's a great moment.   My mom doesn't get up to too many games, so just seeing them on the field.   Usually she'll send me a text or something like that too, just some advice or something like that.   She was there in person to actually give it to me on the field, so that was a special moment for me.

Q.   What was it? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   Just basically told me to have fun and take care of the ball.   She always tells me to take care of the ball, so I've definitely got to do a better job of that.

Q.   (No microphone)?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Simple as that.   You can't correct the past.   You've got to move forward and continue striving for greatness, really.   Like I said, you can't correct the past, so you've just got to move forward.
