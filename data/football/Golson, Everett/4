MICHIGAN   0
  NOTRE DAME - 31

THE MODERATOR:   We'll get started with questions for the players. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   It feels amazing, just the preparation, it's an amazing feeling.   And we got 24 hours to really enjoy the victory and then the next game's Purdue. 

Q.   What does it mean to you to take out Michigan in the final game?
JAYLON SMITH:   It means everything.   A great rivalry coming to an end.   At least in our era. 
And, especially, I have a brother that plays for Ohio State and they hate Michigan, so it really goes to show upon a family, the fact that we can get the victory.

Q.   And how important was it that you won the last game?
JAYLON SMITH:   It felt amazing.   They haven't had a goose egg since 1984.   So that alone‑‑ we're setting our own standards here, and it's an amazing feeling.

Q.   How do you feel about playing out against Purdue?
JAYLON SMITH:   Just to go back on Monday and correct our mental errors, and just to get better in all aspect.   It's not about who we play, it's about our execution and how we're doing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   Yeah, it was just getting our cleats in the ground.   First series, you're really not that loose. 
And it's just really all about calming down and after the game settles in, after that first drive, we were pretty good to go. 

Q.   How much did you want to beat these guys and make this last game last for a real long time?
JAYLON SMITH:   Even the fact that it was a home game, we don't want to lose.   Especially at home.   With a great crowd, 80,000 plus, just an amazing feeling out there tonight. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   Well, Coach Kelly says it all the time.   It's not about rising to the opposition, we had to sink to the level of our preparation.   So, it was done during the week.   Our preparation was incredible.   Rushing for the ball and really just keeping that tempo up. 

Q.   How does this feel right now?
JAYLON SMITH:   It feels great to be 2‑0.   We didn't have the chance last year to be 2‑0, right away.   So, it's just a great feeling.   We're going to enjoy it.

Q.   So much was made of the end of the rivalry for now, to make this kind of statement, what does that mean for you guys to give this to your fans?
JAYLON SMITH:   Just the fact that we're together.   There's not individuals on this team.   We're young, but we can do it.   There were a lot of errors that we can still clean up and get better at.   And that's what we hope to do. 

Q.   How special was that win?
JAYLON SMITH:   That atmosphere was great.   It was surreal.   Last year we were in the big house playing Michigan.   So, to actually be home, seeing all your family there, it was amazing. 

Q.   You don't remember hearing the chicken dance, but you heard the na, na, na, na. 
JAYLON SMITH:   I definitely heard that.

Q.   What was that like to hear that?
JAYLON SMITH:   Well, after you guys interviewed me about the chicken dance, I actually asked some of the players that actually heard it, and they told me about it.   So, hearing the na, na, na, tonight, it was just a great revenge. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   Yeah, was just ‑‑ we come into each game with a huge inventory.   Some things may even be confusing to others, and it's just all about execution. 
There's so much stuff that we have in our game plan, but if we can't execute it, then we're definitely defeated in that area. 

Q.   There's a lot of young players on this team.   How difficult is it for them to pick everything up?
JAYLON SMITH:   It's attention to detail.   It's not just the coaches that want it.   Ultimately it comes down to us. 
We're all eager to learn and improve our football IQ's.   And just doing stuff outside of football together, whether it's team bonding, or studying together.   It all boils down to the whole fact of being a team. 

Q.   A young defense and a new defensive coordinator.   Does that mean that your defense is maybe ahead of schedule?
JAYLON SMITH:   I would say it really just ceases all the doubts about we're young, can we execute. 
Things that we have to improve on, just the communication and really executing our jobs.   There were a lot of mental errors out there that the crowd may not see, but we're going to get better. 

Q.   You played with amazing energy all four quarters.   What was motivating you throughout the game, the fact that you were going nonstop and not getting sped up?
JAYLON SMITH:   It's just something that we live by.   You get what you earn.   We had to earn it.   We're not giving in.   We were up 21 or 28, at halftime, and it was all about the next play.   Eradicating everything.   Zero, zero. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   I'm not surprised.   Especially with the scheme and how everyone bought into it that they want.   It's a great feeling, just the fact that we can come together and really share this victory with our crowd. 

Q.   Defensive line seemed to get some pretty good pressure on the quarterback.   How much easier does that make your job?
JAYLON SMITH:   Very easy.   Way easier.   The fact that the opposition, they don't know who is coming at them. 
There's plays where both the middle linebackers are going.   And then there's plays where we're faking like we're going and then we're dropping. 
It's just the scheme and we all‑‑ we all buy into it.   And we have things, like I said, we have things that we need to correct, and we will.

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   Yes.   And it was preached to them the whole week.   You guys need to communicate.   We actually had a few theories in practice where we did all hand signals, no talk.   And I think it really helped just the fact that they're young players and they're maturing.   You can see it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   Attention to detail.   Physical play.   It was very crucial defense to the game of football.   And we really executed on that side.

Q.   (No microphone.)
JAYLON SMITH:   The third down was‑‑ it was key.   Getting to third down to where we can spread them out and do what we want, play on our terms. 
That is essentially what our objective is each and every series.   So, it's something that we were very fortunate to do tonight. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   I felt pretty good.   I think what you take from the day is the defense did a great, great, great job.   I thought they were great on the field. 
But, any time you can lead that group back out there on the scoreboard with such a talented offense that Michigan has, you're doing something pretty good. 

Q.   How bad did you guys want to beat them? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think we wanted it bad.   I think that we wanted to just be successful every time we step on the field. 
I like to think that it added a little bit extra motivation being the last time we play them.   But like I said, I'm just‑‑ my hat's off to the defense.   They did a great job today. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   I don't think so at all.   There's certain situations where I got to be smarter, like on third and one, where I need to be smarter.   I'm definitely happy for the win, but there's a lot of stuff that I got to do better. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   There's a lot of things that just mental mistakes that I got to be better on.   I just got to do a better job.

Q.   Talk about your offense efficiency. 
EVERETT GOLSON:   They're all just doing a great job.   Just coming up with big plays.   Just not turning the ball over.   You think that's where we need to be smart, understanding that we got a great kicker who can bail us out. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   He's doing a great job, man.   It's kind of funny when you go back and just think ‑‑ he's special. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think it's a different dynamic this year.   We want to play aggressive.   I think last year, last two years, we relied a lot on defense.   But we're definitely going to be more aggressive this year. 

Q.   You're off to a great start.   When they start singing na, na, na, na, what was that like for you guys?
EVERETT GOLSON:   That was big. 
(Laughter.)
I was disappointed they didn't do the D‑Boyz thing.   I don't know if they heard about that.   Y'all didn't hear about it?   So Matthias had them doing the D‑Boyz, but they didn't do it.   But they definitely gave great effort all night.   That kind of energized the team. 

Q.   Two years ago when you played obviously it was not your best game versus them.   Was there a little bit of redemption tonight playing well?
EVERETT GOLSON:   I talked about that earlier.   I think that really I just wanted to come out and do what our emphasis is, run our game plan.   I think the defense did a great job. 

Q.   How trick was the place and is that one of the moments where you go, hey, I'm really happy this all worked out to come back the way we did?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, definitely.   I credit my family and all that.   It all starts with God.   Just to allow me to be here to keep my head on straight the whole time.   It all starts with God. 

Q.   How electric was it out there?
EVERETT GOLSON:   It was pretty electric.   Pretty electric.   It was fun to play.   A fun atmosphere to play in. 

Q.   I know a lot of people are already throwing around the word Heisman with your name.   What does that mean to kind of maybe have you thrown in there?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Avoid the noise.   Avoid the noise.   People are going to talk, that type of thing, whether it's good or bad, but you got to keep your head on what really matters is my guys around me, that's where it starts.   I don't know if I really necessarily hear it. 

Q.   Purdue on the schedule.   Another great test.   What do you guys do to keep this thing rolling?
EVERETT GOLSON:   Got to take care of business.   Got to prepare, we got to execute, things like that.   But I think that one of the things about being Notre Dame is everybody is going to get up for playing you.   So you have to, you can't just throw your jersey on and you got to come with it every time you step on the field.

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   Oh, I think that I mean I think that that was just me understanding a lot more what we want, what Michigan is doing, things like that.   So just taking advantage of the things that we can take advantage of.

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   The edge, to be honest.   (No microphone.)

Q.   Were you surprised that it was 31‑0, that you shut these guys out? 
EVERETT GOLSON:   No, I think that we have the potential for‑‑ you look at the scoreboard at the end, it was kind of a sense, I guess it was surprising, but like I said, just credit the defense.   They did a great job tonight. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   Definitely I seen him grow, for sure.   I think that we have all grown that just comes from preparation, whether it's as spending late nights in the film room, just getting on the same page, things like that.   I think that they have all come along pretty well. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   All season.   All season.   Just trying to get the work in, really.   You talk about those guys, I mean, it's good.   They had a lot of work in the off‑season.   They worked hard to understand each other, understand where both guys are in routes and things like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think it definitely was.   I think at the end of the game it was. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   Amir has definitely come a long way.   This is his first year playing wide receiver.   So he's definitely come a long way.   He has to learn a lot of new things.   But he's done a great job. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   It helps a lot, for sure.   I had someone in my face a couple of times, but just knowing where he's at, knowing how he's going to run his routes it really helps.

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   I saw that they were looking for it.   So I like to see that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   They have really done a great job.   I think that his, especially by him with his speed, and then on top of that, he can run routes, get in and out of his break, so I think he does a great job. 
It's really kind of, it's kind of scary how that if I was that corner it would be scary for me, just knowing how versatile he is. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah.   That's what I'm saying.   Yeah.   So, I mean, he's done a great job.   Just getting in and out of his break, I think on that one he was just patient with it and he kind of worked him over a little bit.   And then he got in and out of his break.   So he's done a great job with that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   It was really just trying to take advantage of what the defense gives.   It just so happens that we came out on top. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   You could just spread it around.   It's difficult. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
EVERETT GOLSON:   It does in the sense that we're 2‑0 now.   So, I'm definitely happy about it.   I'm going to celebrate, but I'm not going to say that it wasn't really a big thing.   But I'm definitely happy about the win, but you still got to move on.   I think that you never want to get complacent.   It's nice to win, but you move on.
