EVERETT GOLSON:   Happy to be back out there.   We showed our character, what we want to be on offense and how offense is going to be electric and I think we were electric today.   But there's still some stuff we have to clean up.  
   
 Q.   How confident were you feeling?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Pretty confident.   I was thinking to myself earlier, it felt completely different than 2012.   
   
 Q.   Coach Kelly said something about not want to go over‑coach you.   Do you understand what he was talking about and do you like that?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I think so.   I think Coach Kelly trusts me a lot due to the fact that I've shown a lot of progress and he kind of gives me a little bit more hands‑on and allows me to come to him‑‑ have a conversation‑‑ telling me what to do.   
   
 Q.   And he said he wants to call it a trick play, the one where Bryant went a different way from the hand‑off.   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I'll agree.   I'll agree.   Yeah, I just think‑‑ tried to make something happen (Laughter).   
   
 Q.   That kind of worked out, seemed like all of a sudden Rice was back on their heels.   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I think it was a good play to be honest.   I was a little fortunate.   I think Rodney put me in a little bit‑‑ the line did a great job, as well.   
   
 Q.   When you first heard the crowd roar and your name on the speaker, what was that like?  
EVERETT GOLSON:   That was big.   That goes back to the community we've got here and supporting‑‑ it was good and it was kind of‑‑ just kind of a sense of accomplishment at the beginning, just knowing that everything is transpiring and I'm back here now.   So it was a good feeling.  
   
 Q.   How much fun are you having out there with touchdowns‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   It was good.   It was fun now.   
   
 Q.   When you think about next week's opponent and the fans are going to be buzzing, what's going through your head now with Michigan?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Just to prepare.   We've got to prepare for Michigan just like we did Rice.   I don't think I get into all of the hype of the game and things like that.   But at the same time, you have to take care of business and you have to prepare.   Michigan got a great football team.   It's going to be a tough one but I'm ready for it.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
EVERETT GOLSON:   You have to.   Coming here, Michigan‑‑ inaudible.   
   
 Q.   What did you feel like you accomplished working‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think I needed to polish a lot of things.   There was a couple throws where I stayed in there and made a throw.   That's what is in my mind now, but I think just being ‑‑ more on timing I think a lot of stuff today, I was kind of getting out of the pocket and making plays and having the guy scramble and things like that.   Definitely going to get the timing down and be more precise.   
   
 Q.   The big plays in the pocket‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think the emphasis for us was just to go vertical.   The first couple drives, we didn't do that necessarily.   But yeah, we worked on vertical this week and we got the tools to do it.   Once you got a the chance‑‑ to be successful.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think I felt pretty comfortable from the beginning.   I don't know if you necessarily told me‑‑ like I said before, that's one of those things where you've just got to stay at it.   I think he did a great job of doing that and came out pretty good.   
   
 Q.   When you went away for that long‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I had to.   I think that's what inspired me to do all the training and all those days of me just working out by myself.   I'm looking forward now.   I think that's what helped me.   
   
 Q.   What felt different versus two years ago?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I have to say confidence.   I think there's areas where I could clean up, like I was just talking about with footwork and things like that.   But I think overall confidence.  
   
 Q.   The last four or five days, picking things up a notch‑‑ why did that happen in the last week?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I guess maturing and understanding what they were doing.   It goes back to me‑‑ the coaches getting me ready for the game.   So I think that's what allowed me to be so confident.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel differently this week?  
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, yeah.   
Yeah, man, it was definitely good.   We kind of called it payday.   You know, you go through all the spring, through all the cold and everything for a moment like this.   It's definitely payday for us.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
EVERETT GOLSON:   It was definitely good.   I was just thankful for my teammates.   They came out with a lot of enthusiasm.   They played loose and because of that, I think that's why we were successful.  
   
 Q.   You talked about getting more comfortable running the ball, but your rushing touchdowns today, was that a different feeling for you today running the football?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I don't think‑‑ I can't really describe it.   It's kind of one of those things for me, cool, everything breaks down, you've got to go.   You've got to make something happen today with the coverages they were playing.   
   
 Q.   The third touchdown, what happened on that play?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I guess I just‑‑ didn't want to hit it off‑‑ inaudible.   
   
 Q.   While you were away‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I appreciate that it.   I think, yeah, like I said, it's preparation so I gained confidence, really taking the time to study film and really taking time to study my mechanics.   It gave me confidence.   
   
 Q.   Sometimes we want you to play more freely and not think as much and just run around and be an athlete; do you feel more free to do your own thing and make plays than maybe in past years?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think so.   It goes back to the knowledge‑‑ couple times where we would take a run from the inside to the other.   Just comes from me being more knowledgeable and guys wanting me to be more knowledgeable about it and everybody being on the same page.   
   
 Q.   First play, 75 yards, the touchdown pass to Will Fuller, can you talk about what you saw in that one?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Definitely he ran a post.   Will is a guy with tremendous speed.   I definitely didn't want to over‑throw.   So I kind of throw him over to the middle instead and he made a good play.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned confidence‑‑ getting outside the pocket, is it better now with the offense‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I think so.   I think we have better knowledge that allowed me to stay in a there a bit longer.   I saw a couple things where they were three down‑‑ just goes back to preparation.   They are going three down‑‑ I knew if they were doing a certain coverage, I wasn't going to have nothing, so you have to make a play.   
Like I said the coaches did a great job of preparing us well for this game.   You kind of go, I like call it ‑‑ get the ball move quicker because you know exactly what you're getting.  
   
 Q.   A couple players talk about the first hit in their first game back‑‑ was it just like, all right, shrug it off and let's go, now I'm back?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I can't even remember‑‑ I don't know, I like to think of myself as kind of a tough guy.   I mean, a lot of that stuff is kind of dirty, me getting hit and things like that.   Like we came in at half‑time and it's like, oh, yeah, saw you got hit, that type of thing.   But yeah, it was definitely good to get back out there.   
   
 Q.   Seeing yourself as a passing quarterback, when did it become almost instinctive for you?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Yeah, I think like I said, just knowing the coverage, knowing what you've got.   If you don't have anything, a lot of things they are doing‑‑ they drop eight a lot, so when they do that, open things up for the quarterback so I just try to take advantage of that.   
   
 Q.   Take me through the long touchdown to Will and what you saw.   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Basically quarter was up and Will did a great job just kind of subbing and I was cutting and‑‑ like I said, Will is one of those guys with tremendous speed and once you get an open field, you've definitely got to give him the ball.  
   
 Q.   How great can the offense be when it finds this type of balance?  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think it can be really good.   Like you said, Greg had a great day‑‑ a couple big runs.  
   
 Q.   I know you guys don't look ahead and take it one day at a time, but a big one next week, talk about how the expectations and attitudes change?  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think we are going to prepare just as we did this week.   I've always tried to prepare the same way and we understand that it's Michigan obviously and it's going to be a great team but you have to prepare the same way as you would any other team.  
   
 Q.   The field was a little wet; did it work well?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   It was good for me.   I grew up with turf back home, so it was kind of one of those things that I was happy for.   So it was good for me.   
I think it helps us be more diverse in what we do‑‑ the backs that we have, allow us to be very diverse and play‑‑ we can play any type of weather, can control the tempo of the game, whether it's going fast or whether it's slowing it down.   I think that is what helps us a lot and to be really diverse.   
   
 Q.   What about what a play breaks down and it's not open‑‑ you have a wide open field, how are you communicating?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   It's not really‑‑ it's something that you can't ‑‑ I like to think it's a thing ‑‑ you can't teach.   It's one of those things that in the off‑season, that's what builds that.   It's kind of one of those things that's just, get open‑‑ it's just find a way to get open.   I've seen a couple of times where they are running, I'll cut and run and take it all the way back and they just come into my business.   So I think we do a great job of that, just getting open and being more disbursed with doing that.   
   
 Q.   Do you try to make eye contact?   How does that work?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   Just really get open and throw your hand up or whatever it is‑‑ see them getting open and stuff like that.   
   
 Q.   When did you think you earned that‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   I do not know.   I don't know at all.   
   
 Q.   He said it was in camp, you learned how to protect‑‑  
EVERETT GOLSON:   That's a privilege.   That's a privilege to finally not‑‑ for sure.   I think it just comes with him trusting me a little bit more and me having more knowledge about the game, that type of thing and me being a little bit older.   I think he trusts me a little bit more and so I think that allows him to kind of take the reins off a little bit.   
   
 Q.   Coach Kelly mentioned you had a lack of discipline in the spring game.   What's changed?   
EVERETT GOLSON:   I think me trying to be more polished.   I think in the spring, a lot of things more moving for me, just getting back, that type of thing and timing wasn't necessarily the best.   But that's why you have the off‑season and that's why you have that time to really‑‑ and learn things like that.
