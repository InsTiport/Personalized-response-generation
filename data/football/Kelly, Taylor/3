ARIZONA STATE   28
      STANFORD - 44

Q.   What can you say about what happened here tonight? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   Stanford's a great football team.   They're well‑disciplined, and we couldn't get things going in the first half.   Penalties, dropped balls, missed reads, my turnover was huge.   We've just got to bounce back.   We've got SC and then the South.   That's one of our biggest game this is season to play SC.   Hopefully, we'll see them again in the Pac‑12 Championship.

Q.   What happened on that play that was intercepted? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   I was trying to throw it away.   I just couldn't get enough on it, and I should have just put it down at the feet of the running back.

Q.   What was the message Coach had for you guys afterwards?
    TAYLOR KELLY:   He's proud of how we worked and how we fought back from adversity.   Gave a lot of credit to Stanford and how well they're coached.   They've got a great football team, great program.   They've got good things going for them right now.

Q.   Why do you think there was such a contrast between the first half and the second?   It looked like almost two different teams for you guys. 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   We just had to get first downs.   That was the big thing.   We just couldn't get things moving.   Once we started getting a little tempo going and finishing drives, we had that second score, and guys just kept getting that momentum and kept feeding off each other.

Q.   It seemed like you guys couldn't get the running game going.   How much is that hurt you now? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   It's hurting us a little bit, but we've got great wide receivers on the outside.   They've got to pick their poison what they want to stop.   And Jaelen is one of the dynamic receivers and he's proven himself.   Same thing with Chris Coyle and Marion and D.J., we've got to keep giving them the rock.   They keep stacking the box on us, so they have to pick their poison.

Q.   What was it with you and Jaelen tonight?   You really had something working. 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   He's very ball friendly.   He knows how to give me and save me room on the sideline.   We work after practice every day just on fades and curls.   Just timing routes.   So he's going to be something special.

Q.   How encouraged were you by this game for you guys even though you guys came back to get the win? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   I'm very proud of my guys.   They fought back being down 39‑7 or something like that.   That's one of the big adversities and how our team handles it.   We fought back, and got the momentum going in the second half.   I'm proud of my defense and offensive line.   We've just got to get ready to work and get ready for SC.

Q.   I know you guys put a lot on this game.   It's kind of the first big game.   It's a letdown, but you don't really have time to sulk or anything.   How do you put this behind you and move on? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   We've got to move on to SC.   They're behind us.   They're in the North.   So it doesn't affect us too much.   But it's Pac‑12 play.   We've got SC and they're in the South.   So that's the big game further.   We've got to focus on that.

Q.   How physical were they up front? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   They were very physical.   They got a great front seven.   Their D‑line is fast and big, and we had some problems with it, but we've got to‑‑ they've got a great football team.

Q.   Are they doing anything different tonight? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   They were doing some good things with their twists up front, and just kind of bringing the pressure a little bit.   But they're just well‑coached.

Q.   The response in the second half, does that give you guys anything moving forward versus had you just kind of maybe collapsed in the second half? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   It does.   It's how our team is.   Once the fourth quarter is ours, so we've got to fight back.   Our team‑‑ I didn't ever think that we were going to not get going eventually.   Our team fights through everything.   That's something different than last year.   We've just got to keep going and move on to SC.

Q.   What happened on the punt you had blocked there? 
    TAYLOR KELLY:   I just put it too low.   Just kind of low.   They kind of got back.   It was my fault.   It was a bad punt.
