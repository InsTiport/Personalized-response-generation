<p>	Q.  Ben Hartsock talked about just the repetition this has become this week and what it's like.  He made a reference to Groundhog Day.  Do you guys feel that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do practices seem the same though?  I mean you do a press conference every day.  Is it getting repetitious for you, Will?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, you've pretty much got a big challenge in terms of Roscoe Parrish.  Is there any game plan in terms of how to eliminate his productivity?</p>
<p>	Q.  For either Will and Darrion:  We keep hearing about Miami's speed; can you talk about whomever impressed you with speed as compared to what you heard about Miami?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the fastest team you played?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, what's the mood of this team right now two days before the game?</p>

<p>	Q.  A lot of guys in this room said the Big 10 conference is not very good this year.  Any sense of pride by you on how the other Big 10 teams do in the other bowl games?</p>
<p>	Q.  Darrion, will you guys watch bowl games today?</p>

<p>	Q.  Penn State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Darrion, the perception among us is that Miami is loaded offensively.  As you look at it on film, is it scary to watch; what is your impression overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you go into the game at this point confident about playing them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, talk about the season, how long it's been?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, I'm sure you saw some film with the Florida State game, Miami and that last kick that went wide left.  Did you see that and what was your reaction, what were you thinking?  Were you feeling a little bit bad for the kicker?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you like to be put in that position?  Would you like to have a game on your foot in the final seconds?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will, same question Darrion answered about the impression of Miami being so awesome in offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will, do you have to do anything differently defensively?  Have you changed any defensive schemes that you had during the regular season?</p>



<p>	Q.  Starting with Mike, how did you guys celebrate the   new year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will, did you celebrate at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much time do you get to spend with your family at this time?</p>
