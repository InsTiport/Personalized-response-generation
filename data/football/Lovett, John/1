Liberty - 48, Baylor - 45   
 Q.  How do you take the loss?  This has to be tough for you.  
JOHN LOVETT: It's a team loss, so we're going to get after it Monday, get back to practice, refocus, UTSA next.   
 Q.  Do you think about their physical nature, speed, size, surprise you?  
JOHN LOVETT: Nothing surprised me tonight.  It was just a game.  Give credit to Liberty University.  They're a really good team.   
 Q.  Can you take any positive, you made your college debut tonight, you scored, are you able to at all reflect on this, do you think and enjoy the fact that you did do that even though it came with a bad result?  
JOHN LOVETT: I mean, like I think of it as like normal, so I don't get too excited about that, because I think that should happen, we practice for that to happen and that's what is going to happen.  So I don't get too excited about that.   
 Q.  What was your reaction when they voted you a single digit as a freshman?  
JOHN LOVETT: I mean I was shocked.  I was just surprised that like the team noticed all the work that I was putting in and everything I was doing for them.  I appreciate them a lot.  I love them.   
 Q.  Does that number mean anything to you?  
JOHN LOVETT: Yes, it means everything.   
 Q.  What's the number 7?  Is that a background thing or?  
JOHN LOVETT: Oh, well.   
 Q.  Any special?  
JOHN LOVETT: Where I'm from New Jersey that's the number to get right there.  Everyone in New Jersey wants number 7.   
 Q.  Is there a reason why?  
JOHN LOVETT: I don't know why.  I just like the number too.  I had number 7 since Pop Warner, so.  My old Panther days.
