LENOY JONES, JR.: (No microphone) shift, just a tough dude and I respect that very much.   
 Q.  I talked to (indiscernible) about it.  This defense, you think back to what you were at the beginning of the year.  How much better have you gotten, the defense?  
LENOY JONES, JR.: Oh, my gosh.  I feel like the leadership spoke up and we all got together.  I mean, like I said, we got to step it up and play our games.  Play like little kids, have fun and play fast.   
 Q.  Obviously, you didn't want T.Y. to get hurt.  How much can something like this help you in terms of getting this kind of experience playing that spot?  Help you going into next year.  
LENOY JONES, JR.: Being a leader because I'll be an old guy next year.  I've got two years after this.  Just learning from T.Y., and he taught me how to be a leader definitely.   
 Q.  How much do you hurt for the seniors not winning today, not getting to get them a win today?  
LENOY JONES, JR.: Man, it hurts.  It hurts big-time.  But, I mine, next year, when seniors come back to see us, they're going to be like they started this process.
