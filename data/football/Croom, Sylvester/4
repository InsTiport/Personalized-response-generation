<p>	Q.  A lot of stories this year around the NCC, about kids getting in various amounts trouble.  Could you just talk about how you deal with that and how you deal with trying to avoid that among your players?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about philosophy you implemented, discipline, that sort of thing.  Did you anticipate the fallout numbers wise that you would incur if you did accept that it might hurt you in the short run in wins an losses?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Jerious Norwood and just the job he did last season for you and what you are expecting from him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  All the movement with players from different positions going everywhere, is that a function of a young program and you guys trying to figure out who is going to go where; is that something you see as a future pattern for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  This time last year you were having so many interviews and answering so many questions about the historical significance of your hiring.  Have those type of interviews decreased now; is it more about X's and O's?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up, having been through it -- what advice would give to new coaches coming into this League, what was unexpected to you in the first year of competition?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the position changes, is there a common thread or theme that goes through like to get more speed on the field, guys who maybe have smaller frames for those positions moving into guys with big positions for bigger frames, any kind of thread like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the spotlight not so much on you this year, from like the media attention that stuff, it will likely shift to Jerious Norwood.  Are you happy that he's going to get this kind of attention and how will he handle it being in the spotlight this year more so?</p>
<p>	Q.  As someone who came from the NFL for a long time I was wondering if the new replay system, would you prefer to have coaches challenge or have it done up in the booth?</p>
<p>	Q.  What went into your sales plan to get your players to do the things the Bulldog way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about your recovery from your knee surgery; how that's going?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know because we talked about it when you took the job you knew how hard it was and how hard it was going to be.  You have done it for a year; is it harder than you felt or --</p>
<p>	Q.  Quality of personnel aside, you played on two National Championships teams.  What were the intangibles present in the Alabama program at that time perhaps when you went into Mississippi State last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You really had to change the mindset?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your thoughts on whether more contact with the players during the offseason, more organized activities in that time will help solve these off-field issues?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year you said you hoped to get 10 to 15 percent of the West -- how much did you actually get installed last year, what are you expecting this year as far as percentage-wise talking about how Omarr has improved?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Eric Butler's emergence last year and his role maybe this year in the offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your first recruiting class until now has the strategy changed more regional, talk about that development of that strategy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Amazingly my question is about the academic progress.  Earlier you were talking about discipline.  Do you think that the fact that if you run too many kids off, you can actually lose those scholarship down the road and even perhaps -- will that affect the way people do things and how will you address it?</p>
<p>	Q.  With a year under your belt were there things coming in that you wanted to do offensively, defensively that you weren't able to do?</p>
