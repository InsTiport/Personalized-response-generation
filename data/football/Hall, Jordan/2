 Q. Talk about that kickoff return real quick, what did you see, et cetera.
 JORDAN HALL: I mean, I ran up the middle. I seen the lane to the right, hit the lane. Kind of mad I didn't finish it off, but we scored on the drive.

 Q. This is two weeks in a row where you really had it going, last week in Miami you weren't able to finish it out because of the cramping and stuff you were dealing in the second half. How good did it feel to put in four quarters to get it done and get better and pick up yards?
 JORDAN HALL: It definitely felt good to be out there the whole game because last week felt like I let my team down because I couldn't play in the second half. So it definitely felt good.

 Q. Are you going to get any ribbing about not finishing that kickoff, and also talk about what your special teams did and the fact they didn't even kick to you on punt? 
 JORDAN HALL: I mean -- ask that again.

 Q. Is anybody give you any ribbing maybe in the film room about not finishing off the kickoff, and the fact they're not punting to you, does that show you you're doing pretty well?
 JORDAN HALL: They already said what they had to say on the sidelines. So I ain't worried about it. What was the second question? 

 Q. About the punt, they're not punting to you guys, just kicking it out of bounds, off to the side. 
 JORDAN HALL: Coach says we want to use special teams as a weapon. I think if they have to kick it out of bounds there's a chance they could mis-hit it and have good field position for an offensive drive.

 Q. With Braxton making his first start today, did you see anything differently from him before the game, maybe, and what was he like as the game went on in the huddle?
 JORDAN HALL: Braxton did a good job. He was calm. He's going to be special. You see how he makes people miss when the blocking breaks down, and he had some good passes that were missed. But we're just going to continue to get better and work on that.

 Q. Will it be tough for Boom to get his job back, and when they all return, will you all feed off each other and how important that will be?
 JORDAN HALL: Yes, we're just going to feed off each other and just make the defense have to, I mean, account for all of us. I think when he gets back, it will definitely spark the offense even more.

 Q. You're in your third year, just talking about going into the Big Ten, how tough that's going to be starting next week, the first really three games are all quality opponents, Michigan State, Nebraska, Illinois, you're going right into the thick of it, just what that challenge will be for you guys?
 JORDAN HALL: It's definitely going to be a challenge. We're going to use this game to see what we can learn from and get better. Because we've got to get better every game if we want to compete in the Big Ten.

 Q. You guys used a lot of different players on offense, a lot of different formations, do you feel like this offense is still trying to figure out what it does best, or do you feel like you have a good idea what this offense does best?
 JORDAN HALL: I think we run the ball good. Carlos did a good job running the ball. Braxton did a good job running the ball. We just have to get better at everything. That's basically it.

 Q. How close are you guys to sort of being as good as you can be as an offense? Are you getting there or do you have a ways to go? 
 JORDAN HALL: I don't think we're never going to be at the -- I think you can always get better. I think we're just going to have to keep working and practicing and use it on the field on Saturdays.

 Q. How did Braxton handle himself in the huddle? And just talk about his play, and maybe just lifting this whole program from last week's disappointment to a win?
 JORDAN HALL: Like I said before, he was calm in the pocket. He controlled the huddle. And you don't usually see that with a young quarterback. I just told him like this is your huddle so take over. He did a good job of that.
