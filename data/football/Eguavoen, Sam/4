  Texas Tech   34

Q.   Talk about the game tonight, coming in here and just your performance overall tonight?
ERIC WARD:   I just think we left a lot of opportunities on the field that we could have capitalized on.   We put the ball on the ground too much, and we didn't play our best game today.   That's very apparent.

Q.   Just talk about this bye week.   Do you feel it's hitting you at the right time with injuries and things of that nature? 
SAM EGUAVOEN:   Yeah, we definitely need this bye week.   I mean, we didn't expect to lose four games in a row, but we do got a lot of guys banged up.   Some guys not even coming back, but, I mean, this bye week should help us.

Q.   Eric, is that the most disappointing thing about this season is what's been left out on the field?   I mean, not what's been accomplished but just from the mistakes standpoint when you look back at things?
ERIC WARD:   Yes, sir, I would say so.   I would say we kill ourselves a lot out there on the football field by penalties and turnovers and stuff like that and fumbles and letting the other team have opportunities to score.   To be a good football team, you can't allow that to happen.   You've got to capitalize on the drives you have and put points on the board.

Q.   There were a lot of great catches in the first quarter, first half, and then in the second half a lot of dropped passes.   Can you explain the difference between the two halves? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   I mean, we're just playing the game of football.   It's not always‑‑ it's not always going to be perfect.   There are a lot of peaks and valleys that are going to be out there in a football game, so I really can't answer your question.   We're just playing full speed and trying to capitalize on each opportunity we have to go out there and make a play.

Q.   Sam, could you talk about the missed tackles tonight and those things that plagued you? 
SAM EGUAVOEN:   I mean, we're getting to the ball, but guys just aren't finishing.   We've got to run our feet and tackle.   I really can't explain that.   You've just got to look at yourself in the mirror and just do what you've got to do.   That's our problem.   Too many guys are worrying about being superman on the field.   We've all just got to worry about our job and do what we're supposed to do.

Q.   From a standpoint of obviously you guys had struggled against the run so much and so much has been talked about that the last month.   Is this like a really bad team to catch at the time when you guys were maybe down and your run defense had been having so many issues? 
SAM EGUAVOEN:   Honestly, I mean, I really don't know the distinct answer to why we haven't been stopping the run.   I'm not going to point any fingers at anybody.   It's a team thing.   I mean, if you look back at the stats from all the past games, it's been six or seven big plays that's really just stood out and made the score lineup.   I mean, I really don't understand why we haven't been stopping the run honestly.

Q.   Eric, can you talk about the mood of this team right now?   Losing four straight, you've got the Longhorns coming, what is the mood of this team right now? 
ERIC WARD:   We're very distraught after a loss.   We've left a lot of things out there on the field that we wish we could get back.   The game is over now.   No sense in talking about it.   We have to go look at the film, watch, capitalize on the things we didn't do well tonight and look forward to the Longhorns.

Q.   Your touchdown catch at the first half, can you take us through how you managed to pull that off with one hand and secure the catch and hang on to it when you hit the ground? 
ERIC WARD:   The reason I had to catch with one hand is the guy was holding, so that's the only option I had.   I mean, I just did my job.   I mean, the ball was in the air, I did the best I could to bring it down with the catch and it ended up being a touchdown to help the team.
