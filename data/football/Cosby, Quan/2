 Q. What's it going to take for Texas to win Monday night? 
 QUAN COSBY: Execute. Take care of the ball and execute. It is no real secret or anything special we have to do. You take the ball and you execute. 

 Q. I think people know Austin because of the famous people who live there. Who is the most famous person that lives in Austin? 
 QUAN COSBY: Coach Brown, probably. There is a lot of people that come through there. It is a great city. They love Texas football. They make sure they are well-taken care of down there. Probably Lance is the most famous as far as what he has gone through in his life.
