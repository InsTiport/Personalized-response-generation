 Q.   Is it just a matter of the defense?   (No microphone)?  
COACH FLOOD:   I don't know.   I don't know if I felt that way.   The start of the fourth quarter, the game is 16‑13, and one of the things we tried to do obviously defensively was limit the big plays.   We knew we were going to give up some drives.   We thought we played good red zone defense and we could make them kick a few field goals and attempt some field goals, maybe we could block one and then win the game in the fourth quarter.   We were kind of poised to do that.   
They had drives all through the game.   They had a 13‑play drive to start the game, a couple 7s, then we got a three‑play stop for a field goal, a ten‑play, and a nine.   So was it too many in the end?   I don't know that.   I don't know that.   But I think ultimately for me we had opportunities in the second half that we just didn't capitalize on.   We had two great kickoff returns by Janarion Grant, getting the ball at the plus 47, getting the ball at the plus 45 and only yield three points, I think that was probably a bigger factor.  
   
 Q.   In the second quarter to kick the field goal (No microphone).   
COACH FLOOD:   The two running plays we ran I didn't feel were very effective.   And the one pass play we ran, the quarterback was pressured as we tried to throw it.   Couldn't get enough on it to get it to Michael to score the touchdown.   I didn't have confidence in that drive that we were going to be able to score, and I thought the three points were more valuable.  
   
 Q.   Did you think you'd have a second chance at that?   (No microphone)?  
COACH FLOOD:   No, because it wasn't that much of a difference.   The ball was very close when I made the decision.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH FLOOD:   There was a period of time in that half where he was not available.   I'd have to go back and look at the TV copy.  
   
 Q.   I know you haven't had time to reflect, but what are some of the things you're feeling at the end of the season?   
COACH FLOOD:   Yeah, I think it's probably disrespectful to the game, the Pinstripe Bowl and the New Era people, the Yankees, and the people that put it on to make this a reflection on the season.   The game itself is so emotional.   There is so much that goes into it a bowl game with the weeks of preparation.   And you look in the eyes of the seniors in your locker room after the game, and it's the last time they'll suit up as Rutgers football players and how much it means to them, the day itself is a very emotionally draining day.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about coming in with the thought process?   
COACH FLOOD:   What do you mean by the thought process?   
   
 Q.   The way you guys were moving the ball.   
COACH FLOOD:   I think everybody's got exotic plays in their playbook.   Every play you call is designed to work.   You call them because you've had success with them in practice.   The players build confidence in you as a play caller and as a head coach.   When you get into the field zone, you call the plays that you practiced.   That was one that we had.   Unfortunately, we didn't execute it the way we wanted to.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the way Joe Rossi prepared the defense and the way they performed and adjusted?   
COACH FLOOD:   I thought Joe did a good job.   Certainly doing the special teams as well, really serving double duty for the game, I thought he handled it very well.   We talked early on about how I wanted to play the game, and how we wanted it to look, and I thought he did a very good job of giving me what I wanted.   I thought that the players were in position to make plays.   
Some of those sustained drives, we knew the areas of the field where we thought they'd throw the ball.   We thought we'd be able to break on the balls a little better than maybe we did, and that allows them to continue some of those drives.   But overall I thought the game plan gave us opportunities.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned taking away big plays, but they kind of took a lot of yards on the (No microphone).   Is that something you thought about getting away from and playing more press coverage or was it just breaking on balls to make plays?   
COACH FLOOD:   I didn't think either team really broke very well on the ball.   Yeah, I felt the surface was a good surface when we were out here yesterday.   I think what happened was as the weather got warmer and the ground thawed, it really got soft.   That was, I think, the reason why some of the players were slipping a little bit out there.   
But when you put a defense together, if you do one thing, you're going to give up something else, and we had made the decision that we were going to try to limit the big plays.   To do that, if you start getting in press man coverage, now you're opening up opportunities for big plays.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned the field right there; how much did that dictate what you did on offense as the game went on?   
COACH FLOOD:   I don't think it changed what we did on offense.   I think it has an effect on both teams.   It wasn't just us; it wasn't just them.   I saw both teams slipping.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone) the play you ran today, was that the half back option that you ran at that time, or did you like the way they threw the ball in practice?   
COACH FLOOD:   Correct, we practiced it.   We practice with all the players, but when you do it in the game, you try to decide who is the best option to do it.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH FLOOD:   I think that's a great adjective for Chase, is competitor.   I thought that's what he did today, and that's what he's always done given the opportunity.   Some of the plays he made with his feet, his rushing yards don't show that because of some of the sacks at the end of the game.   He gained 55 yards rushing in the game, and some of those were big plays that kept drives alive.   I think that's what he was able to do.   It's really one of the signatures of his career at Rutgers.  
   
 Q.   Did you have a particular message for those guys since it's their last time to play together?   
COACH FLOOD:   You hope that they can hear it.   When you don't come out on top in a bowl game there is such a finality to it, it's, as I said before, a very emotional locker room.   But as I said before, We love you.   We'll always be here for you, and you thank them for all the effort they've given through their careers.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel late in the game as competitive as you were it could really be a boost for recruiting?   
COACH FLOOD:   You'd probably have to ask the recruits that.   Anytime we go into a stadium we feel we'll be ready to compete and be able to compete.   We felt that way when we played Arkansas.   We felt that way when we came in here today to play Notre Dame.   I have to give a lot of credit to Coach Kelly and his staff.   I know they didn't have their full staff either.   They did an excellent job.   They have talented players, and I thought they played well today.  
   
 Q.   You grew up in Queens.   I don't know if you had a chance to go to Shea Stadium.   But can you talk about your background here?   
COACH FLOOD:   I never had the opportunity to see the Jets play live at Shea Stadium, but I did grow up ten minutes from there.   I did grow up a Yankee fan.   I want to be on the record saying that because my older brother was a Mets fan.   
But I think the players obviously know I grew up in New York City.   I think they know how special a venue this is.   I think that's one of the great experiences about being a part of this game is getting the opportunity to play a game in Yankee Stadium.   I think that's probably more important to them than anything else.
