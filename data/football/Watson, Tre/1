California - 22  Stanford - 35
TRE WATSON: We let it fall short and there was nothing we could do.  We got to move on to next week and focus on ASU and get this W.
Q. Going forward what's kind of going to be your message for your teammates?
TRE WATSON: Just focus on the little things this week in practice.  Everything technical, blocking, from the blocking, the catching, to the can you tell us and just getting downhill and attacking and being more aggressive.  Really that's our main thing.  We just got to clean up the little things and we'll be able to go out next week and put on a show and get this W.
Q. Does it make it more frustrating knowing that it's little things that are really getting you?
TRE WATSON: It hurts.  This is a big game and it really hurts.  Every game's a big game, honestly, but now we know we can beat one of the best teams and we have been knowing that so now we got to go out and just do our thing and focus on us and stop worrying about all the outside things going on.
