      TEXAS TECH - 40

 Q. Seth, would you talk about Alex Torres tonight? Sure seemed like he was catching the ball well for you? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, he's a dependable guy. He works hard. He's a good leader of this team. So we can count on him to make plays for us. As you can see, he does a good job at it, and he takes a lot of pride in his work.

 Q. Were you expecting the Aggies to blitz as much as they did coming into this thing? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, we knew they were going to bring a lot of people. But our game plan was to get the ball, get rid of it quick, which we did. We did a good job of it. Just Coach Brown kind of told us in the locker room, we played well offensively. It's just one of those thing that's didn't go our way.

 Q. Setbacks are part of the process. Can you just kind of talk about this and how it fits into the whole realm the rest of the season? 
     SETH DOEGE: It's one of those things. It's a loss. It is what it is. We have to learn from it. We have a big game next week. It's important that us older guys like Torres and guys like that that we keep the energy and the thought process positive in the locker room, because we have a big game coming up next week. 
     Kansas State's coming in. They're going to be a top 20 team and one of the best defenses in the country. So we need to be ready to go for that one.

 Q. Obviously, when it comes down to being a five-point game and you had settled for so many field goals, do you remember, is there any drive or whatever in particular that you'll look back on and kick yourself that you didn't get seven as opposed to half? Any that you saw as more missed opportunities than others? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, the ultimate goal is to score a touchdown every drive. There were a couple times that we should have scored. Whatever it may be, I don't think it was much of them like lining up and stopping. I think we shot ourselves in the foot a couple times and that cost us 7, and we got three. 
     Luckily Donnie had a great game, and kicked a lot of field goals for us. But at the same time, offensively our goal is to score a touchdown every drive.

 Q. Growing up in this rivalry, can you talk about possibly ending it on this note? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, it's not the greatest feeling in the world, but at the same time you have to learn from it. You have to kind of let it go so you can prepare for the next one.

 Q. How would you grade your performance so far this year? 
     SETH DOEGE: I don't really know. I'm just trying to prepare every week and put my team in the best position to win the game, and that's me being prepared to go out and doing my job.

 Q. With this being a 45-40 game, did you feel like it lived up to what this series usually is for the fans?
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, it was a hard-fought battle. We felt like we shot ourselves in the foot a couple times. We could have put up a little more points, but we fought hard. We fought until the end. 
     I'm proud of my teammates. You know what I mean? You can see some things about us, we'll never quit, no matter what, regardless what's happening.

 Q. Did you get an opportunity to speak to Eric after he got hurt? 
     SETH DOEGE: No, I haven't.

 Q. Would you talk about Adam James and his perseverance and what he's meant to this team and you guys? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, Adam's been through a lot. The thing is, the thing about Adam is not many people can go through what he's been through and keep going and stick with what he wants to do, and that is play football for Texas Tech. 
     So he's done a really good job of overcoming adversity when maybe a lot of people didn't want him here. But he stuck with it. He stuck with the coaches, he stuck with his friends, and I'm proud of him. I think his teammates are proud of him.

 Q. Was it your plan to use him as much as you did today going into the game? 
     SETH DOEGE: That was part of the play and the reads, kind of brought me to him. We don't sit there and say, hey, we're going to throw it to Eric this time. It's one of those things that the read brought me to him.

 Q. Talk about losing Eric Stephens tonight? How much of a loss is that to the running game and someone at wide receiver for you? 
     SETH DOEGE: Yeah, he's been a huge part of our offense. Obviously, he's been very productive. He's been maybe the best offensive player we have on this team. You know, he's a great guy, great leader , so it's going to hurt. 
     But at the same time we're going to have to find some guy that's want to step up and fill that void. It's going to be hard to do because he is such a great player. 
     But I wish him the best. I'll be praying for him. I know the rest of the team's feeling the same way. But at the same time, a couple guys are going to have to step up.
