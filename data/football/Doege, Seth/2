 Q.   It was obviously a lot closer than you wanted it to be today.   What is the thought after this one for you guys?  
SETH DOEGE:   First thing that comes to mind offensively is we've got to finish with touchdowns.   I think if we finish with touchdowns a couple times, and I can't recall the play or the drive, but we finish with touchdowns and I think it's a different ballgame.   
But that's the way it works.   That is the way football goes.   We have a resilient group.   I think we did a really good job sticking together and battling through some adversity and finishing.  
   
 Q.   What do you think sort of bogged down?   You were up 21‑7, driving about midfield.   Just kind of seemed like you were going to sort of have your way.   What were the key things of getting down inside the 15‑yard line that were making it hard for you guys?   
SETH DOEGE:   I really don't know.   I think it's just not making plays, when it's time to make plays.   I couldn't really tell you.   I'd have to watch the film to give you a detailed answer.   
The common goal from last week and this week is we need to finish with touchdowns, not field goals.   This league is such a competitive league that it's a small margin for error.   So if you leave some opportunities for the other team to get back into it and they get back into it, it's going to be a battle.   That's what happened today.  
   
 Q.   How was it after the Texas loss this week?   
SETH DOEGE:   You know, we have a 24‑hour rule, and I think we did a good job as a team getting over that loss.   It was tough because it was UT.   We felt like we had just as good or better team.   Felt like we had a winnable game, and didn't really finish during that game.   So that's what was tough about it.   
But we understand we have a great opportunity in front of us with this game and the next two and the bowl game after that.   So we wanted to finish out this season strong.   We have a three‑game season.   That was the first season.  
   
 Q.   What was going through your head when you saw Eric with that ball on the final touchdown?   
SETH DOEGE:   Yeah, it's been hit and miss in practice, but I just had a really good feeling about it.   I think Eric's one of those guys when you call on his number, he's going to get the job done regardless.   So I was putting the ball in his hands.   It was a really good move by Coach Brown, because he's a great player, and they did it perfect.   They ran the play perfect, they executed, and that was a huge touchdown for us.  
   
 Q.   Can you speak to the job Eric Ward has done for you here?   
SETH DOEGE:   That guy is a really good player.   I guess the stats can tell you that, but just watching him when he doesn't have a ball in his hands, the way he blocks for his teammates.   He's a very unselfish player.   Guys trust him.   He wants to win, he's competitive.   So I'm glad that I have the opportunity to play with him.  
   
 Q.   Seth, the number of times that you've thrown to him lately, particularly late in the game today as many times as you were looking his way, is that a reflection of the confidence you have in him?  
SETH DOEGE:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   I trust both of those guys, Darrin and Eric.   So when we need a play and one of them has a better look than the other, that's who I'm going to go to.   Just because I feel like both of them can get open and both of them can make plays in critical times.   Kind of like we just talked about those guys compete really hard and I trust them.   
   
 Q.   Your team got more involved this week.   What was the reason?  
SETH DOEGE:   We have play makers on this football team, and as a team and the coaching staff they looked at we didn't really get SaDale and guys that can do things with the ball in their hands enough touches.   So we wanted to get the ball to those guys and let them do their thing in the open field.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like you had a wall of blockers when they cut the pass.   Did you think you were going to be able to score?   
SETH DOEGE:   Yeah, when I threw it, I saw the flow, the flow just took off.   So I knew it was going to be wide open.   I was trying to set up Eric's block.   I'm not an athlete.   I'm an average runner.   But maybe a better athlete would have scored, but I tried my best.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
SETH DOEGE:   That was huge.   I'm so excited for these seniors because we get to end this home stretch on a win, which is huge for us because we've been through a lot.   We've worked really hard, and I'm glad and feel blessed to have the opportunity to play here.   I'm glad that we did end up with a victory going out.   That is something that we'll remember forever.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible) can you talk about the impact of the wind today?   
SETH DOEGE:   I'm a West Texas kid, so the wind is not really a factor to me.   I've been throwing in the wind since I was little.   It's not too big of a deal.   Nothing game plan‑wise, nothing routes or throwing‑wise did we ever say we can't do this because of the wind.   We've been practicing it every day, so it's not a big deal.  
   
 Q.   Kerry, after obviously a rough day for you guys, what did it feel like getting that good stop in there in the second overtime?   
KERRY HYDER:   It was good.   We gave up some big runs throughout the game.   I think they averaged about six yards per carry.   I felt like we held our ground.   Our conditioning showed up in the second half in overtime.  
   
 Q.   What was the sideline like after they scored and dropped down, missed the field goal, and now you get to go overtime?   
KERRY HYDER:   We were excited.   We weren't excited; we were disappointed, but we knew we had to get out there and make a play.   We knew it was going to come down to the defense making a play.   When our time came up in the second overtime, we were able to get off the field.  
   
 Q.   What was the biggest difficulty in slowing them down on the run?   
KERRY HYDER:   They were creasing us, and the option game we weren't picking up the pitch man, the quarterback was finding the seams when they didn't pitch it.   That was the biggest part.   They found some natural gaps and were able to hit the gaps for big runs.  
   
 Q.   Frustrated losing your helmet during the game?   
KERRY HYDER:   Yeah, it kept popping off and kept popping off.   I had to tighten it up.   It was so tight that it was hurting towards the end of the game.   But anything to keep it on.  
   
 Q.   Did you stay with the same helmet?  
KERRY HYDER:   Yeah, I stayed with the same helmet.  
   
 Q.   Considering Kansas had lost 18 conference games in a row, were you saying come on, we can't lose to these guys?  
KERRY HYDER:   Well, you never want to take Big 12 wins for granted.   But going into the game we knew they were going to come in and play hard.   But losing this game would have been a big deal, but I'm just glad we were able to fight through the adversity and come out with a win.  
   
 Q.   Did you expect this game to be as dramatic as it was?   
KERRY HYDER:   Like I said, in the Big 12, anything can happen any day, man.   These teams in the Big 12, anybody can win any day.   So I knew they would play hard.   You know, you've got to give them credit.   They came out and ran the ball effectively on us.   So next week, that is something we can't let happen.
