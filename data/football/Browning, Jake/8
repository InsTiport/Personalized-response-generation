Q. What do you think about the Alabama defense?
JAKE BROWNING: I think that will be a huge challenge, obviously.  The front seven is very good.  The DBs know the front seven is very good so they're not looking to cover people forever.  They're looking to jump stuff because you don't necessarily have time to do double moves, stuff like that.
I think, obviously, the best defense we've seen all year.  Like I said, that's what we want.  You get to this point, you want to play the best teams and so that means you're in the best games.  So looking forward to it.
Q. You don't like doing this stuff?
JAKE BROWNING: It's fine.  This is not the highlight of the week for me, but I think it's fine.  It is what it is.
Q. Do you feel like the rest in between the regular season was good for you?  Do you feel like your body kind of is feeling better after a long grind?
JAKE BROWNING: Yeah, I think it was 12 or 13 games, and yeah, I mean, I think everybody wanted that rest, I'm sure.  Everybody on the team that, you know, even if you haven't been playing, if you're redshirting, you want that rest to get your body ready.
