Q. Coach told us he thought you improved in your accuracy downfield.  How did you do that?
JAKE BROWNING: I think it was just something I focused on.  I think last year, I didn't practice it enough.  Like throughout the year, you know, I didn't really work on it.  That's something you need to continue to work on even when you feel like you have it down.  It's staying on top of that, where you still have the right timing and all that.  So, you know, something I focused on in the off-season.
And having Ross as a deep threat guy, I know he's going to be open down the field and Dante is going to be open down the field.  Both guys that are pretty fast.  Just being able to hit them.
Q. Jake Browning, ready for this Bama defense?
JAKE BROWNING: Yeah, we'll be ready.  They're obviously a really good defense and all that, but I think we're a pretty good defense and we have to be able to play at a high level.
Q. When you think of the guys rushing off the edge, it's more important for you to get the ball in your play makers' hands pretty quickly, right?
JAKE BROWNING: What I do to help with pass protection is get rid of the ball on time and not sit in there forever.  I'm not really thinking about the pass rush guys or pass rush threat.  That's more something you got to ask our O-line.
