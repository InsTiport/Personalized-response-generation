Oregon State - 15, Stanford - 26
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. Seemed to be a struggle.
MARCUS McMARYION: Yeah, you got to credit Stanford's defense.  Really stout up front.  Played a lot of man cover, did well.  Have to execute better on the offensive side of the ball.
Q. (No microphone.)
MARCUS McMARYION: I mean, they're being real simple.  They line up and say, This is what we're going to run.
Really it's just execution on the offensive part, everybody doing their job, same thing over and over.  Just got to clean up the little things.
Q. (No microphone.)
MARCUS McMARYION: It's just something we kind of talked about all week.  We saw obviously having a guy on the back like Ryan, they're going to favor him a lot.  It's up to me to take the load off of Ryan, take some shots off of him.
Q. Did they say anything at halftime about, Let's try it?
MARCUS McMARYION: Yeah, that was the game plan going in.  We didn't run it too often in the first half.  Yeah, just kind of solid, something we talked about early in the week.  We wanted to attack.  Reemphasized it more in the second half.
Q. You had some space a couple times.  Do you think you can build on that and make the offense as a whole better going forward?
MARCUS McMARYION: Yeah, definitely.  I think I can help out the offense a lot more, being able to show my athletic ability.  Kind of been limiting myself to just the pocket passes.  I definitely think I can help out the team a lot more in the run aspect of the game, getting a lot more pulls, being smart about it, when I could pull it, when to give the ball.
Q. Talk about the big touchdown pass.
MARCUS McMARYION: We knew we were going to get man-to-man coverage like I said.  They're real heavy playing man.  I worked the safety, following his eyes like he was a book (indiscernible).
