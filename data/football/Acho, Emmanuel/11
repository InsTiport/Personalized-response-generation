  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: I think it's a good feeling, but I mean, from day one I've been extremely confident in the defense. I've been extremely confident in the talent we have on defense from the line to the linebackers to the defensive backs, and so I knew that with the flow of the game, the momentum of the game, I knew if our offense got in the end zone I knew that would be it. They got them in and scored, and I made sure the defense, we upheld our part of the bargain.  
  
  Q. As a guy who has an older brother who played, can you relate to Jaxon and Case just having that blood in you, what those guys have done, as well?  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: I think it makes you a lot more mature. It makes you a lot more mature on and off the field because you don't make some of the same mistakes as some of the guys who didn't have anybody to tell them how it's going to be, don't make some of those mistakes. You're always see the maturity on the field with guys like Jaxon, Quandre and then Case coming into the game and just leading us back to a victory. You've always seen the maturity on the field, so that's one of the underlying things that nobody really knows about but it's there.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: I mean, it's huge. To be able to fight back like that and come back and win, it's something in the past I'm not sure we would have been able to do, and that's probably the biggest thing is to see how much the work we put in the summer, to see it pay off, to see the leadership on this team, leadership on the offense, leadership that's been on the defense, to see it all pan out, and when I talk about seeing the fruits of our labor, that's exactly what I'm talking about.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, I mean, we're trying to keep things rolling. We started off, we are 2 and 0, so got a good thing going, but we've got to focus, put BYU behind us and now it's all about UCLA. We're going to prepare very well for that one. Especially for me personally I know last year it didn't go as planned. So I'm going to get back to the grind and make sure I play well and the defense plays well.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, you know, for Blake it's not as big a deal because he's in the secondary, he's in the back end. But when somebody rushes for 200-plus yards on you, first people that get talked about are the defensive line and the linebackers. So it is personal. It's our job, so I know me, Keenan and Kheeston are kind of like the senior group of the interior front. We're going to take it personally, we're going to prepare well, and all of our focus is on UCLA.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: Our first two games were against spread offenses with Rice and BYU and so you go from sitting there watching a team pass it 50 times a game to now they're going to sit here and try to hammer you. It caught us off guard little bit, but it's nothing we can't handle. I think we've proved our physicality over the last 48 hours, and so now we just have to bring it to the table.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: He played a great game. Obviously he played a great game. He has a pass level and he gets off the ball extremely fast, extremely well and extremely low. So I'm rooting for him, but he's a young guy, he has to keep working. He can't sit and rest on one fact because in the grand scheme of things it's not that big a deal. He has to keep working, he has to keep grinding and make sure he continues to produce.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 EMMANUEL ACHO: You know, the defense, we just kind of play the hand we're dealt. Regardless of the situation, we go out there and we just fight hard. We knew early on in that game that we had to keep BYU from scoring to make sure that we stayed in it and keep fighting until the offense shows up and pulled out of this thing. Thankfully with ten minutes in the fourth quarter, they showed up in a big way.
