Q. Hey, Leonard, talk about, Gilbert going down last week, just talk about the atmosphere in the locker room throughout practice this week and rallying around him?
LEONARD JOHNSON: Yeah, we lost like one of the best corners in the ACC in my opinion.  It's just next-man-up.  Coach pushed us.  He moved Mike Carter completely all over the field, moved him into corner, moved me into nickel or strike position.  We knew we just had to play next-man-up.  Just play hard.
Q. The interception for a touchdown obviously was a huge play in the game.  I think it really put the game away.  What did you see on that play?
LEONARD JOHNSON: Coach called us into cover three, so I just had the flats, D-line, great rush, got a quarterback out of the pocket.  He was rushing to throw.  I had the flats.  Hopefully I just caught it, just ran down the field.  But it was a great effort by the D-line getting him out of the pocket.
Q. How much did that help you all day?  Looked like they were flushing the quarterback all day long?
LEONARD JOHNSON: Oh, yeah.  It was great pressure.  I mean, guys went down, EA went down, young guys came in and played hard.  It's just next-man-up.  Great rotation, fresh guy come in, make plays.  That's what we needed.
