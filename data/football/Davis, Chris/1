Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Yes, sir. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I just tried to stay humble through the whole process. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We put in a lot of hard work coming in this season and I would just say that hard work pays off.   Florida State has a pretty good offense and playing in the ACC, everybody has a pretty good offense. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I can't really answer that question.   Like I said, they have a great offense overall, they got good players, and so do we.   So it will be a good game to watch Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That didn't ever cross my mind. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I keep doing what we have been doing to get us there, preparation.   We have been taking it one day at a time working up to the game.   And I feel like we're ready to play the game on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I don't buy into that, because like I said, we worked all summer for this, and we're just thankful for the opportunity to play in this game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It changed a little.   From signing more autographs, taking pictures and getting standing ovations in class. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I can't answer that question. 
(Laughter. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   The season has been fun.   The return was a good return, but I had 10 other guys blocking for me.   It was a great block all up and down the field.   So I give them most of the credit. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We just stayed together.   After that LSU loss, nobody blamed each other.   We kept approaching practice the way we had been doing and that's what got us to this point we're at now.   Coach Malzahn kept us focused on the process and that's why we are here, where we're at now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   When I walk in class, the class just get up and clap for me. 

Q.   One time or what? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   A couple times. 

Q.   What class? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Geology.   My public finance class.   It's just crazy.   I'm a very humble person, so ‑‑ but that's how I handled it, I guess.   I just tried to stay level headed throughout the whole process. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I just I stand up and wave at them.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   When Coach Malzahn came in he told us, it's a new day.   Put last year behind you.   And that's what we did.   And we went through the spring and summer, we worked really hard and that's what got us to the point where we're at today. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   In the SEC that's the best conference in college football.   And I just got to say, we're going to be well prepared for Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We're just ready to play our best and represent the great state of Alabama. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Coach has a game plan.   They put together a good game plan to go out there and execute.   And that's what we're going to try and do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It took a minute.   It took a minute from the team running and jumping on me, but that comes with the game.   That comes from making a play like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Playing in the game three years ago, it was a tough feeling.   Not being able to contribute to the team to get the win.   I just tried to overcome that with this opportunity that I got right now and make the best of it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I had a high ankle sprain.   I was on crutches for the rest of the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I never had a bigger play bigger than that moment. 

Q.   Describe your thought process from the moment the ball was kicked. 
CHRIS DAVIS:   My thought process was just trying to make something happen.   When I'm in‑‑ when I managed to stay in bounds I knew I had a chance to take it all the way, and that's what I did.

Q.   What's your life been like since then? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   I would say it's changed.   It's changed.   Signing more autographs, taking pictures, and like standing ovations in class. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I guess you could say that. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We're just going to try to embrace the moment.   We're glad to be in this position but obviously we come here to win the game and that's what we're going to do. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It was crazy.   Everybody still talks about the announcer when he was announcing the game, but it was crazy. 

Q.   Was the National Championship always the goal? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   The goal was just to take it one day and one game at a time. 

Q.   When did the National Championship start to become a reality?
CHRIS DAVIS:   When we went on the road and beat Texas A and M, we knew we had a chance.

Q.   What was it about that game that made it a reality? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   It was a quality opponent, I think they were ranked in the Top‑10, if I'm not mistaken.   And to go on the road and beat a good team like Texas A and M, that was huge. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I was running down the field on kick‑offs and I tried to stick my feet in the ground and my feet came from under me. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, sir.   No, she couldn't make it.   She's going to watch it on TV. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Being raised by a single parent is always hard.   But my mom made the best of it and I owe her a lot. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   As a competitor, yeah, you felt like you were a part of and ‑‑ just as a team player that you have to play for the team.   But I moved on from that and I got another opportunity to play in that type of game right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I still got the rings. 

Q.   Where are they? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   They're in my room. 

Q.   What was your first reaction when you saw that play on TV on the replay? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Like, wow, listening to the commentators as the play was going and it was a good feeling and I tried to embrace that moment. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I don't get chills. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I tried to put it behind me.   We still got one game left and that one game is the biggest of them all.   We're just trying to go out there and win the National Championship on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Coach Malzahn always says, if the game is close at the end, we're going to win.   So that's how we approach every game.   And we believe what he's telling us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   This is a good feeling.   Because if it wasn't for his play, we wouldn't be in the situation that we're in right now.   And you could say the same about my play.   But I always say that his play was better than mine because I actually got the opportunity to watch it.   So I'm quite sure he will say the same thing. 
But both the plays kind of changed college football, especially this season.   So we did try to embrace that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   In any time of the game, somebody has to step up and make a play.   And the Georgia game it was Ricardo and for the Alabama game it was me. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We never ‑‑ like I said, Coach Malzahn came in saying, it's a new day.   So we put last season behind us.   We came in to this season taking it one day and one game at a time.   And that's why we're in this situation we're in right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We just sit around and laugh about it.   No one let us forget those plays.   Like I just said, I say his play is better than mine because I actually got a chance to sit down and watch it.   But if it wasn't for those two plays we wouldn't be in the situation we're in right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I was on the sideline.   I actually got to see it unfold. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I would say hard work pays off.   We are put in this position for a reason.   You look back in 2010 we won a lot of close games too.   So I guess in football some luck has to be involved sometimes.   But it is what it is. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I just said ‑‑ like I said, we worked to get where we're at right now.   And through, from the spring and the summer, we put in hard work and the hard work is paying off. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We actually didn't know anybody was back there at first.   Ryan Smith had just decided to move back there and Coach Malzahn called the timeout to ice the kicker and they decided to put me back there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, sir.   Because I didn't know anybody was back there at first.   So I had no idea. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I knew if the ball was kicked in bounds, I knew I had a chance to make a play.   But I thought that the ball was going to get kicked out of the end zone.   I knew he wasn't going to make the field goal, but I didn't think it was going to be kicked inbounds for me to have the opportunity to return it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Like I said, I got to give the rest of the guys a lot of credit.   They made good blocks up‑and‑down the field and I can't take all the credit for that play, I got to give it to my teammates. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I didn't have any worries that I stepped out of bounds.   I kind of like tiptoed on the sidelines.   I knew when once I stayed in bounds that I had a chance to run it all the way. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   But me playing defensive back you don't get a chance to practice that, but. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I really didn't.   I was just running, trying to get as far as I can and when I managed to stay in bounds I knew then that the game was over. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It's crazy.   I think a lot of players are really enjoying it and this will change the way you embrace the moment.   And that's what we're doing. 

Q.   Talk about as far as getting ready for a big game on Monday.   Talk about the emotions that you feel once you step out on the field. 
CHRIS DAVIS:   The emotions will be all over the place.   The players are going to be very hyped up from both teams, but as we know, in the first quarter the emotions are going to be flying all over the place. 
But we're going to have to settle down and play the game.   So all players know that, we have been doing it all season, but this is just a bigger stage.

Q.   Talk about your defensive play.   How important is that going to be to stop Jameis Winston?
CHRIS DAVIS:   We'll see how that unfolds on Monday.   But we're going to be playing hard. 

Q.   What have you done preparation‑wise?   Have you done anything different?   Do you expect anything different or do you stick to the plan? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   We stick to the plan. 

Q.   What's the best part of being in California?
CHRIS DAVIS:   Just enjoying the experience.   We all know this is a business trip, and we're trying to bring the National Championship to the state of Alabama. 

Q.   What makes Chris Davis so successful? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Chris Davis is just being Chris Davis. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Obviously he's a great player, he's the Heisman Trophy winner, and I think he got a good football IQ.   And we just are ready for the game on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We know what we got to do and we're going to do it.   That's all I can say about that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   If it's a shoot‑out and it's a close game, like Coach Malzahn always says, if it's a close game at the end, we're going to win. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We have been in that situation before.   And we trust everything that he says. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   How does he compare to Johnny Manziel?   He don't.   Johnny Manziel is a great player and Winston is too, but they bring different things to the game.   And that's about all I can say. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That obviously brought attention to me.   Signing autographs and taking more pictures and getting standing ovations in class. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   They just say, oh, what a play. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   They have a lot of good receivers.   So we're going to go out there and execute the game plan coach has for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   The way he approaches the game.   The defense he brought in.   He put it on us about giving up the big plays and we really respect him for that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He got on us real, real hard, but we know that that's what comes from trying to win a National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   From the beginning of the season we just said we're going to take it one day and one game at a time.   And that's what we did and that's what got us to the point we're at right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, in football games can be won all kinds of ways.   And we just are thankful to be in this position right now. 

Q.   How have you been able to win some of these games? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   It's unbelievable.   That's what I can say.   We had two great finishes this season and two plays with me and Ricardo, and it has just been a fight. 

Q.   Did you realize shortly after what those moments are going to mean in Auburn history?
CHRIS DAVIS:   You get reminded of that all the time.   So some people say that we're going to go down in Auburn history and that.   That's a good accomplishment, but that's something that we worked for. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We got to give all credit to Coach Malzahn.   He came in, he said it's a new day, and we bought into that.   He said, don't pay no attention to what happened last year, because it's a new day.   And we just took it one day at a time. 

Q.   Do you like being the underdog? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   That doesn't matter.   The game's still got to be played. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   The numbers, it's a big part, that's what coach always remind us of, are the numbers that we're giving up a game.   But, we made stops when we needed to make stops.   And that's what's got us to the situation we're at right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I seen that play, yeah. 

Q.   Your play is being talked about with that play.   How do you look at that play?
CHRIS DAVIS:   It's a good feeling to be a part of college football history.   That's what a lot of people dream of.   And that's why a lot of people play this game.   So I just try to embrace the moment. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I can't say that.   I just say all our hard work has paid off.   And we're trying to finish this great season with another win, a National Championship.   And we got a good chance of doing that on Monday. 

Q.   How confident are you?
CHRIS DAVIS:   We're very confident.   We haven't done nothing different.   We have been doing what we have been doing to get us to this point and that's taking it one day at a time in preparation. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He's a great player.   He didn't win the Heisman for nothing.   So we respect him and we look forward to playing him on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   When I seen the ball coming to me I knew I had an opportunity to probably take it all the way back.   Knowing that they had bigger action ‑‑ bigger players on the field, offensive and defensive line men.   And I knew they only had two guys that probably could really run, run with me.   And that was their kicker and the holder.   So I just tried to set it up and I had great blocking all over the field and once I managed to stay in bounds, I knew I had a chance to take it all the way. 

Q.   How much has your life changed since that play?
CHRIS DAVIS:   Like I keep saying, it changed a lot.   From signing more autographs, taking pictures, and getting standing ovations in class. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Oh, I watch it here and there.   I always catch it on ESPN, but it's a great feeling. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, it doesn't give me goose bumps, but the commentator might give me the goose bumps, but like it was a great play.   It was a play that will be remembered for a long time and it will go down in Auburn history and college football history. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I seen some of the reactions, yeah.   Yeah, it is. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I embraced it.   Coach Malzahn, he believed in me this season.   He told me I was one of the leaders and I took that and ran with it. 
Now I got one more game to lead my team to victory and on the biggest stage of them all, to bring a National Championship back to Auburn. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, I don't believe in that, I don't buy into all that.   Like I been saying, we worked hard to get to this situation we're at right now and hopefully we can end it with a National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That's what they say. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I guess definitely that's what he says.   We're just going to go with our scheme and our game plan.   And if we have to play man, we're going to play man.   So I guess we'll see how that all unfolds on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We got plenty of good defensive backs too.   And we have to have good communication.   That's what we'll have to do to limit their chances of getting big plays. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I really don't know.   I think in 2011 we were the underdogs coming into this game, but like I said, all that don't matter, the game still has to be played. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Like I said, hopefully I can make it through more than one play.   But this is a special game anyways, based on the situation.   We're playing for it all, you know, and like I keep saying, we're just trying to bring another National Championship to the state of Alabama and Auburn family. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We just are embracing the moment.   Coach Malzahn came in and said it's a new day.   And we bought into what he brought to the table.   He said we're going to take it one day and one game at a time this season.   And that's what we did, we stayed together through it all. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Not really, I tried to put that game behind me.   We still got one game left.   We're going to do what we can to win this game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It means a lot.   Especially for me, because I got a son.   And to be remembered at Auburn history and not only Auburn history, college football history, that's an honor. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It was phenomenal, without Ricardo's play, we wouldn't be here and without my play, we probably wouldn't be here.   So we just embraced the moment. 

Q.   How old is he? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Three years old. 

Q.   Will he be here? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, he won't be here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I wouldn't say magic.   We're just trying to finish off the season.   We're trying to finish off a great season with a National Championship win. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He's a great quarterback.   Obviously he's the Heisman Trophy winner, but we're just going to go through with our game plan.   Coach has put a good game plan together for us, and we'll try to execute that game plan as well as we can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Just practicing and preparation working up toward this game is how we stay game ready.   We know it's been along layoff and that can be good and bad.   But by our staying together and the team chemistry we got, we won't be missing a beat. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Finally.   We can't wait. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It was a high ankle sprain on kick off.   Me running down the field and it was a double team and on a double team you're supposed to attack the outside guy.   And I tried to stick my feet in the ground and that's how I got the high ankle sprain. 

Q.   Which leg? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   The left one. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I'm going to approach it like I approach any other game.   It's on the same stage as that one was in 2010, so I'm just going to approach it like I approach any other game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No more.   No more.   You might be a little nervous when you get out there, but all that will go away.   That's part of being a competitor and a college football player, all players will be nervous. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We have faced good receivers all year and we're just going to go about it how we have been going about it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Keep doing what we did to get us to this point.   On defensive end we got to limit it to close plays.   And I think we're going to do‑‑ we're going to execute the game plan that the coaches have set up for us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We worked all spring and summer to get where we're at now.   So we don't really buy into all this team of destiny stuff.   It's been more like all the hard work has paid off. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   After the LSU game, obviously taking the only loss of the season, we stayed together.   Everybody came that following Sunday with the right attitude.   And we knew that we had a chance to win a lot more games and then the Texas A and M game, everybody felt like we had the hunger to play for more. 

Q.   You guys are the underdogs Monday, how important is that in this matchup? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   On this stage you got to be‑‑ if you ain't motivated, I don't know what to say, you're playing for the National Championship. 
And like I keep saying, the game got to be played.   So being the underdog, none of that matters, because we still got to play the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Oh, man, I came in on top and I'm trying to go out on top.   We are trying to get this W and bring it back to the state of Alabama and to the Auburn family. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   My life has changed a lot.   I think you know that.   Signing more autographs, taking more pictures and get getting standing ovations when I come to class. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That's football.   In football you're going to have injuries.   I just thank God for the opportunity he has blessed me with to be able to play the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I thought that a couple of times.   But I also felt safe at the same time.   And that's what got me through it all. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I had another ankle injury.   A concussion. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I never give up, I never quit on my team.   I'm one of the leaders on this team and I'm looking forward to leading my team to a victory on Monday. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   A player is going to have his ups and downs and a program is going to have its up and downs and at the end of the day we know it's a business.   So we are just embracing this moment, this opportunity to be here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Geology.   And public finance. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We're going to let them do all the talking.   Like I told you, game's still got to be played.   So we'll see how that unfolds on Monday.

Q.   If you would describe the character of your team, who would you say that your team looks like? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Auburn.   We're just going to be ourselves.   We're going to do what we have been doing that's got us this far. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Playing in the ACC, we have faced all kinds of things.   The challenges, I don't know.   We know that there's going to be some challenges, but we're going to execute the game plan on both ends as good as we can and to come out with a W. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No.   No. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Thanks Auburn fans and Auburn family, thanks for all your support this whole season.   We'll see you all on Monday. 

Q.   What was the lowest point last season? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   We never thought of that.   Playing here and playing in the SEC, this is what we come to Auburn for, to play a National Championship.   And I've been thankful for the opportunity to play in two of those.   I'm just embracing the moment, so is the team, and we're happy to be here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   We really put last season behind us.   Because Coach Malzahn came in and made sure we did that.   He came in and said, it's a new day.   And we bought into that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I think that brought us together more as a team.   Coach Malzahn came in, he did a great job with the team.   Everybody bought in to what he was bringing to the table.   And that got us where we're at right now. 

Q.   What was the hardest thing last year?
CHRIS DAVIS:   The hardest thing? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   The whole season was hard.   Nobody likes losing.   It's a new day.   And we're just trying to put last season behind us and we're focused on winning the National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I ain't a big fan of interviews, but it's a part of the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   By me being here when Coach Malzahn was the offensive coordinator I knew was all about winning.   And I'm sure that other guys that were here in the past knew the same thing. 
And Coach Malzahn came in with a theme about staying together.   And that's what we came in to the season with staying together.   He also said it's a new day, and we put last season behind us and that's what got us to this point we're at right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   When I came to college my mom told me that that's how I got my name.   Because my old man is Christopher Davis, Jr.   But my momma told me I forgot my name and I decided to wear junior in honor of my dad.   By me never even getting the chance to know him and by this being my last time playing college football and it could have been my last game of football ever, so I just wanted to honor my pops. 

Q.   Did your mom share with you what happened? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   She shared a little with me.   She never got into any great details about it.   But I used to hear some people telling me about my dad, and they told me he was a good football player and basketball player, but my momma, she never really got in details about it, but. 

Q.   How old were you?
CHRIS DAVIS:   I was two years old. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I'm quite sure everybody wishes they had a father figure.   And I never had that father figure.   For me, it's like I was raised by three women, and I love them a lot and they taught me right from wrong.   And they got me to this situation to the point where I'm at right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Yeah, because family is everything to me.   I think I owe them a lot.   And they're part of the reason I do what I'm doing today. 

Q.   Your mom? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   My mom, my grandma and my aunt. 

Q.   Your mom and mom's sister and her mother?
CHRIS DAVIS:   Um‑hum. 

Q.   How tight a group are they?
CHRIS DAVIS:   They're real close.   They're real close.   And every family, you're going to have your ups and downs, but ain't nobody going to love family like family. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I got to say my grandma. 

Q.   What does she make?
CHRIS DAVIS:   Macaroni, fried chicken, everything.   My momma can't cook. 
(Laughter.   I always said that. 
(Laughter.)

Q.   What has your experience been like this season on and off the field? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   It's been a good experience on and off the field.   We're just embracing every moment.   We are happy to be in this position we're at right now playing for the National Championship game. 

Q.   Is your grandma here?
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, she's not here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   They're at home.   They're going to watch it on TV. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That was my grandma on my dad's side.   Julia May. 

Q.   Is she the one who showed up on the field? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Yes, sir. 

Q.   She pushed her way through?
CHRIS DAVIS:   I don't know how she got through all that traffic, but she got there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   They have pretty good receivers, but we have faced good receivers all year.   We're just going to keep doing what got us to this point. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Ricardo got more out of it.   He's an outgoing kid.   And I'm sort of laid back.   We both love being on the front of Sports Illustrated, and we are just embracing that moment. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He made one of the biggest plays that's going to go down in college football history, and I did too.   So it's good to share that moment together on the cover of Sports Illustrated. 

Q.   The timing of it.   Talk about that. 
CHRIS DAVIS:   It couldn't have come at a more perfect time. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Anything can happen in a football game.   And we're just glad those plays happened for us.   Because those plays gave us the opportunity to be here and playing for the National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Women can teach you what a man is supposed to teach you, but they can't do it all.   But I did have three women teach me on how to be respectful, how to carry myself, and in all types of environments.   And I love those three women to death.   And they're the reason why I'm doing what I'm doing now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I'm a clean person.   I like to be neat and you can tell that's where I get it from, those three women. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   That's a nickname my momma gave me growing up.   That's from my mom. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Watch the plays. 

Q.   Over and over? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Over and over. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, we just stayed in the room.   We went and got food and came back to the room.

Q.   What did you get? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   We got some wings.   And we sat on the couch. 

Q.   Your grandma is great.   Is she coming out? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, it's too far. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I watched the rest from the sidelines on crutches.   It was tough to watch. 

Q.   Your ankle? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   High ankle sprain. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Yeah, I tried to plant and planted the wrong way on my ankle. 

Q.   You were on crutches?
CHRIS DAVIS:   Um‑hum.

Q.   Were you able to celebrate?
CHRIS DAVIS:   I tried to celebrate.   Bo Jackson made me feel bad going into the locker room.   He told me he got kicked in the leg by a horse and it didn't keep him out of the Iron Bowl, and I let a high ankle sprain keep me out of the National Championship game.   So he kind of made me feel bad. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   When I went in the locker room. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He's a great quarterback.   I just believe he's the Heisman Trophy winner, so that tells you he's a great quarterback.   He does all the little things right.   And he's a leader for his team.   We have seen a couple of videos on ESPN of him in the locker room being funny, so he's a good player. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   Our coaching staff came up with a scheme and we're going to go out and try to execute that scheme as good as we can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I think it's very important to keep a quarterback off balance.   By blitzing him and messing up things.   But, whatever the scheme the coaches got for us, we're going to go out and execute it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   He got good receivers.   So, yeah, that's, like I say, he's got good receivers. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   I can't answer that question.   We ain't never had a chance to ‑‑ he hasn't got away from us yet.   So I can't answer that question.   We'll see that on Monday. 

Q.   When you look at your play, you've had a lot of injuries, you overcame those injuries, here you are playing for a National Championship.   You got hurt on the first play of the National Championship, what's that been like for you? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   Well, I'm just trying to embrace the moment.   After being hurt back in 2010 on the first play, and having the opportunity to come back this year and hopefully make it through more than one play‑‑ like my career has been up‑and‑down, but I'm happy to go out on top.   And that's the plan we're trying to bring, to bring the National Championship back to the state of Alabama and the Auburn family. 

Q.   How much pride do you think you've been able to provide this team this year?
CHRIS DAVIS:   I take a lot of pride in doing that.   Coach Malzahn chose me to be one of the leaders for the team, and I'm just trying to lead my team into a victory.   And me and some of the other guys, we joke about we're going to be the MVP of the game and we're just going to go out and play our butts off.

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   And I said clearly him.   Because I actually got a chance to see and watch his play unfold.   And I still don't know how he even caught the ball.   How he even saw the ball.   And they were both two great plays and those plays put us in the situation we're in right now. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
CHRIS DAVIS:   It means a lot from them going through what they went through last season.   But they stayed behind us, they believed in us, and we can tell that through every game we had. 
And we have to give Coach Malzahn a lot of the credit.   Because he came in and said it's a new day and we bought into that and we stayed together.   We overcame adversity, we won a lot of close games and he always told us, if the game is close at the end, we will win. 

Q.   Is any of your family coming?
CHRIS DAVIS:   No, they're going to watch it on TV. 

Q.   Your son coming?
CHRIS DAVIS:   No.   He's going to watch it on TV. 

Q.   How old is he? 
CHRIS DAVIS:   He's three.
