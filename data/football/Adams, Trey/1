Q. You spoke a little bit earlier about the preparation and kind of getting your mindset back.  How has preparation for this game been different than anything else you experienced?
TREY ADAMS: Well, it's been the same, except we have more time to do stuff.  So maybe more film, having more, you know, leisure time to, you know, really dial in on our guys.  So probably just having more time to do that has been the biggest.  We do the same thing for every game, practice-wise and film-wise.  So just having more time to, you know, not to rush things and, you know, be more comfortable.
Q. And what do your coaches say they're looking for to get out of this game?
TREY ADAMS: What they're looking for to get out of this game?  Probably that we can play with anyone.  I mean, you want to be the best, you've got to beat the best.  Alabama is probably the best.
It's going to be a fun game.  I mean, looking around this place, it's huge.  I love it.  It's going to be awesome.  I can't wait to play and I'm excited.
