An Interview With:
NATE MEIER
JALEEL JOHNSON
DESMOND KING
Q. For all of you guys, what is something that's surprised you from Stanford when you turned on the film in your preparation?
NATE MEIER: I would say I would start with just the veteran line and how they come off the ball and how they run their offense.  They have a lot of power, and they like to play high-tempo, and to get into high-tempo and just run the ball.
JALEEL JOHNSON: Yeah, I'd second that.  Their guard, Outland Trophy winner [Joshua Garnett], very physical.  They have a very great running back too, so that will be one of our biggest challenges throughout the game too.
DESMOND KING: I believe that their team is very dangerous.  That they have a lot of weapons out there.  Even though they have the running back, McCaffrey and the quarterback Hogan, they also have receivers and big tight ends out there that they can split out wide and kind of put you in a position where you can make your corners check tight ends instead of receivers.
So they're going to put out a big 2-3 back, two backs, three tight ends out there on the field and still probably throw the ball or they can run it at the same time.
Q. I want to follow up on that.  Desmond, what's that like for you?  You're going to see one of those big dudes out there, and all of a sudden you may be isolated in the red zone?
DESMOND KING: It's going to be tough.  But you have to place them in the same position that you place everybody else that you play against.  You've got to step up to the plate.
