<p>	Q.  Talk about your major concerns going into the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jay Cutler, all he's done for the program, talk about him what you expect from him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You got the most experience in Cutler, the most experienced quarterback in the conference, in the League, that doesn't have much experience at that position.  How important is that in what you are trying to do at Vanderbilt?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Jay.  What was your reaction to his being named preseason All SEC Quarterback by the coaches; what does that show about their level of respect for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the things you need to do and are capable of doing in the short-term but need to do in the long-term to get back to say something like eligibility to be more competitive?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little something on the demands of the modern day head coach time demand.  There appears to be more of a growing frustration level off the field and having to address certain things.  How much time would you say you spend coaching, working on strategy as opposed to addressing the media?</p>
<p>	Q.  The tragedy in the off season assured that you would have inexperience coming back at tailback this year.  Talk about the lead candidates for that position, how well they did in the spring and also would you rather see one of those guys just kind of claim the position or would you rather it be tailback by committee?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the mental obstacles you faced at Vanderbilt. </p>
<p>	Q.  Your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you deal with the older guys when you guys lose a couple of games early in the season where they don't act like they -- what do you do today to try to avoid same old syndrome if you will?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just a little more on Kwane, how has the emotional recovery of your team gone?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you guys bring in psychologists or anything like that to help the team deal with Kwane's death, if so what do they tell you to do as a coach or staff to some keys to help them deal with it as they continue?</p>
<p>	Q.  Winning and losing has become awful important.  I know you have spoken before about the commitment to do things right there.  My question is same old question that has been said many years:  Do you have what it takes for Vanderbilt to compete in the SEC, can you compete for championships there and specifically the athletic department reorganization the last couple of years, how does that seem to be working?  Pleased with that?  Comment on that, please. </p>
<p>	Q.  You have said that you felt like that you guys underachieved last year.  Could you kind of expand on that a little bit?  Was it in terms of strictly wins and losses or --</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you overcome the negative perceptions about Vanderbilt because you have the smallest stadium in the League, highest academic's, when it comes to recruiting there are a lot of negatives thrown at you.  How do you overcome those negatives?</p>
<p>	Q.  On your schedule what are some dates that jump out to you if any, that you even look forward to or things you got to do to get through them and then how do you deal with the schedule in terms of assessing your team at the end of the year or how do you approach your schedule?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, on Saturdays. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you still playing with pain or just put on a --</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Erik Davis, I think sometimes he gets lost in the shuffle with like the guys you brought in today, how he has looked in the spring, is he going to be the --</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the offense, how about the defense; what are some places that you are expecting specifically about your defense this year, positive or concerns or both?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Moses, linebackers, specifically him as a player, do you see that group being the strength of your --</p>
