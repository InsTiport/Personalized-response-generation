		  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   First BCS game for Baylor.   How does it feel to be a part of this? 
GLASCO MARTIN:   It feels great.   We've had this vision for a long time.   Got to see it come to fruition after all our hard work. 

Q.   How has everything been as far as the hospitality here?
GLASCO MARTIN:   It's been great.   The hotel people, they do their best to help out.   The volunteers with the shuttle service that takes us around, people just want to get out there and help us have fun in Arizona. 
Mostly the weather has been great.   So it's just been a great experience.   I love it.   I'm sure my teammates love it. 
But we're ready for the game.   Ready to get focused and play this game. 

Q.   Speaking on focus, as far as you guys are in media events here and there, when does that full football focus come into play?
GLASCO MARTIN:   I think it's starting to shift into play right now.   I think these next two days, it won't be as much of a grueling practice, but more sharpening your mind to make sure we go out there and execute the way we know how to. 

Q.   How was it helping the community out here packing up those lunches?
GLASCO MARTIN:   It's always important to give back.   Anytime you can give back to the people that are watching or supporting you, just anybody, it's a great feeling.   It kind of helps yourself. 

Q.   Do you have a lot of family coming out to the game? 
GLASCO MARTIN:   My mom, my aunt and sister are coming to the game.   It's always great to have their support.   Anybody that would come to drive and watch me play, I'm thankful for. 

Q.   How is it being the No.1 team in Texas right now?
GLASCO MARTIN:   It feels good, man.   It feels good.   We've come a long way.   I don't think anybody would have expected this five years ago.
