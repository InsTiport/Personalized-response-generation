Wisconsin - 34, Miami - 24.   
PAUL CHRYST: Well, truly proud of what this team did tonight and all year long.  I think the best part of tonight was a reflection of what it's been all year, and it's a great team victory.  It takes everyone, and I thought everyone contributed.  Proud of what this team did.   
 Q.  Coach and Alex, can you just evaluate Alex's performance tonight?  
PAUL CHRYST: I thought he was really good.  He was.   
 Q.  Alex, how would you evaluate your performance?  
ALEX HORNIBROOK: It was fun to be out here with these guys, and our receivers were making plays for me, Danny and AJ, and the O-line did a great job, and the defense helped us out like we did all year.   
 Q.  I know you struggled with interceptions this year.  What were you seeing in Miami's defense?  
ALEX HORNIBROOK: I'm not sure.  I guess we got lucky and didn't throw in the picks today.  But they played a lot of man coverage, and these guys were winning all their match-ups, so it wasn't too hard for me.   
 Q.  Alex, you seemed to step up a lot in the pocket today, and the lane was open for you.  Was that a design or was that a flaw in Miami?  How did that happen that you had a clear vision to your receivers?  
ALEX HORNIBROOK: I think it was just the O-line, they were doing a great job, whether their defensive line was going up field or not, but they were doing a great job just throwing them by and giving me room to step up on pretty much all those passes.   
 Q.  Danny, can you talk about your performance, three touchdown receptions today?  
DANNY DAVIS III: You know, I had pretty good practice, so it carries out into the game.  I wanted to come out here and play for the seniors and finish strong, and I feel I did a pretty good job.
