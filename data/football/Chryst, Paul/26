Wisconsin - 34, Miami - 24.   
 Q.  What was the key to tonight's victory?  
PAUL CHRYST: We scored more points than they did.   
 Q.  What do you think made the difference in that?  
PAUL CHRYST: Our guys just played, and proud of the way they played, and it was a good win, good team win.   
 Q.  What's this mean for the Big Ten, 13 wins for Wisconsin?  
PAUL CHRYST: I hadn't thought about it.  Obviously proud to be in the Big Ten, and I think we've got a heck of a conference.  We represented well so far in the bowl season.  For this group and for this group of players, 13 wins, that's not easy to do.   
 Q.  What can you say about Alex's performance tonight?  
PAUL CHRYST: I thought he was spot on tonight.  Proud of what he did.   
 Q.  Talk about how big of a win is this for your program?  
PAUL CHRYST: First and foremost, for this team, for this group of players, obviously really proud of all that they did this year, and certainly for the program, it's good.  I think we've taken a lot of pride in everything that happened, what the players, coaches did before us, and they have a responsibility to keep that going and try to build on it.  Just proud of this group.   
 Q.  Your quarterback, 258 yards, four touchdowns.  Was there any indication leading into this game that he was going to have this kind of an impactful game?  
PAUL CHRYST: Well, you never know what's going to happen.  That's why you've got to play the game.  But I thought he prepared really well and obviously was confident with our players.  Nothing happens alone, right?  There's other guys that come in.  Defense, boy, they were big in a lot of moments.  I think the pick that Van Ginkel had was a big catch, and then we were able to capitalize with some points.
