Wisconsin - 24 Purdue - 7

COACH CHRYST: Certainly appreciative of the efforts, and as in each game, goes differently, and you have to come out of it and be able to go into the winner locker room, you appreciate that and all the work that's done by the players and the coaches and that's good.  I think you've got to learn to win different ways.
