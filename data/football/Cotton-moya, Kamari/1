Q. I know you guys expected a really good offense coming into today.  Did you expect anything like this, what they were able to do?
KAMARI COTTON-MOYA: Of course.  We watched them on film all week.  We've seen how strong they were, seen that they had multiple attack ways, attack strategies, and then we just didn't attack well.  We just didn't execute well.
Q. What do you guys have to do moving forward in the next two games?  Of the three games, this was supposed to be the easier of the three.
KAMARI COTTON-MOYA: We've just got to believe, believe in our plan, believe in our coaching, believe in our skills and just not look back.
Q. Is that what kind of the gist of the postgame talk was in the tunnel?
KAMARI COTTON-MOYA: Not really.  Coach Rhoads was just telling us that we didn't play good enough to win, and we didn't, and back to work on Monday.
Q. What's the mood of the defense right now?
KAMARI COTTON-MOYA: The mood?
Q. Yeah.
KAMARI COTTON-MOYA: We just know we've got to play better.  We didn't play good enough at all and we didn't play how we needed to play, and it showed today.
