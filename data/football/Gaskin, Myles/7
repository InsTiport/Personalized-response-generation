Q. Some of the scholarships paid the full tuition, room and board.  That's pushed into the 1,600, right?
MYLES GASKIN: Um-hmm, I think so.
Q. You guys get, what, a check every month when you're on campus, eight months, nine months?
MYLES GASKIN: Yeah.
Q. So in a place like Seattle, the cost of attendance is still pretty high.
MYLES GASKIN: Yeah.  I mean, it's one of those things, it's just you kind of got to make do.  I mean, you really have to.  You got to be smart with your money or else you won't be living somewhere, because you'll get kicked out.
