LANE KIFFIN: Sometimes teams can have a good record, like 12-1, 11-1 and they lucked out in games.  These guys blew a lot of people out.  There's not a lot of close games.  These guys are really explosive on offense.  They don't give up any big plays on defense.  They don't give up a lot of points.   
A lot of people think we're going to walk in and win by three touchdowns and all that.  That's not going to happen unless we play great.  So we're going to have to play really good just to win the game.   
 Q.  You've seen a lot of SEC defenses on film.  Where does the Washington defense stack up?  
LANE KIFFIN: I think that it would be right at the top.  I said yesterday, I think it would be most like probably Florida when Florida was healthy.  I think that Florida, when they were healthy, they got beat up at the end of the year and missed some guys.  Without injuries, I think Florida would have been maybe one of the top couple defenses in the whole country.   
I think these guys are similar to that, fast, really good secondary.  I think, obviously, both corners are NFL players.  The defense reminds me a lot of the Seattle Seahawks.  The size, the speed.  They're faster than they are bigger.  They spend a lot of time together, so the defensive schemes are very similar as well.
