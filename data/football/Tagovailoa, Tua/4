 Q.  You just hugged Kyler Murray.  What was that embrace like?  What was said?  
TUA TAGOVAILOA: Well, he did a great job tonight.  I think he did a tremendous job on offense for his team.  He did all he could.  I mean, just telling him congratulations on a great season and whatnot.  But they were a tough team.  They did really good, but credit goes out to my teammates, as well, for the victory.  I mean, defense gave us the ball back when we needed to.  We didn't execute as much as we wanted to on offense, but we made some things happen when we needed to.  I mean, it was just a great team win.   
 Q.  How does your left ankle feel?  
TUA TAGOVAILOA: My left ankle is still uncertain right now.  We're still trying to get better with it.  I mean, I don't know if it was better tonight than the week, but I mean, right now it's all right.   
 Q.  Given how hard you worked to get back, in 24-hour recovery, we've documented well, how would you describe the satisfaction of this win?  
TUA TAGOVAILOA: I mean, it's good.  You know, it's always good to see your hard work pay off, and just with the team, working hard with the team as well.  It's good to see that everyone is happy.
