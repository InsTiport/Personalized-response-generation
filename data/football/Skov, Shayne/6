 Q.   Tyler, after tonight, how does your body feel after 45 carries?   When did you find out you had broken the school record?   
TYLER GAFFNEY:   Well, right now.   That's when I found out.   I feel great, feel like I just played a football game.   Probably feel as good as these guys.  
   
 Q.   Tyler, can you talk about the holes that you saw with the offensive line tonight?   
TYLER GAFFNEY:   Yeah, it was a grinder.   We made the holes.   Oregon's really good at filling in with their safeties, with their backside backers.   It came down to lowering the shoulder and hoped for the best.  
   
 Q.   Sorry, could you just talk about the offensive line and their job to create those holes?   
TYLER GAFFNEY:   Oh, they're amazing.   I mean, you watch the games, they do their job.   They're moving guys back yards and yards.   I'm taking some credit, I guess, but this is for them.   They did a great job today.  
   
 Q.   A.J., how were you guys able to stop Mariota and this incredible offense?   If you could sum up if a few things, how would you do it?   
A.J. TARPLEY:   We had great players and great coaches.   Make great plays like that and we can stop anybody.   But we have to tip our hat to the offense when those guys give us time to rest and reload every series, and it makes it a lot easier.  
   
 Q.   Shayne, was this your best game in college?   
SHAYNE SKOV:   I don't know.   When one of us makes a mistake, the other steps up and that's how we played.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you rattled Mariota in this game?   
SHAYNE SKOV:   No, I think we knew going into this game was going to be a test of wills.   Two different approaches, two very different tempos.   One team was going to decide the way it was going to go.   And on defense, just attacking the line of scrimmage and disrupting their tempos.   
   
 Q.   As a whole, defensively you held the Ducks to zero points going into the half.   What was your mentality going into the half and following suit after?   
SHAYNE SKOV:   I think speaking for the older guys, I remember 2010 up in Oregon we had (No Microphone).   We knew they're dangerous.   But it's about two hours of football and we have a lot of veteran guys on the team and we weren't going to let that happen again.  
   
 Q.   Tyler, could you talk about the importance of this win, given how Oregon, you're trying to keep their BCS hopes alive, you guys probably shattered that by beating them in this game?   
TYLER GAFFNEY:   It's huge.   I think the whole nation knows and us especially that this is a play‑in game for the Pac‑12 North.   To be able to win the Pac‑12 Championship, you have to go through Oregon or you have to go through us.   That is the mentality we've had these past couple years, and that's what it's going to keep being.  
   
 Q.   Is that a Kurt Rambis look you guys have, or are you the Hanson brothers from Slap Shot, or what have you got?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETES:   No it's nerd nation.   We take pride in what we do.   
   
 Q.   The play with Anderson, and first game back, what was it like to have him back, the Goose?   
SHAYNE SKOV:   It was awesome.   It's unfortunate that we lost Ben, but Henry wants to come in there and play just as well as Ben did.   It looked like he didn't miss a beat.   He's been gone all week, but he came out there and did a great job.  
   
 Q.   Tyler, can you guys play as a team better than you did in the first three quarters tonight?   
TYLER GAFFNEY:   I mean, for the game plan we had, no (laughing).   Yeah, there is always room for improvement, always room for improvement.   There are a couple holes that I missed.   A couple guys that probably not blocked as well as we'd like them to be.   But as a whole, I think we did what we wanted to do, and that was keep Oregon's offense off the field.  
   
 Q.   I know your mission is to stop the other guys from scoring, but were you surprised when you'd look up at the scoreboard in the early fourth quarter and there were zero points against this team?   Why not?   And why was that possible?   
A.J. TARPLEY:   No.   Not at all.   We go into every game with the same mentality that we are going to shut people down.   
SHAYNE SKOV:   We don't concede points.   People can write what they want and say what they want.   But what counts is the guys that take that field.   11 guys on offense take the field, then 11 guys on defense.   What happens between the lines is dictated by us.   That's the only thing we can control and that's how we play.  
   
 Q.   What were the two or three biggest factors that made that shot happen in the third quarter?   
STUDENT‑ATHLETE:   Effort.   One guy makes mistakes, the other guy covers for them.   Intensity, communication, spread you out with the hurry‑up, so we have to communicate, and then, I don't know.   I just say it's effort, intensity and communication.   Effort, intensity, and communication.   We take pride in that and practice it every single week.   Walk into the Pac‑12 teams and run spread offenses effectively with great offenses.   But we take pride in ourself that's we're going to come down and shut them down.  
   
 Q.   Shayne, can you talk about the play where you snapped the ball out of the receiver's hand there?   Were you surprised?   
SHAYNE SKOV:   I just saw him and knew he was at the T.   And I was like, hey, screw it.   I'm going to go for the ball.   Try not to lose it.   You're already down to the goal line area.   So go for the ball, knock it loose, and I picked it up.   A bunch of guys had standout plays today.   It really was a collective effort.
