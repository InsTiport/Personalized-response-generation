 Q. Talk about the touchdown. 
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: It was just a great play by the whole defense, and then I just happened to be there to pick up the ball and everybody was running to the ball. I had blockers up front and scored a touchdown. I mean, I wouldn't be able to do it without the rest of the team, rest of the defense, though. 

 Q. What's the mood in the locker room?
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS I mean, it's just -- you lose a game, you're going to be down a little bit. But we've got to shake it off next week and come back and play Missouri. I mean, this is big-time loss, but we've still got two more games to play, and we've just got to play them to our best ability.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: I don't know. I'm not too sure. 

 Q. Why do you think you guys lost today? 
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: Why do I think we lost? I mean, we just lost to a better team. They just came out more fired up than us.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: Yeah, they are. It's just hard sometimes going out there and then you get score -- they keep scoring touchdowns, and you get kind of beat up. But you've just got to keep bringing it every play, every down. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: I mean, it was pretty tough, but I've got good coaches. They really coached me up. I messed up on some things, but most of all they really showed me technique wise what to do, what not to do, leverage, all this, but it was my first week, so I still kind of messed up on some things, though. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 CORNELIUS DOUGLAS: It could be. I mean, I think it depends on the person, who it is, you know. But I mean, if you have a heart, you have the heart of a champion to win every game. You're going to have losses sometimes. It's going to be tough, but you've just got to come back every week and play.
