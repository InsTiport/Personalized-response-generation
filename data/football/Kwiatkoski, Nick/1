THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.
NICK KWIATKOSKI: It's a good backfield they have.  They get downhill, run hard.  That's the biggest thing I see on film.  They run hard.
As a linebacker, that's something that sticks out on film.
Q. Talk about playing at Bethel?
NICK KWIATKOSKI: I played my sophomore year.  I didn't play a lot.  Freshman, I was on the JV team.  Sophomore year is when I suited up and played for varsity.
Q. Back then, did you ever think you would be at this point you are now?
NICK KWIATKOSKI: No, it's been a crazy career.  Can't really expect anything.  Just kind of go through it.  Been through a lot.  Looking back, I never thought I would be sitting here today.
Q. Do you have anybody from back home coming out here for the game?
NICK KWIATKOSKI: Being my last game, I have some family and friends coming out.  Not too many people, but they're definitely making the trip out here.
Q. What kind of challenges does their offense present to you guys in this game?
NICK KWIATKOSKI: They're a good offense.  They have the ability to make big plays in different parts of the game, run game, pass game.  Quarterback has the potential to extend plays.  They're a versatile offense.  They do a lot of things.
It's one of those things where you have to know what's going on at all times.
Q. What's next for you?  Are you looking a few months down the road after this game?
NICK KWIATKOSKI: I'm not sure.  I mean, I have thought about it, but it's kind of hard to think about it when I'm about to play my last college game.  My big focus is to go out strong, get a win.  We'll start worrying about that after the game.
