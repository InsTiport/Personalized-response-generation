<p>	Q.  Coach, I was wondering, I know you had to do a little bit of double duty the last couple weeks.  Have you done that as well this week or are you very focused on USC this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, first of all, congratulations on your new job that you have down the road. </p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma, when you said they're the best team that you think that you've played, are you prepared for it since you've been at USC?  Could you get into that a little bit more?  Is it because of personnel, schematics?</p>
<p>	Q.  I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on Adrian Peterson.  What special problems does he present for you guys, and is there a player that you've played against that's similar?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ed, you were recruiting Peterson, but were you surprised he's been able to have such a big impact so quickly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ed, you were around a lot of big games at Miami, now at USC.  Where does this game rank in terms of pre-game buildup, hype, anticipation, those kinds of things?</p>
<p>	Q.  What impresses you about their offensive line and what has led them to give up so few sacks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you go into a little more detail on recruiting against Oklahoma?  I mean, how often, how many guys is it year to year, and what's your best pitch when you're selling a kid on USC and against Oklahoma?</p>

<p>	Q.  This question is for Matt.  What are your memories or your thoughts about the way that Leinart has developed since you guys were teammates in high school?  And I understand that in your junior year you started ahead of him at quarterback.  Do you wish you had stayed with that maybe?</p>
<p>	Q.  Darnell, from Oklahoma, the way they do things offensively and how they approach their scheme, you're involved in so much that happens for Southern Cal on the back end defensively especially.  Talk about what you see in Oklahoma and what kind of involvement you and the safeties are going to have to have in USC to try to put Oklahoma in check?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lofa, let's go back to chasing Reggie Bush around in practice, now that you've had time to think about it. </p>

<p>	Q.  Do you have a philosophy how you're going to go about things initially at Old Miss?  Do you have a big picture type of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the talent at Old Miss -- in the state of Mississippi.  Talk about that, how many players there are there every year. </p>
<p>	Q.  From your background recruiting, if there's hypothetically a kid on the fence between SC and Oklahoma at this point, does this game have a real pronounced effect on where that kid might go?</p>
<p>	Q.  The National Title games often, even when you have high-powered offenses, they're going to be low-scoring, tight defensive battles.  Do you anticipate that Tuesday night, and if not, why not?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you were to attack your defense, where do you think people -- where would you attack it?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you look at Matt, he almost seems undersized for a DB, let alone a linebacker.  How does it pull it off with his physical skills?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's a couple Oklahoma assistants who have said privately, "Wait until Adrian Peterson learns technique."  How do you react to that?  Do you see a guy that's getting by just on instinct now?</p>
