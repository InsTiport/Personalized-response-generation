Q. Anything that you can put your finger on?
JOSH FIELDS: We just didn't execute tonight. We have to build off of this game and go into Nevada, execute more, and create big plays.
Q. What was it like --
JOSH FIELDS: It's like playing any other team. We expect to win every game, so every time we play-to-play physical, better football and try to get a W.
Q. Is it running back by committee?
JOSH FIELDS: Yeah, we do running back by committee. Treyvon, me -- I can do it, and we got Rey Flores, he's a running back, as well.
Q. Was today, a big stadium like this --
JOSH FIELDS: No, sir. This is my third year, so I played Tennessee, Oklahoma. I'm familiar with the big Power Five schools.
Q. Where do you guys go from here to get better?
JOSH FIELDS: Just got to see the mistakes that we made this game. Just create big plays. Be more physical and just come out here and just with the mindset that we are going to dominate and win.
