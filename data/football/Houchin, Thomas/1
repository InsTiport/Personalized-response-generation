<p>	Q.  Yes. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how -- team rules, you're talking about team curfew, I assume, that is for you defined as being on the premises or players have to be in their rooms? </p>
<p>	Q.  A couple of things.  Could you talk about perhaps your disappointment that a senior and a captain would be put in a compromising position, perhaps?  Also, could you evaluate Ell's play tonight? </p>
