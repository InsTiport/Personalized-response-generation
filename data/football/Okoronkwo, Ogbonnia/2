Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been good.  Pretty slow pace.  Just been doing a lot of Georgia, just looking at their offense, preparing.
Q. In terms of what they do, how different is it?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's a lot different than the Big 12 for sure.  Similarities can be (indiscernible) and Ohio State.  Their running game and (indiscernible) O line, but nothing like the Big 12.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Towards the end of the year he started playing with a lot more confidence.  I think he's a really good player.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He's fine, just sniffles (inaudible).
Q. This would be the fourth time there isn't a Big Ten or SEC, a Big Ten or Pac-12 team in it.  This is kind of a unique experience having a team involved (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been fun.  But we've been enjoying it.  It's a lot of work at practice but we're just taking it day-by-day.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: So far, just practice.  Practice has been really competitive.  I feel like our guys have really turned it up another notch and it's been really good out there.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: (Indiscernible), that was fun.  It was fun just being around everybody.  I love free prime rib.  I can't complain about that.  I cleaned my plate, every last bit to even the creamed corn, the mashed potatoes, everything.
Q. Did you get seconds?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I wish.  I'm not sure, I didn't ask.  I didn't want to be that guy.
Q. Almost like a competition between (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Oh really.  Somebody should have told me that.  I didn't even have to unbuckle my pants or anything (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Oh, wow.  I didn't know.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I brought roses for my girlfriend at the time and Sadie Grays (phonetic), Valentine's Day.
Q. Sadie Grays?  You were ahead of the curve.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I was a little ladies' man.  I'm not a rose guy anymore.  I think roses are clichÃ©.  But don't quote me -- (laughter) -- I'm not really a rose guy anymore.
Q. I think you can make an exception.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, for sure.  For sure.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been cool.  We got to do a lot of things with the team.  We went to Disneyland.  I enjoyed that.  Rode some rides.  I haven't ridden a lot of rides in my life.  That was my second time.  I had fun.  And then the Beef Bowl, they had a lot of fun with it.  They had a little skit with two of our players.  And free prime rib, I enjoyed it.
Most enjoyable moment?  Getting on the ride for sure.  I about had a heart attack on the ride.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been cool.  The weather's been real nice.  I like it.  It's like hot and cold at the same time, I don't know how to explain it.  It feels good, though.  It's real breezy.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I think it's easier.  It's a business trip.  Coach Riley really instilled that in us before we left that it's not a vacation.  We have things to do and goals to accomplish.  Everybody knows it.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just a rough, physical team.  Two NFL-caliber running backs.  Just a very solid O line.  They're a really good team.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, football is football.  We feel like we're going to put our pads on just like they are, we're going to play football.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I'm going for it.  I hope so.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Every chance I get I have to make him feel pressure, to make him make a decision really quickly.  Before that we have to get them into predictable situations on first and second down.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Our D line, everybody was ready to play.  They've been getting a lot of scrutiny all year, saying that the pass rush has been this and that.  But I told him not to worry about it.  After this game nobody will have anything to say about them.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just practicing lower, lower leverage, being more physical at the point of attack, just stuff like that at that practice.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Can't (indiscernible).  He doesn't need to be coached up.  He's ready to go.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It doesn't feel different, but my role is definitely different.  But it's the same thing.  Everybody was pumped for that game.  Everybody was ready to go.  It's the same thing now.  It's a business trip.  Everybody here is focusing, ready to play.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yes, sir.  The difference, I think, us handling this trip is just, like, we can't expect to show up and win.  There has to be extra work done, behind-the-scenes work.  Has to be stuff that's done like in our free time.  Even though there's not a lot of that, we still have to be able to put in that extra when it's just us in our hotel room.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Well, not really, just because after losing -- after losing everybody counted us out.  So we still feel like that, that we have the underdog mentality.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I think so.  I would say Iowa State just because of how much they ran the ball.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, we (inaudible), but people only say that because they're in the SEC and we're in the Big 12.  So I think it's more just a narrative that they're following.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Not at all.  I mean, we did it last year in the Sugar Bowl.  That was just a year ago.  I don't know how people forgot so fast.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Not saying that.  You know, I just don't understand, like, where that comes from.  You know, like, it confuses me, honestly, when people say that we can't play physical football.  It's like the Big 12, the offenses are different but at the end of the day football is still football.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I love my equipment staff.  Those guys are the best.  They work overtime for us.  They get us all the nice stuff.  I mean, you all see our swag out here today (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just containing him.  He's an explosive guy.  He makes a lot of plays with his feet.  We've just got to limit him.  He's going to make plays.  They're going to keep feeding him the ball but we just have to limit him.
Q. Have you been watching bowl (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been really cool.  Yeah, I grew up watching college football a lot.  I remember the Rose Bowl, USC and Texas, I have it on DVD.  I just watched it while I was home.
It's just really a dream come true being here.  Just as a kid, like, always wanted to be here but never know until it's actually going to happen.  It's just cool.
Q. You being a defender (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I really like the defense.  They're really athletic.  They're really fast and physical.  I really enjoy watching their defense play.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I don't think we weren't prepared last time.  It's just, you just gotta show up on game day.  Last time I feel like the leaders, they had us prepared, the coaches had us prepared, we just didn't get it done.  It wasn't due to lack of preparation or anything, just somebody has to lose; somebody has to win.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Well, we just control what we can control.  And we control all the variables that we can control.  So we have done everything that can be asked of us.  So we're going to like the result, what we get, whatever it is.  We've done everything we can.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I do.  I definitely get tired of it, because it really just doesn't make any sense.  Like people act like we haven't played SEC teams every single year that I've been here and won.  We respect the SEC; they're a really talented conference and really explosive.  It's just that I mean for people to just count us out because we're playing a team from the SEC, I think that's ridiculous.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I don't think it's possible.  I don't think it's possible.  I think he has eyes in the back of his head.  He can run around and do all that, but it's nothing like the (indiscernible) at all.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I don't have any of (inaudible) (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Baker?  I see him every day.  (Inaudible) (laughter) There's nothing wrong with him.  There's nothing wrong with that kid.
Q. Do you think he'll play?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, he's been at every practice.  He's fine.  They've only held him out of (indiscernible) football, so he doesn't miss anything.
Q. Kind of wish (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, there's a lot more energy when Baker is not here (laughter).
Q. Is he coughing up anything?  Is he really sick?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: No, not since the first day.  The first day he was under the weather.  But he's like way better since then.  I'm wondering why he's not with us.  I'm like (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: For sure.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, for sure.  Yeah (indiscernible), I would say Ohio State just for the title level.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, yes, sir.  We've done it before.  We're just ready to, at this point we're just ready to play.  We know they're going to run the ball.  We've been working on it for a month.  There's no surprises there.  We're just ready to play.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I love this break.  I love this break.  We got a lot of guys back.  A lot of guys are fresh.  They're ready to go.  A lot of guys had ample amount of time to watch film.  We feel like with all this time it can only help us.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, he's been at every practice, taking all the first-team reps.
Q. Being a defensive end and linebacker, how do you (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just gotta tackle him.  He's going to get the ball, you tackle him (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I'm a senior.  Senior.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I mean, this is my goal since the summer started, since strength and conditioning started.  ATL.  We put it on our shirts.  You can't go a day in the locker room without hearing someone saying ATL.  That's been our motto, our slogan.  That's what it's been about, the big was our first goal and now this is our second.
Q. You guys (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: We gotta tackle well.  We feel like we did that.  We tackled a lot better at the end of the season.  I'm pretty confident, we've just got to contain them.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: As far as what?
Q. Offense?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: From Georgia?  No, we feel like we're definitely prepared.  There's nothing more we can watch.  We've had a month.  We've seen everything.  So we're just ready to play at this point.
Q. Do you feel like (inaudible) in the moment (indiscernible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: This is a business trip.  Nobody is overwhelmed.  We're ready to play.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: We've got to start with the edge.  If you want to win, win big games you've got to start fast and come out and (inaudible).  These games are usually hard-fought games.  And you want to give yourself every advantage.
Q. (Inaudible) is there anything (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Well, maybe just at the end of the day you're going to win it.  Just like, I don't know if they're really like just emotions, like that you're going to win it no matter what, because we definitely didn't have a doubt in our mind about losing until it happened.
Q. Anything different about (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: For sure.  Yeah, there's definitely things.  But I don't really talk about stuff like that in interviews.
Q. Playing the SEC (inaudible), there's much made about Oklahoma (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, I just feel like people like to hype it up.  They want us to say something that's going to like become a headline, but it's not that big of a deal to us.  We're just playing a team that we get scheduled to play.  And when it's the SEC, we've been 4-0 in the past four years, so those are just facts.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Baker is practicing just fine.  He hasn't missed a rep.  I'm confident.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I can't tell.  He's still talking crap to me (laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: No, not at all.  He's just missing all the media stuff.  And honestly that's hurting me too because I'm getting all these interviews now (laughter).
Q. Ready for Monday?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He'll be fine.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He'll tell you that.  That's my right-hand man.  He's out there making all the calls.  He's out there really getting people lined up.  He's just like -- it's like having another coach on the field.
He watches just as much film as me, knows what's going on before it happens.  He's able to communicate it to everybody.  He's been a real big help to me this year.
Q. What's it like (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: His whole town is watching him.  I think that's a lot of pressure to some people.  Caleb, he loves like being in high-pressure situations.  That's where he thrives.
Q. How was his performance (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Caleb, if his game is -- I told him this is going to be his game, just like the Sugar Bowl last year.  That was his coming-out party.  I told him, like, we need another one like that one on Monday.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: No.  Just because we're not done yet.  You don't stop in the middle of the race and be, like, wow, I'm super ahead of everybody.  You just keep going.  You've got to win it before you start trying to (inaudible) yourself.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: For sure.  We're on the right track.  But we're not really taking time to look back and reflect or anything.  You can easily be reflecting on how you lost in the semifinals or you've just got to keep going.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, I feel like Coach Riley did a really good job in this transition.  It feels like normal.  I've been here for the last four years.  This year didn't feel any different.
Coach Riley stepped in.  It was seamless.  The transition didn't slow us down at all.  So it was fine.  I feel like this year like it went so smoothly just because of that.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, just because -- our last year we really stressed leadership.  We felt like after the Texas Tech game, that's where we made, like, Texas Tech last year, we made our biggest strides in leadership, but we didn't want to have another game like that this year so we tried to get on that early.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He loves it.  You see him?  He probably has some (inaudible) right now, some shades.  He loves that.
Q. What's (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He's just a real, like, confident dude.  He believes in his ability.  He knows he's the fastest guy on the field and he's going to let you hear it.
Q. What's it been like (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It should have already happened for him.  If anything, it was late.  We see him do it in practice, take the top off of the defense all the time at practice.  The guy, you can't run with him stride for stride.  Just happy to see him finally break out in Bedlam.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: (Laughter.)  No, that's not my thing.  No, it's just not my thing.
Q. How proud are you of Murray?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Oh, man, to be out there doing what he's doing at 18, you know, I don't think I could do that, you know?  He's out there really making calls and being a Mike linebacker.  He's a quarterback that (indiscernible) us.  That's a really big deal.  A lot of people don't give him enough credit for that.  He's really young and he's really controlling, like, 11 bodies on the field at once.
Just a testament to how good of a coach Coach Kish is.  He develops players.  He just moved to inside backer, never played it before and he got Freshman All-American.  I'm just ready to see how good that guy can be because the sky's the limit for him.
Q. What have you done to help him out?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I can't take any credit for what he's done.  Yeah, we've done extra workouts together.  We watch film together.  But that's all him.  That's all his want-to.  He's just a hard worker.  He just wants to outwork everybody on the field.
Q. Was it a little overwhelming for him back in the season opener?  (Inaudible) a young guy like?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: What I told him in the season opener, you won't know how it feels until you feel it.  And he got to -- everybody has to go through the -- everybody that first time on the field, everybody goes through the jitters, but they're definitely gone now.
Q. (Inaudible) his role is important.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, for sure.  People aren't going to like mention him just because he's a freshman.  But what Kenny does for our defense is big.  He's sideline to sideline, he's physical.  He makes you feel him in the gaps.  And he just brings a physical dimension to our defense.  But he's definitely a big concern for -- he should be a big concern for Georgia.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I feel like getting there, from starting the season at 18, so happy to be there.  I see what they're saying.  We're here, we've been -- known we were going to be here the whole season.  There was no doubt in our mind that we were going to be in the front all season.
Right now we're at the point where we just want to continue, like, checking off our goal list -- semifinals, check; and then national championship, check.  So I guess that's the difference.  It's been on our to-do list.  They're just another team to cross off.
Q. How does this translate to (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: For sure, just because we've been here before.  I haven't been out once compared to 2015, I know I went out a couple of times.  It's like I don't really care about that stuff.  I know what's in front of me.  I know what possibly could be in front of me.  We just want to handle business.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I see a lot on tape.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, there's definitely opportunities.  Every time you have a guy with less experience, you want to just -- it's just smarter to try things on his side.  But, I mean, I don't really talk much game plan in interviews.  (Laughter) sorry.
Q. How does it feel (inaudible) and how has he been handling it?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He's practicing fine.  He's just been missing the media stuff.  I'm pretty pissed off because without Baker everyone is at my table.  I'm like, wow, come back, (inaudible).
Q. Is there a difference out in practice?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: No, he's fine.  He's fine.  It's just all precautionary.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I mean, we're looking at this as a business trip.  We're not even really like trying to enjoy everything.  We just -- we want to get to the game and we want to win.
Q. How about (inaudible) Riley becoming the head coach?  What stands out most to you about him (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just his confidence.  The way he carries himself.  Coach Riley, he's a guy you want to follow.  You can see that there's no doubt in his mind that he believes that we can win this game.  And when players see that, it's contagious.
Q. How about the layoff (indiscernible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's been good for us.  We've got a lot of guys back from injury.  A lot of guys got to rest.  I got to rest.  My body feels great.  I feel like I did at the beginning of the season.
Q. For Georgia, the running back that you're up against, how does (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: That's fair to say.  Just tackle him.  They have the ball, you tackle them, you know?  You've just got to contain them.  They're NFL-caliber running backs.  We know that.  They're really good.  We believe we've prepared well enough that it's just going to come down to tackling.
Q. (Indiscernible) game plan (inaudible).  What stands out and you were flat out on the ground after that game.  How do you inspire yourself and everyone else to sell out like that?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Honestly, that's sort of been the motto, hold the rope.  I know you watch -- I know you see like all these braces, a lot of people have braces, hold the rope.  I don't have mine on today.
But that's been our motto since summer workouts, just hold the rope, don't let go.  That's what's inspired us.  We've all been working together.  We didn't give up in the summer, don't give up now on the field.
Q. There's been a lot made about the SEC (inaudible) yesterday, saying (inaudible).  Where do you land on it?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: The Big 12 doesn't get enough respect.  We have one of the most competitive conferences (inaudible).  I think the Big 12 is 4-0 in bowl games, is that right?  Do you know what the Big 12 record is now for bowl games?
Q. 4-2.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: 4-2.  And what's the SEC record, do you know that?
Q. 0-2, I think.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Okay.  I'm just saying, like, the SEC this and that.  But look at what's on paper.  We're 4-0 against the SEC.  I'm not saying that they're a bad conference.  We respect that.  They have a great conference.  But I just feel like a lot of people just get caught up in all that stuff.
Q. (Inaudible) a lot made of OU's defense (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: It's fair to say, I guess.  Sort of the first half of the season we weren't playing our best football.  But we really started clicking, and we started playing like complementary football with the offense until the end of the season.
Q. Any doubt about Baker?  He just walked in a few minutes ago for interviews.  Did you ever worry about him being able to play in this game?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: No, I told him to stop being a sissy (laughter).
Q. Anybody else been sick?  Is it stuff going around?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just allergies, the changing weather.  In Norman, it was like 25, 26, and then coming here and it's like in the 70s.  Just a change of weather.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I was feeling it a little bit like the first day, but I got over it.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Just how explosive they are.  Nick Chubb, he's a guy you're not going to arm tackle him, not just going to bring him down with one arm.  You've got to really be physical when tackling him.
And (indiscernible), he's just a guy who can make some ridiculous cuts.  I've seen him make some cuts, some video game cuts on film.  They're just two NFL-caliber guys.  We're excited for the challenge.
Q. Talk about how (indiscernible) has prepared you for those guys.  (Inaudible) issues with the running back -- a year ago (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, that's sort of what I've been saying in practice.  We have Rodney back there.  We have Abdul Adams back there.  We have Trey Sermon back there.  And I've been going against Samaje and (indiscernible) for years.  We've seen really good backs.
We've seen really good backs, we've seen really great backs.  We've seen really great backs and elusive backs.  We've seen it all, so our defense, we're prepared to play against guys like that.
Q. (Inaudible) year ago and the Bulldogs (inaudible).  How has it been for them (inaudible) do they handle it pretty well?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, they've been able to fully lock in, that's been good to see.  They've been really taking advantage of the time off, really watching a lot of film.  Everybody's locked in.  They know what they're doing.  They know they'll really have to play fast and there's going to have to be no hesitation on the field.
Q. (Inaudible) overly complicated.  (Indiscernible) charged up for it, (indiscernible) confidence and being under control as much as possible.
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: For sure, because it's not rocket science what they're doing.  When they line up, they might have a couple of variations, but they're trying to outwill you.  They're trying to just run over you.  It's a mano y mano type of game.  You've just gotta win your matchup.
Q. How do you feel?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: We feel great.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: He's passionate.  He cares.  He cares so much.  He's the first guy there and the last guy there.  The guy like -- he's really a genius.  He can retain so much information.
Everything I get, like, he'll text me sometimes and be like, hey, did you watch this game?  Did you see them do that?  There's just so many things that he's shown me about different offenses just through the course of this year has helped me be successful.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Oh, yeah.  It's just when your coach is putting that much effort in and he's not even playing, it makes you, like, question what you're doing and it makes you check your stuff up.
Q. Highlight (inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Highlight, I would say Disneyland.  Yeah, Disneyland, just riding all those rides.  That was fun.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I just want to shout out to my brother right here, Caleb Kelly.  That's my little bro (laughter).  That's my boy.  New Year's resolutions, I just want to get closer to God and just take care of my family.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Love you all, watch the game.  I'm going to try to put on a show.  I'm going to try.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I feel good.  I feel good.  Got a couple of days before the game (laughter).  Got a couple of days before the game, just resting, kicking my feet up, tipping off some Propel.  (Laughter).
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: You mean first game, personally?  I don't know.  I don't think about stuff like that.  Best game of our defense -- hold on, hold on.  The playoff -- (laughter) the best game for the whole defense, I would say the Big 12 Championship.
We started off the first game with a touchdown.  I don't know who scored it.  What was his name?  (Laughter)  We started the game with a touchdown.  It was 17-17 at halftime -- 17-14.  They didn't score again in the second half.  I feel another dominant game by our defense.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: I would just say it's experience.  There's nothing that I haven't been through.  And I feel like that just helps.  A moment is never going to be too big for me.  You're never going to see me, like, just waver when it's crunch time because I've been here.  I'm old.  I've been here for 10 years (laughter).  I always say that.  Like there's nothing that can surprise me at this point.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Yeah, I mean, I got all my brothers.  They still love the game.  Whenever I get an off week I'm definitely going to come down.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Let me see, I gotta think about this one.  (Laughter) they got -- (laughter).  If I'm watching the Sooners I'm going to be watching Caleb Kelly.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Oh, yeah, and Kenneth Murray for sure.
Q. (Inaudible)?
OGBONNIA OKORONKWO: Hey, he can really do this.  Yeah.
