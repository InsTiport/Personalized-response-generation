<p>	Q.  You said this is your most talented team ever.  That's pretty remarkable statement considering you had four guys drafted in the first round.  How do those two kind of facts mesh?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to size and speed, is speed what you saw in Travis Williams that made you think a guy that size could be a successful linebacker?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Trey Smith and has he fully recovered from the shoulder surgery last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of discussions did you have with Marcus McNeill about the NFL; what does it mean for him to be back another year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think enough has been done as far as changes in the BCS process and formula and in making coaches available -- do you think enough has been done --</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you people that you meet in this off season and prospect's families, how do they view your season, undefeated but not winning the National Championship, how are you seen now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just anybody you meet. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you have got some talent at wide receivers in particular coming back, could you expand on the offense in terms of -- I know we're going to see new running backs; how is the offense looking --</p>
<p>	Q.  Would having more contact with the players during the off season and being able to do more organized team activities, would that curtail some of these off-field problems?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coaches now cannot stand up in front of their teams and say if you go out and win every game, win the conference Championship 13 and 0, you will win a National Championship.  Any of the coaches talk to you about that and also do you think your team has the players come back, have a chip on their shoulder because even though they went 13 and 0, they obviously didn't get the National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  So many juniors leaving early; what is it about Auburn that allows you to keep those guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mark Richt commented earlier, he's only coaching pure football like 25% of the time.  With all the many hats that you guys have to wear, publicly especially, are coaches in major programs becoming like almost CEO types?</p>
<p>	Q.  How satisfying was last year for you personally given everything that went on with your job situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were here last year that question came up.  You seem to want to take the high road.  Your players, did they have a carryover effect after 13 and 0 last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Elaborate on the defense side of the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the spring, the transition between Chisek (phonetic) and Gibbs?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up, what specific improvements did Quentin make this spring and talk about the progress of Steve Gandy?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you won't be at Auburn forever.  Is coaching in the NFL down the road? </p>
<p>	Q.  Judging from your philosophy about the playoff system, all that you don't see, 12 games and postseason, is too many games --</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Kenny Irons.  Unusual to see a kid transfer within the conference.  Could you remember how that transpired and were you surprised South Carolina granted him that release?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you get a chance to see enough of Southern Cal, Championship game during the year, to get an idea of how you guys might have hatched up with them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked over the last couple of years I believe about getting to Auburn to the point where you can contend every year.  Last year you obviously did contend for the national title.  You say you are more talented.  Are you there yet?</p>
