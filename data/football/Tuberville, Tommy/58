<p>	Q. Are you kind of resigned to the fact you are going to wind up No. 2 behind tomorrow night's winner? Would you like to have the plus one format to play whoever wins tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q. Jason, when you look back on this, will you think of yourself as winning a national championship tonight, yourself and your teammates? </p>
<p>	Q. Can you take a second and put your career in perspective now when you're sitting there next to that MVP trophy, talk about what that means to you. </p>
<p>	Q. You guys said before the game you wanted to make a statement with this win. Did you make enough of a statement tonight? </p>
<p>	Q. You guys after the game get a chance to go and celebrate. You went up to the ESPN set. Can you tell me the reasoning for that was? </p>

<p>	Q. In the fourth quarter, you got very conservative, trying to run into nine-man fronts. Were you trying to preserve the game? </p>
<p>	Q. Could you talk about the two stands your defense made on goal to go?</p>
<p>	Q. Was Jason stretching the field early with the deep passes, what kind of stuff did that do for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q. Is there a concern on your part that because the game was so close, that it might sway some voters not to vote for you? </p>
<p>	Q. In the past there have been a coach here or there that's maybe gone against the grain in the coach's poll. Would you consider doing that to make a statement? </p>
<p>	Q. Are you for a playoff in 1A? If you are, what kind of format would you like to see? </p>
<p>	Q. Could you talk about when you stopped them at the one yard line, second quarter, how much that changed the tenor of the game?</p>
<p>	Q. It would seem like with all the BCS implications and ramifications that it might have dictated going for the fourth and two there early on. Then you decided to kick the field goal. What was the thinking there? </p>
<p>	Q. A year ago you said in Auburn that you and your staff were going to win a national title. Did you have any idea at that time it would be this soon?</p>
<p>	Q. Regardless of what happens in the polls, would you consider getting your team rings? </p>
