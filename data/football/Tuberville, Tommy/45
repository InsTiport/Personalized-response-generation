 COACH TUBERVILLE: Derrick Mays, I thought did a good job of playing corner, and played corner the last four or five weeks. We're just trying to find some speed at corner.   
 Hubert, he made plays all over the field. He just needs to learn to play at this level. We've had to play a lot of freshmen this year. So one thing about it, a lot of guys that played today also played during the year. With all the injuries that we've had, you know, Torres bruised his shoulder out there today. We took him out. I think you probably saw that. Other than that, we didn't have any injuries.  
  
  Q. What do you take from the offense or defensive performance given, as you said, the level of competition.   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: The first half, they looked good on defense, didn't give up any points. They played the starters. The thing that happens when you put your back-ups in there, obviously, you're going to give up some yards.   
 I wish we had played a little bit better with the back-up defense. Some of those were seconds and mostly the guys that were thirds that hadn't played much all year long.   
 But it was good that we got in, played our starters and got them out, able to rest them a little bit so they could have a little fun on the sideline and not feel like all the pressure's on them.   
 Have them a little bit more healthier going into this Sunday, ready to play Houston next week. We're going to have to be full speed and ready to go.  
  
  Q. Talk about how you felt about seeing a guy like Jonathan that's been in the program for so long and played a bunch of series on defense?   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Yeah, we have several seniors. We tried to get the ball to as many on offense as we could that haven't played much, being that this is Senior Day.   
 Jonathan Brydon played a lot. Howard played a lot. He's a senior. He's done a good job for us. He just had to play several positions all year. So our main concern was to try to get the seniors that hadn't played much into the game, give them some time to play. They've done an awful lot for this team. Even if they hadn't been starters, they've been around, and it's good to get them in the game and play a little bit in front of their parents.  
  
  Q. Did the time actually work out pretty well for today's game with the way the team's been beat up and needing a victory like this?   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: I would have rather had this game earlier in the year. Break it up a little bit and have another home game, but that's part of it. You've got to play when the schedule is there. Now that it's over with, we played in this game. Probably needed it after the last three games that we played; the Missouri game, A&M game, and the Oklahoma game we were a little bit beat up.   
 Proud of the guys. They came out today, as they have all year long, practiced hard and came out and played hard early. We get off to a good start and that allowed us to play a lot of people.  
  
  Q. What did you think about the special teams?   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Yeah, it went even faster this week. What we wanted to do was play a little bit more up-tempo. I thought it helped us. It was something that I think caught them a little bit by surprise; kept them from getting lined up.   
 Most of the time, even when we do go fast we do sub, and when you sub, you have to give them time and opportunity to get their substitutes in. So you can't quite go as fast as you want.  
 So today we upped it a little bit. The first drive, the first two drives. I think one was a 98-yard drive, and one was an 80-yard drive. Two pretty good drives. Fast tempo, didn't make any mistakes in terms of getting lined up and enough people on the line of scrimmage. So it was good. It was good to see us go that fast.  
  
  Q. Seemed like you threw the ball down the field a little bit today. Was that by plan, or just because it was easier to do?   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Well, we had a little bit more time to throw it, and we wanted to throw it down the field. We wanted to make them get in certain coverage where we could run the ball a little bit more. So it works out pretty good.   
 You want to throw it down the field a lot, but the last couple of weeks we haven't had that opportunity.  
  
  Q. Though you had back-ups you still scored every possession. How important was it for them to get in there and get some experience (No microphone)?  
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Well, if you go back and look at it, Harrison Jeffers played quite a bit. He needed to play because we needed to see what he can do, Aaron Crawford.   
 But McRoy is going to be a force for us as we go along. He gives us an extra step, a guy that can hit the corner. We run a lot of lateral plays. He's pretty exciting to go watch.   
 So it was good to see that start working a little bit. People are going to have to start preparing for it. Hopefully next week we can keep doing what we were doing today and have some the same success running inside and outside. That really makes your running game, and even your passing game, it keeps the defensive line honest and gives the quarterback a little bit more time in the pocket.  
  
  Q. (No microphone)?  
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Yeah, they both got here. Just talking to seniors. We talked about last year coming into the season, you know, what game's important. Every game's important, but they were very disappointed last year of losing that game.   
 So it will be one where I'm sure both teams will be ready to play. Both teams will be a good college football game.  
  
  Q. How much do you wish this game would have been played earlier in the year given the amount of guys you got in?   
 COACH TUBERVILLE: Well, we needed to do this the first month of the season. It would have been good to have it the first month. There is no reason to talk about it, because next year it is that way, all of our non-conference games are early. Unless there is a change in the schedule, we want to move somebody around.   
 So it was good today. It would have probably been good for us to have had a game like this maybe after the Texas game before we jumped right in the middle of Big 12 play, but that's part of it.   
 We're excited that we're to this point today. I know we've had some setbacks during the years, but it's good to see a team play hard even though when you come back off of a game last week and play hard and score, what, 23, 24 points the first quarter. That was fun to watch.
