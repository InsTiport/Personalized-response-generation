Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Probably going to be more when I'm done playing but right now I'm trying to win a National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY: ‑‑ last year, and we got to go out there every game and play our hardest every game.   When I'm sitting down after halftime like we did last year but this year we're playing every game as hard as we can. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   We're grounded.   All these guys on this team we've always been close, like me and Rashad, and Jameis, we've all been close ever since‑‑ when Jameis started we became close right then and then we just‑‑ we've all been close from the beginning.   Rashad didn't talk that much from the beginning, neither did I, so it's kind of like we didn't interact, but we all became real good friends. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   When we come back for reunions we will be like, this is great. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, our teams offense is the best offense, I think.   We go out there and we know we have to score and we get out there and score and I think we play our best when we are under pressure. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   The‑‑ whole time, we just go out there and if we know we have to score, then nobody is stopping us. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I don't know, just instincts, I think, we go out there and when it's time we really gotta score, we score. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Every once in a while. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Huh? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY: ‑‑ long time. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Uh‑huh. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, they've been trying as they can and mainly Rashad and Travis and Ermon, all those guys, I mean, we're just going out there and beat those guys. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   We'll try to‑‑ they will try to bracket Andy and little things like that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   When they got to come‑‑ (Away from mic.)   ‑‑ at you, somebody else is always open.

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, he's an unbelievable running back and Carlos also.   When they're hot running the ball, it opens up the passing game, also. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, some plays yes, and‑‑ yes. 

Q.   Whichever one is on the field, they're hyped for the other one, they're great team players. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY: ‑‑ yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, we don't really‑‑ I mean, we'll throw some different plays in there that we think will open up, but we don't really change anything that we do in the second half. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   This is a perfect situation, the situation you want to be in and then we go out there and try to win the game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, we just go out there and‑‑ like I mean, in our minds we don't think anybody can beat us.   So we go out there and we play our hearts out the whole game.   When we come out then, we won the game and we're happy that we can pull it out. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   No. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, they're all good, the players on the defensive side and we're just going to have to help them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   They have to stop the running and the passing game. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Good.   How you doin?

NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah.

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I'm good. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, a lot of teams have had defensive plans before and they have some good guys on their defense and we have to find holes in their defense. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, there's holes in all defenses, you just got to find them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I don't know.   We stick to the same game plan we have had all season long and get a win. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Everybody thinks they're going to beat us, so we're going to shock the world.   We're going to go out there and play our best and show how much better we are than them. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY: ‑‑ center? 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Hoefeld and Barron‑‑ Hoefeld got hurt but Barron played well when he was in there and we could still do things and then when Cam went in there he started playing a lot better and, I mean, it just opened up a lot of things with his size in there. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah. 

Q.   What kind of player is he? 
NICK O'LEARY:   He's just a confident‑‑ out there and he knows it and he can stop anyone that comes up against him.   He's strong and great at left tackle. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah, I mean, we all came in here to win the National Championship, and we done that and I think we came in here with the right intentions and did what we wanted to. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   We played in high school, in the grid iron games together, ever since then I knew he was going to be a great player and he showed up‑‑ last year to a National Championship. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   He just really‑‑ he tries to keep everybody calm.   So I mean, he tries to joke around all the time and when it's time to get series, he gets series. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   He's the same way all the time.   He never changes.   He's always goofing around in practice and practicing hard, but I mean, he knows when to be serious and when not to be. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah. 

Q.   (No microphone.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, he just‑‑ he tells people what they're doing wrong and just‑‑ he let us 'em know what they're doing wrong, but they know when he's messing around and when he's serious so everybody listens to him. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   No, he's been doing that since he got here. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah, always messing around and you know when he's serious and you're serious. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Yeah.

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Not really, he's a great player, a great guy to talk to, he's a nice guy but we're going to do the same thing we were going to do before that. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   They're a good defense.   I mean, we played against a lot of defenses this year so we're just going to do the same thing we've been doing. 

Q.   (No microphone.)

Q.   (No microphone.)

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   We're winning a different way.   We're still out there winning, playing the best we can play, the only difference is we're playing whole games this year not just halves. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   I mean, he's always been a leader since last year.   He goes out there and keeps everybody calm and lets us, everybody know we're not going to lose the game.

Q.   (No microphone.)
NICK O'LEARY:   Sometimes, but I mean, for the most time he's just out there having a good time, with everybody else, keeping everybody calm and happy and when it's time to be serious, he's serious. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
