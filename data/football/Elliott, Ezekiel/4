Ohio State  Â– 42
  Alabama - 35

Q.   How does it feel being the MVP?
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT:   I was ready coming into the game.   Barry Sanders said before the game there were two great running backs that were going to play tonight, and they both were for Bama.
I felt a little bit left out.

Q.   What's next what are you all going to do to get ready?
EZEKIEL ELLIOTT:   Gotta go back out there grind finish this how we want to.
