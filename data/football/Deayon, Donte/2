  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the preparation.   
DONTE DEAYON:   The preparation is the biggest thing.   Go out there over and over again, make mistakes in practice, so when you get on the big stage, you can just be loose.   
   
 Q.   What stands out about Arizona?  
DONTE DEAYON:   They go really fast.   They have good athletes.   They have a really good football team.   
Their offense is really explosive.   It's going to be a good challenge.
