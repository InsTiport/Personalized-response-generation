TCU-27, TTU-3   
 Q.  How do you feel the run game went today?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: Overall it went well.  I felt the O line was busting their tail to open up the gaps, just let God-given talent take-over.   
 Q.  In terms of TCU's run defense what were you expecting and what allowed you to be so productive today?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: They're a hard, physical team, they're a great program, just like I said before, the offensive line was working really hard today and made a crease in there and I after the handoff, just ran.   
 Q.  How frustrating was it to get in the red zone and not capitalize on some opportunities, especially when the defense kind of got you going right there at the six?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: Yeah, the defense played great.  The offense getting in the red zone, we got to put it in there and that's us, that's on us as players.  It's tough.  It does sting, but next week we got one game hopefully two.   
 Q.  Justin, did you have a full week of practice this week?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: Yes, sir.   
 Q.  And how hard has it been on you the last couple two, three weeks to try to get back into, trying to get back into the offense?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: My main focus is just doing whatever I had to do to come back to the team and lay it all out there for them guys because I love my team, I love the coaching staff, I love everything about Tech and all I wanted to do is just come back and just play my heart out.   
 Q.  What was the locker room like?  
JUSTIN STOCKTON: After a tough loss like this, heads are going to be down, but I mean just us as leaders, got to keep the team up because we still have one more week of play.
