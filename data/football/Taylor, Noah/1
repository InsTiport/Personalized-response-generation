Florida - 36, Virginia - 28
Q. Obviously today didn't end exactly how you guys wanted. Can you talk a little bit about that offense and how it was to stop it? I know you were all over the field making stops.
NOAH TAYLOR: I mean, they were a pretty good offense. Obviously scored 36 points. But I think we lacked execution. There was a lot of missed assignments that we had. We'll put it together next year.
Q. Just to build off that question, like I said, it's not exactly what you guys wanted. I know two losses to end a good year. What can you do to build off this and start next year strong and what can you learn from this loss?
NOAH TAYLOR: First thing we're going to do is get in the weight room. We're going to get conditioned, going to go through winter workouts, spring ball, and it's just going to be a different type of UVA football next year, I believe. A lot of people leaving, so a lot of places need to step up, a lot of leadership. So I think we'll be good.
