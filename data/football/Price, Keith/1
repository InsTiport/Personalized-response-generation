WASHINGTON   28
  STANFORD - 31

Q.   When did you see them open on the last throw? 
KEITH PRICE:   Right when I scrambled, I should have thrown a better ball.   It was kind of a low ball.   I thought it was complete at first.   Turns out it wasn't.   But if I would have thrown the ball a little higher, we would have had a better chance of catching it.

Q.   How hard was it because you were ready to run that next play and all of a sudden it's over? 
KEITH PRICE:   Yeah, yeah, it's tough.   It's tough.   You know you have a chance to win the ballgame, and who is to say.   I don't know if he caught it or dropped it or whatever.   I didn't see the replay.   But just to have the game end like that, that's no fun.

Q.   How surprised were you that they overturned it?   That they could see it conclusive? 
KEITH PRICE:   I was very surprised that they found a way to see it.   I guess the referee made a good call.   I'm not blaming the refs at all.   We just have to play better.   We have to play better in the first half.   Offensively we had too many turnovers and we were shooting ourselves in the foot.

Q.   How close were you to getting that second snap off? 
KEITH PRICE:   Real close.   I was trying to go.

Q.   I could tell. 
KEITH PRICE:   Yeah, I was trying to go.

Q.   Did you hear the whistle blow as you were snapping it? 
KEITH PRICE:   Yeah, as I was snapping it, the whistle blew.

Q.   Because you knew it was coming? 
KEITH PRICE:   Right.

Q.   What goes through your mind?   Trying to go as fast as you can, and all of a sudden it's like‑‑
KEITH PRICE:   Exactly.   It was the last play of the game offensively.   It's just tough, man.   It's tough.   We were so close to winning the ballgame.   We felt that we could win.   Stanford is a great team, but we have a pretty good football team as well.

Q.   How different is that feeling now?   I mean, I know you don't want to go with an L, but you proved something here, right? 
KEITH PRICE:   Yeah, we already knew that we were a good team.   We knew that it was going to be a battle.   We knew it was going to be a hard‑fought one.   But I'm proud of the guys the way that they came back and they bounced back in the second half. 
The defense played phenomenal.   So I wish we had a couple more explosive plays to kind of help them out in the first half.   But I'm proud of the way the offense fought back in the second half.

Q.   Did you get a chance to see their stop on third down at all?   Were you guys huddling up on the sideline? 
KEITH PRICE:   Yeah, I did.   I did, man.   They did a great job giving us a chance to win the ballgame.

Q.   With the third quarter and that first drive again, you guys have had that formula pretty much all season now.   Is there something in particular that happened this time? 
KEITH PRICE:   We just needed to settle down.   I talked to the guys, we need to settle down.   When the ball is in your hands, just catch the ball.   I think the offensive line did a great job protecting me and opening up holes for Bishop.   I mean, this loss is just tough.

Q.   Was S.J. the target on the interception? 
KEITH PRICE:   No, it was Jaydon.   It was Jaydon.   They made a good defensive play, if they didn't get a hand on it, it would have been a touchdown.   I mean, stuff like that happens.

Q.   Did you think that was it at that point? 
KEITH PRICE:   No, I knew we had a shot.   All we needed to do was the defense to get the stop.   They told me, I seen Marcus Peters.   He told me we're going to get you the ball back right now.   That's all we needed was the ball back and we went down and scored.   I was proud of the offense the way we responded.

Q.   What changed?   In the first quarter you guys really struggled.   Then things started to click in.   What was it?
KEITH PRICE:   Guys just needed to settle down.   We were killing ourselves.   I think we had a couple of third and twos, third and shorts.   Then next thing you know we're getting 10 and 15‑yard penalties just shooting ourselves in the foot.   We could have had more explosive plays, kept drive as live, and helped our defense out and put more points on the board in the first half.

Q.   How frustrating is it with the couple of drops there?   It was like you guys really couldn't get tempo. 
KEITH PRICE:   Right, right.   It's frustrating.   It's frustrating.   We're starting routes every day.   The ball didn't bounce on our table tonight.   But the way that some of these guys bounced back, and Kevin Smith had a marvelous game.   I seen the fight in him.   I seen the fight in all our guys.   It's just unfortunate we didn't come out with a W.

Q.   As a leader, what do you say after this?   It's late Saturday night and you have a huge game coming up to get their mind back in it? 
KEITH PRICE:   We know we're not far off at all.   We understand that Stanford is a good team.   We understand that Oregon is a good team.   These are both games that's going to determine the championship.   That's ultimately our goal.   So we know that they're going to come to Seattle hungry.   We know that we're going to be hungry.   We're going to look at the film, but we'll be ready for Oregon next week.
