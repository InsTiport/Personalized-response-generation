THE MODERATOR: Joining me to my far right, fullback Dimitri Flowers; then Erick Wren; and to my right, Rodney Anderson.
Q. Dimitri, what's different about this for you guys than two years ago in the Orange Bowl?
DIMITRI FLOWERS: We have some experience that played on that team.  So we know what it's going to take to ultimately win the game.
And I'd say the biggest difference is we're handling all the distractions well, all the events.  It's a great event here, week long at the Rose Bowl, but we know why we're here.  We're here to win a game.
Q. Erick, you're tight with Baker.  You guys have been through a lot.  How would you describe how he was at practice yesterday?
ERICK WREN: He's the same guy every day.  He's very passionate, energized and always ready to practice.
DIMITRI FLOWERS: You're going to have to ask Coach Riley about that tomorrow.
