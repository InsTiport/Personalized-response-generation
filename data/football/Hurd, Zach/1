		   ZACH HURD: It doesn't matter what anybody else says. It doesn't matter what the media or anybody else's opinion is. It is the opinion of the players that are in our room, and our coaches and the supporting staff. They are the ones that know what we have sacrificed and put in. Everything has fallen into place for us. 

 Q. Connecticut is known for its offensive line development, for its running game. What is the secret to your guys' success?
 ZACH HURD: I think it starts with our offensive line, Coach Wholley. He has done a great job with us. And he knows the techniques, the fundamentals and the way to teach us. 
 And then you have the running back coach, he does a great job with the running backs. It is the guys we bring in. They are hard-working and are big and can move well.

 Q. There is a variety of different blocking techniques, different schemes for offensive linemen, there are zone blocking techniques, power, drive blocking techniques. What do you guys mostly do? What's your focus? 
 ZACH HURD: We want power. We will move on it all game if we need to. That's been our coach's view and what everyone knows us for, is power. We go after it. We will let them make a miss.

 Q. Give me a quick scouting report on the Oklahoma front seven. 
 ZACH HURD: They are big, fast guys. They are running the ball. They put themselves in the positions. From what I can see on film, they don't get out of their patch. We do a great job of getting after them.
