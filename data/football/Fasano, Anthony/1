<p>	Q.  When you were growing up, did you have any particular memory that stands out of Notre Dame, Southern Cal football, any game, what it meant when you just heard about that rivalry? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you think about it now, what does it mean to you in terms of college football and two programs, this kind of intersectional rivalry? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know it's not your side of the ball, but you look at USC's offense, they're averaging 640 yards a game midway through the season.  As an offensive guy, what do you think of when you hear a number like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Big test for your DBs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a quality about Coach Weis that kind of separates him from any other coach you've ever played for? </p>
<p>	Q.  How long did it take for him to get the players to believe they could win any game on the schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think the best story was on the team?  The reason I ask that is so much is written about your coach.  Sometimes the stories about the guys that are actually doing this get lost.  To you, what is the best story on this team among the players? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much of this, being here now at 4-1, how much is just you guys being a year older, a year bigger, more mature, and how much is it the change in the coaching staff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the difference or if there has been a difference in the pride or confidence that you have in your program this year versus years past. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much has Coach Weis had to do with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you weren't a big Notre Dame fan growing up.  There's so much made about the lore of Notre Dame, stories of the past.  Do you buy into any of that stuff or do you think it's kind of silly, the fact you weren't a fan?  I'm curious where you fall on that scale. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell me what you see different in Brady this year as opposed to past years. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you recall an incident either in the huddle, I would assume that's probably the best time when it might have happened, you guys were facing either a key third down or a key series, where he came in and either made a joke or grabbed attention in the huddle, just something that you hadn't seen from him in the past that you said, "He is definitely our guy now"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody talks about the offensive line, Brady, all those people.  Tell us a little about Darius Walker, where he fits into the scheme of this offense. </p>
<p>	Q.  You said earlier the coach has a great way of teaching the system.  Can you elaborate on that?  What is different about the way he teaches compared to some other coaches you've been with? </p>
<p>	Q.  When did you notice everyone kind of buying in and having the confidence you needed to have in his system? </p>

<p>	Q.  I asked Anthony, but who to you is the best story on this team right now, player-wise, and why? </p>
<p>	Q.  You look at him.  To me, maybe you'll agree, when you first look at him, he looks like the typical possession receiver.  Does he fool teams in that he can get down the field and make big plays? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell me what changes do you see in Brady Quinn this year as opposed to past years? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if there was one anecdote or incident in the huddle.  You obviously have had a lot of long drives, crucial third downs.  Was there one particular time when he came in and made a joke or said something where you said, "He's got it now"? </p>
<p>	Q.  What changed with the new coaching staff? </p>
<p>	Q.  As you look at this game coming up, is SC this monolithic, unbelievable thing or is it a deal where if you go out and execute, you can win the ballgame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody talks about Charlie Weis and the offense, Brady, a great offensive line.  Where does Darius Walker fit into the mix of all this? </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a lot of talk about the ghost of Notre Dame, this sort of stuff, the fact you have the game at South Bend, does that give you a little extra edge as far as confidence-wise, just knowing there's kind of a history there, or do you just forget that totally and play the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is whatever confidence you guys might have, from the fact that Coach Weis apparently is a guy that is obviously very prepared, he's going to have you in position to win the game, is that maybe where the most confidence you guys are going to have is going to come from? </p>
<p>	Q.  You returned a lot of guys, especially on offense.  In your mind, what is the biggest reason for such a fast start for this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much has the success been due to Weis' attitude about win right now and how much to his offensive mind that he brought from the Patriots? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you don't worry about some of the ghosts of Notre Dame, the history.  Do you suspect the USC players also don't care about that stuff?  Beyond the fact you'll have your home fans, is there any advantage to the fact you're playing this game at home against the No. 1?  Does that mean anything or do you think the USC players are like you and that doesn't mean anything? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going into this game, beyond the fan reaction, you're not going out there with a ghost for the 12th man? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you take us through with the bye week what Charlie's schedule was in terms of when did you actually start focusing on Southern Cal, how you used the extra days? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you feel that extra week has helped you in terms of preparation?  Do you feel like you know Southern Cal as well as you can know an opponent? </p>

<p>	Q.  Are you going to be able to play baseball and do spring practice at the same time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something you don't want to bring up right away with a new coach, kind of see where your standing is on the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why don't you think you were thrown to much your first two years?  This has been a breakout season for you so far. </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like it's maybe been a while since the two teams have come into this game with this degree of attention from fans and the media.  From your point of view, is there something special with the rivalry or does it blend in with other games on your schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does it add something that the two teams are so highly ranked?  Is there something more to it than there has been perhaps in the past? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about your background as a baseball player.  What was it like when you first came here? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was told that your coach told Coach Weis this spring, your baseball coach, told him you could make a big impact.  He was out there hyping you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little about what Charlie Weis has meant to this team, how your role has changed on this team since he's taken over? </p>
<p>	Q.  How has your role exactly changed since he's taken over? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you recall a particular series or play when you realized that Brady had really come into his own? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen a change in him in the huddle?  Was there one time you can recall where -- doesn't sound like he's much of a joke cracker, maybe I've missed something, has he said something to loosen you guys up at some point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Comic relief is not his thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us something about your family.  Do you have brothers or a dad that played?  Are you a Homer Drew fan? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think your last name is Croatian.  Is there some history there where some grandparents came across? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you speak the language at a young age? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you tell me, was there one particular play that stands out in your mind that Brady has made this year where you said, "He has arrived"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just watching SC the last couple of weeks, they've shown they'll give up some yardage through the air, Arizona State a couple weeks ago, to a lesser degree Arizona last weekend.  To the extent it's possible, are you encouraged by what you see of their secondary? </p>
<p>	Q.  This series has been so lopsided for the last three years.  There's a sense it's going to be a closer game this year.  Jeff Samardzija talked about the confidence that Coach Weis has given you.  What else is the difference this year?  Does it all come from that?  Can you talk about different schemes?  Why is this team so different? </p>
<p>	Q.  In light of the fact you think USC has a good secondary, why do you think Notre Dame has the type of offense that can make USC's defense vulnerable? </p>
<p>	Q.  It looks like it takes a really balanced team to beat them.  You can't just be run heavy or pass heavy.  They don't have any weaknesses on defense.  Do you see any places vulnerable? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about people expecting a close game this year, all the attention that this game is getting, from your point of view, is there still something to this rivalry or does it kind of just fit in with all the other games on your schedule? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does this game feel any different than SC-Notre Dame games you've been a part of? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you first got a look at Coach Weis' playbook or offensive system, was your first reaction that it was really complicated?  In the spring when it started to click, did you start thinking, if we make this work, we're going to have an efficient offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  As far as preparation you've seen thus far, going into the USC game, do y'all feel like the game plan he comes up with is going to be the game plan that's going to find the weaknesses on whatever defense?  Have you gotten the confidence now in him he's going to come up with the scheme that's going to give you the best chance to win? </p>
