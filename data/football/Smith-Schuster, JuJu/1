Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think I was looking forward to going out there and playing with the team.  We've been through a lot.  Obviously they've been through a nine-game win streak.  It's important for us to go out and show what we're made of.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Most definitely.  I think both teams went through the darkest times just to find the light and both teams -- only one team comes down with the win any season.  I think the last game, last time we played USC won.  It's not that far ago, 2009 and I think this year they're back.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Our chemistry, I thought first lost with the team, we had a bunch of individuals trying to make it for ourselves and we had a players meeting after the Utah game.  We have to treat each other like this is it.  We done losing and have to play as a family.  Our chemistry goes a long way.  And throughout these events, we are having a great time.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Hey, fun, JuJu Smith-Schuster, hi, everyone, shout out to my family, teammates and coaches.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Sick, sick.  A cold.  Yeah, trying man.  Barely, anything.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I'm getting better.  I had it last night.  Hopefully it goes away soon.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, just a little cold.  On game day, there's a different vibe to the end.  Now four more days, two more days so --
Q. Talk about stepping out on the field today (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It will be very hard.  As a kid I dreamed of playing in the Rose Bowl.  I think today, it's just something that you want to be part of, and that's what it is.  My adrenaline is going to be really high.  Not just for me but for my teammates, too.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, just being hungry, I'm always competitive.  I always want to be the best of the best I can be.  The guys around me, they helped out so much.  They've been a part of the things I've been through, ups and downs.  I've kind of learned and grown from it.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: My father.
Q. How about an athlete?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: An athlete watching?  I haven't really much thought of that.  I'm just a player who likes a lot of athletes.  I don't have a favorite, I just like a lot of players on each team.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: To always stay humble and always give credit to those who helped you out.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.
Q. Could you elaborate on that?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: For that, we've been through a lot.  The third game loss, we had players we need and after that, we thought we're not going to lose any more games.  After the games we lost.  We're a bunch of individuals, we lost for ourselves.  Now we're as a family and now we're here today.  I can't say I'm not blessed.
Q. How much more of an advantage is that?  This is your home.  How will that play in your advantage?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It's great.  We have the home advantage.  But then again I think Penn State is going to could out, do a white out like they did last time.  The fan base is very strong, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's even.
Q. What do you think when you look at (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I see a lot of things, he's a great player.  He can play both ways.  He can play nickle.  He can play outside.  They can move around here and there, but I think they're very aggressive.  They're very like hands on.  So it's going to be a dog fight, you know?
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Honestly, I hadn't paid attention to them.  I was more focused on my team and how we were doing.  For them, I guess it's like, you know, it's kind of a team everyone sleeps on.  Everybody kind of creeping up, creeping up and boom, both teams from in the Rose Bowl.  It's awesome.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: They're both great corners.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Just to be playing the way we've been playing this eight-game win streak.  You can't change who you are.  You have to stay the same and you finish how you finish.
Q. What has been the best part this whole week?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: The best part?  For me, I would say improv is funny, very, very funny.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I've never been to improv, so it's like the first time.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, yeah.  I mean, the players that they used, it's comedy.
Q. Really?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yes.
Q. How excited are you to get all of the activities out of the way and play?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I wish I was playing right now, but this is all part of the Rose Bowl.  Team activities, family bonding.  Last night was amazing, we got a chance to meet some great people, the CEO.  For us to be there is great.
Q. Do you think the Alabama game, watching the game under the bright lights prepared your team?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah, most definitely.  Now we can say that, having been there.  Now that we've been there, on the big stage and light, for us to be in the Rose Bowl, should be -- we played in the Rose Bowl multiple times so it shouldn't be new to us.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Kind of, yeah.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  They're known for the number one team coming back, and we just have to keep pointing the ball.  We have to keep scoring.  Every time you touch you the ball, we have to get points.  Penn State, they were losing to Wisconsin, and they came back and won the game.  For us, dominating the first half and try to win the second half.
Q. Can you talk about your comfort level with Sam now than when you first --
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Well, at first, I was kind of like, kind of iffy, kind of off.  Over time, we got that connection in practice, but not only for me, but for other receivers, too.  He's able to move around the pocket.  Off his back foot, throw it across the field and that's just Sam.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: No.  Once you scout team, he was like that, too.  He was dicing our defense, the freshman, so --
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It's your last bowl game, the last game of the year.  For us, everything in your cart, why not?  Do everything and win.  We should play the first play, second play, last play.  Obviously, any teams would do anything to win.
Q. (No microphone) what would it be like playing in the Rose Bowl?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, for us, you know, winning the Rose Bowl, you think of the Trifecta, so it's a great feeling.  Then you have -- when you think about losing the Rose Bowl, it's something that you don't want to come to mind but at the same time, the possibility of that, we been through a lot.  I'm just so happy to be here.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: For us, I mean, it seems like we have the home advantage down the street, if there's like a home game.  We played in the stadium before, it's nothing new.  But at the same time, I think Penn State's fan base is really strong.  Even the last game they came down here, they wore all white.  They call it the white-out.  They're pretty deep in their fan base.  I think for us, it's going to be -- yes, we have the home advantage but yes, Penn State's fan base is pretty strong and they'll have a lot of support.
Q. Do you feel like you're at a bowl game?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  The last few -- the last few games have been in California.  He went all year.  Doing the event that's what makes it feel like a bowl game.  Other than that, you practice in our own stadium, and obviously, you play in the Rose Bowl.
Q. What is the fan base like?  (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, people can say it's not fair.  People say it's the Rose Bowl is where it's based at.  But at the same time, I think Penn State will come out here and be very deep with their fans.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Receiver, yeah.  And I'm cold.  So I have to like wear a jacket.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: About last night.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Right.  I don't know what it was.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Obviously, we both had goal routes.  He was on the left.  I was on the right.  He was on the right side.  I saw the ball go to Darreus, and I'm like, oh, shoot.  Next thing you know, Darreus has got the all in his hands, probably one of the best plays I've seen.  For someone to take the ball out of another man's hand is very impressive.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah, most definitely, you put him in a situation where, you know, he kind of helped finish the game.  If you don't make that catch, you're obviously punting it and it would have went any way.  We won by four points against Colorado, so anything could have happened.
Q. You guys got one guy when it comes to (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: You know, he had a one-handed touchdown.  That's something you always show and always watch, you always thought that, you go out and play with your buddies and have fun.  That's what they did.  They said it's a great opportunity, a great feeling.  And, you know, just a blessing to be a part of.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I like how they are very aggressive.  I like how they come down and are ready to read, make holes, make tackles and stopping the running back from going a long way, but that's the best part, a physical group.  I can't say anything more.
Q. Kind of 50/50 with the other side, do you kind of take advantage of that?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, yeah.  Obviously, when you have a little bit of an advantage, you want to take advantage of that.  But also when the ball's in the air, it's 50/50.  They're great DBs and for us it's whoever comes down with it.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, yes, yes, I think, and also makes a big part of it, too.  Also our quarterback putting the ball in the right spot.  At the end of the day, wherever the ball is at, both have to be in great position to make a play and whoever goes up first, you know, most likely might win the ball.
Q. (No microphone) going up first?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.
Q. Big plays should win the game.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  Big plays.  Trick plays might win this game.  I think both teams they have a lot.  They have a lot of trick plays on both sides, and I think that both head coaches are going to do anything just to win this game.  It's going to be a fun game.
Q. (No microphone) Penn State's offense definitely got better.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Definitely.  It was fun to watch their defense.  How Penn State came back, losing to Wisconsin 28-7 in the Big Ten Championship and they obviously come back and score, and they come back in the game and win the game.  Of course it was fun.
Q. Sounds like you went through the same exact stuff.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yes.
Q. Team meeting, in October.  Crazy to look at it and see --
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It is pretty crazy, they went on a nine-game win streak, us on a eight-game win streak.  For us to both be in the Rose Bowl, it's very understandable.
Q. Do you have a New Year's resolution?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: That's a good one.  Being better in the sweater that I love.  Obviously I have a lot to improve on.
Q. The years you played with Adoree', is there a lot of competition there?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Always.  We have the Jim Darwin in front of you.  It's always a great competitive.  For me to get better.  It's me being my best.  Me being with him every day helps him out and he helps me out a lot.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yes.  I think that everything happens for a reason.  I think what happened at the end of the day is a blessing.  I wouldn't change it.
Q. Do you look at other receivers and try to simulate things in their game?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I like watching all of the guys.  Obviously, you watch Julio Jones, Odell Beckham, you know, everybody has their own little swag to them.  Their own technique.  I think it's tool to take a little bit in your game.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, yes.  Makes everything a lot easier.  It doesn't take that tension off me, but he does bring a lot of tension.  Obviously, when he's in the game, you know he's scoring, so you know he's getting the ball.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Our special team head coach?  Baxter, John Baxter, unbelievable guy.  I mean, what he's done with this team I think is unbelievable.  I think he scores at least once a game.  If not even once.  But he's a great guy.
Q. What do you see when you look at Penn State's defense, and the way they'll cover you?  What do you think they'll do?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think they'll be a lot of -- probably bracket the other team.  At the same time, we have numbers around the table.  Darreus Rogers, two running backs, definitely our tight end.  I think will be a great match.  What they bring to a table, we bring to the table.  It's a great game to watch.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, we talked with him, obviously, he talked about, you know, being part of the Rose Bowl.  He's unbelievable.  But I mean, when he had that one-hand catch against Michigan, that was something we seen like, man, wasn't by any means.  It's just catching the ball one handed and doing it and how strong a family they were when they stayed in the game, so yeah.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Just to be better at what I do, you know, playing ball.
Q. What do you think is the best thing to happen (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  It's very important.  I mean, I think for us as an offense, I think we need to put points on the board, field goals, touchdowns.  Every time we touch the ball, we need to put points on the board.  It's great.  I mean, this is why they're in the Rose Bowl and why we're in the Rose Bowl.  It's going to be a full game, a full 60 minutes.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It's amazing.  I'm grateful to be here.  It's a blessing.  It's an honor.  And it's so much fun, them being part of the Rose Bowl.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  I started probably freshman year, and I was never big on social media.  To be a part of it, it's great.  You get to connect with your fans, and, you know, just help out a lot.  It's pretty fun.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, I haven't talked to my parents about it yet.  I mean, that's something I want -- I want to come back.  I want to come back and play safety, do a lot of things, but I also want to go, you know, it's 50/50.  In my head, you know, right now I'm just focused on this game and just winning this game.  After that, give me a week and I'll probably make my decision.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: He encourages me.  He's a great head coach.  When I first met the man, I was probably 12, you know, and I told him, I'm coming to USC.  He said okay.  Let's do it.  Ever since then, he's been, you know -- he's just been a great guy.  Being a great 'SC head coach.  It's unbelievable.  What he's done with the program, turning it around and what Coach Clay Helton is doing.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think for us, it's just our family and coming together, being a family, and, you know, like I said, it's the first three games we were all individuals or a bunch of individuals just trying to make it out for ourself, not really caring about our team.
And now that -- you know, after the third game, we lost, and we treat each other.  That's it, we're done losing.  Now we --
Q. People always say the Rose Bowl (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, always.
Q. (No microphone) considering you guys struggled this year, and now you're back.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  I mean, it is home to us.  It's down the street.  We played in that -- the Rose Bowl multiple times, and for us, it's not a third opportunity to play in it.  It's great.  It's unbelievable.  I can't wait to play it.
Q. (No microphone), what do you think it's going to be like?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I can't even explain that, like the emotion and feelings.  I think you just have to let it happen.  I think it's going to be a great game.  What would you feel like coming out of the tunnel?  You feel like, I don't know.  It's hard to explain.
Q. (No microphone) Rose Bowl highlights?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, always.  He always -- you know, that game was like, you got to win that game by anything you do.  He said it doesn't matter.  Make your plays when it comes to you and dominate the day.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: The only thing we talked about with him was playing in the national championship game and that one was -- his team was like unbelievable.  And his team has confidence, it's something that was huge.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Just my father, when he came into my life, he got me into sports.  He wants me out of trouble, stop playing in the streets and pro ball was the way out.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Once we had that player in me, everybody was like, okay, we're done.  We're losing, we need to keep pushing.  We had them try and bond together as a family, we weren't playing for ourselves, we were playing for each other now, that was the A-game.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Man, this right here.  My brothers, my family, alumni, the Trojan family.  It's amazing.  I think without them, I wouldn't be around today.
Q. Do you have memories (no microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: One, two memories talking about Joe McKnight, we also talked about the one-handed catch.  It's amazing, just being a part of it, of history, you know.
Q. (No microphone) did you get a chance to watch that one?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, definitely.  It's hard.  That game is hard.  Texas, you know, they worked their butt off, so --
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  Most definitely.
Q. It's hard?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  It's pretty hard.
Q. I watched it.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Really?  Were you at the game?
Q. I was not at the game.  I was a teenager at the time.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah, yeah.
Q. This will forever be in my memory.  When you get to see it live --
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I watched it on TV last year.  I didn't see USC live.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  I think what our team has been through, I think for us to go through the darkest time.  When I made my decision to come to 'SC, sanctions was still among us.  And after that, we worked so hard, our Trojan family, what we've been through, it's brought us to the Rose Bowl.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I mean, I can't say we're surprised.  It was kind of expected out of us.  We are a team and that's what we do.  For us, that team meeting, everyone said something.  Personally, I said, like we're done, we can't -- we're not only for ourselves, it's us against the world.  We had to work our butt off to get where we're at today and we've done that.
Q. Is there a moment you're like (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely multiple moments of that.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It was in our spring game where he threw a slant.  Before he came out, he breaks the ball to his head.  Before he turned his head, the ball was there.  Little stuff like that.  Getting the ball there in time, being a NFL pro.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: You know, just being a Trojan, you know?  Just being Trojan made.  That's what we call it.  Just being relentless, you know, trustworthy, hard-working, and just -- it means a lot.  Just being a Trojan goes a long way to be part of this establishment.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I have not thought about that.  Now I know.  I don't know how many more I need, but --
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, really?  Okay.  That's okay.  Coach Casey --
Q. I just thought I'd ask you (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Just being better at my craft.  Being a better man than I was, be a better son, better brother and sister, just get better at football, just the little things.
Q. How about looking back at your favorite movies, something like that, maybe your favorite outlook, something like that?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Definitely Travis Scott's "Goose Bumps."  That's a song I listen to before every game.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: It's a few.  There's a different one.  I think the Travis Scott "Goose Bumps" is my song since it came out.  I always listen to it.  Because I get those goose bumps all of the time.  That's before me stepping out to the field.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Favorite plays in this football season?  Like my play or just a play?
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think the play with Darreus Rogers, taking the ball out of the man's hands, it was an interception, but I snatched it out of his hand.
Q. How about your own?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: My own.  Playing against ASU, the hitch, taking it across field.
Q. There's more to it than that, right?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Most definitely.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think people started being individuals on our team, being a bunch of individuals.  For us, it was more about, you know, after that team meeting, we have our players meeting that we had, we talked about coming together as a family, and now we're done losing games.
Q. When was that?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: After the Utah game, third week, fourth week?  Week three.
Q. And you lost before, right?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Right.
Q. Things began to change?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Most definitely.  Obviously you have a new quarterback, you change up your system.
Q. You have a quarterback that can run?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: R.G. can run, he can do multiple things, so --
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Oh, most definitely.  I mean he --
Q. Move around, that kind of stuff?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: He did.  I think the majority of our players, making the D runs outside the pockets.  There's been times where he fumbled the ball right out the pocket.  Throw it deep and still make the big play.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: We going to be lit.  We going to turn up.  The Rose Bowl, it's so much fun.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I'm sick.
Q. Sorry.
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: That's fine.
Q. Talk about where you come from (no microphone).
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Coming out of high school, I didn't know how to return routes.  It was pretty bad.  He always told me, get to 'SC.  I'm going to be a better player.  He's done that these past few years.  As a player, I learned a lot.  My IQ in football is very high.  I believe so, and just knowing that, just taught me a lot.
Yeah, man, we start off bad, everybody kind of shied a what from 'SC.  For us to be here today is unbelievable.  To be part of history, and go down in history as one of the greatest teams.
Q. The offensive ball, where have things changed (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I think it was the chemistry, you know?  The first three, four games, we were just playing as individuals, a bunch of individuals just trying to make it out for ourself.  I think we came here as a family and we made it fun.  Offense, defense, and special teams.  Every time we touch the ball, here you go, we have to get up the field.  Every time the defense steps on the field, you have to dominate.  Every time we get the ball, you have to score.  Just getting that chemistry, you have to believe in each other.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: Most definitely.  You have one of the best guys, the best hands in the country, Darreus Rogers.  He had two receivers, 6'4", 6'3", height advantage, strong and fast.  Not even that, you have two great running backs in Jones and Justin Davis who both run the ball.  For us to have those residents, makes it again a lot easier.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: I learned that time management is very important with school and playing football.  It's very important to use your time wisely.
Q. (No microphone)?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: For us, it's that second half team.  Second half, they played a full game.  They were down.  They were losing to -- they were losing to Wisconsin 28-7 and they came back and won the game.  They are ranked number one for coming back in the second half.  For us, we have to play a full game.
Q. (No microphone), is there an area you improved the most as wide receiver?
JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER: For me, I can say it's more understanding the game a lot better, and, you know, just being more physical.
