GREG GAINES: I think it's going to take -- it's going to start on the D-line and the O-line.  If we win on the front, we're going to have a really good game.  We've got to keep the quarterback safe, and we've to get to their quarterback.
They've only allowed, I think, seven sacks on the season.  So we want to get a few of those and that would be good.
