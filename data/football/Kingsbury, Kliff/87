KANSAS   21
  TEXAS TECH - 34

Q.   Coach, you said earlier this week that you thought you had to play your best game to win.   Do you feel like you got that performance today that you were looking for from your team? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   It wasn't our best game, that's for sure, but I was just happy to see us find a way to win in the end.   Once again, I thought we had times to really stretch it out.   Defense got big stops and offense wasn't able to capitalize, and that's kind of been the story of our season, so we have to continue to work on rising up in all three phases and putting teams away. 
But you've got to give them a lot of credit.   That's a tough situation there, and their players played really hard, like we've seen all year and stayed in the football game.

Q.   With DeAndre at 132 last week and 164 today, it seems you're becoming more comfortable running the ball?
COACH KINGSBURY:   I've said it since I got here, if that's what we're having success at, we'll keep doing it.   He's been really running well.   The O‑line has been opening up some holes so we'll keep going to it.   At the end of the day, we've got to be able to throw it and win on the outside with our receivers and that is something that's still coming along.   I was proud of the way DeAndre played and really protecting the football all day.

Q.   Did that influence you to run him more towards the end to run the clock today? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, with their offense last week the way they were going in the middle of the game, we needed to score and keep scoring.   I thought our defense was playing well.   We were getting first downs running the ball.

Q.   Would you talk about the defense a little bit.   115 yards or so rushing is all they gave up and the number of stops, like you said, they played off the ball today, didn't they?
COACH KINGSBURY:   I thought so.   I thought they had big stops and big key turnovers at times.   Their two touchdowns were both off our turnovers, which gave them great field position.   Very proud of their effort and hopefully we can build off of that.

Q.   14 points off turnovers, can you talk about that? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   That's kind of been the story of our season.   I was proud of our group to overcome this week, but we can't continue to do that.

Q.   You've lost four in a row, and you finally get the win.   Is it as exciting as other wins or more of a relief to get back in the win column? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, wins are hard to come by in college football, so anytime you get one you have to be pleased with it.   I try to stay pretty level.   So we're looking ahead to TCU already and excited that our guys got to feel that.   Those seniors especially don't have a lot of home games left, so it was good to get them a win.

Q.   Can you talk about Pete Robertson today.   It seemed Pete put a lot of pressure on Ben, and he was in the back field all day long and that helped contain that offense?
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, Pete's been a guy we've had to lean on for a lot of snaps, but he's been coming.   He's played over 100 snaps a game when we play that many.   He just keeps fighting, keeps coming and continues to get back there.   Excited about his development, and he's still learning how to play that position.   Coach Smith has done a really good job of mentoring him.

Q.   What did you think about Ian and the way he played today?   He had the one drop, but other than that. 
COACH KINGSBURY:   Exciting to see him come on.   His first few weeks you could tell it was moving around pretty fast for him and Cam.   Both of them, I think, have settled in a little bit.   It always hurts when you lose somebody like Brad, but I was excited to see Ian step in and make that big touchdown catch and a few others.

Q.   Coach, significant (Indiscernible).   What's it like to see some improvement there? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   That was big.   I thought early on, especially, we had a couple that backed us up and one hurt on the punt return.   It was a big punt return, and the other one we're going in to score and we have a penalty to get us behind the chains.   So still had some at inopportune times, but that was a huge improvement from what we've been doing.

Q.   You know what happened to Jakeem with that leg?   It looked like it was more than it actually turned out to be. 
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I think he's okay.   I'm not sure what it was, but they said he was back.

Q.   What is Josh Hughes' status? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   He is no longer with us for the remainder of the season.

Q.   Was Jakeem out with injuries today? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   He was.

Q.   What did you think of the way the safeties played? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   Not bad, not bad.   Had some missed tackles that I know we'd like to have back, but I felt like for the most part they were in the right place at the right time.   That's a good start.   Now we just have to finish the play.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
COACH KINGSBURY:   A violation of team rules.

Q.   Does he have a program (Indiscernible)?
COACH KINGSBURY:   Not sure yet.   Yeah, not sure yet.

Q.   Was it a relief for you after what happened with the Kansas State game? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   I'm not really going into get into that.   Just violation of team rules.

Q.   Could you talk about Taylor Symmank, his running today was pretty outstanding especially there at the end when he got off a 58‑yarder and really kind of closed the game up?
COACH KINGSBURY:   He's been fantastic.   That last one with that type of situation was a real money punt.   That type of pressure and where he put him helped us close out the game.   Couldn't be more pleased with how he's performed all year.

Q.   If Bradley Marquez sees extended time, who do you think on the receiving corps will step up? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   I'd say Ian would have to be a big part of that, and we'll have to shuffle some bodies around from there.

Q.   What has been the biggest change in your team's rush defense the last few weeks? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   You know, I'm not really sure.   I think probably being more comfortable with Coach Smith's way of calling defenses and the things he's looking for, and then just a lot of guys up front growing up to an extend.   We had a bunch of guys that were new to the Division I game and counting on it to play reps.   I think it's slowing down a little bit for them, and hopefully they're improving.

Q.   Your inside receiver situation, would you anticipate getting Jordan Davis back? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   We're not sure yet.   That's a deal we're still taking day‑to‑day.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
COACH KINGSBURY:   He is no longer with us for the rest of the season as well, so we'll see moving forward.

Q.   Violation? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, no, his was a different situation.

Q.   Have you seen Coach Smith's basketball entrance to the arena last night?   Does that kind of keep you from thinking that might be good for you? 
COACH KINGSBURY:   I heard about it, but I didn't want to watch it.   He's usually pretty smooth, so that's all right.
