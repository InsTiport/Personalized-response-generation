 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, I haven't.   I haven't.   Pretty bizarre, but I thought our kids' effort was incredible the entire time.   Their level of effort from start to finish.   Played their hearts out and found a way to win an ugly game.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about the defense, was everything coming together?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was the best defensive performance I've been a part of since I've been a coach.   We put them in bad spots all night offensively, and they kept stepping up and turning them over and getting stops against a talented offense with a really talented quarterback.   So couldn't be more proud of that side of the ball.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   I mean, that's what he's done.   How he's approached it since we made our decision.   He's taken advantage of the reps.   He's a good player.   I mean, he's a really good player.   I couldn't be more proud of the way he stepped up and came down and won the game for us.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   He said he's okay.   I think he just twisted his ankle or knee or something.   But he's walking around and he felt good after the game.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he played every rep like it's his last, even in practice.   You're happy to see a guy like that have success.   He goes all summer, plays baseball, comes back and he's in mid‑season form this early.   He's an impressive young man.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone).   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, they were going to try to take him away and let some other guys get open.   We had guys open.   I saw the first half, we had a chance to really get up and run out on them, and we didn't make the plays.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he's one of the more explosive players I've been fortunate enough to coach.   We try to get him the ball any way we can.   He makes people miss in space.   He did that again tonight and had that great one‑handed catch to make the play for us.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone).   Do you think that's crucial?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I mean, we needed a quarterback going in to make plays, that's big time.   Like I said, stay focused through all this and not get his head down, not pout, and just come out and compete.   That's what you're looking for.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about the down‑field blocking of the wide receivers?   It seemed they created opportunities for the team.   
COACH KINGSBURY:   They always are.   There are a bunch of wide receivers that made a bunch of plays here, but they work for each other.   Coach Cumbie and Coach Morris do a great job instilling that in them.   So I thought all night on the perimeter, they blocked their hearts out.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the defense in the first half and the second half (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I thought they played just as well if not better.   That is a talented offense with some really good play makers.   So to hold that team with ten points with all the bad situations we put them in, it's an incredible feat.  
   
 Q.   What about finding your running game a little bit late?   You know, you pretty much abandoned everything that the running backs were supposed to get till midway through the third quarter?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, and those backs made huge plays in the passing game.   We're going to get them the ball and find ways to get them the ball.   They were doing a good job taking away the run and late.   When we thought we tired them out a little bit, we thought they ran the ball well which is good.  
   
 Q.   On the punt return‑‑  
COACH KINGSBURY:   I saw it.   I saw it.   They segmented it up there and said he waved, so...  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, no, everybody had seen it.   They were wondering why he was running with it, because all our players looked like they froze.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about your third down defense specifically?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, they do a great job.   Coach Wallerstedt had a great plan, all those guys.   Bunch of seniors over there take a lot of pride in it.   They stepped up and got them off the field over and over and over again when we weren't doing much.   We kept putting them out there and they kept fighting.  
   
 Q.   Was there time to say anything to DeAndre or kind of lift him up?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, I mean, we had to go make another play.   I thought bad habits are good things to teach off of.   It could have been a lot worse, you know?   
   
 Q.   Carlos almost having that (no microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, yeah, a young guy.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I mean, he's coached to stay away from it.   He's a young guy trying to make a play, you know.   We've got a bunch of young guys out there trying to make plays.   So it's stuff you can teach off of and hopefully it will never happen again.  
   
 Q.   Does this win mean more to you personally?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, not at all.   Just proud of all the wins.   We approach each game the same and respect every opponent the same.   I think what I was proud of was just the effort.   The defense, the way they played, it was incredible.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on your first game?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   It was just the next opportunity.   That's how we approach it.   Each week is another opportunity to try to get better and try to win a ballgame.   That's what it is.  
   
 Q.   Did you like playing on Thursday night?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   It was fun.   It was a great atmosphere.   Our students are incredible.   The number of student that's came out and got there early and stayed late, that's what this school is about.   It was a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   (No microphone)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it's a tough turnaround on a short week, so there was some much needed rest.   We'll play Texas State and have a bye week after that.   So they'll have a lot of reps this next couple weeks, get their legs back, and be ready for that stretch run.  
   
 Q.   You guys beat TCU at their own game.   Talk about what that says about Texas Tech that you play a defensive game?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I mean, we're just about winning the ballgame.   I mean, that's it.   I don't know what type of game that was, but we won and we'll take it.  
   
 Q.   Overall, talk about how you're feeling?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Just excited for the players.   I said it, having a new staff and then buying in like they have and the confidence they've shown in us as coaches, it means a lot to watch them go out and play with that type of effort and that type of emotion, you want them to be rewarded for it, and just happy they got a win.
