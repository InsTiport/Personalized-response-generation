COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was exciting.   Came out, started fast.   Scored on some drives and got sloppy towards the end, but was glad we started fast and got it rolling.  
   
 Q.   What did you think when the start was delayed?   What did you guys do in the locker room?   How did you feel like you guys handled it?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was okay.   It was 30, 40 minutes something like that.   So the kids seemed loose and ready to go, so it really wasn't an issue.  
   
 Q.   The only pressure of (Indiscernible)?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he's done a good job.   He's had a good spring and just really shifty.   So when he got his chance, he made some plays and that was exciting to see.  
   
 Q.   Could Quinton White be more of an option in the future running game, or is is it still Kenny Williams and DeAndre?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, we'll see.   Guys play their way into roles on this team game by game, so we'll watch the film and see how it looks.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about Baker Mayfield his performance in the first half tonight, just what stood out to you?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, just protecting the football.   I thought he did a better job not forcing throws.   Couple drops that would have helped, but for the most part, a much better job protecting the football.   Ball wasn't bouncing around everywhere, and not trying to force into tight windows.  
   
 Q.   Then the decision to start Webb in the second half?   Your kind of thought to get off to that big start that you were going to use him or was that the plan all along to allow him to get some game reps?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, it was going to be how the game was going.   And having a short turn around, we wanted to get our starters out and try to get them some rest.  
   
 Q.   Kliff, some thought you might red‑shirt Davis at this point.   Was that considered at all?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   No, no.  
   
 Q.   What benefits do you derive from a game in which it's basically over in the second quarter when you're up 35 or 40 points, something like that?   How does that benefit the team?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   It's a good question.   I don't know how to answer.   You get some young guys experience under the lights in front of the crowd, and some guys stepped up and made some plays.   But that's about it from what I can tell.  
   
 Q.   How much does it help with the short week?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   I hope it helps.   It's still midnight or whatever it is.   It's about the longest game I've ever been a part of, but, hopefully, we'll be able to save their legs a little bit.   It's a tough turn around.   Whatever team handles it the best this week.   We know they're one of the best‑coached teams in America, so it will be a heck of a challenge.  
   
 Q.   Does Baker start no matter who is available at quarterback right now?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   We're still week to week on that.   Anything can happen.   So he's just got to continue to get better and continue to improve.  
   
 Q.   Is what you've seen from him in the last two weeks though, has he made as good a case as he can to remain a starter?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I think he's played well.   Anytime you have a true freshman in a new system who didn't get here too long ago come in and move the ball like he's moved it, that's exciting.   Hopefully, he'll just keep getting better.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel like (Indiscernible) are you comfortable and confident with him being ready to go?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, very, very, I think he's prepared himself well and showed a lot of improvement from week one to week two.   And if he continues to protect the football, then we'll be in good shape.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned (Indiscernible) seemed dynamic?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he had some good moves out there late in the game and did some good things.   That's kind of been his deal every scrimmage we had, and in spring he found his way into the end zone and was making plays.   So it was exciting to see him come out and execute some of those runs.  
   
 Q.   Could you talk about student support tonight?   I mean, 14,000, almost half the student body showed up tonight?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, that's incredible, broke a record.   That meant a lot to our players.   They were rowdy early.   Even after the delay they all came back, which is awesome, and I know Thursday night they'll be back rocking, so I'm looking forward to that.  
   
 Q.   Were you happy to see a couple of turnovers?  
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, that was good.   They had some good takeaways.   That is a good offense, traditionally, there at Stephen F, they throw it around and had good schemes, so I thought our defense hung in there and did a good job.  
   
 Q.   Couple of those situations where you guys were 3rd and 8, and 3rd and 10, and Baker runs for 11 on the first down, how did you feel about his judgment?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, that was some of the similar things early on last year in that.   Sometimes he has guys open and you'd like him just to throw it and then he takes off with it, but that's just growing pains.   I thought it was good that he kept the drives going.   So whether with his arm or his feet, if he get it's, that's all that matters.  
   
 Q.   Did you see improvement with the O‑line?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I thought they played hard.   You still got to get a lot better.   You've got to get a lot better.   But the effort's there.   They're trying and they're pushing the tempo and playing fast.   So we've got to it's as a group continue to get better.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on Webb?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I thought he did good.   Couple throws he'd like to have back.   But I thought he executed well for not having as many reps.  
   
 Q.   Did you pull a lot of the starters because the game was coming up so soon this week?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, we would have probably had a come more drives had we not had the quick turnaround.   But to get out of there relatively healthy, I thought that was the right time to do it.  
   
 Q.   When you were on the 4th and 10 (No microphone) are you going to actually run a play or were you trying to call off sides?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, top secret, so.  
   
 Q.   You get a couple of turnovers tonight, so you kind of see what the drill is?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was good.   We knew they'd be throwing it around and the ball would be in the air.   So we thought we'd have a chance.   That's something we've got to continue to get better at.   Obviously, we had three ourselves and we can't do that.   We have to improve upon that.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of the rushing game overall compared to the SMU game?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Not bad.   Like I said, after the SMU game, they did a good job taking the run game away, so that was half of it, and we didn't get as much movement.   So it was good to see that and create some lanes for some of those backs, because when it's there, they can hit it and make up some yards.  
   
 Q.   Proportion of rushing yards to total yards was good.   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was better.   It was definitely an improvement.   I'm not caught up in that.   However we can score points and win the game, that's what matters to me.  
   
 Q.   Should Beau Carpenter be ready next week, and also Andre Ross?   How serious is his situation?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I'm not sure.   I just know he was out for the game from what AP told me, and Beau is day‑to‑day with his deal, so hopefully he'll be back.  
   
 Q.   Kliff, the two freshmen, the sophomore the junior in the secondary, did you kind of expect Bradley and Chase and those guys to have a big night?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, from what we saw on film, we thought that was an area we could attack.   We had some talented scale in the wideout position, and those guys did a good job when the player was there making the play.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of the new video board and the game atmosphere?   
COACH KINGSBURY:   It was good.   It was good.   The screen adds a dimension, the speakers are obviously a lot better, and they played some pretty good music, so pretty good.   Thank you all.
