KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, just uneven play, a bunch of three-and-outs. The one turnover giving them the ball down on our end of the field wasn't good, and just guys not making plays, lots of drops, lots of big drops, lots of penalties that stalled drives. Not very good I didn't think. I thought Pat moved around, made some plays, protected the ball fairly well, but a lot of those young receivers, just no killer instinct. When we had a chance to put them away, didn't do it.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, I think they had a good scheme. They hit some good stuff. We had to make some tackles, and we didn't. But I thought the second half they played tremendous there holding them scoreless for about the third quarter and it was 59-31, we had the ball, had a chance to really put it away, and just no killer instinct on offense. Very similar to last year where we just never finished games.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: I guess lack of success. I'm not sure. We've got to find it, though. I think Pat has some of it in him. I think some of those receivers, when that ball is there and it's in your hands, those running backs, we've got to catch it and we've got to finish the game.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Like I said, I think the first half they kind of got blitzed. The guy does a good job down there schematically. The quarterback is a good player. They didn't turn it over in the first half. He was running around making plays. The running back is a really good player, a couple receivers, so I think they kind of jumped on us there, but I thought second half to start the third quarter, they really made a good stand, gave up some yards, but got those turnovers. And offensively, when we had a chance to really put it away, we just didn't get it done.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: No, I think that's good. I think that's a step in the right direction. Last year we didn't get that type of production in the second half. Hopefully we'll build off that, but we've just got to start faster on that side of the ball.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, I think so. Like I said, I think they -- Longo had some good schemes that we hadn't seen and then came out and really jumped on us. We gave them the ball that one time on our end which didn't help, but second half they got things under control a little bit more, and then you give those two up late, but a lot of that is on the offense. I think we went three-and-out four times in the second half, so that's on us.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Just how it went. We liked our match-up in the passing game, and like I said, I thought we had a bunch of shots that we dropped big plays and then we had some big plays called back from penalties, and just things we can't let happen.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: You know, Jakeem had a big kickoff return and had some nice plays, but I just thought it was pretty average for those guys as a group and didn't have that at the end of the game to finish it off.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: No, it came as a surprise. I'm not sure how many -- I would assume seven or eight probably, but yeah, it comes as a surprise. Last year we had a bunch. I thought during camp we caught the ball very well, but that was not the case today.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, we had some untimely ones for sure, like a couple plays I can remember, a big screen we had down there we had a block in the back that stalled a drive and a couple others, so just things you can't have happen in those situations.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Internal team matter. Just leave it at that.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Really taking it day by day on that. I don't have an answer for you.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Like I said, I'm just going to leave it internal team matter.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Injury.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, he tightened up during warm-ups, so we sat him out, and then Reggie had to sit out the first half, violation of team rules, so that Z was a little thin over there. Ja'Deion had some nice catches, stepped in, I thought did a pretty good job.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Not bad. He's coming along. Played quarterback in high school, still developing as a wide receiver, but didn't seem too big for him. He went out there and performed.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, just the killer instinct. That's something we talked about, finishing games. It's 59-31, like I said, we had the ball, you've got a chance to go score, it's in the third quarter, you've got a chance to go really put it away and you just let them linger and kind of flounder around and everybody is just okay with it, and we've got to get past that. It's not good enough.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: I'm not sure. He's being examined right now.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, it's only his fifth game or fourth full game, so he has some throws he'd like to have back, some reads he'd like to have back, but for the most part does a good job pushing the tempo and protecting the football, which is what we ask him to do, so we'll just continue to get better there.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: I thought he was pretty even keeled. Like I said, a couple reads I know he'd like to have back, a couple throws that he missed that he'd like to have, but I thought he handled himself well. But the main thing we talked about the whole time was protect the football and we won the turnover battle which we haven't done here in a while, and so it was a positive.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, Symmank has been phenomenal and then it was good to see Barden step up in his first real live action and knock those through.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: We'll just coach them hard. Somebody has got to step up and get it done, so we will coach them very hard this week and get them ready for UTEP.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, he had a good camp. He made plays every time he had an opportunity, which were limited because of those other two guys but he always caught the ball, he was always where he needed to be, and same thing went for today.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: An injury.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: We'll see. It's kind of how he feels and how it improves over this week.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: No, just a rotation. We felt like both of them had deserved to play and had earned that time, and we needed to get Murphy some reps in live-game situations, so we just kind of had a rotation going.


KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, it was a great individual effort for sure. He just broke a tackle and with his speed, once he gets out, he's hard to catch. That was a much-needed return at that time.
