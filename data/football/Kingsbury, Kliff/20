Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: And just not calling great plays down there, not executing at a high level.  So there's a number of things.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: We're just focusing on how we can get better as an offensive over all.  I think we've got to have a better scheme down there.  I thought we moved the ball well at times.  We have to have a better scheme down there, and give our players things they can execute.  And we've obviously been lacking that, and that falls on me.  I think that's the overall approach this week, how we can get better down there as a unit.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: He did.  I thought it was the best game he's had here, actually, just running the football, he's had some great games receiving and done some good things.  But running against a good defense, finishing runs, making people miss in space.  I thought he had one of his most complete games.  That was great seeing coming back from injury.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, I mean I think we've been up and down.  Teams are trying to take Keke out of the mix, which they should and we've got to make some plays on the outside, which Dylan has been solid.  And we're developing rapport with T.J.  He's had some good plays, and we have to find a way to give him a chance on some balls.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, we tried to take some shots.  And weren't able to give him a chance, either fell down on a route or over threw it or threw it out-of-bounds.  He when you have a tough match up you have to give him chances.  We definitely saw that, we weren't able to hit any of the throws.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: You know, we did the same thing, I guess we were in the red zone five times and scored three points.  We felt like he had good drives, just couldn't finish in the red zone.  That's something we've got to get better at.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: It's a little bit of everything, make sure that the quarterbacks come with everything you're calling, make sure the receivers know it inside and out.  And on an execution scale during practice there's a tighter focus and intensity when you get down there during that period.
Q. Talk about the Texas defense?
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: They're playing a lot of young players, and you can tell they're understanding this game better.  They've been great athletes but playing great together.  They bring a lot of pressures.  And they play hard, tackle the football well.  You can just see that all the young players throughout the year have gotten better and better.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Tre King should be good to go.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: More a coach's decision right now with him.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: We'll see.  Day-to-day.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: The same.  Day-to-day.
Q. Both of those guys are still on the team?
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: They are.  Correct.
Q. It's coach's decision, as well?
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: It is.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: He has, he's always been talented.  But he's seeing the football better, triggering better.  He's definitely settled into that position, and you can tell it's slowed down for him a ton.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Not a ton.  Anybody they put back there is going to be very talented.  And they do some different things to help those guys out at times, whether it's rolling coverage or pressures, and they know the ball is coming out.  All those defensive backs are very athletic, very talented.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, we are.  They're going to do what they do.  But one runs a bit more, the other throws a little bit more.  Both talented young players, that are learning the system, and just going to get better ask better.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, I don't know holistically the answer there.  All I can see is the film, and different schemes on defense, different schemes on offensive.  And still very talented.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: It's hard when you look at your own team.  Keke has had an outstanding year.  He jumps out.  And Dakota jumps /-P out to me as two guys that have come on in the season.  There's a bunch we're going to nominate.  And but I think those two have made huge strides this season.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, like I said, teams are doing things, to try to take him away, and he understands that.  He was able to impact the Baylor game and had a nice return the other day.  We'll always look for ways to get him the ball.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: No question.  That's all our focus is on, you put all behind yourself and worry about those guys, and make sure they play one more game.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: I did.  Yeah.  You know, anybody that's met him, he's one of the best few you'll ever meet in your life, the most positive guy ever.  Doesn't matter how bad we got beat on some days, he would act like we were a play away from winning the game.  Always positive.  Always supportive of us.  And lived a great life.  I think they had the get together for all his former players and friends, they packed that arena.  That kind of tells you the impact he had on people's lives and the type of man he was.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: Yeah, he's been a steady hand, no question.  I think the relationships he has with this university and people surrounding this university are incredible.  There's not many people that can survive four coaches like he has.  He's great with the players, his staff.  Another guy that's always smiling, always seeing the bright side of things.  Is a great resource for myself and everybody else on our staff.
Q. (No microphone.)
HEAD COACH KLIFF KINGSBURY: I believe there will be a helmet sticker, is what I heard, I'm not sure a hundred percent, but that's what I heard.
