 Q.   Could you talk about the defense?   It seemed to embrace the challenge when the offense was struggling, especially in the first half.   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, two weeks in a row they've carried us, a bunch of really good players and veteran leadership.   They've done a great job the first four weeks really of leading this team, and so hopefully they can keep building on that, and the offense needs to catch up.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he was all over the field.   Really proud of him, a senior that does everything right and doesn't say much, just does his job.   I think he had eight tackles and a tackle for a loss, so it was fun to see him play.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he came in and played okay, Baker played okay.   Got to get a lot better at that position overall.   But I told them both they're probably both going to play the rest of the year, and we'll figure it out.   You've get to win with two true freshmen quarterbacks and made some good plays, made some bad, and that's what you get early on, but we'll continue to get better there.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   I'm not sure.   
   
 Q.   Could you talk about the fumble recovery for a touchdown?  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it's a great job.   Our defense was swarming, and that's what happens when you're swarming like that and running the ball, all 11, and topped out and scooped it up and scored and we really needed it because the offense was struggling in the first half.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   He got banged up and hit on his back.   Like I said, we feel like Davis can lead us at any point, and they're both going to be playing, so Davis went in and made a couple good throws and had some bad ones, but overall that position has to get better, and they will.   We've got a bye week to get a bunch of reps in and then a road game.   We'll see where we're at.   
   
 Q.   As you start preparation for Kansas, how difficult do you think the quarterback choice is going to be?   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, we'll see.   I'm glad we have the bye week to think it over, and as coaches we'll sit down and talk it over, and we'll play whoever gives us the best chance to win.   Baker is 4‑0 as a starter, so we'll see how it goes.   
   
 Q.   How soon do you think (indiscernible)?   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   I don't know.   That's the thing, they just‑‑ every day they give me a new update, and he's come a long way from where he was, but I still don't have a timetable exactly.   
   
 Q.   What is the status of J.J.?   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   J.J. should be back by next week.   He had a little something in his knee, but it was a lot less than we thought initially, and he's walking around and it looks good, so I expect him back early next week.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about Amaro's play?   He was money in the middle tonight catching the ball.   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, both those guys had a lot of confidence putting the ball high and let him go get it.   He's been fearless in doing it, so that's really helped us, especially on 3rd downs.   He's made a bunch of big catches up the middle.  
   
 Q.   Are you satisfied with where he's at right now?  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   No, not at all.   We had way too many times where we had numbers in the run game and weren't able to produce the yards, and we've just got to keep getting better because those backs are good players but a lot of times there's nowhere to go, so we've got to keep getting better at that.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, got to get better, and that's when you can't run the ball like you'd like to down there, then that comes into play, but proud of Bustin.   He stepped up and hit a bunch of them and continued to work down there and find ways to get touchdowns instead of field goals.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I mean, we just got to respond as an offense.   We expect to score any time we have the ball in our offense, and I thought our guys did a good job coming back down and making plays after they did.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   We'll be back next week, as well, so that will be much needed up front, and looking forward to that.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, you know, offensively as fast as we go we need to stay on the field if we can to keep our defense off, and defensively they harp on that all the time, three‑and‑out, get them off the field.   We talk about it, we work at it a lot, and the defense has really been spectacular at it the first four weeks.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was a great catch.   Eric, I said it last week, I just did a poor job of finding him, but we got him back involved this week and we're going to continue to get him more and more involved as we get better at that position, the quarterback position.   He had a nice game and excited to see him having success again.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   No, I'd have to watch the film, but just really excited about the production.   They're creating turnovers and swarming and getting off the field on 3rd and 4th down.   A lot of big stops, so I was excited about that.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he's got a big‑time arm, but it was more what they were giving us, and we missed some, we made some, and we just got to get more consistent.   He's got to be stronger in the pocket and not look to get out and make plays with his feet all the time.  
   
 Q.   Do you think there was any emotion hanging over the TCU game?   
    COACH KINGSBURY:   No, not at all.   I think the defense played great again, and I just think offensively we had two turnovers and two 4th down stops in the first half and just didn't get a rhythm for the second week in a row.   I've got to do a better job of game planning and getting those guys ready to go.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, when he takes off like that he's got to protect it, and so we've just got to keep working on it.   They're young guys and they're trying to make plays, which you appreciate, but you've got to be smart, especially down there in the red zone when you've already got points.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   It's huge.   We've got to get better, especially with some young players at certain positions.   We've got to use that week to improve our team and keep it rolling.   Excited to be 4‑0 at this point, especially the last two weeks not playing well on offense.   It says a lot about our team and the other sides of the ball rising up when we need them to.   
   
 Q.   They had a couple of sacks tonight, and it looked like (indiscernible).   Can you talk about that?  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, he's a big kid and really worked at it, and we've still got to put some weight on him, but he had a great summer and off‑season, and he's hard to get down, so hopefully that can continue where he's extending plays and it breaks down.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, I think we've got to keep him more in the pocket when it is there.   There's a time to get out and run, he knows that, and we'll watch film and get better.   But young guys are excited and that happens.   It comes with the territory.   
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible.)  
    COACH KINGSBURY:   Yeah, it was a big‑time play when we needed it.   It was a 3rd down and he kind of posted him up and kind of grabbed him with one hand.   He came through at a crucial time for us.
