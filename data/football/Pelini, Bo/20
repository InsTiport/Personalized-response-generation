<p>	Q.  This is for both you guys.  Can you talk about the addition of Marcus Walker at cornerback and how he's solidified your secondary?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Pelini, as a former assistant with Pete Carroll for the New England Patriots, has that helped you while watching tape this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  First of all, Brent and Bo, congratulations on a great season.  Brent, you made some adjustments at some point in the year which really solidified your defense against giving up big plays, and the last few outings you played lights out on defense.  I know you don't want to give away a game plan, but talk about those adjustments and what you did and how it solidified this defense that's really come together to become one of the top defenses in the country?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brent and Bo, this is for both of you guys.  Obviously Mike's departure -- how would you say each of you has put your individual handprint on the defense? </p>

<p>	Q.  Brent, people have become so accustomed the last few years to you guys being so dominant defensively and kind of producing all these guys who get all-American and other awards.  With the exception of maybe Dan, a lot of these guys have not gotten quite that same kind of recognition.  Is this a different kind of defense than you've had in the past, and along those lines, people might say it's not as dominant as it has been in the past.  Is that a misnomer or has this been a different kind of year defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brent, you mentioned Bo coming in and the third linebacker, especially on early downs.  If you both would address this, this might be one of those games scheme-wise that you would need to do that anyway.  Is that something that is especially beneficial to you in a game like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bo, would you address that, please?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you say that the four weeks or so -- over this break, how would you say that's helped Antonio's continued recovery, and would you classify him as near 100 percent, at 100 percent at this point?</p>

<p>	Q.  Bo, could you give us some insight into the conversations that took place to take the red shirt off of Walker because taking the red shirt off a kid in November is a tough, tough decision.  Was the decision to say, hey, we're not going to get to where we want to be unless we do this?  Ultimately what did it come down to? </p>


<p>	Q.  Talk about Southern Cal.  You said back in Norman before you came down here you thought maybe athletically they were as talented as any offense that you've seen.  Now that you continue to watch them, do you feel that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a question for both of you guys.  With Cal being such a strong representative for the PAC 10, do you have to say anything to your players about taking too much or not enough?  Do you want them to take something from that result last night with Texas Tech beating them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brent, how would you characterize Lance Mitchell's journey over the last two years and what do you think he's accomplished and done this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is he 100 percent going into this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Bo, knowing Pete Carroll as well as you do and given the fact that you had basically a month to prepare for this game, how difficult could that be for the Oklahoma offense in terms of preparation time?</p>


<p>	Q.  Which is the most media intensive?  If you don't particularly want to deal with the media, is it easier in the NFL or easier at the college level?</p>
