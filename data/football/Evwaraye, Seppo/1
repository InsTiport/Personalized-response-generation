<p>	Q.  Hey, Coach, can you talk about the differences in coaching of the program in the second year compared to the first. </p>

<p>	Q.  Coach, a couple injury questions:  Over the spring, Brandon Jackson, Matt Herian, Lydon Murtha, how are they doing right now?  What's the status for the season? </p>

<p>	Q.  Bill, what attracted you to Zac Taylor? </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean Callahan with Rival.com.  Coach, how much of an upgrade do you expect Zac to bring to the offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  This is for coach and the players, too.  What are the main things, maybe the two or three that you have learned from last season or took away from last season? </p>




<p>	Q.  Randy Riggs, Austin America.  For Cory and Seppo, can you talk about how different this spring was as opposed to last spring in terms of just understanding the offense and knowing what you are supposed to be doing. </p>
