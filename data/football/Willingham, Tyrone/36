<p>	Q.  Having played six straight weeks, is your team tired?  Does it physically need a break from the intensity of it all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you tried looking at Bowl situations yet, implications, where you stand?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you worry about the players thinking much about this, especially an off week?  I'm sure they're looking at these things. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Question regarding the BCS ratings and needing a law degree to figure it out.) </p>
<p>	Q.  How will you approach this week?  Will you take the same schedule and go through the same routines that you had in the previous weeks, previous bye weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle's numbers have improved a lot since he's been back from his injury.  Any specific things you've seen in his development that have led to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you been able to get much of a read regarding Gerome Sapp?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you take a look at USC this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you look at specifically?  How might that be different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now it's November, the weather is changing.  What challenge does that present to you when you're inside more as opposed to being outside on the field?  How does that change your preparation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Passing game, is it just the natural process as you go along with guys getting more comfortable, or is there something else to it?  Has Carlyle really done something well to be able to expand the production, limit the mistakes?  Has he done something special during the last few weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the players talked about after the game that the bye week came at a good time, not only because the team seemed to need some physical rest, but mental rest.  How do you provide mental rest for the team? </p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like your bye weeks this year have come at good intervals.  Some years you have two bye weeks within a month, closer together.  Do you have any preference on bye weeks, how they can help or hinder a team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything new on the status of Gerome Sapp?  Sorry if that was already asked.</p>
<p>	Q.  You expressed a lot of confidence in Ryan Grant on Saturday.  Anything changed with his status, after all his fumbles?  He's still sharing time at that spot with Rashon Powers-Neal and Marcus Wilson?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned the bye week.  You mentioned mental rest for the players.  I'm wondering how your routine changes this week.  What is typical of what you do that would be different? </p>
<p>	Q.  With just a couple left to go, what would you say you've been most satisfied with this season and dissatisfied with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Courtney Watson made a comment, the team hasn't performed up to their ability the last three weeks.  Do you see that as a lack of concentration?  What do you do during this bye week to get the team back on track?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Rutgers, what does that team bring to the table, what do you have to do to prepare for that this week in practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan seems like a very serious and focused guy.  He was saying after Saturday's game, shaking his said, "I don't know what it is, but I'm going to find a way to fix it."  With somebody who is that focused, do you have to sometimes say to him, "You've done a good job" so he doesn't put too much pressure on himself?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's a little cold for golf.  Is there anything you do when you need to relax and get away from it for a few hours?</p>
