<p>	Q.  Jones was in a few minutes ago talking about the importance of the game and revenge; he said it's not something the players talk about, but something he knows is on everybody's mind.  Is that an emotion that you like, that they can look back at last season's loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it worry you at all that players try to do too much in this game; you can't change the results of last year, but that players meet try to do more than they should?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was the biggest surprise to you in that game the fact that they were able to amass so many yards?  A lot of people thought it would be a close game, but the one thing that they were pretty sure of  -- USC would not be able to get a lot of yards on Notre  Dame, but total opposite happened, it was a record day for them, the worst day ever  ...</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the offensive line play against Pittsburgh, did you see a significant  improvement on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was the play of Ryan Harris a big difference in that, do you know?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan Harris, did he perform as well as you hoped he would?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've always said that regardless of age or experience or inexperience, the best player is going to play.  Has Carlyle Holiday improved that quickly as a receiver or do you have to bend that a little bit to get an athlete of that caliber on the field to keep him involved because he is one snap away from being a quarterback again?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think the point was brought up over the weekend by one of the announcers that you have a lot of offensive players on your punt and kick coverage team.  Are you at all ever concerned about offensive players having to be quote "defensive players" on special teams and make tackles when they should be running down the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  No.  I'm saying maybe they are not as good at tackle, punt and kick coverage.</p>
<p>	Q.  Anthony Fasano played quite a bit the other day.  Would you relate what he's been able to do to get himself  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about what Darrell Campbell may be asked to do and what you've seen from him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is Darrell Campbell like off the field versus what he's like on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  What the the status of Nick Setta for the weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think of DJ Fitzpatrick?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's Nick's injury exactly?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the status in the preparation with Carlyle Holiday, is he working out 100% in practice as a receiver, or heaven forbid, barring an injury to Brady, is he still working out as quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are you hearing from the fans, getting mail, pro or con?</p>
<p>	Q.  I remember Parsegan (ph) once told me, he gets mail criticizing the team even when he wins.</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have many people sending you, literally, plays to use?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you see in the USC defense, obviously they stop the run very well, and talk about the challenge that your offense faces versus the USC defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same lines with the offense, you were able to run the ball, do you think you can have the same similar success against this defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as your defense versus their offense, last year it looked like they threw it to the backs a lot, their tight endl who will be out on their second string, tight end is now injured, are they doing similar things that they were doing that last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much advantage do you think him coming from a very consistent high school program helped Ryan at a position where freshman rarely play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Probably an unfair comparison, are there any similarities between him and Quaim (ph) who played very early for you at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at USC's offense a little bit, what are some unique challenges there their tailbacks present with those three guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at Ryan and Julius, you've talked about the advantage of two different styles of backs and keeping the defense on their heels a little bit.  USC can do the same thing defensively, how do you prepare for that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Quieting Larry Fitzgerald on Saturday, I think most quarterbacks always say you are never going to shut a great receiver down completely, but Vontez has so much confidence, and you have not coached him for all four years but you've seen hem for all four years, talk about his growth and what allows him to be so effective week after week.</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit, talking to some of the offensive lineman going into the Pitt game they talked about the need to get going, get their confidence back.  Can you talk about the job that Ryan and Julius did in helping that line get his confidence back, because obviously any line loves to have its backs run for 300 yards.</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Mike Weinert (ph), his ability to step in?  I guess a lot of people might have expected USC to have a drop after after Carson Paul left, but for a young guy he has done an amazing job of keeping that going.</p>
<p>	Q.  The past weekend there were several games that fans might have expected to be closer than they were, there were blow-outs in games that were supposed to be closer. Is  that a sign of parity in college football, are the days of super programs over?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  In what ways is he a leader on the team now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was this past game the game you were expecting when he came back, not a record-setting game, but really dominating on the ground?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that is the cost of doing business in IA football these days, it seems like a frequent occurrence that  -- inaudible -- and how does that affect the team, and maybe recruiting especially?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed to be, I don't know, there's a lot of college basketball, seems like some coaches are reluctant to take transfers, but this also seemed to be really not uncommon that a quarterback would transfer to another school and perform pretty well there, just sort of a gamble on both the school's part even taking a quarterback in as well as the player's part?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the days leading up to the Pitt game, did you see anything in practice that sort of indicated that the team might have that kind of bust-out day offensively, especially in the running game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you see the way the guys came out so well in the first quarter -- and that's been missing a little bit; was there more of a sense of urgency going into this game, do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously your faith in this group never wavered through the 1-3 start.  Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You addressed the defense, can you talk specifically about their defensive line and why they have been so effective and some of the problems they pose for you guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regard to Julius Jones, when he left Notre  Dame, I mean, were you  -- what was kind of your mind set, did you think he was going to come back, was it within that plan that he was going to return sometime or are you just  -- were you just kind of taking a wait-and-see approach?</p>
<p>	Q.  And were you surprised at his progress or did he just, as it was unfolding, or did he just give you a call when he had finished the work he needed to do and said, "hey, I'm coming back"?</p>
<p>	Q.  How has Rhema McKnight developed as a young receiving threat for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've coached against USC every year you've been a head coach, what makes the game special for you and why do you consider it so special for Notre  Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any hard feelings about the way USC finished off that game last season, scoring at the end of game, even blitzing late in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible -- Saturday, he had 33 yards passing and 352 yards rushing, to win against USC, is he going to have to throw those two things more into balance?</p>
<p>	Q.  That would work.  That would be balanced.</p>
<p>	Q.  Not much has been said about the USC offenses but despite the new quarterback and several new players, they are still in an explosive group, can you talk about their offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  The year layoff that Julius took, were you concerned about how far back that would set him in terms of his football, and did he surprise you about how quickly he was able to come back and get back into that sort of shape?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think he appreciates football a little bit more now that it was taken away from him for a little while?</p>
