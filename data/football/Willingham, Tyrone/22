<p>	Q.  After the game, I probably heard about four or five different reporters ask your coordinators about whether adjustments were made, I guess that's the buzz word, and of course they said yes because if they said no that would make them look bad, so of course they said yes, that they made adjustments.  But what is the reality of that, what constitutes an adjustment at halftime, and specifically, what kind of adjustments do you make over the course of a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't mean to accuse  --</p>
<p>	Q.  -- you're right.</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of adjustments do you make over the course, at half-time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you find that most of the time it's not a matter of an adjustment, it's just a matter of one team playing better than the other?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned after the game that you thought your team was tentative against USC.  Do you feel, were they intimidated by the situation, were they intimidated by a USC team that's clearly one of the best teams in the country?</p>
<p>	Q.  Barry was asked about his quarterback and apparently he had knee surgery on Sunday and he cited the Federal Privacy Law as his inability to say something about the injury.  Is that something that you're advised by the university?  I think that came into play when you were still at Stanford; what does a Stanford, what does a Notre  Dame tell you with regard to that law?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you always approach it that way, even before there was a law?</p>
<p>	Q.  And also you're trying to respect the future career of an athlete?</p>
<p>	Q.  They put him through so many physical  --</p>
<p>	Q.  At this stage, halfway through the year  -- inaudible --  will not play the balance of the season at this stage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will he be made  -- would we have access to him for him to answer to his  --</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if you could talk about Julius Jones and Jeff Price a little bit, how close, how competitive they are in practices and just the progress of those two guys this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  And even in building for next year, because obviously Nicholas isn't going to be here next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fullback's role this year, is this how you had hoped it would look, I mean, obviously it's Stanford, you have a very talented young man, your later years there, can you talk a little bit about the fullback's role?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even in terms of production?</p>
<p>	Q.  Right.</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game you mentioned, someone asked you about Brady Quinn's performance and you said  -- I'm paraphrasing  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  You got it right.</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you, with young guy a like Brady Quinn, is that really the bottom line, is it maybe not more important that he doesn't make the same mistake twice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Beyond Notre  Dame not winning Saturday, how would you evaluate the things that you see in Brady Quinn at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  The defense was so dominant last year until the USC game, and then this USC game it seemed like the same problem came back, and I realize that they are a very talented team, but what's happened to the defense?  What do you think is keeping this defense from maybe being as dominant as it was early last season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're 2-4 now, what's the focus for the second of the season, do you talk to the guys about bowls, do you just say Boston College is all we're looking at, do you try to give them a big picture?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you  -- you're a very bottom-line oriented guy, how would you rate your performance as a coach this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  And just in terms of your vision and goals for this program, I know it's to win, talk about, you were 10-3 last year, 2-4 this year, talk about the progress and what your vision is and how you feel about where the team is right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think Coach Baird after the game on Saturday was questioning whether he had properly prepared the defense and motivated them.  Do you look at every little things that would motivate them, like what you could have done differently, that sort of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned about losing to BC, the Bowl chances are in jeopardy, would you want to go to a Bowl game at 6-6?</p>
<p>	Q.  Right.</p>
<p>	Q.  At 6-6, you don't have any opinion whether Notre  Dame should go to a Bowl game or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I'm right, I was looking at past records, I believe Notre  Dame's only loss by 30 points, ten times in its history.  What does it say about the status of the program that three of those games have been in the past eight games?</p>
<p>	Q.  The size of the loss doesn't bother you at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  And one other stat, id doesn't seem like it, but in the past 20 years, Michigan has been catching up to Notre  Dame as far as being the winningest program.  If my math is right, and I believe I've checked three times, if Michigan wins two or games the rest of the way out and Notre  Dame loses two more, they are going to pass Notre  Dame as the winningest program.  What would that mean to the program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it would hurt Notre  Dame's  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Would it bother you that that occurs on your watch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Carlyle's progress as a receiver, what you see that he's grasping pretty well, what he's still having trouble picking up as a receiver?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will we continue to see him more as a receiver?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you consider him right now as, receiver or quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think that in the past, the talent of Notre  Dame has been a popular conversation topic among fans.  As you watched USC play on Saturday, did you see a much more talented team than what you had or how do you assess the talent difference between the two squads?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you look at your passing offense, especially from a pass deficiency perception, over the last few weeks mit's kind of varied near the bottom of the NCAA statistically.  What are some of the biggest challenges that you're facing right now in the passing game in getting that going and getting that started that has prevented it from being as successful as you would like it to be?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk a little about Cedric Hilliard has struggled a little bit this season, the ankle has been something that's reoccurred, as you've watched him and tried to keep him encouraged, what is your perception about how he's battled through this; and obviously it's a very difficult, nagging type of injury?</p>
<p>	Q.  With all respect to Greg Pauly, what do you lose when you don't have Cedric at 100%, can you quantify that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  So even if you take the right step, it can never just be truly just a loss that you move on from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Against Purdue, Notre  Dame had five sacks and against Pitt the defensive line had eight sacks.  USC seemed to be able to stifle them pretty well; they only gave up one sack.  What do you need to do against Boston College, what did USC do to make that so difficult?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even though the outcome of the game Saturday was not what anyone hoped, do you have to this week in preparation emphasize the first two drives on offense and show what's possible when everything  -- when everything is executed properly, because you were able to move the ball pretty well against a pretty good USC defense.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any  -- after looking at the film, is there any reason why those two drives were successful and why the offense struggled the rest of the way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wanted to ask a little bit about last year's game, in particular, just the decision to go with the green jerseys, do you think that kind of gave seed to this budding rivalry?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel as though you outfoxed yourself and that it had the unintended consequences of firing up the opposition?</p>
<p>	Q.  You kind of gave a hint to the crowd at the pep rally, to come out in the green, do you intend to do that this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk about the state of these two teams coming off two tough losses and what this game will mean?</p>
<p>	Q.  How big of a blow was the interception return by Josh when you look at it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Getting back to one last thing about the rivalry, coming off your true rival, do you think Boston College in your players' minds has become a rival?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you could tell me, one of the assets of your personality that others have commented on is your ability to maintain that even keel no matter whether you are winning big or losing, and to those on the outside it seems like that would be tougher to manage in a losing situation.  Can you just expound on how you're able to do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  And I wondered if you've seen that your players over these two years have moved more in that direction of being able to do that, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year after the Boston College  game, some of the BC players were seen lifting pieces of the Notre  Dame turf in the air in a triumphant manner, and there were also reports of some damage in the BC locker room after the game.  Has there been any discussion on any level of that or do you think that's at all in the mind of the players going into this game at Boston College?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Setta coming into the USC game he said that mostly was out; what is his status?</p>
<p>	Q.  And Glenn Earl, as well?</p>
