<p>	Q.  Do you find any benefit in the game ending in a manner that it did Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)</p>
<p>	Q.  Would it be fair to look ahead - obviously you don't want to do this   - but if there are 3 or 4 unbeaten teams and only two are playing for the National Title.  Would that be considered, in your mind, unjust to the teams that aren't able to play the National --</p>
<p>	Q.  As you get into November, what are your means of figuring out the BCS and who you need to watch, those sort of things as you  get into --</p>
<p>	Q.  I am looking for some help.</p>
<p>	Q.  If I could just follow-up briefly on what David asked about you think this is the best system we have right now.  Do you have any thoughts or see any merit in doing it the way that it was previously done which conferences, that won Championships, designated Bowls and then the Bowls just kind of filled out at-large as they went.  For instance the '65 season ended up with three undefeated teams and then think all lost Bowl games and Alabama was the National Champion.  Do you see any merit in reverting back to sort of a scramble where more games on January 1st influence the National Championship than just one?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if you could talk a little bit about Greg Madison; what you saw in him when you decided to retain him and what values you think he brings to your defensive staff?</p>
<p>	Q.  I had the fortune to talk with Coach Walsh a little bit.  He mentioned an intern program that you were a part of with the 49ers.  When you were an assistant coach at Rice, I guess that was your first contact with him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the value of that program and what you were able to get out of it and presence of Coach Walsh who is a guy you ended up following at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you followed him at Stanford did you try to incorporate some of the concepts from his offense; blend them with some of your own ideas?  Was there any borrowing from his system?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other thing, you know, when you were at Rice and some of your other stops, just looking at the records of some of those teams, it looked like will you had to deal with adversity, you had to deal with losing.  As a coach what can you glean from those situations?  I think it might have been 11 straight losing seasons maybe as --</p>
<p>	Q.  Sorry.  What can you glean from those kind of situations?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've had Stanford teams that were picked middle of the pack or lower in the pack than preseason and then ended up being pretty good teams.  Is there ever a point in the season, and maybe with this Notre Dame team, where you need to address when suddenly your team breaks through and now they are the favorites.  Do you need to address so they are not exhaling; so they are not satisfied with that; do you think this group is beyond something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Take us through your routine of post-game video highlights.  Let's say it's a home game, do you record the games at home or have someone do it for you and try and watch it as soon as you get home?  Do you wait until the next day or do you use the tape or film that the university provides? Do you watch it alone, with the team, coaches; how does that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the office?</p>
<p>	Q.  And then do you get to the coaches later?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you watch the TV feed --</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't watch TV with the replay and the slow motion?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch the -- is it film or tape?</p>
<p>	Q.  So you can slow it down and?</p>
<p>	Q.  Watch it with some of the players, perhaps freeze frame it, slow motion, to constructively critique any of the plays?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about the run defense Saturday, particularly after Cedric left the game what adjustments needed to be made and how you were able to successfully slow Greg Jones as the game wore on despite being down a man on the front four?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about the value of having a guy like Kyle Budinscak who can play inside and outside, have you found that to be a rarity in your coaching career?</p>
<p>	Q.  Cedric's status?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Boston College in general?  They have a running back that's on pace for a thousand yards again and an experienced quarterback coming in; is that even with three loss, seems like they can present some challenge?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know how much you have seen of them over the last few years but there -- I think it is their fifth straight year where they are on pace to have a thousand-yard back.  Anything in particular that you see in their style that creates those kind of opportunities for -- like you were saying different backs, you almost expect them to fall off a little bit but for the last five years they haven't?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the development of Ryan Grant over the last couple of weeks, big game against Air Force; then some kind of tough yards against Florida State ends up with, I think, 94, 95 yards?</p>
<p>	Q.  I have a couple of questions for you.  First of all, after the Florida State game there were a lot of commentators talking about how well prepared the team is and how they think that Notre Dame is the best coached team in the country.  Is that a tribute to your assistant coaches and the job they do getting the team prepared?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most of your -- a lot of your assistants came over with you from Stanford, but two on the defensive side Bob Simmons and Trent Walters, came from other roles.  Can you just talk about what their experience with Walters in the NFL and Simmons with being head coach at Oklahoma State, what that's meant to your defensive staff having those two guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Finally, Carlyle has had two impressive games back-to-back now.  To you, what has been the most important thing that he has improved on in the last few weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were your impressions of McPherson at quarterback for Florida State the last few minutes and was that against your No. 1 defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Arnaz Battle got up a little bit sore from his second catch the other day and didn't seem to be that involved for the rest of the game.  How is his health and do you expect him to be at full strength on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you when a coach comes into a new job such as Notre Dame, a lot of coaches try and mold the program, but to what degree do you think the program at Notre Dame, the University at Notre Dame molds its coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel it has molded you in this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  After starting out 8 and 0 what have you come to learn about Notre Dame that you never envisioned or never completely understood?</p>
<p>	Q.  Florida State I understand that at the end of the game I read somewhere that someone had scrawled Boston College on the board there. Was that the handy work of one of your GA's John DeFilippo?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about John and his association with BC through his father?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking about Boston College and teams that they played.  They are very banged up, they have lost the three games, they have lost some key plays.  Is the wounded animal thing something that you have to worry about when you play a team like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's kind of what I meant, the fact that they would be able to muster more than they might have for a different opponent because it is Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that there's work to be done and you have got things on your mind and one game at a time and all that, but have you, at any point, in all this, stopped and said, my goodness, we are 8 and 0?  You are always optimistic going in, but this is an incredible way to start.</p>
<p>	Q.  Begging your pardon, I'd like to ask another BCS question.  I know that good coaches concentrate just on winning football games on Saturday and try not to think too much about the polls.  But you have probably noticed that Notre Dame is well ahead of Virginia Tech in the BCS, but you are behind them in the polls.  I wonder if you could share with us, please, any thoughts you may have had on that discrepancy?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of the players according to them on Saturday and some the defensive players, a lot of them talked about how much fun they had out there and how the fun can kind of be infectious when they get going.  Is fun underrated as an element in a team's success?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a mindset that you noticed sometimes during fall camp or is that something that develops with success?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering with your experience against Boston College last year, did you see any kind of elements of the west coast offense in BC's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up about Derrick Knight.  You go from defensing a guy like Greg Jones to Derrick Knight, what concerns, I mean, do you have in his escapability and ability to score through tackles or  --</p>
