<p>	Q.  In U.S.A. Today there's an article about the BCA is warning colleges, that it's going to steer prospects away from institutions that do not improve their minority hiring practices.  I guess just your reaction to this.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a time when you sensed that your team began to believe everything that you were saying; is there a game or a time when you began sensing that they were believing what you were saying?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the best streak you have ever had as a coach, I believe.  I don't think you have ever won 7 straight at all.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it surprising though when you are in a streak like this do you notice it?  Do things come together naturally and you don't notice it until after it's over or do you feel it coming together as it begins.</p>
<p>	Q.  Third best or only two other Notre Dame coaches had a start this well.  Did you get advice from Parsegian?  Did he tell you what to expect?  I know not the game plan but did he warn you on what to expect, things to be careful of?</p>
<p>	Q.  The one thing he said is that when you are in this it's a lot of fun this first year, but the thing is you worry now that the one  -- you set the bar so high right away that now, you know, this is what people are going to expect every time.  Is that a concern of yours or  --</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you didn't know much about the history.  I am wondering if you have read up on the history yet of Florida State/Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about going into a game like that where there's so much tradition the so-called game of the century eight years ago, what does all that mean going into this?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think about Florida State, this Florida State team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Based on the last four games, they haven't been decided 'til the final minute.  When your team has been involved in as many close games as it has and sort of has shown the ability to close it at the end, does that -- is there some value in that when you are going into it as hostile an environment as Florida State is?  They have only lost 4 of their last 90 down there that you sort of can pull it out at the end?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's easy from our standpoint to say that it is a good time to be playing Florida State if there ever was one.  Is there ever a good time playing Florida State?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) I would assume that Florida State's athletic level of their secondary is probably going to be as good as you have seen.  How much of a concern is you becoming a little bit one-dimensional in the passing game with Arnaz, and how why is that happening do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the biggest difference between your offensive line from the week before against Pittsburgh when it really wasn't that effective and then against Air Force, was it a product of the different levels, Pittsburgh defense is that much better than Air Force or your level of play was that much better?</p>
<p>	Q.   There doesn't seem to be as many deep balls that have been thrown the last few weeks.  Is that because teams are taking that away?  Is Carlyle reluctant to look deep to take that chance or would you like to see him do that a little bit more?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any reaction to your former quarterbacks named NFL starter this week starting Sunday(inaudible)?    Are you surprised?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything about the magnitude or scope of this program you are coaching that has surprised you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anyway to summarize what makes this program unique in college football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Florida State in a very small number of other schools have all sort of dominated maybe the top 4,5 spots in college football over the last decade.  Is there something in the nature of this sport that makes it harder to crack what you maybe call a super elite than in college basketball where it seems like making the Final Four, there's a wide opportunity and a number of schools really that have been in the top 4,5 in college football is very small.  Teams may rise up and be 10th, 15th, but not 5 it's just  -- very small numbers schools which are trying to reenter.</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything else you can think of that -- what about just the nature of, I guess, maybe you can turn a basketball program around with a couple of guys and that's really not  possible in football?</p>
<p>	Q.  This press conference is a perfect example of how as the head coach of Notre Dame you have a higher profile than you did at Stanford.  I was wondering if you could talk about that adjustment.  Has it been easier than you thought it would be now that you are over halfway through this first year or has it been tougher, people thought that might be the thing that you had the hardest time with is just putting yourself in the spotlight?</p>
<p>	Q.  A couple of weeks ago you said you don't believe in kicking slumps.  Nick Setta has missed 6 out of 7.  What would you describe that as this stretch?</p>
<p>	Q.  Both of his misses Saturday were from the extreme -- from the hash mark; one was from the right and one was from the left.  I know you are trying to get the first down on those third-down plays but is that something you have to be concerned with getting the ball in the center of the field, get him a better opportunity?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned before that Florida State is two points way from possibly being the No. 1 team in the country.  What aspect of their team, be it offense or defense, that has your focus in your preparation right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  You just throw out the Louisville game because of the weather conditions that night?</p>
<p>	Q.  It has been suggested by some athletes who choose to celebrate their successes on the football field that the criticism from the media, it is a cultural misunderstanding on the media's part.  Do you concur with that assessment?</p>
<p>	Q.  I thought it was a pretty good question.</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious to know what your evaluation or assessment of Carlyle's 360 spin and throw was the other night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about the challenges of somebody like Greg Jones bringing to the table being 248 outweighing your entire line backing core and even-- what are some of the unique things that a big back brings to the table?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Dan Stevenson and Jim Molinaro, their development, and how much comfort that provided you to have a bit of a rotation there?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the case of Molinaro, he worked his way in not really relating to injury.  What has he done in make a charge to really earn that time?</p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to motivation how much do you use quotes from other players? (Inaudible)  curious how much you use that to fire up your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the status of Rashon Powers, will he be available this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, the class schedule this week obviously is a little bit different.  Does that create more problems because you are not in the same routine or does it allow more focus, less hype because there are less kids are on campus?  Do you have any thoughts one way or the other on the difference in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  In my earlier question, listening you talk about your role on the football team it's like listening to Dusty Baker about what his role is with the Giants.  Wondering if your paths crossed Dusty's much when you were in the Bay Area and is he somebody that you could learn things from while you were up there or if there are leaders outside of the realm of football that you have called and taken things from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Congratulations.  I should say continuing congratulations on the season.</p>
<p>	Q.  You have spoken quite often about the need for confidence and many observers, in fact, point to the greater confidence of this team as perhaps the prime factor in their success.  The swagger of the secondary, for example, and you have also been adamant about the need for good sportsmanship and respecting your opponent.  Could you give us a little bit of your philosophy as to where the line is between swagger and confident job-owning on the one hand and unnecessary let's say, personal confrontation or lack of sportsmanship on the other.  For example, perhaps we might all agree that a few choice remarks between players at the end of a play are a natural part of the game.  But seeking a confrontation after the whistle and away from the play or perhaps not even near the context, is not.  If it's anyway helpful as a point of reference and perhaps it's not, but I believe that many Notre Dame players and fans remember to this day the fact that during Coach Holtz's time, Miami players decided to run through Notre Dame's pre-game warmup.  I don't know if you are aware of that.   But aside from that one issue, could you just give us some of your philosophy in that regard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, it does occur.  Do you feel that it has occurred in a proper context or have you been an observer of that at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  I want to ask you a couple of things about -- there's some quotes from you from articles that's have appeared in some of the papers in this area.  One was a couple of weeks ago.  I don't have it in front of me so I am paraphrasing. it had to do with expectations that you have created and the ability of different guys to step up and make plays and that there's not one guy you look to; it is a different guy every week to step up and make a big play in a game.  Is that something you have focused on from the first day that you have met with the guys setting some expectations and roles sort of where the guys know that everybody is capable of doing something every week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Another one from I think this was in the preseason when you first had gotten the job you were talking about winning and it says here:  I love winners, I love people that are champions.  How do you know - maybe when recruit, even the guys you have, how do you know that a kid could be one of those; maybe not right away but he has the potential to be one of those guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  Herman Edwards with the Jets says this every week, about winning with character play and even though the Jets were 1 and 4 'til Sunday he was convinced because of the character of his guys they would eventually turn it around.  How important is that to you all the character and the attitude that people talk about, especially in recruiting and bringing guys into the program?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have had a number of tough road games already against nationally ranked opponents.  I am wondering though with Florida State's tradition and this venue that you have talked about earlier, how big is this game for your team, for just how everyone sees it, how you all see each other too?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can this be a signature-type win for whoever comes out on top?</p>
<p>	Q.  Well if you were writing the story could it be a signature type win?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of feedback have you or your coaching staff receives from potential recruits, whether it be in terms of your success this season, direction of the program, the system that you have incorporated, things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  And they have responded to you well and what you brought to the program as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  In talking to Tony Dungy this morning and he says always you and him always felt like kindred spirits; he says maybe it was our parents, the way we were raised, the emphasis on education; how we approach things.  He said something today that when he first got a job as an NFL head coach that he was always uncomfortable with how he did being linked to minority hires and whatnot; that it's part of the problem, people judging the many by how the one does.  And he said, all that said, the reality is that your success will be important, breaking down barriers.  Do you agree with that and how do you feel about your success being linked to everyone else; is that a form of prejudice in and of itself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Comment a little bit about one of your backup guys, Zach Giles; how has he progressed so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  What does he do best at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell me if your paths crossed at any time with Chris Rix who is from California and have you looked at him as a possibility going to Stanford when you were there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me follow-up on that then, what do you see in him that you like in a quarterback?</p>


<p>	Q.  After football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about what Florida State's program means to the people in Florida; what kind of procedure has, you know,  growing up when you were watching them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Until maybe last season did they have a certain (inaudible) of disability about them?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess if you could talk a little bit about Dan Stevenson next to you working in a rotation almost behind Sean Milligan and what he's brought to the table and I guess what improvement he's shown you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any particular signs you saw out of him last year that might have given you an indication that he could step up this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe you went to Seminole High School?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you want to play for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lost the thrill  during recruiting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you ever go to any games, Florida State games?</p>
<p>	Q.  What does it mean to go back now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly, talk a little bit about the development of the offensive line.</p>
<p>	Q.  After the Air Force game Carlyle said a lot of the guys on the offensive line were upset with the way things went against Pittsburgh and that you guys were really determined to bounce back then against Air Force.  Talk about that.</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you guys have a lot more important things on your mind than point spreads but you have been underdogs a lot this year.  And one of the lines I saw yesterday you were an 11-point underdog.   Does that shock you that you are double-digit underdogs?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any reaction to that?  It doesn't upset you or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Until recently they have been pretty much invincible at Bill Campbell stadium.  What is the atmosphere like there and how is it different from other places, if it is?</p>
<p>	Q.  During your time at Notre Dame, you have played in a lot of supposedly the toughest places to play at in college football, like Tennessee and other places like that.  Do you think that going in you know what to expect and it's not really going to be that much of a factor for you and some of your more experienced teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you noticed the different reaction on campus, around town, towards you and the program with the recent resurgence?</p>
<p>	Q.  The years that you have been here, anything about the magnitude or the scope of this program that -- does it still surprise you sometimes when you think about Notre Dame program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this program unique in college football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously you have got your back turned to Carlyle when you are on the field.  Seems like he's becoming more comfortable with all aspects of this offense, with the short passing game as well as the running game and stuff.  Can you sense that when you are on the field in the course of a game that he's becoming more comfortable?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes when teams have been winning big all year then they go into a tough contest people will say they don't necessarily know how to react to a close game.  You guys have been in a lot of close games.  Florida State/Notre Dame games have always been close in the past. This one will probably be as well.  Any advantage to the close games that you have already played in when you are going into an environment like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you are at Notre Dame - obviously every week is big - you are never going to go in and see half the stadium field and things like that.  As a player, do you sense something even bigger this week because this may be the biggest game Notre Dame ever played since maybe the 1993 season; if so, how do you kind of keep your emotions, keep the team in check so that things don't become distractions as you prepare for Florida State?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a minute ago - (inaudible) any one thing that caused it to lose its appeal or was it Notre Dame just was a better choice?  What happened there?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) What are you thinking out there and is there a thought of punishing the guy so the next time you go at him he's going to worry about what happened?</p>
<p>	Q.  You are the unbeaten team, higher ranked team.  What does that do for the mentality of the team?  Do you almost feed off that kind of underdog attitude?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you think accounts for that, the point spread?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's history with Florida State?  Were you recruited there?  Have you been to games down in Tallahassee?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having been in many close games as you have been this year knowing how to deal with the pressure at the end, any value in that going into a venue like Florida State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week the talk was about how you were going to deal with Air Force's option offense.  Coming out of that, is it difficult to transition out of that mode against -- and  sort of go back to dealing with a more traditional offense this week?  How do you make that adjustment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week was supposed to be the big test of this defense because the option is such an odd scheme and they talk about how it so difficult to defend and how they can sort of impose their will.  When you handle them as well as the defense was able to what does that do for the unit's confidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  After facing an option last week are you glad to see a more traditional offense this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Surprised at all with the overwhelming success you guys had as a defense last week?</p>
<p>	Q.  What does it mean to you to be nominated  for an award like the Dick Butkus Award?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) (Florida State Running back)?</p>
<p>	Q.  How he is similar to different to say maybe a Duckett (phonetic) or a William Green, some of the other good backs that you guys have gone against?</p>
<p>	Q.  How many ticket requests have your had from your family?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because of the great history here talk a little bit about what it is like to be at Notre Dame when you are not winning the big games or not ranked highly and just how it is different now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because of the history and tradition here, was there ever a feeling you were letting it down and was that hard to live with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your initial impression, what were the first great initial impressions from Coach and how did that translate into winning?</p>
<p>	Q.  You came into THE season obviously with high expectation; then you get the viral infection.  You missed the first two games.  What was that stretch like for you and was it -- how did you keep yourself sane during that period?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having played against Coach were there any concerns on the part of the players as far as your perception of who he was and what he would be like to play for?  You had a little bit of experience having played against him.</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't look over there and say look how stoic this guy is he, he may be hard to communicate with if I played for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does a military-type coach scare a football team?</p>
