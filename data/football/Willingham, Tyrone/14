<p>	Q.  On one hand, it's a bit of a must-win situation for a team that's not in a conference, because obviously you don't want to fall 0-2, but by the same token if you put all of your regulars in one basket with the players and don't come out on top, how do you balance that fine line of, hey, we have to win this; that things might start spiraling downward?</p>
<p>	Q.  At half-time when Alex Flanagan interviewed you, you said have to give the team, the offense something they can hang their hat on.  When you can't decipher an opponent's scheme or the players can't put that in play, and you talk about the confidence being so important for your team, now do you run the risk of maybe the players starting to question whether the staff can give them the answers that they need in order to be successful? </p>
<p>	Q.  Brigham Young used three punters with fullbacks; I haven't seen that, is that something and now you have to adjust?</p>
<p>	Q.  Try to get the best of both worlds, being able to cover.  Now you can't really even block a punt like that. </p>
<p>	Q.  The field position game was crucial the other night, and that certainly came into play last night.  What do you do now in order to reverse that trend, because if they kick off to you and you go three-and-out and your punter, though he nailed a couple the other night, he's generally a less than 40-yard punter; you're going to be giving away field position all the time.  How do you compensate? </p>
<p>	Q.  The field position, was it a case of, Rhema caught the punt on the one-yard line, is that a case of a kid trying to make a big play and not thinking about where he is on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  And talking to players, the offense getting close, what signs are there?  To me the offense looks similar to last year; some games you have a good running game and some you pass a little better, but didn't seem to be close to having the full package together yesterday. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was it a matter of positioning?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you talk to Brady? </p>
<p>	Q.  And can you talk a little about the problem finding the middle linebacker, somebody who has no scheme -- what makes that hard? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Michigan's receivers and the problems they are going to pose to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Brady said yesterday that maybe he has to, in order to spark the offense a little bit, force a couple of passes.  Do you agree with that in principle? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the move of Zbikowsk to strong safety, what the thought process was and how quickly has he adapted to that? </p>
<p>	Q.  How would you evaluate your secondary at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about your offensive line play, how would you evaluate that?</p>
<p>	Q.  One thing people asked me was on third down and seven, why do you throw a 5-yard pass? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know that your philosophy was that the best players play, regardless of year, freshman, senior, whatever.  What is the biggest challenge to getting young players ready to play, getting freshmen ready to play when they are the best player? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do high school programs and coaching and scheme figure into that mix, too?</p>
<p>	Q.  And the last question I have is the rule about the penalties and calling out the numbers, holding on number whatever, do you like that as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you talk about your offensive line, a lot has been made of fact that you brought back four or five starters, but a lot of those guys, three of the four guys are playing new positions.  How much of a difference does that make in terms of how much time it takes them to catch up to what they need to do in their different responsibilities?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you looked at your running game on Saturday, what did you see as the major problems? </p>
<p>	Q.  Marcus Freeman is a guy that didn't see a lot of time on special teams last year.  What did you see in from him in the off-season to elevate him all the way up into the starting lineup?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was that what kept him out of the rotation last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to Ryan Harris coming out of that program, in terms of the advantages that afforded him to get on the field last year, is it a similar case with Marcus or different? </p>
<p>	Q.  The depth chart that we saw last week at this time, Marcus wasn't even on it.  Was that just the nature of, we're not going to give away who we are going to play a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  That answers my question fair enough.  Another thing, in regards to Brady forcing a ball and somebody asked a question about third and seven, running a 5-yard pass, how do you coach that with your quarterback in terms of balancing when you need to throw the ball and trying to squeeze in a tight spot, as opposed to just taking what the defense is giving you all the time?</p>
<p>	Q.  The challenges of getting a younger player on the field, so get specific in regards to Darius, what does he need to show you or the coaching staff to prove, to get you comfortable to put him in a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  At this week last time, you said that the position was your freshman were not going to play last weekend, and that held to be true.  Is the case today the same as it was seven days ago? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to Brady a little bit, he said that one of the best things that he's come along with is an understanding the hot routes, he called them key routes in your vocabulary, how important is that for a tight end, and how do you coach those guys up, coach them into understanding where the holes are? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to Goolsby, obviously the secondary has a lot of room to grow, but as a veteran who is in the front seven, asking him how he avoids putting more pressure on himself to make up for that, what do you tell the guys in the front seven to avoid them maybe trying to do too much, as kind of a cliche there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Confidence was a big theme in the preseason, to what extent do you feel like that's still lacking with the team, either going into Saturday's game or since having an unsuccessful start? </p>
<p>	Q.  A fresh start to a new season gives an opportunity to wipe all of that clean.  When it goes in a similar fashion and then the next week a No. 5 or No. 7 team is coming in, how can you do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan Grant is a guy that talks that way, he always seems to have a lot of confidence in himself and the team, how much difference do you have like he could have played Saturday night and did you give any thought to putting him in after the game was going on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the idea of young players getting ready to play, for Michigan, Henne stepped in and was able to play well this weekend; what did you see from him that enabled the offense to play so well in the first game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering if we could get a copy of your depth chart. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is Grant's status this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had mentioned earlier today that sometimes it's schemes, sometimes it's individual breakdowns that you see on film.  Usually it's a combination of both that leads to the offense not being able to produce, and I do sense the frustration that you have with the offense not being able to move the ball and score as many points as you would like it to do.  Why do you then remain confident that this offense can still work? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect to make any changes in special teams this week, particularly in the punt return game? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like at times your offensive line, the same group has struggled against the blitz.  Is there a point where you just say, you know what, we're going to have to stop everything and just work on this and see if we can figure out how to solve this one specific problem?</p>
<p>	Q.  So is it frustrating to watch the film and see that the results? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on the play of Kyle Budinscak, and more specifically, the job he's done recovering from the knee injury? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier, after the game that the three deep catches by BYU changed the game, changed the result of it.  What do you specifically have to do this week to ensure that it doesn't happen again? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking ahead at this week, and you look at what happened last week, how do you convince your team that better things are ahead for them when they lose to a BYU team that's not nearly as good as Michigan and you've got Michigan coming up this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some people recognize the flaws, too?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on the return of Mike Goolsby from his injury, his leadership on and off the field as well as his play Saturday night? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on his play Saturday night, do you think he was overhyped coming back, first game of the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you could take a moment and talk about the difficulty that there has been in putting drives together for the offense.  At times you can get a couple first downs and then it just seems as though there is a breakdown somewhere along the way, and obviously field position played such a huge factor in the game last Saturday night.  Talk about how important it is for this offense to be able to generate some consistent drives to help in that field position. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that put more of an onus on your defense and special teams to make turnovers, make plays in order to get the offense out of that? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like especially in recent history, this game with Michigan kind of, it can either really lift a team to a good season or start a downward spiral.  What is it about this game that can really hype a team up and get them ready to go for the rest of the season? </p>
<p>	Q.  In 2002, did you feel that? You beat Michigan 3-0; did you see it in the team that, hey, this may be lifting them to a level they did not even see coming? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering about Carlyle Holiday, he wasn't on the field much and I don't think anything was thrown his way.  For the offense to be successful, is he going to have to play a bigger role?</p>
<p>	Q.  Particularly when BYU was so aggressive coming after you, would it have been nice to have someone like him where you put the ball in his hands and he can make something happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  On that note, looking at the film, do you think from a play-calling standpoint you did all you could to maybe slow the BYU rush and get them maybe on their heels a little bit with a look or misdirection or something?</p>
<p>	Q.  The running game, looking at the film, was it more of a case of holes not being there or just not getting through the holes that were there? </p>
<p>	Q.  I talk to several of the players yesterday asking them about their first impressions of Brandon Hoyte, if they remembered the first time they met him and to a man, each and every one said he was unforgettable and no way could you miss him the first time you met him.  Would you talk about the first time you met Brandon and your impressions of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Also wondering, you talked about Michigan's wide receivers, but their secondary is also fantastic; you've coached a long time, how would you gauge the synergy of going against these great receivers; it seems it would make both sides of the ball better. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just wondering about Shazor and Jackson, the secondary, they are obviously very good.  How much would you attribute to the fact that they go against these fantastic receivers against practice; they are trying to stop Edwards every day. </p>
<p>	Q.  And final question, Edwards was talking about, it's obviously no surprise but Notre Dame's players are looking forward to this game, especially after what happened last year, but he talks with just as much passion about what happened two years ago.  He said after walking into that locker room after the loss and seeing grown men cry, he said the things about rivalry games is you'll win a couple, but you'll always remember the ones you lost.  Having been a part of rivalries with Michigan as a player and a coach, is that a fair statement?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked last week about how important confidence was, what feel do you get for your team's confidence coming off this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a couple of minutes ago about the win two years ago against Michigan.  It seemed like a lot of people want wanted to take that win and say "Notre Dame is back."  At the time did you think it was going to be harder than that or did you not foresee what was coming? </p>
<p>	Q.  Not sure. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Carr said yesterday he expects the Big Ten to go to 12 teams and he thinks Notre Dame should be that 12th team; what are your feelings? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that thank-you mean you'd like to be a member of the Big Ten? </p>
<p>	Q.  Thank you, Coach. </p>
