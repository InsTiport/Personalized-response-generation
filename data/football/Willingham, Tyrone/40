<p>	Q.  Talk about the challenge preparing for the Air Force option.</p>
<p>	Q.  The secondary talked over the weekend about how they kind of have nicknames for each other.  They seemed to have established separate identities.  Talk about their personalities and the style that they bring in blending together to play together?</p>
<p>	Q.  Vontez said not playing defense until he got to college, he still feels like he's really kind of learning.  He feels very new in the position.  What kind of things do you see that even for as well as he's played that kind of show that sort of inexperience in the position?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mid-point in the season can you evaluate how well Carlyle has adapted to this offense and maybe some areas that you are still looking for improvement for his performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk little bit about Courtney Watson how he acts as a leader to this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't have any choice in the matter but can you address what the late start Saturday night does?  It's going to be after 9 o'clock South Bend time before the game starts; what effect will that have and what can you do to counterbalance that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Arnaz Battle is a fifth-year receiver but this is his only second year playing wide receiver.  What were your impressions of him coming in and how has he -- what improvement has he made throughout the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Besides him progressing and naturally it would seem that the catch he had to win the Michigan State game and the performance he had last week against Pittsburgh would just boost his confidence and help that progress along?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin Tuck gave up quite a bit of size last Saturday to Pittsburgh.  Talk about his performance considering what he's up against there.</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Air Force's offense and what kind of challenges it may present.  Talk a little bit about their defense.  They have some pretty solid numbers too.</p>
<p>	Q.  How much experience as a coach have you had going against this style of offense or an option-style offense?  You probably didn't encounter that a whole lot at Stanford.</p>
<p>	Q.  When was the last time that you did encounter it as a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you lean more heavily then on assistant coaches such as like a Greg Madison who has faced it every year for the last five, six years or Bob Simmons who came from the Big-12 where he was exposed to it a little bit more against a Nebraska?</p>
<p>	Q.  You took over at the end of the game with a little bit more than a minute to go.  I saw on the sideline with the coaches trying to figure out how many timeouts I have left and the timing of everything.  Is there a chart that you follow or does somebody do the math on the sideline?  What is the procedure done in trying to figure out how you are going to use up that time on the clock?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does somebody literally do the math on the sideline?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a chart that you follow?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously and you have said it many times the most important stat or the only number that really matters are the numbers on the scoreboard.  But when you look at statistics and look at a stat sheet are there one or two statistics that you feel are a little bit more important than others, turnovers, what whatever?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) are you surprised that the fight the offenses troubles that you are 6 and 0.  I know you keep saying that's the most important thing, but did you envision the offense having as much trouble as it has had?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of it is -- you said I think at the first media day that it would take a long time for the offense to learn the west coast offense.  Is there a problem learning it or is it a problem running it?  Is it that they don't know enough yet or they are not running it properly?</p>
<p>	Q.  Generally when people think of service academies they think of (inaudible) Air Force has consistently had good teams and especially Notre Dame-trouble in the past.  Why do you think it is that this one out of the three is able to put together such a strong program?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the difficulty in preparing the defense against a triple threat option attack.  Do you make any specific changes?  Do you try to get more speed in the lineup?   Is it more assignment type of football, more specific than how you go about defending that type of an offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) (Glenn) as a hitter, I am curious that you feel like that's more of a mentality that goes into coming up and popping people and how does he kind of achieve that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you felt like he's maybe a little more quiet than some of the other guys in the secondary.  Does he kind of just fit well as the guy that follows the rest of the more boisterous guys back there?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Air Force's defense sometimes is overlooked.  They have been quite stout against the run this year; yet on the defensive line in some positions they are a little undersized.</p>
<p>	Q.  I am sure that you are not a betting man but Air Force is actually favored this week.   Can that be a source of motivation for your team this week in practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  You paid some compliments to Air Force and their coach.  I don't know if you happened to catch it last night but Fisher was interviewed on one of the talk shows and he said that not only does he admire you greatly, but you, in fact, are one of his idols.  Could you comment on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's seems like both Notre Dame and Air Force were kinds of unknown qualities coming into the season.  How did you get your team to be where they are right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any thoughts as far as the altitude?  Falcon Stadium is about 6200 feet.  I know a lot of coaches feel that it is not a factor.  Others feel that it might be.  Your thoughts on that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Of course Air Force is -- they practice and live at that level.  Is that an advantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you felt like you had to substitute more early than you might do customarily due to altitude?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could give me your idea on this, why do you think more teams operate in that -- the wish bone offense and why do you think Air Force has been so successful in what they have been able to carve out of the years with Fisher running that offence?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you given any thoughts to ever have anything like that in an offense that you run anyplace in your college career or in your coaching career?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like a lot of times when a coach his first year at a program he will talk about how he needs to restock talent.  When you came in and took measure of this program, when do you look around and say we really have a lot of players because you have got a lot of veteran talent who has given a lot of leadership?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of the seniors have talked about sort of their hunger to win and hunger to have success this season.  Can you sense that sort of absolute desire to get back on the football field and turn things around a little bit from their record last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same things talk a little bit about just your ability to rotate players and you-- seems you have used almost everybody on the bench this year and you haven't been shy about playing everybody.  Just maybe the mentality behind that?</p>
<p>	Q.  That goes with obviously playing freshmen and sophomores and people who have never seen the field before, obviously you have a gotten fairly positive reaction from them?</p>
<p>	Q.   Can you just talk about field position. A lot of people don't focus on this and don't even notice it unless there's a mistake or something, but just the advantage of having a punter like Joey for field position and what it means?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people early on postseason looked at the schedule and thought the first three or four games would be the toughest.  Now mid-season it looks like these next games might be the toughest back-to-back.  Can you talk about -- I know you say take it one week at a time.  Are you looking at them -- obviously they are going to play a big part in what happens the rest of the year?</p>
