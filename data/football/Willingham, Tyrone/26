<p>	Q.  After starting your career here at Notre  Dame coaching, 8-0, the last games have been a struggle.  Has the opposition made huge adjustments?  Was 8-0 an inaccurate indication of where you were in the development of the program, has the opposition been that much better or how would you assess that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week I asked you about the relationship that you have with Bill Diedrick and why it works so well, that you share the same philosophies?</p>
<p>	Q.  The quarterback has to make plays you can't put him in a perfect play all the time.  Does it hurt, is that philosophy hurting you a little bit as Carlyle struggles to get a grasp of the big picture?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you consider altering or have you considered altering the West Coast offense in order to accentuate Carlyle's assets more a little bit, running skills?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game you were asked about the quarterback, who was going to be the quarterback, you said whoever the best player is.  I'm going to ask whether -- if Carlyle was losing -- you said potentially but not yet.  How close is Brady to overtaking Carlyle at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  How close is Brady as good to being as good  --</p>
<p>	Q.  If you struggle early against Michigan State are you more likely to bring in Brady faster than you have in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  And along with that, last year the defense obviously made a lot of key plays, they are making some this year, but when you look at the stats, Notre  Dame is in the bottom half of almost every category.  Is there something that you see, a fix there that you see or is it just working harder or what is it ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach said that Jeff Smoker cannot start if he's still injured, they are going to bring in a red-shirt freshman in, Drew Stanton, who has not played at all this season over than some special teams plays.  How do you prepare for a quarterback you have never seen?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game on Saturday, several of the players said they saw some mixture of anger and -- how do you catalyze that into something positive that they can use sort of an energy that they can use to get better this week.</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe the year that you guys went to the Rose Bowl at Stanford, you started out with a 69-17 loss that year.  What do you remember  -- do you remember how the team reacted to that and how you were able to turn that year around?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Freddie Parish and what he did to put himself in a position for playing time and contributions this early in the season.</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier, and I hope I'm quoting you right here, that Carlyle was making progress, but it might be progress that's not visible to the rest of us.  Can you share what progress that you've seen?</p>
<p>	Q.  And have you ever been in a position where you've had a quarterback situation where you've had really two different systems for your quarterbacks?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have to bring in a couple this year, just to get the numbers up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sticking with recruiting theme, when you're talking to players and you're thinking position switch for this kid, how do you approach a kid who maybe has his mind set on staying at a certain position and you're thinking of him at a different position?</p>
<p>	Q.  High school player.</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that change when he gets here?</p>
<p>	Q.  To look at it from a different perspective, you played two games, that means you've played four halves, you're down 3-1 in terms of halves that's been played.  Is Notre  Dame football in trouble?  Can Notre  Dame win a first half and can you put over 38 points on the board?</p>
<p>	Q.  Thank you.</p>
<p>	Q.  The way you organize your practices, does the first string quarterback get almost all the reps with the first team and the second string quarterback just a few?  And since Brady is so new, does he get remedial help so he gets to do a little more than he sometimes would or did you not deviate that at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does it depend probably more on the first string quarterback, what he needs, his needs are sort of addressed first and the second string quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look back at the Michigan game and you are talking to the team through walk-throughs, practices, is that experience that you want to bring up as a motivator, or do you just kind of let it go and not forget it, but don't harp on it or bring it up again?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, this week as you prepare for Michigan State, do you talk about Michigan?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you look at the tape, specifically at the defensive line, Michigan obviously had a very talented offensive line, at the same time, were you surprised at Michigan's ability to really win at the line of scrimmage and hold the point of attack against a very veteran defensive front that you have?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to Coach Diedrick when the subject of playing a freshman came up, he said they have to be physically ready, mentally ready, but on more than one occasion he said that maybe the most important being psychologically and emotionally ready.  What did you see maybe out of Brady, whether it be full camp, as you talked to him over the summer on occasion, that led to you believe that maybe he would be psychologically, emotionally ready to do some things this year, if need be?</p>
<p>	Q.  I ask this question not in a negative way to Chris Holson (ph) at all but last year when the subject of a No. 2 quarterback came up, is Pat was very much more in the race, obviously was healthy at the time as well.  But as yourself and Coach Diedrick talked about Brady and freshman playing this year, there seemed to be much more of a thought that Brady was maybe a little farther along or he had grasped the offense a little quicker.  I don't know if that's something natural, he was more suited to do this than year was last year, but what are some things that maybe have accelerated Brady's progress to the point where he's maybe a little bit farther area head than, say, what Chris was last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just a different personality, different perspective, all that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had classified Mike Boosby as day-to-day week-to-week, month to month --</p>
<p>	Q.  That's what I was getting to.  I wondered if at what point does he become year-to-year in the season, is there a point of no return where you say, we're not going to blow your eligibility to let him play two or three games?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does this year shape up?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is a big game for both teams, coming off two pretty big losses, Michigan State and Notre  Dame.  What would it do to either team's psyche to lose this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's that going to be like to host  your alma mater?  Last year you came up here with Notre  Dame and coming down there, are you excited, nervous?</p>
<p>	Q.  I heard about you maybe wear an MSU t-shirt on game day but not against MSU, is there any other memorabilia that you keep around that you wear on the practice field or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was it like for you as a player from Michigan State coming to play the Irish, do you have any memories of that series?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was it like coming out of that tunnel for the first time?</p>
<p>	Q.  For you as a player, coming out of that tunnel, first time.</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned earlier how when the offense struggles, it's not just the responsibility of just the quarterback.  How much of some of the problems may be just natural growing pains that come with having to replace some veterans on the offensive line?</p>
<p>	Q.  Like you said Saturday, there was not much that went right, but I'm just wondering what your opinion is of utilizing the wide receiver, are you looking to get them more involved in the offense, do they have to be more involved in the offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of the running game, I don't know if it's by design or by happenstance that Carlyle has not seemed to run the ball that much this year, has that been by design or just the way things have gone?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'd like to ask you about the execution you referred to and intensity during the game, as you pointed out numerous times it's difficult to know with certainty what's going on in someone's mind, certainly that includes players, but through our indications in the meter and actions such as obviously the hard-hitting versus arm-tackling, I'd like to ask you a two-part question.  One, would you agree that the level of intensity, the mental game, if you will, last Saturday was won by Michigan, and if so, how do you motivate the players?  You've already talked about  -- how do you help the players take the intensity from the practice field and put that into the game situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I may follow-up, how much is that consistency on the field, how much of it comes from emotion, from intensity, if you will?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not a percentage, but is it a major factor?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is emotion intensity a major factor in producing consistency on the field during a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to talk to you about Michigan State and their running defense.  They are ranked very high but they have not faced many teams that like to run yet.   This is an opportunity for you guys to come in and establish the ground game.  I wanted to get your thoughts on that offensive idea.</p>
<p>	Q.  And one other thing as far as Ryan Grant and Julius Jones, is there a difference between the two guys that would lend better to what you are going to see Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan State's quarterback situation has been a little bit of a flux this week.  Just curious how you go about preparing for the possibility of seeing two different quarterbacks, and does it matter a whole lot to Michigan State's offense if Jeff is at the helm?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you have a balance on offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  To that end, looking back at Saturday's game, it seems like there were a lot of instances where you end up 2nd and 7, 2nd and 8.  How much does that limit your play-book or change what you can call there to get out of a 2nd and long situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you practice indoors, preparation for the Michigan game, was that helpful, was their surface any different from the indoor practice you are used to, and did it have anything to do with the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Different from what you're accustomed to?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was the reaction of the players?  Was it prepared for the record crowd and the noise?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you communicate when it's that loud?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking ahead to the pep rally, any celebrities coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are they helpful to the team, to motivate the team when you get name players, Regis or whoever?</p>
<p>	Q.  You say that you would like to establish a run and you think that that's your strength.  It appears that every defense you face is putting eight, nine at the line of scrimmage.  Is it a situation where you night have to throw just to be able to run?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that Carlyle's decision, you come in with a play and you see eight, nine guys up there?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people have had a lot of criticism towards Carlyle Holiday.  Do you think that's fair?</p>
