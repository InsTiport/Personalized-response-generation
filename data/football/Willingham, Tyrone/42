<p>	Q.  I wonder if you could describe the emotions mixed in going into this week playing against a lot of players who you recruited and if this is anymore difficult for you going into Michigan State was?</p>
<p>	Q.  Latest on Carlyle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will he practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kevin White in saying no to a 13-game that we've talked about last week, he used the term we don't want --  Notre Dame does not want to exploit its players.  I wondered if you felt the same way and if that was -- if you felt like adding one game would, quote unquote, exploit Notre Dame or any player?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things Stanford/Notre Dame are very similar in the whole identity of the universities; one thing that's different is the amount of attention paid to each football program.  For instance out there right now it's in the Bay Area baseball time, Playoffs, there's the NFL season.  How much of that, wanting to be part of somewhere where the biggest show in town played into your decision or in your thought process, in leaving Stanford for Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you prepare for a team obviously you look at them offensively, defensively the things they do, but in this situation playing Stanford do you, in preparation, account for the motivation that the Stanford players may have in playing against the school where their coach left them for?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a coach do you do anything to counter that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked last week about your philosophy of ones versus ones in practice.  Is that your philosophy or did you pick that up or was there a head coach that you played for that introduced that philosophy to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your last game you scored on an opening drive, you get the ball for the second time on first down, Carlyle makes -- I think throws short; on the next two downs each of your tackles jump offsides.  You lose the momentum or at least you did at that point.  Why are your offensive linemen jumping offsides?  Is it always forgetting the snap count in the huddle or is there a change made at the line of scrimmage that would account for that?  Why do offensive linemen jump offsides?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there more factors than just forgetting the snap count?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know; that's why I am pleading ignorance in the question.</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of an advantage this week that you know of their personnel, know their strengths and weaknesses, is that going to help you a lot even though they are in a different system now?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you come here do you change a lot of things?  Are -- your defense has been going in your offense for a couple of years, a lot of them, will they recognize things faster, and if the quarterback is calling a play on the line, will they know it when they hear it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Same thing with the sideline signals, I know against Michigan  -- (inaudible)  -- against Michigan your -- the quarterback was standing in front of the signaler so Michigan couldn't see the signal.  Is there worry that they will know the signal is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pat had a full week last week.  How had he developed?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said he ain't got a whole lot of reps before.  Do you see improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kind of expound on what you were talking about the biweek you talked about the things that you were trying to develop.  Some of the young kids, did you see anything that you wanted to in particular that you can share and also do you worry about losing some momentum?  You have won four games and the biweek, sometimes the momentum is not there the following week...</p>
<p>	Q.  In addition to Holiday you said some of the other people nicked up and things, how is the health issue?</p>
<p>	Q.  I heard you the other day talking about playing cornerbacks and quarterbacks and the fact that you thought those were positions where there was such a thing as playing someone too early.</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of Chris Olsen and quarterbacks, how do you measure when a quarterback is ready, the circumstances thrust him in there and you hope he's ready to go?  Are there certain things that you look for where you say he's ready if we need him?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is Chris progressing along those lines?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder too is there in your philosophy are you ever to a point in a season where you say, boy I am not going to play - I am not talking specifically about Chris - a freshman, I am not going to use him when I get to the 7th game, I am not going to play them at this point and preserve a year eligibility, do you have that thought process or are they always kind of, hey, if we need them if they can help us  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the challenges that your corners face in going against the tall receiver like Tevo Johnson?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you have a guy that brings those dimensions, I mean, does that change the way the corners play their coverage?  Does it change what you do  --</p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious are you sad that you moved Tevo out to wide receiver at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have mentioned Bill Walsh on a couple occasions.  I wondered if you could talk about what you think he brings as a coach, what qualities you admire in him as a coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of focus on Arnaz in the last week after that catch in Michigan State.  Talk about his progress from the time that you saw him starting in spring and just I guess some of things that maybe we wouldn't see that you might - rout running and blocking and just the progress he's made at wide receiver?</p>
<p>	Q.  Players and coaches talk a lot about focus, but how important is it for the player to have a sense of that they can actually make a difference in a game in terms of maintaining that focus? I would imagine it is hard to get a player through an entire season of practice if at some point they start to feel that their contributions in a game will be minimal?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the first win you said, I guess you told your players don't believe the hype, because there's going to be a lot of hype.  This week the NEW YORK TIMES, BCS poll has you as No. 1.  When did do you start worrying about the hype?  What do you do to make sure that they don't believe the hype, things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Omar Jenkins and his improvement this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Much will be made by us about your connection with Stanford and the emotion that we may speculate that your former players are feeling.  In your experience as a coach in any games maybe similar to this with the emotions surrounding it, what actual impact can that have on the performance of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Getting back to Tevo a little bit, how is he similar and how is he different from some of the other taller receivers you face, say a  Charles Rogers --</p>
<p>	Q.  I think he may have caught like a fade or kind of a jump ball as you said in the end zone from a short distance situation.  That has to be one of the hardest things to defend you know, if you are scheming against that.  Is there a really legitimate defense for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rashon Powers-Neal powers, I am curious if you could go back to springtime or when you arrived even the decision to move him from defense to running back, you know, what factors led you to that decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rashon Powers-Neal powers Neil he worked at safety quite a bit last year and making him a running back full-time...</p>
<p>	Q.  With Rashon Powers-Neal's health status in the spring he was a  little bit banged up.  Did you really know what you were getting once preseason opened this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the improvements you think the backs may have made?  How much of that is communication, familiarity?  I guess talk a little bit about those improvements.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that you see maybe younger backs commonly underestimate how important those blocking schemes can be sometimes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stanford has played two quarterbacks a lot of different times this year. Talk about their similarities and differences, how that affects your preparation for the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What strengths are you seen on film of Stanford  this year and how difficult is it to make your players see it especially coming off the kind of loss that they had last week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Change can bring about a lot of emotions that we saw here with your team.  When have you seen the excitement change to belief?  It seems now the past couple of games that your team believes in themselves.  It's not so much that we have a new coach and we're playing for you. They actually believe that being undefeated that they can go the rest of season that way, when did you actually see that light in their eyes?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week (inaudible) they gave up basically 13 points in turnovers and especially knowing your defense and how they salivate over that, is that one thing that you are stressing that these quarterbacks, that if you try to force them, try to intercept them, that there are a lot of points that can be had off that; especially knowing the tenacity of your D and how they like to score on offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even though you have know authority over the schedule, it does work at least in your favor a little bit that if you are going to have a biweek then to come back and have a game, it could get up a team up with emotion at least playing against Stanford.  It seems that your team knows the emotions and knew the emotions against Michigan State, they know the emotions going into Stanford.  Does that at least help you to play into getting your players fired up?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were talking earlier about Carlyle Holiday.  I am wondering is there a certain point by this week where he's going to have to be able to practice to play or to play in the game Saturday or is that up in the air or what is your philosophy on those things?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously been mentioned a few times already about Stanford giving up 60 plus points last Saturday but I would imagine that you showed the team more of them scoring 60 plus points two weeks ago.</p>
<p>	Q.  If you had your druthers would you want Stanford on your schedule this year, next year, and secondly, how has your relationship with Kevin White developed since your hiring?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering what your emotions would be like in say the hour before the game when you are out on the field and you are seeing Stanford stretching and maybe some guys come by to say high or you talk to some of the people in the program, will it be pride, will it be just happy to see them; how do you think you will be feeling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it's going to be pride this week because you know, a lot of these guys have talked about you as a father figure in their lives and somebody that's made an impact on their development, how does that translate to your emotions this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am curious about your perspective on Stanford's defense.  You had a defense -- the Rose Bowl year they gave up quite a lot of points but you succeeded in spite of that.  Do you see any similarities between this young defense and any of the defenses that you coached at Stanford from that perspective?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you could talk a little bit about Shane Walton what qualities has he brought to the secondary and special teams and coming in not really knowing what to expect personnel wise has he been one of the most pleasant surprised for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  The records would indicate that the accent from your standpoint would be more on defense this week.  That may not be an accurate assumption or not.  What about their defense that gives up a lot of points, in the meantime you have talked about they have got young players, is it turnovers that has been more a problem then their defense or how do you see that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering what is different about life in the South Bend area as opposed to where you lived here in the Bay Area?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is the weather there now?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you miss the most about your former home in the Stanford area?</p>
<p>	Q.  Don't have one at those now?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much have you been able to follow Stanford?  Do you have and impulse to check out their scores, to keep abreast of what is going on there?</p>
