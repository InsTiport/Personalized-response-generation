<p>	Q.  I'm sure you've noticed the BCS pole just came out and you've always pretty much stuck to the line of whatever the system is that's in place, you're in support of that.  But I was wondering if there is a system or an idea that you might have that might make better sense of this whole process.</p>
<p>	Q.  If it were ever to go to a playoff system, which I guess is likely at some point but seems unlikely at the moment, what do you think a workable number would be?  Is eight a workable number or is 16 too much?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're out of school this week, how do you balance the free time they have with their needs to emotionally recuperate from everything they have gone through academically?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has your experience been last few years in terms of what your team's focus has been during an off week from school?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you played well?  Do you find that you play better when they are able to focus more on football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Every week talking to players, somebody asks one of the players about, is this team a rival.  How do you define a rivalry and how many can you have in a season?</p>
<p>	Q.  But teams that maybe only have, two or three, they put extra energy into every game you play?</p>
<p>	Q.  And just the fact that it's two top schools, how much does that add to the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about the fact that I think some players didn't like the way BCS has celebrated some of their wins, tearing up the grass, trashing the locker room, do you let -- do you remind the players of that, or do you think they reminds themselves or is that something to motivate them?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think this is the latest Notre Dame has ever been ranked in a season since 1963.  Are you surprised it's been taken this long for the team to be ranked?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you don't think there's a point where you should have been ranked higher or sooner?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does the fact that BC and the Bowl mix with Notre Dame, did you talk to the teams at all about that this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  And listening to Coach O'Brien talking Sunday night or Monday night talking about, he was very disappointed in his team, on both offense and defense; that it was probably the worst he's seen in a couple of years.  Do you see something in the film that maybe you can take advantage of or that they had some problems there?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a string of games coming up against teams with good run defenses.  How are you comfortable at this point with your rushing offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Marcus Wilson and Travis Thomas and how they fit in with that run offense at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about maybe where you are with your backup quarterback compared to where you were in August, how do you feel about that area?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was it true last week you did not practice and pass at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was it very little; was it reduced?</p>
<p>	Q.  I mean, do you do that for -- what you do, bring it down a few notches for injury reasons, or are you trying to get fresh legs?  What are you trying to accomplish when you do less hitting in a given week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Good practices.  What constitutes --</p>
<p>	Q.  A good practice. </p>
<p>	Q.  You promised you would be charming today. </p>
<p>	Q.  We'll give you one more try.</p>
<p>	Q.  And I'll help you with adequate questions. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not going to go there.  But I did want to ask you about one of your freshman, Chauncey Incarnato, probably not spending a lot of time in your eye, but talk about his progress and what you've seen him from so for this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've got three running backs that bring something different to the table or at least they did last week against Navy.  Talk about the different styles that Grant, Walker and Wilson have and the stress that that might put on a defense having to defend those three different styles?</p>
<p>	Q.  Everybody knows about the on-field impact Derek Curry makes, but talk about what he brings to the table off the field.</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned pass rush, Matthias, the Indiana kid, talk about what makes him so effective as a pass rusher?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see many players that big with that kind of speed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Every coach has characteristics, what would you say are the characteristics of tomorrow O'Brien?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are the questions any better from this side?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've touched on some of these already, but basically the capsule form, but what do you look at the strong and weak points of Notre Dame against BC on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other way around?</p>
<p>	Q.  On statistics, do you follow the stats when you're on the field?  What I'm leading up to, let's say you're ahead by 30 points, two or three minutes late in the game.  And you normally would be using second- and third-string players; you find out one of the running backs is maybe three or our yards short of getting 100 yards.  Would you put him in so he could get the 100-yard mark? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you ever know if they are that close during the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your mail like?  For coaches at Notre Dame, no matter what they do, it's critical, they can win by -- and I'm quoting other coaches -- you can win by 50 points and you're criticized because you're running up the score or you win by three points and they tell you should you have won by more, etc., etc.  How is it going for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't read your mail?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you get much mail?</p>
<p>	Q.  Take us through, aside from practice, what's your typical day like this year?  Meetings I'm sure, but what else goes on behind the scenes?  What time do you start?</p>
<p>	Q.  So what happens other than looking at game film from other teams --</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you able to get out and about and go to a restaurant or wherever in public and people not want to talk football or whatever?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about in the off-season?</p>
<p>	Q.  One final question.  When all is said and done, you have a week or two, what do you like to do for a vacation, get out of town?</p>
<p>	Q.  Like a cruise?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's not any of the personal stuff, but I wanted to talk about the offensive line.  What do you see right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the key to becoming more consistent?  What do they have to do to become more consistent?</p>
<p>	Q.  And also I just want to talk to you, too, about the rivalry game recently with Boston College.  What is it with that game, what's made it such a rivalry over the past few years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you agree that there seems to be an extra bit of nastiness to this series with Boston College right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the impact Bobby Renkes has had and how much easier it makes it knowing the other team is going to start at the 20. </p>
<p>	Q.  Carl is on the step charts, he's ahead of Bobby, is that the way you plan or --</p>
<p>	Q.  DJ has gotten a lot of accolades for his directional punting, how hard is that to develop, because a lot of people thought maybe Jeff has stronger legs than DJ; can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kickoff, is that even more pertinent this week with a player like Blackman back there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you feel like your kickoff coverage needs to improve?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paul Lee, how would you describe the year he's had so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Over the course of the season, where do you feel like he's kind of put everything together to have the kind of year, he's at 30 tackles, which I believe is more than Darryl had last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  One thing that's unique to Greg is he was fairly touted coming out of high school; can that be an extra source of motivation for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly the topic of starting fast is something that the offense talks about essentially every week; what goes into that and why do you feel like maybe you're able to get over humps on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  The topic of scripting play is well-linked to the West Coast offense; do you still do that and how much do you do it if you do?</p>
<p>	Q.  How far does that extend?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the running game, does that go hand-in-hand with not being able to start fast than if you were able to run the ball consistently?</p>
<p>	Q.  Starting fast and being able to play with a lead, how does that change the flow of a game, change what you're doing as a coach in terms of play calling on both sides of that, whether you are down early or up early?</p>
<p>	Q.  So it's less of an issue of if you get up earlier, players are more free and not putting pressure on themselves; you don't see that as a benefit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the idea of how everything is a rivalry game for this team, how does it complicate your task as a coach to prepare your team not to as a team, but carrying the heavy symbolic burden that Notre Dame does?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you personally deal with the fact that many people out there see you not just as a football coach, but almost as a guardian of sacred trust?</p>
<p>	Q.  And what's your sense of what Notre Dame football means to people and to college football as a whole these days; does it mean the same things as say in the 1940s or 50s?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game Saturday, Brady Quinn called it his worst game of the year.  How would you evaluate the passing offense against Navy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that one of the things that makes him special, is he has such a -- he sets such high standards for himself; that he wants to live up to them?</p>
<p>	Q.  And just to get something else on the quick-start thing, you got off to such a quick start against Navy.  Was that just what happened last week, or is there something that happened in that game that you can translate to this week and beyond?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is the first time in a long time that you they not had any seniors on their offensive line, what have you seen of them and is the experience factor or lack thereof markedly visible to your eye?</p>
<p>	Q.  Throughout Tom O'Brien's tenure at Boston College they have always had a tailback, a singular tailback that is a superstar that they rely on.  Last year it was Derek Knight and this year they are playing more by committee, and what are you seeing out of that and what adjustments have they made to continue to be successful in the rushing game, even though they don't have that one singular guy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously a nice turnaround this year to this point last year, 2-5, 5-2 this year.  What do you point to as the biggest thing that's led to the big turnaround?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much are you continuing to see improvement in the confidence area week-to-week?  It looks like on the field we are all seeing improvement in the X's and O's and those type of things.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this a time of year, do you start to talk about Bowl games, obviously one win away from being eligible; when does the B word kind of come up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about, are you getting everything out of Mike Goolsby as you had hoped?  He seemed to have rebounded well off the injury. </p>
<p>	Q.  What have you seen, maybe his stand-out strengths this year so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has anything really jumped out at you as far as his strengths on the field this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this a guy we could see playing on Sundays?</p>
