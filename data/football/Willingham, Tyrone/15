<p>	Q.  Talking about the schedule, Notre Dame is having a change of philosophy scheduling and planning to go to a seven-game home schedule in 2009.  Do you think there's a need to level the playing field as far as changing philosophy? </p>
<p>	Q.  A little bit, because you have three teams coming in who are not getting return dates.  I thought you would have Tennessee or Nebraska, Penn State without getting return dates?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about seven home games, does that give you a big advantage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the difference this year between Brady Quinn this year and last year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does having the experience -- you keep saying last year that coming out of high school -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about John Sullivan and what he brings to the offensive line?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking with some of the players yesterday, asking them what kind of things specifically they needed to do to turn the season around from last year and you had different answers:  Focus, concentration, getting a quicker start in games, a variety of different answers.  What one or two things would you point to as being the key to turning the season around from what happened last year? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you get that confidence and swagger? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the players were also talking about the number 38 because of the 38-0 loss to Michigan, and I heard Justin Tuck say that they do sets of 38 whatever with Mickey, are you familiar with that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's your involvement in that activity? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're aware of?  You let Mickey handle that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  The punting job, have you made a decision regarding that?</p>
<p>	Q.  On running back, Ryan Grant said yesterday that he was 95 percent and ready to go.  He has not had a lot of contact this fall, if any.  Is that a concern of yours as you go into this first game? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of finding that second or third running back that you wanted to put into the rotation, what are the criteria that you've used in order to make that decision?  Is it just holding on it the football, is it explosiveness; how would you characterize how you've made that decision? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of BYU, as you've been here, they have been very successful under Gary Crowton in opening games and last year beat a pretty solid Georgia Tech squad.  After having been beat the year before by Georgia Tech, when you go into an opening game with a coach like this who likes to throw the ball all over the lot, do you have to worry about having to defend things that he may not even use, and --</p>
<p>	Q.  Because he's kind of had this record of being a very creative coach offensively and tries to spread the field and use a lot of different formations.  Do you wind up having to prepare for things that he may not even wind up using in the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  And secondly over the years, they have been a much better team in pro than they have been on the road,  which is not uncharacteristic of teams, but  why do you think that is for them? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you worried about the food being cold this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the challenges you'll face with BYU's passing game, and what's the best way to have something off secondary as they go about maturing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you figured out starters on the corners? </p>
<p>	Q.  Strong safety?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mention confidence and swagger, talking to the players yesterday, they gave a fairly clear indication that they already have that confidence, I don't know about swagger, but they don't have a point to prove to themselves Saturday night.  They already know that they can do it.  Could you talk about how you maybe coached that confidence up over the last nine months, because certainly their most recent memory of playing a game was a negative one?</p>
<p>	Q.  So is that a mentality that you have coached through for the last nine months? </p>
<p>	Q.  Turning to Ryan Harris for a little bit, can you talk about his athleticism?  Talking to Justin Tuck yesterday, he said he's considered more of a big tight end than an offensive lineman, which is a pretty high compliment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about his drive a little bit to really excel, there was that show on MTV --</p>
<p>	Q.  The professional training he puts himself through in the off-season.  I think it's fairly unique for a college athlete to a certain degree; could you talk about his conditioning and his drive to put himself in optimum shape?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that could be indicative of the program that he came from? </p>
<p>	Q.  Moving from the right to the left side, what has been your evaluation of that through fall camp and how is he progressing? </p>
<p>	Q.  And lastly, Carl Gioia, the kickoff specialist, what has he done to prove himself in that regard and when was that decision made? </p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to consistency in that regard, where did he prove himself in that way through fall camp? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you evaluate your backup quarterback situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  How are the two freshman progressing during camp? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the 38 thing, or you commented on the 38 thing. </p>
<p>	Q.  Well, that's what I was going to ask you, is that a problem, does that take away from the focus of BYU? </p>
<p>	Q.  How do you as a coach get them really locked down on BYU, what you have a big rivalry game hanging in the distance the next week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Corey Mays, can you talk about his progress? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of three starters, do you expect Grant to be able to play for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last thing, you personally, do you feel like as a coach you need to show progress this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  First, to have either a winning record or a better record than last year in terms of, you know, the bigger picture here.  Or do you think about those things at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  And so the rest of it, you don't think about those kind of things? </p>
<p>	Q.  In 2002, you took your team to Air Force to play, that's over a mile high in altitude, but that was well into the season.  Did you do anything in camp to approximate or at least try to get ready for the altitude that you will face? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to a lot of the other players, they have mentioned Ryan Grant to them looks a lot faster than they have seen in the past.  And asking him about it, he thinks that running track in the off-season really helped him.  Can you evaluate what he gained from running track, whether it's mental, physical and how that's helped him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk specifically about a couple of kids about the offensive line, but talking to Derek Curry,  lining up across this year, he said they are a tougher group and they are more in sync.  What would you attribute that to, is the maturity of Harris and the emergence of Sullivan, or what accounts for the fact that the defense is saying they are that much better?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you describe the transition Mark has made to the right tackle spot and how has that effected the overall lineup to the offensive line?</p>
<p>	Q.  Chris --  inaudible -- bigger and stronger this camp, how would you assess his camp and his improvement and what are your projections for him going into his first game? </p>
<p>	Q.  How is recruiting different from coming off a winning season or losing different if there is a difference? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you finding guys asking this year about the record? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ronald Tally, what did you like about him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like a kid that may be one of those guys that develops into a leader, do you see that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about confidence in your quarterback and your team, can you point to a time last season where you felt maybe they got down a little bit and that impacted your season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lost a little confidence and it impacted your season. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you in any way wish you had an easier opener from the standpoint of building confidence? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wouldn't want to put my finger on anybody but --</p>
<p>	Q.  Perhaps a home game sense a second division mac opponent? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to Mike Goolsby, he said at the start of camp that the spring was a real adjustment for him, more so mentally, just getting back to playing again after having two bad shoulders.  How has he looked in fall camp and how are things going with him, his comeback? </p>
<p>	Q.  The other thing is, a road opener is probably a concern for every coach, but particularly you have a long road trip and then you're playing a night game as well.  Are there added concerns because of those factors? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said you think the guys, the program is on the verge of something big, why do you feel that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  Are there more tangible things such as increased talent level and better mastery of schemes?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you think about winning every single football game, do you ever think about the potential ramifications if you don't win every single football game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you prepare for a Todd Watkins, do you get tape on junior college players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Fitzpatrick, just awarded a scholarship and how he's earned that position, kicking and punting? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you ever played him in golf? </p>
<p>	Q.  How many freshmen do you feel like are in the mix to potentially play this Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you comment on two of the three walk-ons that got scholarships -- Josh Schmidt, he really came out of nowhere, would you comment on what he has done? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you made a decision about your punt returners and kick returners? </p>
