<p>	Q.  Last week you said that you had some homework to do regarding the possibility of a Bowl game.  Have you completed that homework and are there any opportunities for your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering what your reaction is personally, professionally, for a 9-3 football coach getting fired at Nebraska.  How do you react to that when you see a coach having that kind of success in a year and being relieved of his duties?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is it, avoiding a losing season and the fact that Notre  Dame could avoid having the worst five-year stretch its history?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you could talk about how the quarterback position changed from the beginning of the year, maybe fourth-year senior coming back and all of a sudden you had a freshman at the end of the year, what your expectations were at the beginning of the year and how they played out this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Probably one of the center positions on the year as far as number of players, how many would you like to have ideally?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the transfer of Chris Olsen and the uncertainty about Carlyle, what he's going to play next year has that changed the recruiting philosophy for this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you assess recruiting at quarterback so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the game Saturday night I noticed an awful lot of empty seats.  Does that surprise you?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the blowout, it must make you feel great.  Did everybody who was healthy get in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you addressed this before but who calls the play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you give us a view of the game Saturday, the matchup?</p>
<p>	Q.  Back to the great score, the blowout score, does that help much in recruiting?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the quarterback recruiting situation, how do we look next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wonder if you could talk about the maturing of Julius Jones off the field and maybe on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has some of that rubbed off on your other running backs, do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel you have someone else with his kind of potential on your roster currently?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan Harris, as you go into next year, you'll lose your left tackle, I think that's all you'll lose off your offensive line, if he a future left tackle, and how do you make that determination of which side a guy like that ends up on?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are the things that distinguishes a left tackle from a right tackle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Courtney Watkins' career while you've been here?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having coached in the pros before, do you think his size is going to be an issue or do you think because of his intelligence and speed he's going to find a good situation in the pros?</p>
<p>	Q.  Same thing with Julius.  Do you feel like he could be  -- he has not caught the ball a lot out of the backfield, which they do in the pros.  Do you think he can be a productive back at that level?</p>
<p>	Q.  D.J. Fitzpatrick going into next year, would you like to see him be one or the other next year rather than doing both the punting and the  --</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of your offense, once you came in here ideas that you wanted to do with offense, has it changed a lot from you thought you might be able to do, are you less of a passing team or is this from a pass/run ratio, is this kind of what you thought that you would try to be, a balanced offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know a few years ago, there was a point I remember talking to a running back recruit, he felt like diversity issues on Notre  Dame's campus hurt them in his recruiting and in his recruitment, do you feel like those issues have been addressed while you're here, have you seen improvements campus-wide on those kind of issues?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect Carlyle Holiday to return next year for a fifth year, and if so, do you think he would be in the quarterback role or more probable in another position?</p>
<p>	Q.  You'll probably be happy to have him back in any capacity, do you think it would be more advantageous to him and Notre  Dame to play a position other than quarterback or do you have any strong feelings on that one way or the other yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  I guess also Carlyle is a promising baseball player, would you have any objections if he played with a team this spring?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think all coaches universally agree that when you go to a Bowl game and get those extra two or three weeks' worth of practice it's extremely beneficial for a team.  Not having that opportunity this year, how do you make up for that void in the practice schedule and the field time?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Carlyle, you want to do what's best for him, but at some point, what's best for the team, does that take precedent in a situation like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you can share some of your impressions of Julius Jones, when you're watching him on film and watching him from the opposing sideline, and if you can tell us what he's done, has the come back exceeded your expectations or surprised you?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like a symbiotic relationship between Julius and the offensive line.  Obviously each needs to succeed for the other to succeed, much how much energy, inspiration has the offensive line drawn from the way Julius  -- when he starts running well, how much of that aided their improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously when a guy runs for 262 yards, that's a good sign, but had you seen any signs in the first couple of games that Julius was kind of on the cusp of breaking out and giving you some big effort?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about his evolution as a leader, for those of us who covered him a couple of years ago, he's always been a quieter type of guy, but it seems like he started to command more of a leadership role this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  How much harder do you think it is now considering your strength of schedule and your academic standards being raised so high to compete for a National Championship than it was in '88, the last time Notre  Dame won one?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of the strength of schedule, even with great recruits and great recruiting classes, it does wear any team down during the course of a year; wouldn't you agree with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the aspect of preparing to play a game in the Carrier Dome?  I'm sure you guys don't see a lot of Domes along the way but can you give some thoughts on your counterpart, Paul Pascaloni, and your impressions of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you just talk about  Justin, battling through injuries, as he's had a nagging shoulder foremost of the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  And I guess obviously a lot of credit deserves to be put on Justin for the production he's had, how much credit would go to Cedric and Darryl for commanding as much attention inside and at times leaving Justin in the limelight situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much different do you think just sin this year from 12 months ago, techniques-wise and skills?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the season in general and what's been the most disappointing aspect of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on Sylvester Croom and him being hired by Mississippi State and what that means in terms of a step forward?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if you could  -- I'm sure in your profession you're always trying to learn and grow and stuff.  What is maybe the most valuable thing you've learned through this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Without having a Bowl game, obviously you'll be jumping into 2004 a little bit quicker.  Maybe what are your objectives going into the off-season for this team?</p>
