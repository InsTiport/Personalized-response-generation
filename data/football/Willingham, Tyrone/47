<p>	Q.  Two-parter.  One, about playing in the final Kickoff Classic, what it's meant to the game over the years.  A lot of the Maryland kids said that's the start of college season for a lot of kids watching football.  Also, your impressions of Ryan Grant, the way he has stepped up this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  What are your impressions of Maryland linebacker EJ Henderson?  Does he remind you of any players you coached or played against in your time? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know this is your first game at Notre Dame.  In general terms, your anticipation of what other aspects teams bring to Notre Dame when they come to play you?  Do they play you 1% harder because it is Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about it being special being here in this part of the country as we near an anniversary.  Could you expand on that a little bit.  Are you going to address that or have you addressed that with your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how important is this game as far as kind of maybe reestablishing Notre Dame?  Obviously reputation on the field has taken a bit of a hit lately.  How important is it on a national stage like this to kind of let people know Notre Dame is here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to fathom the popularity that Notre Dame has in the New York metropolitan area with the "subway alumni" and the idea this game was sold out in a matter of hours, almost like a home game for you, maybe it's going to be 60%, 70% pro Notre Dame?  Have you began to fathom the idea of how popular Notre Dame is in this area?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about this being the premiere program in the country.  Is that one of the big reasons you came particularly after (inaudible) the first time?  Is that the biggest draw?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you come in with the expectation that you'll be facing more than one quarterback?  How has that changed your preparation, if at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've had obviously since January to get to know your players and all.  Now that it gets closer to the season, have you found yourself having a special bond with the players?  Do they accept you and are in tune with you?  And vice versa, do you have a chance to have a special bond with your players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Since we cover so much high school football in this state, starting next week, Chris Nelson, there was some worry whether or not he would go to Notre Dame after his commitment.  Now that you convinced him to show up, another question about impressions about that young man.  We've seen him since he was pretty much a ninth grader.  Your impressions of him, the way he seems to be adapting to college, playing for Notre Dame coming out of Jersey. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Friedgen was saying before that based on the success that his team and program had last year, he senses a confidence in his players at this time that they didn't have last year at this time.  This program, the Notre Dame program, has gone through a lot of upheaval in the past year.  Do you have any kind of a sense of the confidence level of this team right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  There has been so much talk about the new offense that you have brought to Notre Dame.  Can you elaborate some on the defense, if there will be a lot of changes?  A lot of people expect the defense to be a major strength of Notre Dame football, this year and always. </p>
<p>	Q.  Since you've taken the job, there's been a lot of attention about the circumstances of how you received it.  There's also been a lot of attention of being the first African American coach at Notre Dame.  Does that maybe put even added pressure on yourself to succeed even more?  Nobody knows what the pressures are like to be coaching at Notre Dame in the first place, but add into the mix being the first African American coach.  Are those added pressures involved? </p>
<p>	Q.  No. </p>
<p>	Q.  Given what Maryland did last year in the first year, I wondered if you have studied or paid any closer attention to what they did differently, especially to be able to do that?  Is that the best-case scenario or even realistic for a first-year coach inheriting a program, to expect that? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two days ago you said that the significance of your first game at Notre Dame will be minimized by you and maximized by everybody else, or somebody else.  As you get closer to the game, do you think it's going to be more difficult to minimize it in your own mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Pressures aside, do you appreciate where you are in history as an African American?  On Saturday you'll be the first one to coach Notre Dame in any kind of sporting event. </p>
