<p>	Q.  You have obviously seen a lot of Carson. I thinking  the first three plus years of his career he had thrown 39 touchdowns, 39 interceptions and this year the ratio is 24 to 8.  Can you see the difference on film, like what it is that you have done to make himself so much more effective this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to coach Parseghian, he said that you can almost ask any college football teach, at every place they have ever been, they usually have one time that kind of bedevils them.  He said it does not have to be the traditional rival.  For him, the team that he always had the toughest time with when he was at Notre Dame was USC.  Did you have a team like that at Stanford, the one team -- I haven't gone through the records -- a team that stands out in your mind?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the job Coach Carroll has done kind of reviving the program, the tradition at USC the last couple of years?</p>
<p>	Q.  I read something about when he was hired at USC someone was quoted as saying that he may be more suited to the college game than to the pro game.  Having been on both levels, what are the differences and are there things that make a coach more suited to one level or the other?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's been, I think, 21 years since they have beaten UCLA and Notre Dame in the same season, even longer than that since they have done it in consecutive weeks.  You've talked about the way teams play Notre Dame and the way that Notre Dame has to play every week to play to that level.  What are those kind of rivalry games and the emotion of those games take out of a team that can contribute to something like that where it's been so long that they have been able to put it together?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think this is a team where the secondary is looking forward to the challenge?  Is this the kind of a challenge that they really look forward to?</p>
<p>	Q.  What made the past week or two about Notre Dame might go to Orange Bowl whether they win or lose this game.  As a coach (inaudible)  Would it be fair for Southern Cal to be passed over if they beat Notre Dame this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the Orange Bowl if Notre Dame --</p>

<p>	Q.  Paul Horning (ph) on the radio broadcast indicated that in the spring or summer you had passed up an opportunity to address a speaking  event for a fairly substantial amount of money and he indicated that you weren't going to do any public talks throughout the season.  Can you say a little bit about that and after the season will you be doing that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even after the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  You won't be hitting the banquet circuit to a major degree?</p>
<p>	Q.  No.</p>
<p>	Q.  I am curious as to, you indicated you watch the highlights that the university provided, videotape, digital, film, whatever, rather than the network feed.  I am just wondering how many cameras do they use?  Do they isolate on just the offense, defense, how does that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  How critical is it to have Gerome Sapp back there in the secondary and what is the likelihood of him playing Saturday night?</p>
<p>	Q.  Experience in the Pac-10, how would you rate the Coliseum as a hostile venue and what recollection if any do you have of your own experiences there?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering what the next step or steps are in the evolution of your offense in terms of your wideouts have combined for about 90 catches and tightends are catching the ball more than they have caught it here.  Seems like Carlyle is getting the running backs the ball a little bit more than he had.  What in your mind is the next step or steps as far as the evolution of that whole development?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of times is -- that's dictated then by what the defense chooses to try to take away from you?</p>
<p>	Q.  So then balance isn't necessarily having that balance all in one game; it's having the balance over the course of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Over the last six games USC has averaged over 41 points a game.  There must be more to this team than Carson Palmer.  Could you kind of elaborate about the challenges that they present?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about Cedric Hilliard, what is his status?</p>
<p>	Q.  The position both Notre Dame and USC are in kind of speaks for itself in terms of national rankings, things like that.  In addition to that, it's a major rivalry game.  Like Alabama/Auburn, Texas A&amp;M, along those same lines.  Does that create any differences in coaching when it is a big rivalry game and can you draw from your experiences from the Cal/Stanford game because it's one of the big rivalries also?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last two three games how would you evaluate your rush offense, specifically in terms of the ability to pick up the four -, five-yard gains to give you guys second, third and short where the offense could be a little bit more flexible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about USC's defense, specifically their ability to stop the run?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything specifically they do that kind of enhances that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any advantage to the familiarity that you have (inaudible) --</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that Carson Palmer is up for the Heisman and there's a lot of talk about east coast bias in voting.  A Pac-10 player hasn't won the Heisman since 1981.  When you were on the west coast did you get a sense of an east coast bias; is that a real thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Parseghian was also saying that as a coach the losses always linger more than the victories.  He said he can still give you a play-by-play of every game he's ever lost and the wins all kind of blur together.  Is that fairly true for every coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mention this being a huge rivalry.  I know it's early in the week but has there been anything already that kind of -- that you have noticed that made you say that you  know how big a rivalry this is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Good morning.  I am sure you were happy just for a minute I'd like to take you back to last Saturday for a change of pace here.  I am sure you were happy to give Carlyle and many of the starters a rest in the fourth quarter.  And the Notre Dame Faithfuls seem to really enjoy watching the reserves and walk-ons get a chance to get on the field.  First, have you been approached by any officials of the movie studios about doing a version of Rudy II?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay. (Laughs) A couple of questions.  Actually three.  Does Notre Dame have more walk-ons or reserves than Stanford or other schools that you are aware of?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you tell us a little bit about these guys and what they have given to the program this year and how did you feel specifically when Tim O'Neill ran a power sweep to the left for 42 yards?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have got three freshmen that are going back to their home state for this holiday weekend.  I wonder if you can talk about how hard it is as a freshman to be away from home for this much time and just what it would mean for them to go back?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were a long way from home when you were a freshman.  Do you kind of remember those moments?  Was that I guess, hard in any way to be gone that long?</p>
<p>	Q.  What changes this week for you with practice as far as Thanksgiving goes and the way that that falls this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just have a BCS question.  I know you have got other things to worry about this week.</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, but, just wanted to get a reaction to you guys winning 42-0 Saturday and actually falling in the BCS rankings; was that a surprise to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up on the schedule for the rest of the week.  Are you guys going out to L.A.  friday or Thursday?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering your thoughts about having a four or five loss team in one of the BCS Bowl games.</p>
<p>	Q.  Looks like Florida State this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there other teams that might deserve to be there as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you know, the USC defensive line has really played well this year.  I was wondering if you, on video, if you see a real play-maker up there that kind of stands out above the others?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think it is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having dropped down to No. 7 do you hold out any hope at all of having enough things happen to climb up and somehow amazingly make it to the National Championship game in the Fiesta Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the holidays.  Given your emphasis -- (inaudible).  What are your thoughts on playing every year, going -- Notre Dame'S west coast swing every year which is either L.A. or Stanford and have you looked at future schedules and thought about adjusting that to where you are not playing over Thanksgiving weekend?</p>
