<p>	Q.  Notre Dame has lost nine straight games played at night.  Is that an issue that you have addressed with the football team and do you have a special philosophy as to how to deal with the time in between waking up in the morning and playing at night?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've made the decision to -- Coach Baer has not coached a specific position.  Could you explain the thought process going into that decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  Which assistant coaches will be in the booth game day?</p>
<p>	Q.  Uniform changes, can we anticipate you putting your touches on the unforms?</p>
<p>	Q.  But not this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Following up to that at Stanford you had the names on the back.  Was that a Pac-10 rule or was that your decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Holiday's development this fall?</p>
<p>	Q.  What have you seen that you've like so far?</p>
<p>	Q.   Talk about how much of the offense you feel he is for this game because you said at Media Day that offense takes years to perfect --</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of mixture you hope for, kind of  50/50 that you aim for as far as run/pass or what type of  --</p>
<p>	Q.   What was your reaction each week when John told you well, each week you have a nationally televised half an hour to an hour press conference?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you find this to be a positive   -- I mean this could be on ESPN news; it could be picked you up by anybody every single week.  Is that a positive that you can reach this audience every week?</p>
<p>	Q.  This weekend not only is this team playing its first game this season but you are playing on a big stage, New York City, lots of media, lots of attention.  Are you at all concerned?  Are there concerns about young players who are not only playing new roles on the team, dealing with all of the hype -- it is unusual a little bit for the first game of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you doing anything along those lines heading into this weekend specifically?</p>
<p>	Q.  What particular problems does Maryland present particularly as you try to get something going offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Exactly.  In addition to that.</p>
<p>	Q.  I would imagine before the game you are probably not going to waste a lot of words talking to your team.  What do you say?  What will you say and what will you say to your team different that is different from any other moment, any other game because of the significance of the first game Notre Dame -- Will there be a speech?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the way your team is put together,  strengths and weaknesses, does it remind you of any team that you had coached previously?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last thing, freshman contributions, can we expect to see significant ones from the outset and have the progress of the freshmen the first three weeks here surprised you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Besides quarterback, I guess the position that has been focused on most of the preseason by the media and the fans is running back.  Ryan Grant is the only one that has any playing experience and he had limited experience last year.  Can you just talk about the runningbacks, how they have looked so far and what you expect from them?</p>
<p>	Q.  A little bit about your philosophy of one of the things about getting through fall practice and not getting people too beat up or hurt.  Is there anything that you have noticed at Notre Dame that surprised you that you have had to change or is coaching coaching in terms of how you prepare your team and handle the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you continue to learn about this team how much more can you learn from a game than just a practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that this team is unique from any other that you have coached in the past.  How would you define the personality of this team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about your recollection of having to face Bill Diedrick when he was an offensive coordinator at other schools and also what he brings to your team in terms of Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Brandon Hoyte and your expectations?</p>
<p>	Q.  Glenn Earl, what kind of fall has he had?  I know he had some injury problems last year in the spring; how he progressed this fall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what separated Mike Goolsby in terms of earning the starting spot at linebacker?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important is his personality at the position?  A lot of his teammates talk about him being kind of a brash player?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the leadership that you want to get from the middle of the team on offense and defense.  Do you feel like you are getting that from Courtney and Mike and also the backup linebackers that are behind them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what Notre Dame has done and what it is a constant factor here and around the country.  What are your expectations for handling that kind of tradition and expectation?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are your expectations?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you have any recollections of your first game as a head coach at Stanford against San Jose state, Notre Dame coaches have been pretty successful in their debuts over the years, what do you remember anything specifics from your head coaching debut when you were at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember then about that Oregon game from a coaching standpoint?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a number of players that are from New Jersey but one in particular senior fits your scene Ryan Roberts.  Wondering how has he played this summer and what does he bring to your team?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I may just ask about Lionel Bolen is also from this area, south Jersey...</p>
<p>	Q.  Has the success against being the first Black coach at Notre Dame hit you yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the one thing you want to try to accomplish this season, this first season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any one thing that you have changed since coming from Stanford to Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you changed like preparation or in just the way the way you recruit or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about trying to read the personality of your team as you get into game situations.  That's when that develops.  I wondered is there a more certain time than before a first game for the coach as far as trying to anticipate what might happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Common things that you always worry about for an opening game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did those questions -- those worries change from game to game and get more specific as the season goes on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Opening games that -- there's always something that happens that's is a huge surprise or is it mostly just minor things here and there?</p>
<p>	Q.  My question is a little kind of a follow-up on David Woods talk being the first game.  You called -- you labeled the Oregon, your first Pac-10 game as big.  I know you are not putting all the eggs in one basket but how big to you is the Maryland game other than just being the first?</p>
