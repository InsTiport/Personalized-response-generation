<p>	Q.  As an observer of the Washington State program from the outside looking in, what did you see?  How did they did they build their program to become a Top 10 power?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any correlation in building a national power as compared in South Bend, Indiana?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have a couple coaches on your staff that were at Washington State that you had at Stanford.  What did you see that meshed with your philosophy offensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that your staff has moved past last year and things.  Does it come as a relief now that maybe this week you can put last year behind you and get down to regular business?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you hope that the offense has good performance so that it can stop answering that question?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is the defense going to have to play the kind of games it played in the ten wins, or do you hope that it's more of a shared responsibility in that defense will have those kind of games but the offense  (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, when a team has a bad season, but finishes strong, they often think they can take the good momentum into the next season.  Last season you had the opposite.  Do you worry about a carryover, and have you talked to your players about such a thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about Josh and what you've seen with him in fall camp?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about Dwight, what kind of a fall has Dwight had?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe when you were at Stanford, you had Chad on your team as a true Freshman.  Was it difficult at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along the same lines, is there an urgency in your mind to get (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  My last question is about Jeff.  Can you talk about what you've seen of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I'm sure you got to watch some football this weekend, and I'm sure you saw a lot of mental mistakes.  With Washington State having a game to work out some of those kinks, are you somewhat concerned you might have those mental errors in this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you prepare your team for something like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I notice on the depth chart that was released that Cedric wasn't listed as a starter.  Is that do to an injury?</p>
<p>	Q.  What can a runningback like Ryan Grant who obviously had a productive season like that learn from someone like Julius Jones and what can Jones learn from somebody like Grant?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has Ryan done through spring and fall camp to hang on to the top spot?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, there are so many black quarterbacks in college football these days.  Do you feel like any cultural or prejudicial resistance to black quarterbacks in the game has almost banished?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like there may be instances where the black quarterback is held to a higher standard?  Can you detect anything of that nature?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have been asked a ^couple ^ custom times about the up-and-down-nature of Notre Dame's record the last few years.  I would imagine the players on the team are maybe a little more conscious of it because they have been here through those up-and-down times.  Do you try to coach that mentality away at all?  Do you ignore it and let the players follow your lead, or is it something you bring up in meetings when you're talking to the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm kind of expecting that.</p>
<p>	Q.   I don't have a depth chart in front of me, but I was wondering if you could talk about the status of Mike?</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  And the other thing is I'm assuming that Nick is going to be doing the punting as well as the place-kicking.  Can you talk about the challenge that presents for him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly, you touched on this a little bit earlier:  The fact that Washington State has played a game already when you play them Saturday.  A lot of coaches have always said that the team makes its biggest improvement from the first week to the second week.  What are the challenges that you face playing that team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the development of the offensive line, how well is it coming together with only one starter back.</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's your most vivid memory of your years at Stanford playing Washington?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you win or lose that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  One more question, of all the famous Notre Dame's sites, do you have a favorite?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk also please about -- football's important at Notre Dame, and at Stanford, football is sometimes important.  Discuss that.  That certainly was a factor in your decision.</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, I realize that you guys work 80 hours a week.  Do you guys (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  How is the book doing and what's it like to be a published author?  Does that create some more anxiety?  Is that like finishing a term paper and, hey, there it is, I did a good job?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your book.</p>
<p>	Q.  I'll send you a copy.</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, but you obviously cooperated with it because the guy got good stuff.  (Inaudible).</p>
<p>	Q.  What were your impressions of Washington State last week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how the trainer caught fire?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was damage done?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just a minute ago, you said his role  -- you haven't determined it yet or you don't want to give away how much he's playing?</p>
