<p>	Q.  A few weeks ago there was a story in the San Francisco Chronicle about the West Coast offense and how it's been diminished in some respects because of the adjustments that defenses have made in the process.  Coach Walsh was even quoted as saying that defenses have caught up to it a little bit.  What's your perspective on that and what kind of things have you seen defenses do to combat it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there something specific that's been done?</p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle Holiday, I don't he's caught too many fair catches, he wants to be aggressive and he wants to take advantage of as many opportunities as he has.  How do you scold him on the proper --</p>
<p>	Q.  What assets does Maurice Stovall bring as a kick returner because certainly because of his stature he doesn't fit the normal mold.  What assets do you see there that have prompted you to put him back on kick returns?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you consider him to be the best candidate for the job?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm asking your --</p>
<p>	Q.  I'll let you make that call.  Thank you.</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.  No, that will be fine.  The sideline warning, they gave you two warnings, and you got a little upset on the return.  What happened there and what is it that they are trying to prevent you from doing by giving sideline warnings, is that big of a deal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your reaction, did you think it was going to cost you a touchdown?</p>
<p>	Q.  You guys had pretty good field position and you got into the other team's territory quite often,  yet it seems like quite often you have not maybe got as many points -- I think five turnovers in the past two games and the other teams' territory.  Do you think the team the offense has been better but hurts their own drive at times?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it something that you talk to the team about?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's not just red zone, but I would think that once you get past 50, I don't know what the standard is if you want to score --</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a percentage that you have, though, that you aim for inside the 50, or is it position of the red zone percentage; or how do you measure how successful you're being?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see overall that the offense is doing a better job?  Seems like you're getting a little more balanced in the pass rush the last two weeks. </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you discuss Washington, their strengths and what concerns you most going into this week's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  On the telecast Saturday, it was noted with Brady Quinn he is doing a better job of looking off his receivers and finding the open man.  That's one of the things pointed to in his development as a quarterback.  What are some of the other subtleties you see in his development?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about the decision you made to insert Travis Thomas in the game at the fourth quarter on Saturday and Walker and Grant had been running very well and I think it caught many people by surprise when you put Thomas in the game. </p>
<p>	Q.  What's Grant's status?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm not going to get silly on you, I don't think.</p>
<p>	Q.  We'll see how it goes.   Tim was talking about the West Coast offense and it's evolving and so forth.  When you see a system that you are running, either offensively or defensively starting to evolve away from what works, how do you go about getting new ideas for your playbook?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you feel like you have a need to want to tweak your offense or to maybe change systems, how do you get ideas about what you'd like to do in the future?  Do you watch other games, do you talk to other coaches?</p>
<p>	Q.  So when you say "week-to-week," is it something that you would consider during a season?  I mean, you might see somebody in another conference doing something and you might say, "Hey, that's a great play"? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're talking with your team and with recruits, do you use the term "West Coast offense"?</p>
<p>	Q.  But would you call what you're running West Coast offense or not really?</p>
<p>	Q.  Thank you.  Thanks for going with that.  And then when you're talking to recruits, what do you talk to them about the advantages of your system?  What do you sell them on about your system?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you talk about NFL?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now if they say --</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, no, I'm just talking about your offense.  The next question along this line is what if they say, well, how come -- how long does it take to get to that, why is it complicated?  Because a lot of fans ask that, why is it so complicated, and how long does it take to learn the system.</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to talk about the returns, too.  When you see a guy like Thomas and Zbikowski the way he's able to return interception, let's look at him at kickoffs or punts?</p>
<p>	Q.  Then when a guy like Travis comes in, he's a very young player and obviously has a lot of skills, what do you do as a coach at this point to bring him back?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about the development of Darius Walker?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now, I notice that Washington has given up 560 yards rushing in two games, do you feel like that's something that you can exploit?</p>
<p>	Q.  When looked at your quarterback, what do you look for in terms of signs of growth, what kinds of things specifically do you look at in terms of what he does and can do maybe better than he did?</p>
<p>	Q.  And also, I wonder if you could talk about the special teams play this past Saturday. </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about the quarterbacks against Washington -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  He was a four-year starter in high school, can you tell that when you're watching him on the practice field?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where is he at on the depth chart?</p>
<p>	Q.  Third string probably?</p>
<p>	Q.  We saw earlier Maurice had a boot on his foot; what is his status for Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that one of the reasons that Jeff was put in the game late Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'd just like to ask you a question about you as a person and where are you spiritually.  When you're winning, you seem to be like a burden has been removed, compared to where you were when we were losing, is there a difference in your demeanor, your character, your attitude, your spirit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that same spirit carry over to the entire university?  The other day I was talking with some groundskeepers, and they were telling me about when we were losing, everything on campus seemed to be bitter but now it's sweet.  So do you sense that Notre Dame football is kind of the life of the University; if we're winning, we have life, and if we're losing -- ?</p>
<p>	Q.  With a young quarterback, how much development --</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, wondering where he was on the depth chart. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was actually talking about Brady, but he's still a young guy and there's a lot of things he has to learn, whether it's mechanics or just the nuances of the game.  During the season how much of development can a quarterback have in those areas when there's so much attention focused on game planning week-to-week that takes up so much time? </p>
<p>	Q.  With leadership being an important part of that position, how difficult is it for a guy like Brady to take on that role when there's still so much that he is learning about the game himself?</p>
<p>	Q.  What differences have you seen from him in that area this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised he came out; he had shown some good play but that far exceeded what he had done earlier?</p>
<p>	Q.  Players were saying he's a very popular player among the other players; do you note that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned before that you like players who have played more than one sport; how does boxing help?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the margin of what they gave you yesterday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk more about Matt Shelton, the guys were saying he's pretty well grounded.  Yesterday Regis (Philbin) was talking about him and the huge plays that he is making?</p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier in the year you talked about swagger; is there a swagger now, or maybe you need to scale it down and say, hey, don't get too much swagger?</p>
<p>	Q.  You haven't played Washington since you've been at Notre Dame, but at Stanford you didn't have the best record against them. </p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle Holiday, he said he had a lot of friends and family calling him and asking him where he went during the football game at Michigan State. </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously something came up and it seems to be developing, is the luxury of having a two-back offense, having two guys with different styles that you can run out there, just can you break down some of the luxuries that provides a coach having that kind of duel-purpose attack?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this what you envision coming into the season, having something like this sort of emerge?</p>
<p>	Q.  What advice do you give the players when it comes to dealing with the media?</p>
<p>	Q.  How involved do you get when it comes to giving advice about those types of matters?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you care to share the types of things you would do specifically?</p>
<p>	Q.  Getting back to Matt Shelton, at six foot, 175, he doesn't look like an imposing figure.  Has he used that to his advantage in fooling people with his ability to make big plays?</p>
<p>	Q.  He was talking after the game that maybe the secret is out now and people are going to start paying more attention to him.  Do you see him becoming more of a focus when he gets on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the surprise developments, at least for us in the media, is the emergence of the receivers.  You have a talented and deep group, probably more talented and deeper than any of us have thought.  Can you just talk about that group overall what they have done? </p>
<p>	Q.  One thing that's been noticeable in the first three games is your kickoffs have been going short, 10-yard liners, the kicks, do you want to see them deeper or what do you think about the kickoffs?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you are talking about the kids who over the course of a career have a great career in college, whether it's a kid like Walker who comes in having been recruited by everyone in the country or a kids like Troy Walters, who comes in not having been recruited by very many people at all, is there a commonality in the guys who go through college and do finish as great ones?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that groundedness intrinsic to the players or something they can learn from being around older teammates?</p>
<p>	Q.  And could you talk about what you've seen of Casey Paus, he doesn't have a whole lot of experience, but his teammates are very excited about him and they say he's got the intangibles that they look for and they are confident that he can help them turn this thing around. </p>
<p>	Q.  Was he somebody that you talked to when you were at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  And when you talk about a kid like that who does have, as you said a family background, whether it's a sibling or parent who has played at this level, what do they understand about the college game that perhaps other players have to learn slowly along the way?</p>
<p>	Q.  And finally can you talk about the University of Washington program, you are more familiar with them having been at Stanford and playing them on an annual basis.  Talk about the Husky tradition and the fans.  I hear there are a lot of people who are planning to come back to Notre Dame; they have a very strong fan base. </p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you're any different now as a coach or person than you were back then?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you expand on that, as a coach how you may be different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Has this all been what you thought it was going to be when you got into it?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's the extent of your answer?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember the circumstances, you were here when -- you guys played in the Seattle Bowl and then you ended up getting the job a couple of days later.  Did that all kind of happen while you were here at the Seattle Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Couple questions about Zbikowski in relation to how you project during the recruiting process that a kid might be an option quarterback, what did you see from him on tape that made you fairly certain that you do drive him into the backfield where he really had not played at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about that process, in general terms, projecting a player to play at a different position in college and what goes into that, how you make those kind of evaluations?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of boxing specifically, you've talked about in the last couple of years how much you like guys that have played other sports.  Boxing in particular seems unique in terms of not only the physical nature, but the fact that it's a one-on-one type sport, not dissimilar from wrestling.  Is that a big advantage, that it is boxing, for Tommy, opposed to maybe another individual sport that he could have played?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly, someone asked earlier about you offering advice when players are dealing with the media, as Tommy was going through his recruitment, he was keeping a diary on ESPN.com or something like that, did you read that at all and did you give him any advice on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What were your impressions of the entire recruiting process being laid out in front of a national audience like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't feel like it was your place to advise him to do one thing or the other on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Washington's record aside, considering the extremes that have marked their season this year, does this team present more of a mystery than the usual opponent?</p>
<p>	Q.  They have a number of quarterbacks that have played, and now on the defensive end, he's threatening to overhaul his entire front line and maybe other players as well.  Does that cause you to wonder about what you're going to see actually?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mention your concern over their 0-2 record, uncertain that it properly represents Washington; do you worry about your guys underestimating them?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does the defense that you have compare to ones that you've had in the past?</p>
