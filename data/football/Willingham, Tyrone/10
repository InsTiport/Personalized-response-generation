<p>	Q.  The kick return that went for a touchdown, obviously the missed tackle at the 22-yard line, but the kick returner wasn't touched after that, either.  When you analyze that play, what went wrong there besides the missed tackle?</p>
<p>	Q.  The philosophy there, they are trying to set up the wedge and you have a group of guys that are trying to break up the wedge, and it was almost there was like a pile of ten players, five on each side and once the ball carrier got around it, then he was free.  What did you see there?</p>
<p>	Q.  The one that occurred two games before that, what was the assessment of that one?</p>
<p>	Q.  For Victor, I know the stat sheet says he only has four tackles, but it would seem that he's been a little more productive than that number indicate.  How do you assess especially a defensive lineman?  It's difficult to assess based on tackle holds, but how do you assess his play up to this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  What skills does he bring to the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last thing, there was one point during the game where you were talking to Brady on the sideline and you just at one point just handed him the headset I assume to Coach Diethrich.  Is there a point where you're trying to communicate with him, but your perspective is not as good as the guy upstairs and rather than try to be the intermediary between that conversation, it's best to hook him up with a guy that can see it best?</p>
<p>	Q.  Three of the games, you have had key plays that have really hurt.</p>
<p>	Q.  No major changes, a couple players, Mike Goolsby and -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you work on this every week, but do you put that extra emphasis now or spend more time on it now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin was talking about calling a senior meeting to talk to the younger players to make sure there's no loss of confidence or whatever.  You for that?  Does that need to be said to the players at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think at this point that there are some players that maybe are taking this loss in a way that they need to have a talking to?</p>
<p>	Q.  And I think several players, one of the things they talk about is was the team, the fact that there's still a whole lot to play for.  There are a lot of teams that last year had two losses that went to the BCS?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you feel you had to remind the guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  But some players might have thought after this loss, might think, well, the whole BCS -- do you think there's a need to remind them?</p>
<p>	Q.  And you always say win by one point, a win is a win, loss is a loss, but players, some players are going to see differently.  Do you think that players need reinforce after a big loss like that?  It was a pretty wide margin, do you think that players need reinforcement that there is still a lot to play for and that you -- that they are actually a good team or can be a good team?</p>
<p>	Q.  It would appear you're playing another good football team this Saturday.  Talk about Stanford and what concerns you have. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see anything that they are doing differently this year?  You talked about confidence and big play capability, but is it just a matter of their players getting more experience in Buddy's system?  What do you see them doing that allows them to be 3-0?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the points that have already been made about special teams, the fact that they are No. 3 in the nation, the kick return, is that a particular point of emphasis?</p>
<p>	Q.  They have also shown a knack for blocking fronts.</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about having to coach against players that you were responsible for helping bring to a university.  And I know you've said before with Michigan State, that once the game starts, the emotions go out the window. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that the margin of victory that you were able to put up last year in Palo Alto will serve as a motivator for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you evaluate your team here as we are approaching mid-season mark, where you think you are and where you think you need to go from here?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you are going through a season and so forth, do you ever think about next year -- and what I'm saying in terms of that, do you ever say, you know what, I'd like to give some people in some experience in games that are one-sided or for young people that will be starters next year, do you think along those lines ever, or not really?</p>
<p>	Q.  And I ask it in the context of, for example, if you're losing a lot of people in a particular position group, and I imagine your answer stays the same here, but that's where I was going with that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Offensive line play, can you evaluate at this point both in terms of the running game and the pass game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you account for the inconsistency, because this is a group that is now somewhat experience; that has played together some.</p>
<p>	Q.  Brady Quinn has continued to move up in terms of passing efficiency and so forth.  I know he had some sacks, but his statistics keep getting better.  Can you evaluate that part of his game, and also, maybe the intangible things that he brings to the team.</p>
<p>	Q.  How would the kickoff return, I don't know if he got dinged on that play, just evaluate him, what you thought of his first kickoff return in the game.  And if you'd like to see him back there some more.</p>
<p>	Q.  How close are you to getting Stovall and Grant back?</p>
<p>	Q.  The lopsided losses that have happened since you've been here, I know that probably from -- I heard your answer about what you tell the players, but how about you as a coach, though, how do you process that?  Do you count it the same as a close loss or a loss is the same, or does that disturb you and so forth?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did the big lopsided ones hurt more, any more than the others?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about how much the offense misses Ryan Grant, and how does that maybe change the dynamics of what you feel you guys could do well?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at this season, and this is just going back to what Tom asked earlier, when you look out there, what do you see that you guys are still playing for at this point?  Obviously there's still a lot of games and a lot that you guys could accomplish.</p>
<p>	Q.  After their Washington game, you talked about how a win like that could go into the core of a team, paying off the hard work that everybody put in.  When you lose that way, what effect can that have on a team in terms of the psyche going forward?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do last season when you had some tough losses, that affected the team going forward --</p>
<p>	Q.  When you have a team that doesn't quit like last year's team didn't get Purdue and the results don't turn out the way they want to, can that have a cumulative effect that at some point they feel the work they put in is not translating?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering if you can talk about Trent Edwards and what you've seen of him on film this year, is he living up pot potential you envisioned him when you recruited him at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  And Justin Tuck said that he attributed a lot of Stanford's offensive success to the offensive line.  He said what from he's seen it says the offensive line is starting to gel.  Can you start to talk about what you've seen of them on film?</p>
<p>	Q.  And finally, can you talk a little bit about Corey Mays and the improvements that he's made even from the start of fall camp to now, at the beginning of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of his teammates said to me that if Corey were anyplace else, he would probably be a starter, and you said you know the talent that he has.  Can you talk about the leadership he's provided in terms of not complaining or making a fuss?  He obviously has three very big guys in fronts of him, but it seems like he's done very well with the role that he does have. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just talk a little about Anthony Fasano, his development at tight end and how he's progressed last year to this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the most impressive thing, his completeness as a player, his well-roundedness? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you have so many people at that position and they are all skilled and they are all athletic, how do you prevent, as a coach, from players getting frustrated with sharing playing time and not getting enough reps, how do you make that work?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the fact that your offense got so much yardage on Saturday and was only able to put 16 points up on the board, are you concerned about their ability to finish drives out and get them into the red zone and finish them inside the red zone?</p>
<p>	Q.  And also, Stanford has shown it was very strong against the run.  They only gave up 99 yards to USC.  Talk about having a 325-pound nose tackle to try to move out of the way to get the ground game going?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like you have to get a ground game established against them in order to be successful?</p>
<p>	Q.  The decision to move Ambrose from offense to defense when he was a prolific high school performer offensively, what went into that decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  What didn't translate from the high school level offensively to the college level for him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about some of the lopsided losses, when you look back, more recent ones, it seems to come on the heels of some of your bests performance, Pittsburgh win with the then the 57-7 win against Stanford and then now three straight wins before Purdue.  Do you feel like it's a step-forward, step-back type thing,  is that a concern of yours? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that feel like you were playing a team like you mentioned, coming off the three wins, and now your third year you feel like you've made more improvements than there were in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been asked this question a couple of times now about playing Stanford and the meaning of that game; is there any extra for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're halfway into your third year in the program.  Is this where hoped you would be; is this where you thought you would be as a program?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you feel like are the biggest challenges for you as a head coach to getting to maybe where you want to be where you have put those high standards for yourself, because I know you say your standards are higher than everybody else's, what are your challenges to getting this program to that point?</p>
<p>	Q.  How close do you feel the program is, you mention Purdue and said that is a pretty good football team, and they really did look like the better team on Saturday.  How close is your team to being a team like that that people are going to say -- just have to take our hats off to Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you worry that the big punch will add a little motivation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Later do you regret --</p>
<p>	Q.  So you don't worry about a decision this year affecting --</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned if the run is not there, you're going to go to the pass?</p>
<p>	Q.  In games where Brady throws more than 40 times you're 0-7.  It shows that the other team --</p>
