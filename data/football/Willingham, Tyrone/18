<p>	Q.  I was wondering what your experiences were in the past with a football team at this stage of the season with a couple of games to go without the motivation of a Bowl game at the end of the line?  How difficult has that been coaching a team in that situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does that fall on deaf ears with seniors that may not have that motivation?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems that in college football, when a team struggles, when they have a substandard season, the natural reaction or what oftentimes happens is there are changes on the assistant coaching staff.  You have never been one to have a great turnover on your coaching staff from your years at Stanford.  Is that strictly your call?  Is that something that you would discuss with the athletic department or how is that decision made at the end of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you anticipate your staff coming back intact next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this still emotionally a tougher game for you because in some way the players on the other sidelines are players you recruited to Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think last year, whether this was happenstance, it seemed on the sidelines, that was one of the emotional games.  At halftime, you were animated.  That's when you said, "When Johnny is in danger..."  Do you think your reactions may have played a role in that or was that coincidence that that was a game where you were a little more animated?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't have much contact at all with the Stanford players, even during the off-season?  They don't call you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Aside from this week, do you watch games much?  Do you tape the games and watch them?  Do you casually look at them, see how they did?  How do you follow what they're doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any special plans this week going back to your former hometown, any special things you're going to do before or after the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Stanford/Cal is one of the big games on the college football landscape.  I'm wondering, when you were coaching there, what is it like to try to get the team back to focus for the next week after they've played "the big game," as it were?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that anything that you feel like your team, Notre Dame, can exploit, the fact they're coming off that loss to Cal?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about some of the goal you still have for this team, helping Julius add to his rushing total.  How do you balance goals like that with obviously one of the goals has to be ready getting ready for next season, especially since you had a lot of younger guys that played? </p>
<p>	Q.  With the possibility of a Bowl removed, with some of the players who may be playing injured or at less than a hundred percent, do you start to make evaluations and say, "Maybe, if it will help recovery, we shut them down now rather than allowing them to play at less than a hundred percent right now"? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of people in our profession were kind of debating whether Bowl practice or recruiting time for the coaches is more advantageous.  Do you see any validity to the fact that this will help recruiting, the fact that you have more time, you're not focusing on a Bowl game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you characterize recruiting as going at this point?  Do you feel like you're where you want to be at this time of the process? </p>
<p>	Q.  Along the recruiting lines, are you being received similarly to the last couple years?  Do recruits have questions about the losing record at this point?  How do you address that, if so? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you'll help me if I misquote you here. </p>
<p>	Q.  When you first came, you mentioned about expectations.  I believe you felt your expectations would be as high or higher than the fans' expectations.  You didn't think that was going to be a problem.  I wondered, though, in terms of your expectations for the program, for the team, can you get the program back to where you want it to be?  Are these things fixable in a year?  Do you think these are longer-term goals? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think things that were problems this year are fixable in one year, though?  Are they longer-term problems?</p>
<p>	Q.  Along those same lines, can you talk about the secondary play this year?  Again, maybe things that you feel will be challenging going into next year, things that you're encouraged about. </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you anticipate Nick Setta being available at this time?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wasn't clear.  How did he hurt or suffer an injury?  Was it kicking or making a tackle or doing something else?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think last year you guys signed 22 players, you brought in 33 or made 33 offers.  I don't know if I'm correct on that.  Do you anticipate a similar type, not bringing in the full 54 this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  The target approach, is that something, you know, rather than throwing out all 54 visits, is that something that Stanford taught you, offering to fewer players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why is it some schools will do more of the shotgun approach versus the more target approach?  Has any coach told you why they do it one way versus the other?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Jeff Samardzija's development this year?  What has prevented him from being more of a consistent presence in the offense over the last six games?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has he done to impress you this season, particularly early on when he was catching, or things he's done in the last six weeks?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to Chinedum, he has one catch at this point.  As you look back at the end of the season, is there any second thought to using your of eligibility on him this year considering he played such a limited role?</p>
<p>	Q.  Philosophically for a guy that is going to play a role primarily on special teams, why, in your opinion, is it a good use of his first year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Recruiting, more on the philosophical tangent, as you go through and evaluate, you're talking to players, trying to gauge where they're looking, leaning, when it's time to turn your attention to maybe a different name on your list at a particular position, how many factors go into that evaluation where you may say, "Receiver X doesn't seem like he's looking, we should look at Receiver Y"?  There are so many factors involved.  How do you go through that and try to evaluate that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you ever feel completely confident in that, because these are 17-year-old kids you're dealing with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at Stanford, they've had two full years, offensively how has their system or philosophy maybe changed from what you tried to run?  How is it maybe different from what you tried to do there?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your interest in adding potentially a 12th game to the schedule next year?</p>

<p>	Q.  How difficult was it for you to watch or observe even from a distance the difficulty that Stanford appeared to have in their transition year last year?  To what degree do you think this is a better team this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does the dynamic for you change?  Facing Stanford last year at Notre Dame at your place, this year going back to Stanford, does it change the emotional dynamic for you at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the hardest part of leaving Stanford for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel a responsibility to hold up the Notre Dame tradition?  What do you feel that tradition is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel a responsibility about all that?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the media, you're perceived as very serious and hard-nosed.  Some of the assistants I talked to say that's not true at all.  How do you want to be perceived?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the program that you tried to build and start at Stanford.  Is it tough for you to see what they've gone through since you've left?  There was so much that happened during your tenure there, and now it seems like they're kind of back to square one.  Do you view this mostly as a cyclical kind of thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about what is the biggest difference between Stanford and Notre Dame for the head coach when the team is not doing well?  Is it a different experience than it was at Stanford when you had your struggles there?</p>
<p>	Q.  About playing freshman, do you ever play a freshman because you have the notion that he may not be the type of player that's going to stick around for five years anyway?  Would that affect a young person's playing time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you openly discuss that with a freshman at a certain point in the season where a freshman is not playing, do you discuss that with a player, "We're going to preserve your year of eligibility"?  How open are you in those discussions?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year someone asked you what you missed about Stanford.  You said all you missed was the hot tub. </p>
<p>	Q.  Someone asked what you missed most.  I think that was the response. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you tell us some of the things, after being away for two years, what you miss most about Stanford?</p>
