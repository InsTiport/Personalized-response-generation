<p>	Q.  We were speaking with a couple of the defensive players yesterday asking them about Coach Baer and the common theme seemed to being the defensive players like the intensity he brought to the job of defensive coordinator.  What are some of the qualities that he has brought to the position that has prompted you to stick with him and choose him as your defensive coordinator?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't mean it in that sense. </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been loyal to him and he's been loyal to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  A couple of players also mentioned yesterday that they felt a little bit disrespected before the Purdue game last year when they had run through the pre-game formations and things like that.  What would your reaction be if your team did something like that?  What would the repercussions be of your team doing something like that for the opposition?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned after the game you were a little bit surprised that we acknowledged the six out of eight. </p>
<p>	Q.  But do you sometimes think that the focus is so extreme on Notre Dame that maybe Notre Dame players and Notre Dame coaching staff doesn't get the credit that perhaps it deserves?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen that change through the years?  Is that a societal thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  And that leaves me to my final question, I asked a couple players this yesterday and it caught them by surprise, and you can think about it over this week and answer next week.  If you were in our position, if you were a member of the media, how would you approach the line of questioning maybe a little bit differently than we tend to do it?  Or what would some of the things be that you might not ask? </p>
<p>	Q.  Wondered if you could talk a little bit about the rivalry with Purdue and what's made this rivalry what it is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now, what about the last few years or so, the games have been so close.</p>
<p>	Q.  How does that play into the whole rivalry part? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does their pre-game run intensity the rivalry also?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the attention that you receive, what do you think that this is the first time that Notre Dame has been 3-1 and unranked; were you disappointed to see you were unranked, or do you pay attention to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coaches say they don't pay attention to the rankings and it doesn't matter, but in football it makes a difference.  When do you start paying attention and worrying about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sometimes on Sundays -- if you asked one of your coaches if you heard where we are, or did you guys --</p>
<p>	Q.  Some players seem to know that Purdue has not won here since '74.  Are you aware of that fact?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that puts more pressure on Notre Dame, or Purdue or them to break it, or for you to keep it going?</p>
<p>	Q.  Just because it's been so long? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Kyle Orton and what problems he presents. </p>
<p>	Q.  How much does a guy like Stubblefield, where they have a relationship where they have been doing it for a while and they seem to make plays together, rather than just one guy doing it, how much harder is that to defend? </p>
<p>	Q.  And finally, talk about Justin Hoskins, obviously he's getting more attention this year, I think he only has three sacks. </p>
<p>	Q.  What makes him so good, I asked him what he likes about sacks and he said he didn't know, he just likes doing it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Other than Orton and Stubblefield, what else concerns you about Purdue this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are they doing anything different with Stubblefield this year, because he only had about five career touchdowns coming in; despite all of the receptions, he had he already has eight this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is it that makes him so good? </p>
<p>	Q.  Their third down conversion rate has been amazing so far this year, and I know in the past that's something that Kent has really emphasized.  How do you work with a team to get it ready for those various third down situations defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about defending home field.  It was mentioned that Purdue has not won here since 1974.  How much of an emphasis do you put on defending home turf, not just in games like this, but throughout the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Finally, my weekly question, what's the status of Ryan Grant this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yes, I do. </p>
<p>	Q.  Awhile back we talked about the turnovers that the 2002 team forced and the fact that it didn't happen as much last year, and I think you might have said something to the effect that it's not something that you count on, but you certainly welcome.  Is there something that a defense does that you see that can create that kind of climate, and what is this team doing to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of mind set, with the Syracuse game ending the way it did last year with the December, the defense, you as a coach, I know the players, Kyle Budinscak mentioned they had a players-only meeting where they sat down and talked about what they with do in the off-season.  As a coach, what role do you take to bring a defense back from something like that, especially going into the off-season like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  And without sharing any secrets --</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you say what maybe your mind set was in terms of bringing them back?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked to them about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know that a lot of head coaches sometimes spend the majority of their time on one side of the ball or the other.  I know you have both offense and defense in your assistant coaching background, do you pretty much split the time or do you lean one way or the other? </p>
<p>	Q.  Okay, yes and special teams.  Okay.  I also talked to Kyle about they had this great mind set all summer and they were -- just felt really good and confident about the defense and then he said, "You know, we got into the BYU game and it just was so deflating to lose that game," but they were able to pick themselves back up.  Can you talk about bringing them back?  You mentioned, take a play out here or there, is that what you talk to your team about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Given what you know now about how your season has gone, if you were presented the opportunity to keep BYU at the end of October, move it up where Notre Dame did, do you feel good about the move up to beginning of the season?  Do you feel good about how that's played itself out?</p>
<p>	Q.  A couple last things --</p>
<p>	Q.  The freshman, Vernaglia, is he healthy and practicing now?</p>
<p>	Q.  And is he a strong safety right now?  Is that --</p>
<p>	Q.  And just your general impressions of what he's been doing in practice. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a chance you could use him to --</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  How about Kadous?  Obviously you don't like to use a lot of freshman. </p>
<p>	Q.  Justin Hoskins, doing some kick returns, a little running back last week, is there any chance you'll look at him as a possible receiver, not just out of the backfield, but lined up as a receiver? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to the question about coming off the BYU game, how much does your experience at Stanford help you bring your team back after a deflating opening season loss?</p>
<p>	Q.  And talking a little bit about John Sullivan, talking to Brady yesterday, he said that people on the team don't look at him as a red shirt freshman, they just look at him as a leader. </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of John even though he's only played four games,</p>
<p>	Q.  What have been some of your impressions of him through four games?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you coach a guy that -- if you're going make a mistake, make an aggressive mistake over a passive mistake, he seems to fit that bill pretty well.  Not to encourage mistakes, but is that what you see out of him, as a guy who is being aggressive? </p>
<p>	Q.  When it came to him being close to playing last year, what was your decision to not play him? </p>
<p>	Q.  The offensive line on a whole last three weeks, especially close to the BYU game, Brady has a lot more time to look down the field.  Do you see the line coming together on a whole right now in terms of their protection and just being able to work together and having some continuity there?</p>
<p>	Q.  And in terms of freshmen, going back to the question about Anthony a little bit, when they are dinged up or injured a little bit during fall camp, could you talk about the added challenge that presents for them to get on the field, the ground they have to make up and how difficult it is to make it on?</p>
<p>	Q.  And can you talk about how you feel like Chris Vaughn is coming on right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Darius is probably another that when they were recruited, talked a lot about how they got the impression from Notre Dame that they were being recruited to come in and play right away, not to come in and sit.  What a guy gets that impression whether you have told him directly --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel when that impression is given off that they need to play; that you need to get them on the field at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Brandon Jones, talk about what type of running back he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about West Lafayette, this is the first year the playbook has opened up that Kyle is that good, is it a bigger playbook than in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about Brady, since the last time he played Purdue, how much has he grown?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see him looking forward the game a little bit, as he looked back and saw what happened last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the Purdue offense a little bit, the type of stress a scheme like that puts on the defense and how you deal with that, especially when you get into that chess match, sort of subtracting players and maybe some of your better players the defensive backs, and then you look at your running game and their running is more than solid?</p>
<p>	Q.  You didn't want to talk about the offensive struggles in the third quarter on Saturday, but after looking at the film what are impressions of what happened in the third quarter? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the next step for this offense to, do it for a complete football game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Matt Shelton coming into the season has four career receptions coming into the season and has become one of the go-to guys on the offense.  What does he do and when did he really start to emerge?  Because I know it says in the media guide he became better at coming back to the ball in spring practice, was that it, was that sort of the last cog to getting him out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of his teammates said that without his pads on you would not necessarily know he was a football player.  Can you talk -- in that way, he's bigger, but a little bit like Jerry Getherall who played at Notre Dame, a smaller guy who could go out will and create some magic.  Could you talk about some of your guys that that you have coached that have fit that mold?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about the Purdue offense a little bit, it covered each of the first three games, Kyle has gotten the ball to nine front receivers and they are averaging 200 yards rushing but with three tailbacks; is that harder to prepare for than, say, a team that has one superstar receiver or one superstar tailback? </p>
<p>	Q.  If there was one piece of advice this week that you want your defensive backs to take into the weekend, what would it be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it as simple as, you know, try to limit the big plays?  You hear that a lot, keep the receivers in front of you, that kind of thing.  Will you go over those types of things when it comes to strategy?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a competitor has Purdue kind of become with Notre Dame when it comes to recruiting? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think it's become more under Joe Tiller? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've been in a major conference, and now obviously you're not, but what are the differences in the dynamics for a coach in a situation that Notre Dame is in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there more pressure because, you know, if you're in the Pac 10, you've got the sixth place team is automatically slotted to go to a Bowl, is there more pressure than if you had a conference of your own?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there more pressure, because if you're in a league like the Pac 10, you're going to get -- the financial windfall is going to be the same almost regardless of where you finishing.  Notre Dame, your football team kind of has hold of the pursestrings of the entire athletic department depending if you go to the BCS or go to a smaller Bowl, it's, etc., does that manifest itself in pressure of you and your staff? </p>
<p>	Q.  Until you came along, the tight end has been an afterthought in Notre Dame's offense, but Anthony seems to have changed all that.  Could you talk about his contributions and what he brings to the table?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Jeff Samardzija, is he maybe on the verge of a breakthrough, he's caught seven passes in the last two games? </p>
