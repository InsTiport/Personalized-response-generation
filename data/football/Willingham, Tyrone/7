<p>	Q. Coaches usually say that they don't change a game plan from one quarterback to another, but it appears in Tennessee's case that that clearly is the case with Brent Schaeffer and Ainge.  What have you noticed with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  So you think it's less by design and more by the athlete making the choice? </p>
<p>	Q.  So it is helpful to you knowing that you only have one game plan for this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking with Brady yesterday about the West Coast offense and getting the ball, throwing the ball to the running back, he said that the running backs have stayed in on pass blocking more this year.  Could you elaborate on that, and is that an aspect of your offense that you feel still needs to be developed in terms of throwing the football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan Grant said yesterday that he might be inclined down the road when his playing days are over to get into coaching.  Who are some of the players on this team that come to mind immediately to you that might be the kind of personality that would fit into the coaching world down the road? </p>
<p>	Q.  Since the Boston College game, there's been a lot of speculation about some athletes and football players who may have gotten into some trouble off the field.  Is there any reason to believe that there are going to be any players this week that won't participate because of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Dietrich said last week there could be some changes for offensive starters, they were looking at everything, looking at the start, doesn't look like there were any, was it a case of everybody --</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a case that you think that the offense needs a change because the defense is struggling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Playing in Tennessee, anything special this week you'll do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Working on calls, working on signals?</p>
<p>	Q.  What other types of places are tough? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you go in a place like that, does it feel good when you don't hear the crowd and it's quiet and you realize --</p>
<p>	Q.  Notre Dame is 25-2 after the bye week; any idea why so successful coming off an off-week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to the players yesterday, asking them what they felt they needed to do to be successful this weekend, and I think they mentioned  getting off to a quick start, having a balanced offense with the run and the pass and then limiting their big plays, most of the things that have been talked about throughout the year.  I know every week is a test, but is this week really a good way for you to judge how much this team has improved since the start of the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is one of the goals of the bye week is to get everyone healthy? </p>
<p>	Q.  What's the status on Freeman? </p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan sat out those two early games at the same time Darius burst on to the scene a little bit; is it easier for fans to overlook the response of what Ryan adds to this offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about Grant, address a little bit about his coaching.  What specifically do you see in him that maybe he might be a good coach?</p>
<p>	Q.  His whole career, it's been a little bit of a roller coaster somewhat, with the thousand-yard season and then Julius comes back and is kind of relegated and then this year the injury. </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you say the team is 4-1 when he starts, and 2-4 when he sat out with injury?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about Quinn, what you've seen from him this year and what you would like to see in these last few games from him? </p>
<p>	Q.  You touched on Ainge earlier.  Can you talk about what maybe allows him to play at the level he is as a true freshman? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the role of your seniors on your team, can you talk about what you've seen from them in maybe the last ten days in terms of leadership and such? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you do some recruiting or work on some recruiting during the extra time, and if so, how have you been perceived during that time?  Any different than early in the season, or is it about the same? </p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle Holiday, he's winding down his career and I know that he's changed positions and done a lot of different things.  Can you talk about him and what he's trying to accomplish here, the last part of his career? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask you about Freddie Parish.  Where do you see him right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you wanted to involve him more, Carlyle, honestly it would be tough to involve him less from the line of scrimmage considering he's only had two touches from the line of scrimmage so far this year.  Are you surprised or disappointed that you had not been able to give him the ball more from the line of scrimmage? </p>
<p>	Q.  We've talked about the struggles with consistency on drives, and you've also kind of struggled a little the bit on having by place from the line of scrimmage, you're averaging about three a game.  When you take a look at who you want to put in that starting lineup this weekend, which way do you go a little more, do you look for somebody that can give that you spark for the big play or are you looking for somebody that can be the more consistent player?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see time of possession as a big factor in this week's game, trying to keep that offense off the field? </p>
<p>	Q.  Conversely let's talk about the defense a little bit.  In the first four games, you had 16 turnovers from your defense and you've only had three in the last four.  For the last two weeks that has been a point of emphasis in practice, and what are some of the things that you do in terms of drills and things like that to try to create those kind of turnovers? </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't want to infer anything from that answer, so are you saying that that attitude or those techniques have not been there the last four games?</p>
<p>	Q.  And have you voted? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you talk about the development of Maurice Stovall from the first time you initially got him three years ago to what you're seeing from him now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking about your running backs and how you'd like to get him more involved in the passing game, just knowing what I know about Justin Hoskins, is he a guy that you think might be able to help in that and if so, what has kept him off the field from actually being a player in the passing game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you expand on how much that can open up your offense if you have -- flat or to stretch him out a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think that would help your offense if you had that?  It's hard to put a percentage or anything like that --</p>
<p>	Q.  Talked to Ara Parseghian yesterday, heading to Florida, said he mentioned to you that he will think of you every day, as shooting his age over the next five months down there. </p>
<p>	Q.  We talked about what he did there in the 60s when he was hired here in Notre Dame to turn around the Notre Dame football program, how he asked for a three-year contract and was given that because he felt that that's all he would need as far as turning it around and that he would know which way things would fall.  Your present day situation, do you subscribe to the notion that under a particular coaching staff for that three years, you can tell where things are going after three years? </p>
<p>	Q.  With that said, since you and your staff were hired almost four years ago, do you feel like you're any closer to returning to college football team of the week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you specify what positives have you seen in that way? </p>
<p>	Q.  And the inconsistency, is that pretty much the thing that has really held you back as far as where you wanted to take it, where you could see it, 33 games into it?</p>
<p>	Q.  And last, I know I'm going a little broader scope here but Notre Dame has not won a National Championship in 16 years, has not won a Bowl game since the first day of 1993, could you see how people at home, people that die for the blue and gold are starting to lose faith in the football program overall, not just in the last short term, but just long term? </p>
<p>	Q.  So you could see how people -- there's a lot of doom and gloom out there right now, could you see why that is developing? </p>
<p>	Q.  You touched on this earlier about what you need to do at a place like Tennessee, but going on the road, particularly in a place like that, is it imperative to get the running game moving consistently, because that seems to quiet the crowd more than anything. </p>
<p>	Q.  And you've talked about, also, the ability of the bye week to get you healthy.  I know you probably haven't seen them on the field yet, but has Ryan Grant been the benefitted greatly from that, because it seems like every week he doesn't play he gets a little bit better than if he had to play and recover. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to some of your players yesterday, they seem think that not having to face Brent Schaeffer this week is going to make their task at least a little easier defensively.  Can you talk about what Tennessee's offense loses when he's unavailable as he will be this weekend? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had to coach a freshman quarterback last year and this year you'll be facing at least one freshman quarterback in Ainge.  What are the keys to getting freshmen to the point where he looks like he is now, where he can lead the team and knows how to succeed and can handle the pressure situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach said yesterday that Justin's sack numbers may be down but his impact continues to grow, the way he impacts the offense and the intimidation factor he brings.  Can you talk about how you measure Justin's progress this year, as he is being more and more double-teamed and sack numbers are perhaps not as high as they have been in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kyle said that when they are at the line of scrimmage, a lot of times the guys, or the guy who is lined up across from Justin, will cheat off a little bit and that the rest of the defense picks up on that. </p>
<p>	Q.  Does anything change in your preparation during a bye week, is it two weeks of preparing for Tennessee or do you sake some of the time to look at yourselves?  How does that work? </p>
<p>	Q.  So it's not just two weeks of focusing on Tennessee, it's a little bit of everything? </p>
<p>	Q.  Obviously, you said that the loss to BC was a tough one.  How much extra pressure does that create within the program losing that game and given the tough schedule that lies ahead? </p>
<p>	Q.  How difficult is it though not let the pressure that loss creates creep into the guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to cornerbacks, specifically, whether it be in recruiting or moving a guy from a different position, what kind of personality traits do they need to have that are unique to that position? </p>
<p>	Q.  Cornerbacks. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something that you can discover about a guy before he goes into and experiences that in a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How would you assess Dwight Ellick and Preston Jackson so far this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have they given you pretty much what you expected that they would? </p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly, talking about Tuck yesterday, you said they are pretty funny guys and they have a way of picking guys up with their personalities.  How would you describe their personalities in that way? </p>
