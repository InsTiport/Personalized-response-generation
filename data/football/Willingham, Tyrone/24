<p>	Q.  Speak briefly about Pittsburgh and Fitzgerald. </p>
<p>	Q.  From a coach's perspective, just watching him on tape, also watching Mike Williams who is on the schedule, are they similar in a lot of ways?  Maybe what are some of the differences between those two guys?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of evaluations were you able to make on the offensive line?  Looking at some new guys, new starters potentially. </p>
<p>	Q.  Are you at a point where you worked some new guys into the first team or in a rotation potentially?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the attitude of the team as they went through the bye week.  Talk about the attitude you saw.  Do you lean on some of the veterans to keep it positive?  Do you put that more on you and the rest of the coaching staff?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that what you do, stay positive?</p>
<p>	Q.  Thanks. </p>
<p>	Q.  In your last game you threw for almost 300 yards, which was a little bit of a spark for an offense that has struggled.  How do you now strike a balance between a "short-term fix" of throwing the football, balanced with your obvious need and desire to run the football? </p>
<p>	Q.  So you have to be willing to live with second-and-nine if you have to just to make the attempt to continue to establish the running game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your previous experience with a quarterback throwing 59 times in a game? </p>
<p>	Q.  But you've had quarterbacks throw that much? </p>
<p>	Q.  They were in negative situations?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a couple times "confidence."  Is that one of the key things right now, getting the team confident?  The next two teams are not easy to get confidence with. </p>
<p>	Q.  During an ESPN conference call last week, Bob Davie was saying one of the problems that Notre Dame has is scheduling, there are no easy games.  Do you wish that Notre Dame would have a game or two, a time when things are going bad, you could gain that confidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it safe to assume that Brady is starting?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you try to get Carlyle in somehow?  Is there a role for him? </p>
<p>	Q.  If you're not pleased with Brady's workouts this week, any chance there could be a change in quarterback? </p>
<p>	Q.  The game will be, of courses at night.  It will be dark before it's over.  Do you practice any differently for a night game?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your take on Bob Davie, excoach, being the color man on the network?  Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you assess the play of the fullbacks so far?  Is it what you've been looking for?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're recruiting a fullback, west coast offense, is it a different type of fullback than what a more conventional offense would be looking for? </p>
<p>	Q.  How different is the learning curve for a fullback in a west coast offense from another offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on your philosophy, at what point during the season, or how long is too long before you decide whether you'll use a kid, his year eligibility? </p>
<p>	Q.  Would you feel right about that, though? </p>
<p>	Q.  The question leading up to that is about John Sullivan. </p>
<p>	Q.  I mean, was there a chance we could see him this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year against Pitt, it looked like you decided to keep Pitt in front of you, Fitzgerald in front of you defensively.  Is that the only way to stop that team, do you think? </p>
<p>	Q.  You always say you want to run the football.  In this game, with this kind of explosive offense, 38 points a game, do you think it's probably more important to have some success running the football earlier than against a team that doesn't score as many points? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just saying, with this team being so explosive offensively, do you think it's more important to actually establish the run earlier to keep their offense off the field versus going against a team that doesn't score as many points offensively? </p>

<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your relationship with the BCA and what involvement they had as far as when you were looking around for coaching opportunities? </p>
<p>	Q.  We have an opening out here at Arizona, first opening in the country.  I know the Black Coaches Association has already talked to the school about making a statement about hiring a minority candidate.  Were they involved with you, as well, when you were looking around?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is your take on this opening out there?  From your experience in the PAC-10, do you feel this would be a good fit? </p>
<p>	Q.  Larry Fitzgerald this morning was talking about sort of the rhythm and chemistry that he and Rod Rutherford have built up.  Can you talk about what that chemistry means, when a quarterback and receiver tandem get going, kind of the best combination of that chemistry you've seen?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said a couple times that you need to improve all areas.  Since you like to make things as simple as possible, is it fair to say if you would run the ball better, almost everything else would fall into place? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you perhaps ever worry about comments about west coast offense when actually looking through your head coaching career at Stanford, I think it looks like Stanford ran for more than 2,000 yards on a couple of occasions, looks like had you quite a few pretty high rushing totaling during your Stanford tenure. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious, the team has not scored a first quarter touchdown this year.  I'm wondering what problems not scoring early presents in a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something you talk about and stress with the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  On Brady Quinn, sort of getting his feet wet, getting started, what sort of progression do you hope to see this year and beyond out of him?</p>
<p>	Q.  I'm curious about special teams.  In your time in coaching, has special teams evolved in any particular way?  Has it become more important, stayed about the same?  The evolution of special teams. </p>
<p>	Q.  You may be aware that the Boston Red Sox came back last night to take the series. </p>
<p>	Q.  Yes.  Thank you, Coach.  They talked after the game about their ability to come back based on their belief in each other, their confidence.  You talked earlier about how important positive attitude is.  Would you talk about your belief in this team to win out over the rest of the season game by game and how you feel about their belief in each other and the team as a whole and the coaches, a lot of confidence being derived I think from that kind of belief. </p>
<p>	Q.  One step at a time, Coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're saying then despite the adversity, the belief that this team had in coming together at the beginning of the year you feel is very much still there?</p>
<p>	Q.  The follow-up on that last point a bit.  During the bye week, have you had a chance to talk with the team, maybe reassess some goals, set some goals in the next week or two, things you'd like to see improved in the next game or two?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's not easy when you lose anyplace, but it's particularly tough at Notre Dame for the players and everyone involved.  Because of that, do you have to make special efforts to keep things positive and moving forward?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pitt lost early in the season.  The one thing they've been able to rally around is they're going to the Big East conference next week starting off 0-0.  What are some of the things, being an independent, you're able to point your team towards?</p>
<p>	Q.  Pitt's defense has gotten more than a thousand years.  Could you comment how your offense might match up with their defense, some of the challenges their defense presents. </p>
<p>	Q.  Lou Holtz took control over Irish defense when it was struggling.  Have you taken a more active role with helping the players along the offensive line?</p>
