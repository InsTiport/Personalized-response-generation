<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about what when in your mind when you recruited Pat Dillingham, he could have gone to Stanford one of the best schools in the country and is a walk-on at Notre Dame.  Is that a shock to you or?</p>
<p>	Q.  Tell us a little bit about his personality, what he is like and what makes you confident  -- what type of person is he that led you to believe that he can do that?</p>
<p>	Q.  This is jumping ahead. There has been some national talk before yesterday about BCS and Notre Dame. (Inaudible)  do you have an opinion on whether or not a 13th game would make sense given where you are at this stage of the season and is that something that's even on your radar screen at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about trying to prepare Pat in case he needs play on October 5, what do you have to do as coaches to make up for the lack of game experience that he has?  How do you compensate for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  There a lot of positions, not just quarterback, where the backup doesn't necessarily have a whole lot of experience.  Does that become a concern and as you get further into the season, as the team becomes more banged up?</p>
<p>	Q.  NEW YORK TIMES had an article saying that there are no more walk-ons anymore.  Very rarely happens.  Do you think it's pretty hard now for someone to walk on?</p>
<p>	Q.  When was the last time that somebody that you were aware of walked on and made a major impact, game winning play or even turn into a starter?</p>
<p>	Q.  Professionally?</p>
<p>	Q.  I am wondering how much do you feel like -- you played Michigan State.  You are about to play Stanford.  How much do you think this is weighing on your players to win one for you as opposed to win one for them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you give any consideration moving someone like Arnaz Battle and Jared Clark to quarterback and what would it take in order for you to look in that direction?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you comment on your rushing defense so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  When Courtney Watson got (inaudible) got back in the lineup.  Is that your philosophy?  Is that something that's understood in the locker room that when players get injured, it doesn't necessarily mean they lose their starting job?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the things that you have been doing in terms of preparing your secondary?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe in the first three games the defense total, I believe, 5 sacks in the last three games (inaudible) what are some of the factors you think that gets you that much improvement last weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  At the quarterback position how similar or different is this to last year with Randy and Chris, when Randy went down  --</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe Carlyle in the last three games was something off, I think 20 and 56 passing.  What are some of the factors you think that has gone into him struggling with that completion percentage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mechanics a part of it at all for Carlyle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you believer in Sports Illustrated jinx?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the fact that Pat has a chance to receive scholarships in some other schools, could you kind of talk about maybe his skill level as compared to what we might think of as a typical walk-on skill level?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you plan to have the media between getting the guys to believe that they can go out there and win every game and at the same time letting them know that there are still improvements that need to be made every week?</p>
<p>	Q.  For a guy like Arnaz who has had his share of difficulties - injuries seemingly always coming at the wrong time.  As you are watching on the side can you enjoy that moment for him (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, this may not have an answer or may not make sense at all, but I am wondering having been a walk-on yourself has that given you any special insight into Pat either that you talk about expressly or just helps you deal with maybe what the situation he's in or the mindset he might have at the moment?</p>
<p>	Q.  Reflect on when you took the job, could you foresee something like this breaking like it has for you guys as you kind of look down the road?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has been the one thing that surprised you the most about how your team being able to play during this four-game winning streak?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Pat, obviously until Saturday, he hadn't had any playing experience and I know he's still like all the other players getting comfortable with the system, but he seems to have a good grasp of the system and what it entails.  Can you talk about his picking up the system and his ability to perform it?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the bi this week and three days of practice, how is this week of practice given with a game week of practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't realize we could ask a follow-up and I wish I had, going back to the question about sort of the insight you might have into Pat and some things you might be able to share, can you share any of those with us about ways you might relate to what he's feeling?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what Bob Simmons has brought to your staff and how you guys background together?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about your backgrounds together, where did you first cross paths with Bob?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondering can this experience be a little bit too overwhelming for a guy like Pat being thrust in the spotlight like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Begin the fact that you are going to have a Saturday off actually how are you planning on spending it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Several people have commented on the competence that your team plays with and the enthusiasm they play with.  Was there a point during summer preparations when you saw tangible evidence of that confidence there?</p>
