<p>	Q.  Last week you were 10 of 19 on third down.  This is the second time in the last 18 games you were above 50%.  We were talking to Ryan Grant yesterday.  He said that is a constant emphasis for you guys about staying on the field.  What are the keys to being a successful team on third down?  Obviously, a lot of it is tied to what happens on first and second down. </p>
<p>	Q.  Having Ryan Grant back, I'm sure it's no coincidence that him being in the lineup has something to do with the fact that on that day you did finish above 50%. </p>
<p>	Q.  The term "concussion" was used.  What do you anticipate with Brady this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're saying you anticipate him playing this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Naturally you're going to get bombarded with the questions of the 40 straight wins.  I was wondering what your perspective on that was in terms of how you handle it with your football team. </p>
<p>	Q.  30 years since Purdue won at Notre Dame stadium. </p>
<p>	Q.  Heading back to the Meadowlands, what goes through your head as far as the first game? </p>
<p>	Q.  What was that like for you?  You'll have to think about it, in a way, first time you took Notre Dame on the field. </p>
<p>	Q.  Paul Johnston said a number of times Notre Dame has parade All-Americans, Navy has guys that march in parades.  When you think about that, how do you think about it's said that Notre Dame should meet Navy every time?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel it is that type of situation where Notre Dame is expected to win?  It's a lose-lose in that regard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did Brady suffer a concussion? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you expect giving Pat extra work this week just in case Brady isn't feeling well? </p>
<p>	Q.  You fully expect him to be able to play on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why does the team seem to have so much trouble getting started?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you go over to the seniors at one point the other day and ask them to try to fire the team up a little bit?  Ryan said at some point you came over and said that the team was lethargic, I don't know if you used that word. </p>
<p>	Q.  He did. </p>
<p>	Q.  Nobody wants to be known as a member of a team that lets the streak end. </p>
<p>	Q.  Hoyte is known as a guy that does a lot of things besides football.  He says he's pared down a little bit. </p>
<p>	Q.  He takes great pride in being known as one of the hardest hitters on the team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Where does that come from?  Someone asked him after the BYU game about hitting the quarterback hard.  He said it had to be done. </p>
<p>	Q.  Why the problem in the first half getting 11 men in the huddle?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about with 10?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it players not being aware or coaches missing something? </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, when did Brady get injured?  Was it on the two-yard run? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kyle, what you've seen from him over the past couple years, how he's kind of grown and developed? </p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at the Navy-Notre Dame game, what is it that you think has maybe made this game one of those games?  When you look at the alleged talent level, there's certainly a huge divide.  The game doesn't always play out that way. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm sure the toughness part, maybe their discipline probably plays a role in it, too. </p>
<p>	Q.  DJ is having a pretty good year kicking the ball.  He could have a year left if I'm not mistaken.  Is this a year you would be recruiting a kicker? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you're looking for kickers, do you typically look for guys who can hopefully do both?  Is that the way you look at it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Navy has had a little more than two weeks to prepare for this game.  Do you remember a game in which you had that type of time frame to prepare?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  In coaching at Stanford, here, what do you like about coaching smart players? </p>
<p>	Q.  They talked a little bit about how you could see that manifest itself in meetings sometimes.  Guys are able to understand quicker.  I think they talked about the ability to maybe change things, guys are able to recognize more.  Do you see that, as well?</p>
<p>	Q.  Kyle, when I was talking to him yesterday, about the topic of once he got injured, there was a lot of excitement around Victor, him coming back this year.  He heard that a little bit, found it pretty easy to dismiss.  Did you talk to him about that at all, "Hey, you're not getting overlooked here"? </p>
<p>	Q.  Offensive tackles, they're seen as more skill-position players than they used to be.  Do you agree with that perception at all?  Why do you think that might be? </p>
<p>	Q.  Over the last couple years, you have searched for solutions at tackle.  Why has it been maybe harder to find tackles than guards and centers on this team? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of Ryan and Mark, how do you feel they've progressed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mark moving back and forth.  Have you seen him kind of rewire himself again or do you feel like -- what strides do you think he's made so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of overall offensive philosophy, how do you feel about the max protect idea?  Is that something you're open to when you need to be or is it something that you want to have that option of a tight end being out on a pass rout? </p>
<p>	Q.  How often would you estimate you do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little about Navy's offense, the way they run it, the problems it poses for defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that offense being as successful as it's been, why don't you think more schools run it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Polanco, the way he directs the offense and the problems he poses being an extremely mobile quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  Eckel is a terrific fullback for them, as well.  There aren't that many fullbacks anymore in college football.  Why have more and more teams gotten away from using the fullback as an offensive weapon? </p>
<p>	Q.  You're going to set a Notre Dame record this week in the fact that you will have back-to-back games where you faced a nose guard named Babatunde. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about what a big nose tackle does in disrupting an offense.  You see it used more and more in the NFL.  You're facing another pretty big guy here in a 290-pounder. </p>
<p>	Q.  I don't think Boston College has a Babatunde on the roster. </p>
<p>	Q.  Justin talked about how he hates to play Navy, because of their discipline, toughness, the scheme they run.  What is this week like for the coaching staff, particularly the defensive coaches?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does that translate on the field in the sense if you have a defense that kind of prides itself on being aggressive, maybe even gambling a little bit like you talked about, when there's so many responsibilities, can that take away from that advantage and maybe have them thinking a little too much?</p>
<p>	Q.  Several of the players, especially the front seven, have seen this before, played Navy before, other service academies.  How much does that experience play a factor?  Also going back to talking about having intelligent players who are able to see things developing in front of them better than others. </p>
<p>	Q.  Playing at the Meadowlands might not have that much significance to you.  It certainly does to Brandon Hoyte because of the game he played there a couple years ago.  What do you remember about the circumstances leading up to that, his reaction, Brandon's reaction, learning he was going to start? </p>
<p>	Q.  Players from New Jersey, you've had a lot of them over the years here.  Is there a common thread between all those guys or is it a matter of a good player fitting in the system? </p>
<p>	Q.  Players from New Jersey have been pretty good to Notre Dame.  Is there any common link as to why they play well here or is it a matter of them being good players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Navy is a team that if you let them have lots of long possessions, I wonder what kind of pressure that puts on your offense to be efficient every time they get the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that something you do on a weekly basis, after a loss, after a big win?  When do you usually do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to talk to you about Justin.  He says he gets a lot of double teams.  How as a coach do you help a player cope with the double teams?  What can you do as a team to take advantage of the double teams on Justin? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know earlier in the season Travis had some problems in games.  How is he progressing?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel like he's handled the whole situation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where do you feel like the offensive line is and what do you think this offensive line is capable of this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  What would be your assessment of the state of the offensive line?  How well do you think they're playing?</p>
<p>	Q.  It does. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is this surprising to you that halfway through the season, with the veteran group, that they're still having a lot of goods and bads, that it's not maybe more in the good column?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the play of DJ?  Talk about how he's emerged consistent for you guys. </p>
<p>	Q.  How important has that been for you to have the consistency at punting as opposed to last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  You have some versatile tight ends.  They can block, catch the ball.  How important has that been to your offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think that's a unique trait for a group this year or do you think this is something you guys have always had in the past that you're now starting to use?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) faced his team three times, could you pinpoint the hallmark of a Paul Johnston team? </p>
<p>	Q.  You've played now three times, this will be your third time against Navy in their triple option.  Do you feel like you and your coaching staff have gotten a better understanding of exactly what they do?  Do you think you're more prepared to defend it now than you were two years ago, the first time you faced them?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've been a part of two games now with Navy that were fairly close.  Obviously, last year was very close.  Year before Navy was leading till the end.  Based on that, are you really surprised it's gone on this long?  Do you figure it's inevitable eventually it's going to end, the streak? </p>
<p>	Q.  At what point did you think Darius Walker was going to be able to help you this season?  Was there a point during fall camp?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you think having his parents move to South Bend has helped him be able to contribute this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you feel you're different as a coach now than you were your first game here? </p>
<p>	Q.  Anthony, do you anticipate him playing this weekend?</p>
