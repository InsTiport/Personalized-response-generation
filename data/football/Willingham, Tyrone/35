<p>	Q.  Rutgers, obviously they are 1-9 and everybody looks at their record and dismisses them.  But in seeing and looking at their season, they seem to have their best performances against the better teams in their schedule, so, in that respect, I guess they are a dangerous team.</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the status of Hilliard and Gerome Sapp, have they recovered enough to play Rutgers, and do you think the bye week did allow the Irish to be refreshed and rejuvenated for these last two regular season games?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the key things you and your players that made the turnaround from last year to this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you do specifically to help with that transition?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your basketball counterpart said last night that he thought Notre  Dame's winning record in football has influenced other parts of the university, as well, including the basketball team; that recruits seem more eager to head to South Bend because of what you're doing on the football field.  Can you comment on that a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.  Moving to the West Coast offense, now that you've had nine or ten weeks to work with that group, what kind of percentage would you gauge that you have instilled from what traditionally you would have done in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Brandon Hoyte and his performance this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  What has Arnaz Battle meant to the team this year, and do you think he's fully completed his transformation from a quarterback position?</p>
<p>	Q.  Over the last few games you've struggled a little bit.  Do you have any concerns the team might be running out of gas with the long season? </p>
<p>	Q.  Chris Olsen, being a product from New Jersey, playing as a freshman and he wasn't recruited, how does he fit into the system and what does his future look like?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you give us a little further injury update going into this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Ryan Grant and his performance, is it surprising at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your first year at Notre  Dame, you are now contending for a national title.  Comparing yourself with Rutgers, what do you think the difference is between the two programs?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you first showed up at Notre  Dame, you did a lot to study the history, traditions, the lore of Notre  Dame.  Now you've been there for long enough to get a feel for it.  Do you feel that now you understand what it's all about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Quick question on Maurice Stovall.  I think he's the same age as a lot of high school juniors.  Can you assess his progress and also your willingness to play freshmen players?  It seems like most Top-10, Top-20 teams play freshmen very infrequently.</p>

<p>	Q.  Lloyd Carr was asked about the incident with the fan and he said that he does fear for his safety on the field.  Have you ever been in a position where you fear for your safety out there and is that a genuine concern for coaches and players these days?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that the color of the jerseys this weekend?  You said that you would decide later what color jerseys you would be wearing this weekend.  Has that decision been made?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's pretty bright but that's okay.</p>
<p>	Q.  You haven't decided that yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's always talk about how players mature as they get more experienced, and there's no substitute for experience.  Can you talk about how coaches mature as they gain experience  -- I think their head coach Gashanny (ph), he's the youngest coach in Division 1A.</p>
<p>	Q.  Courtney Watson, he's obviously gotten a lot of attention this year.  He's leading the team in tackles, despite missing two games.  Can you talk about his mental approach?  It just seems like he wanted it really badly this year.</p>
<p>	Q.  He also mentioned that when he made the transition, he felt like linebacker was one of the hardest positions to play in the defense because there's so much you're responsible for, and he said he feels like he's still learning the position.  Can you assess him as a linebacker and sort of just the growth you've seen in the year that you've had him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you looked at the film, and because of that you get the impression that you have respect for Rutgers talent, but sometimes 17-, 18- 19-year-old kids don't see that; they see archrival USC the following week.</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you blaming  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you do anything in particular to keep them focused on Rutgers and not looking ahead to USC?</p>
<p>	Q.  With that said, is there anybody on your staff or in your office that has been assigned any notebook on a computer, wherever, that has a scenario that what has to be , A, B, C, D, all the way down to Z probably for Notre  Dame to get into the Fiesta Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you plan a lot.   I just wondered  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Okay.  I need time on that.  (Laughter).  Each season that goes good or bad for a college football team, sometimes can be reduced down to sometimes a half-dozen plays; that if they go one way, it signals one thing or another.  It just comes down that way.  If you had to off the top of your head think of a half a dozen plays or three plays, whatever, is that the case this year with as success as you've had, and what are those top couple?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned Arnaz and a lot of the seniors, they get a lot of the headlines.  Jordan Black is a guy whose played lot of football at Notre  Dame.  What kind of season has he had and what are some things that he does and brings to your locker room or to your program that we don't see?</p>
<p>	Q.  He's also somebody who has been pretty quotable over his career which has been good for us.  Has that ever been a concern, that part of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned a minute ago about distractions in a week like this where you're playing a team that a lot of people overlook.  The past two games have been similar situations and they have not gone probably as well as you would have liked.  Do you change anything this week, since the previous would weeks maybe didn't go as well?  How do you approach trying to change?</p>
<p>	Q.  One thing that has not worked very well in recent weeks is the defense forced some turnovers and I think the goal was three turnovers a game, and the only game that's been accomplished in the past four was Florida State.  Do you think maybe the defense was worn down a little bit or are teams just doing a better job of handling the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you concerned at all about Ryan Grant's confidence at all?  It seems like after the Navy game, he was questioning himself.  Are you concerned about that at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think the problems that he had was mainly just mental?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Ryan Roberts?  He seems like he's somebody that goes about his job quietly.  From what I understand, people in the locker room say he's a bit of a character in there.  Could you just talk about that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Rutgers earlier.  Can you talk specifically about some of the problems they will pose for you this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Shane Walton being named a finalist, can you talk about how that speaks to not only him, but the defense and the program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you watch any games last Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Which ones?</p>
<p>	Q.  The offensive line, can you talk about the adjustments they had to make in learning a new system and how you feel like that process has gone this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like next year just by being in the same system there's going to be a natural maturation, there's going to be a natural progression?</p>
<p>	Q.  A few weeks before the BC game, I asked you about the team shift and the mental approach from being an underdog nobody, respecting them, to suddenly getting respect and having to play with that.  How that process is doing and how tough of a challenge is that for a coach to make that shift?</p>
<p>	Q.  Texas lost last week.  I think you're probably not one to pay a lot of attention to polls and BCS standings and so forth, am I right about that, or to a certain degree?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you think about that and where you stand right now, do you still think you're in line to achieve your goals this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you like that system we are operating under right now personally?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Carlyle's progress and what you think he's contributed to the team this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it too early to tell, but have you seen any difference in the way he helped engineer the comeback against Navy, will it give him a boost in confidence?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Darrell Campbell's development throughout the season, going from a consistent player to making plays as the season has worn on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there some specific points throughout the season where you saw him take the steps to become a playmaker?</p>
<p>	Q.  He is also a very quotable guy after games usually.  Can you talk about his personality?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch a video of Rutgers or when you show video of Rutgers to this team, do you show them a lot of the game against Miami early on and the first half to get their attention?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a difference in coaching up here in the north as opposed to down south in terms of preparation?  The Purdue game is played in sweltering heat; Rutgers, probably rain mixed with snow and temperatures in the 30s.  Do you do anything different?  I know you can't change the weather, but you have to play in the conditions that you're in, but as a coach do you do anything to make it more difficult because of the changing seasons and things like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  This Saturday is November 23, and the last time Rutgers was here, it was November 23 and it was also the last game that Lou Holtz coached at Notre  Dame Stadium.  Can you talk about his legacy, and now that was a very memorable day here, and what he did at Notre Dame and your relationship with him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to talk with him?</p>
