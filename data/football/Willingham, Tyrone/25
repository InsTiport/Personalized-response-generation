<p>	Q.  Inaudible   -- how will you make a decision on the quarterback?</p>
<p>	Q.  And right now based on the three games in what you've seen from both, what's your idea of which one gives you the best chance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Because it is difficult to have two people playing at quarterback, and Notre  Dame and actually Purdue have had some quarterbacks transfer over the last couple of years, what are some problems specific to the position in terms of recruiting and how you can retain players, since once the players establishes himself the guys behind may look elsewhere for an opportunity?</p>
<p>	Q.  Even with a fair opportunity, someone may decide to go elsewhere, does that affect how you approach recruiting or how you approach the idea of when a player might play to kind of keep them feeling like they are a part of the program instead of looking elsewhere?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year when the team was winning, you talked about fighting against human nature and how that success can work against a team.  What are your concerns now about how a team may react to a couple straight losses and what do you do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does your approach of the coaching staff change whether you are coming off a win or a loss in terms of the attitude of the team and how you focus toward the next week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coaches that have been here in the past have talked about concerns over losing a senior class.  Have you ever been in that situation as a head class, perhaps '98 when you were 3-8, Stanford was 3-8; was that a concern?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there ever a point where you would sacrifice playing experience for the sake of getting younger players playing time for the future?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you know what Bobby Morton's long and short-term status is and can you comment the performance of Mitchell and  Ryan?</p>
<p>	Q.  I believe Rob Woods and Harris, did that start as true freshman on the offensive line for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  What are specifically some of the things that are so difficult for a freshman to adapt to playing on the offensive line?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is John Sullivan close to being ready?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would it be fair to say that the only thing  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you worry at all, I think Coach Diedrick said after the game, the two corners will probably get the equal amount of time, do you worry whoever is playing will be getting less practice ?</p>
<p>	Q.  After watching the film, did you see any progress, have you seen progress the past two weeks in the offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you been surprised at how the offense has struggled?  Did you expect more from the offense than what you've seen so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the play of Victor Abiamiri?  He was starting mainly because of injury but he played real well?</p>
<p>	Q.  In depth chart he is officially back behind Justin this week, is it because Justin has played so well that Victor has not been there?</p>
<p>	Q.  After last year, record aside, I think the fans and many of us in the media perhaps overlook the fact that you are coaching players that were recruited by your predecessor.  How has that affected the team play?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have they adjusted to your so-called West Coast offense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised at any areas, offense or defense, specific players coming in that, perhaps players that excelled, you did not think would do as well or quite the opposite?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are there any areas where you are disappointed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will we see any different offense this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  We'd like to ask you the question as it relates to the morale of the team.  Many other groups have incentives for their players, like stars on the helmet, they do things that will give them recognition.  Is there any kind of incentive, they drop the ball, they miscue, is there any kind of incentive program that will be an outward display that maybe they will try to perform a little better to get that star on the helmet or get that special recognition?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said that sometimes there is a certain spark you see in a freshman, that they understand what's going on out there, is there a point in fall camp that maybe you saw that in Victor?</p>
<p>	Q.  Whether it be offensive lineman or defensive lineman, the natural physical strength, does he have maybe more of a gift in that regard than a lot of other freshmen lineman?</p>
<p>	Q.  As you go through this week at practice looking at the quarterback situation, is there a point where you feel like, "I need to have this done on Wednesday so I can give the starter a few more reps," is that something that you feel going comfortable to the end of Thursday and making a decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the players after the game, they seemed very much at a loss when the question comes up of why is this happening and how do you fix it.  They also seem very much at a loss.  As a coach, is that distressing to hear that the players don't seem to have answers, or do you look at that as "that is my job, I need to provide the answers?"</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the things the players have talked about, they are working harder, coming back with more focus, it seems like teams will say that after every loss.  Is there some point where you need something else, you need a new direction in terms of getting these guys on the right track?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Purdue, what you've seen on tape and maybe a little bit about their defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you lost to a team three years or four years in a row and the senior class looked at that game as, that's our last chance to beat Team X and how much of a motivating factor that can be?</p>
<p>	Q.  The offensive line this year, is the biggest challenge cohesiveness, not having games, is it technique?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you surprised that it has not come along a little bit better at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having a line that is having some of the growing pains like that have some new starters, does that affect the way that you look at your quarterback situation, for example, would you be more reluctant to throw an inexperienced quarterback in what you have an experienced line?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of pressuring other team's quarterback -- and the team has three sacks this year and last year had quite a few, I think 37 for the season  -- is it a matter of the front not getting more pressure, or are you being a little more conservative or team are just blocking you better at this point?</p>
<p>	Q.  There have been comments mostly from television commentators doing your games and guys in the studio and so forth that have the theory that the talent at Notre  Dame is not up to being a Top-25 team.  I wonder what your thoughts were on that observation?</p>
<p>	Q.  You don't have any thought?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've said that you play with what you have?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last thing I want to ask you about was your line coaches.  Can you talk about their strengths, and also, what the advantage of having two guys sharing those positions, what the advantage is?</p>
<p>	Q.  Having looked at the TV copy of the Michigan State game, it looked like your offensive line actually played a lot better than they have.  Do you think that that was the case; that this was the best game that your offensive line has had so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talking to Coach Diedrick after the fact, the offense seemed to open up a little more in the second half.  The thing that I guess threw me was he said:  "We went into half-time and made some adjustments."  But it looked like Michigan State had done of the same thing as far as blitzing the strong safety as Washington state or Michigan have done to you.  First, why would that be a surprise for you, and why would you have to make adjustments at half-time on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Diedrick had said he made adjustments at half-time and that's why the offense had opened up.  But since Washington State and Michigan state and USC and North Carolina State seemed to do the same thing defensively against you, I'm wondering why the adjustments had to be made at half-time, or did you just not expect Michigan State to actually attack you that way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Sure.  Absolutely.</p>
<p>	Q.  Sure.</p>
<p>	Q.  I wanted to ask, no coach really likes uncertainty at the quarterback position where you are going into a week with not knowing who was going to start, but it seems that this situation here is probably going to be helped by the fact that, at least when dealing with us, it seems like Carlyle and Brady really like each other and are both pulling for each other.  Does that make the situation a little bit easier?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, it seems especially true at Notre  Dame where there's so much scrutiny and so much expectations, do you have to guard against the players not really getting too down on themselves and not realizing they are only three games into the season and there's a lot of football to be played?</p>
<p>	Q.  The defensive line, other than the physical, and a lot of kids just aren't big enough to play that position as a freshman, what makes that position something that kids have to grow into mentally, why is it a position that usually  -- being that much more successful?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the quarterback position, Purdue arguably was sort of put back on the national map by Drew Brees, a guy that was overlooked by a lot of schools during the recruiting period.  He was considered too small and not strong enough, and yet he did amazing things not only at Purdue, but in the NFL.  How do you know a quarterback is going to be successful?  What is it that tells you that a quarterback has got that star quality?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about your young receivers and I was just wondering specifically about Jeff Samardzija, he has caught I think a pass in every game, how do you feel about his progress and do you think he's going to get more playing time in the future?</p>
<p>	Q.  There's been a lot of talk about the passing game, specifically the quarterbacks, can you comment on the running game, specifically whether the offensive line has failed to run block well enough, do you need to prove to opposing defenses your ability to throw the ball effective to open up the run?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen where the defenses are starting to cheat up, to cheat away from the receivers and more towards the running game?</p>
