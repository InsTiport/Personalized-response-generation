<p>	Q.  After reviewing the tape, can you talk about the problems the offense had?  It looked like especially the line seemed to have some problems?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was one of the major things only the two catches by wide receivers ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any one area that you're really focusing on this week, as far as something you think you really have to get done against Michigan? </p>
<p>	Q.  The decision-making by Holiday, was that a major problem?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does your dislike for Michigan breed naturally?</p>
<p>	Q.  With Watson expected to be back this week, if, say, Watson, Curry, Goolsby were your three best linebackers, would you consider moving one of them outside, or would you prefer a rotation to build the depth inside?</p>
<p>	Q.  You rotated three different guys at right guard against Purdue; did you go into the game with the plan to do that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Powers-Neal seems to have really good vision as a running back.  Is vision something that you can teach to a running back or does he have to pretty much be blessed with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the secondary  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a philosophy of being more aggressive   -- just let him catch it --</p>
<p>	Q.  Tomorrow is obviously, not another special day, but a dark day in this country.  You touched on what a privilege it was to play in New York so close to the day.  Will you talk to your team at all about September 11?</p>
<p>	Q.  There will be a fly-over Saturday, and I don't want to trivialize it, saying that you will use it to motivate the football team, but I think it will be emotional when the jets fly over the stadium?</p>
<p>	Q.  How typical is it that a coach comes in and doesn't try to install a scheme, no matter what the talent level, or what the talent is, and do you feel comfortable  -- or what makes you comfortable in meshing the two, the talent and the scheme?  You see a lot of coaches that they are going to force-fit their team no matter what.</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of it is oversimplifying to say that part of the problems that you had Saturday may have with regard to pass protection because these are linemen that are sort of used to being option-type run blockers  -- is that  --</p>
<p>	Q.  It appeared at times that Carlyle had trouble with some coverage recognition or things that they were doing, moving around quite a bit, did that show up on the film?  Would you say that is a problem that he had or was that part of the learning curve that you look for in this new offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your history and tradition with playing Michigan.  To what degree do you have any sort of memory of any Michigan rivalry, and to what degree you will incorporate that into your preparation?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the atmosphere and the reaction you've received and what the environment was like, your first home game?</p>
<p>	Q.  It should be at the opposing coach. </p>
<p>	Q.  The opportunity to go through this Big  10 gauntlet with Purdue, Michigan, Michigan State, the fact that you have been in the Big  10 and that you are familiar with this kind of competition does that help you to prepare? </p>
<p>	Q.  You had one experience against Michigan State, successful, 38-0, have you thought about going back into Spartan Stadium?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you have a defense that's been as proficient and scoring and as good at running to the ball, does that build its own momentum? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about, we'll say, we could have done this better or this was a mistake or whatnot, but when you go through a game like Purdue where the offense doesn't score and you still come out, you win does that build a type of confidence with the team to feel like, you know, we can find ways to win?</p>
<p>	Q.  On Saturday you told the team, don't believe the hype or something  --</p>
<p>	Q.  Something similar to that.</p>
<p>	Q.  Anyway, with Michigan coming in, both teams undefeated and things like that, have you addressed the team in terms of handling all of the outside distractions and the expectations on campus? </p>
<p>	Q.  Aside from his on the field contributions what has Gary Godsey brought to this team off the field in terms of leadership?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about his off-season work has impressed you on changing his body type to slim down a little bit?  It seems like he's put in the extra effort to fit in the best he can into your offensive scheme. </p>
<p>	Q.  He and a couple of the other offensive players mentioned that  -- as a coach when you look at the tape of the team that had 50 passing yards, what are some of the signs that might be order to explore?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you weren't here when Vontez came in, but he came in as a running back and then got moved to corner back later.  I wondered, when you have someone like that that shows so much potential on both sides of the ball, how do you weigh that equation out where you are going to stick him?  Do you find out what he likes, is it based on need?  What's your thought process?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned your eagerness for competition with Michigan, what qualities do you feel like you bring from your playing days into your coaching days? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you had a chance to talk with Dennis Green earlier this year, he said that you would have the best arm among the quarterbacks on this particular team; is that true? </p>
<p>	Q.  To your knowledge, is Marcus Wilson and McKnight going to be available? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you say a little bit what kind of mentality does a cornerback need to be successful? </p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you see in Vontez being able to dictate flow of a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do those two guys being in similar positions play off each other help on and off the field?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how guys need ego and showmanship; you touched on your players having class, how do you feel about that, going out with that swagger? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Baer (ph) talked about the defense not practicing as well as he would have liked coming off the big win, how do you guard against that as a coach?  And does a game like this help focus the a little bit? </p>
<p>	Q.  A few of the Michigan players talked about growing up Notre  Dame fans, players are on both teams are often recruited by both schools.  How does that factor into the players eagerness to compete, like you said, for this game this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Gerome Sapp talked earlier in the season about how he is trying to help the younger guys come along and get ready to play.  Obviously, he's shown on the field what he can do.  What's he done off the field to create that depth and experience?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Carr in his teleconference this morning that said the way this BCS works now as the ten-year contract goes through, they might want to reassess playing a school like Notre  Dame, any idea that schools will start to avoid you to help their ranking rather than play to you potentially help?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've never done anything like that; right? </p>
<p>	Q.  The amazing work ethic of your wonderful mother must have figured mightily in your development -- but who were other intimate relationships and folks you may perhaps have never met who influenced you and what were those lessons or influences? </p>
<p>	Q.  One would assume that maybe you know every step that a Jackie Robinson took through his trials and tribulations.  Am I presuming too much?</p>
<p>	Q.  As a former quarterback, wondering whether or not you pulled Carlyle aside this weekend and maybe had a quarterback to quarterback discussion? </p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan's players talked a lot about their excitement level, the renewal of the rivalry and that this is going to be one of the defining moments of the season.  Is that the same kind of feel that your players have right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned about the pride and tradition of the Notre  Dame program, what do you think you've brought to the program that maybe it's been lacking for the past couple of years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think your greatest task as new head coach is to return that glory?</p>
