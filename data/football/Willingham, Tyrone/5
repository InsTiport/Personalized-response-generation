<p>	Q.  Why do you think it is that Notre Dame seems to play better when its back is up against the wall?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked a lot about the need to play with confidence.  Is it tough playing with confidence with a team you lost to the past two years by 31 points each?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you lose close, you say there's one or two plays that caused it.  Both those games, you were close last year for two series, USC it wasn't close at all. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any extra excitement just because you're playing the No. 1 team?  Does that add a lot to this or is it already so big it doesn't really matter that that number is there?</p>
<p>	Q.  The fact that they're coming off a bye week, do you think that's kind of a wash, not a big advantage for you having the bye week?</p>
<p>	Q.  Usually you talk about trying to stop the run against a team.  This team is so balanced, which one do you focus on?</p>
<p>	Q.  On your coaching ballot, do you have them No. 1?</p>
<p>	Q.  We were speaking with some of the players yesterday, and they agreed that going up in the crowd during a game is probably not a real wise thing for them to do.  Brady said the numbers weren't in his favor, so he'd stay out of the crowd. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, have you had that specific conversation with the team with regard to how they deal with fans when they go on the road?  Obviously, they're going to be verbally abused.  They said they've been hit by batteries before.  Is that a specific discussion you've had with the football team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Three players were suspended this year, Dwight Stephenson, McConnell and (inaudible).  Can you give us an idea what their future is at Notre Dame?  Do you anticipate them back for the next semester, spring practice, next fall? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Holtz retired yesterday.  I was wondering about your paths crossing during your coaching career, just what your thoughts are on his coaching career. </p>
<p>	Q.  In-home visits start Sunday.  I was wondering if you could kind of relay to us what that whole period is like from a coach's standpoint. </p>
<p>	Q.  From a busy standpoint, how busy you are, a understand from the importance of the visits in the whole recruiting process standpoint. </p>
<p>	Q.  Logistically, going to a Bowl game, Bowl preparation, that's a good problem, but talk about the challenges you face with that, with having some coaches on the road and others trying to prepare for a Bowl game. </p>
<p>	Q.  We talked about the three-year factor at the beginning of the year.  Notre Dame coaches in their third year, Holtz, Devine, Ara.  Pete Carroll in his third year won a national championship.  You're in your third year.  You're 6-4.  What do you see as the difference between the route that Pete Carroll was able to take in building a national championship versus what you're going through now here at Notre Dame? </p>
<p>	Q.  Why was he able to build a national title in three years where you're at 6-4 right now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Reggie Bush is a young man that you tried to get here at Notre Dame.  It's obvious why when you see him play.  What is it that stood out about him during the recruiting process?  What do you see in his development now? </p>
<p>	Q.  Another thing that they're doing with Byrd back in the lineup midway through the season, they're utilizing the tight end even more than they did early in the season.  How much does that pose a threat to you, that weapon, and your defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does Norm's offense compare at all with any of the other offenses that you see throughout the year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any one where you see this is like Purdue's or BYU's?</p>
<p>	Q.  When talking about all the weapons that USC has on offense, can you talk a little bit maybe about the stress that that puts on the defense to try to make up for or keep everything in front of them, so to speak? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there some concern about just the ultimate match-ups, they'll probably put a linebacker on a tight end, you'll maybe have a linebacker trying to cover a runningback?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Derek Landri, kind of what he's meant to that defensive front?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a foregone conclusion, people were asking you about Bowl preparations, that Notre Dame will go to a Bowl regardless?</p>
<p>	Q.  And how about you as a coach?  Is it something that the team talks about?  Do you put it to a vote?  Do you say, "We're going if we get an invitation"? </p>
<p>	Q.  I also wondered in terms of your philosophy, would you like to play the best possible opponent, what I mean by that is the highest-ranked opponent?  Do you think that's the best thing?  There's a lot of people saying Notre Dame should be playing a middle-of-the-pack team, or should they play the highest-ranked team you can?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you evaluate, we're not to the end of the season yet, but pretty close, the offense, how you felt the offense developed or didn't this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  In your opinion, does the offense take a step forward next year naturally because you have so many returnees or do you tweak it?  What goes into the coaching process on that when you're saying, "Here is where we are, we're No. 75, we want to move up, how do we improve?" </p>
<p>	Q.  The numbers that were produced by your offenses at Stanford were pretty overwhelming at times, pretty consistently good.  Was the fact that you were coming into a similar system helped getting things moving faster there offensively than perhaps here?</p>
<p>	Q.  And then I would imagine that plays into the personnel that you inherited that maybe was better fit at Stanford?  I don't want to put words in your mouth. </p>
<p>	Q.  You're a more eloquent speaker than I am anyways. </p>
<p>	Q.  Has the learning curve here, in your opinion, taken longer than you expected or did you go in with a blank page and not have expectations about that? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned both last year and today about USC being a pretty talented team when you played them, or talented group of individuals, that they become a team.  Is there anything else in USC's rise that you can look at and say, "That was a great idea, I like what they're doing with that"?  Anything you can take from their model?  Are USC and Notre Dame such different models that there are not parallels?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of recruiting, do you feel that you need to have guys on your team, do you think it's important when you're recruiting, guys on your team that will eventually end up in the NFL?  Do you think that's an important component in terms of your talent level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a sense of whether Justin Tuck will be back next year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You used the word "inconsistent."  We played at times, quite a few times throughout the season, very, very well, which means, as I see it, the talent is there.  Why is the inconsistency, in your opinion?  Is it a fair question?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's right. </p>
<p>	Q.  And the USC game, what do you look at as Notre Dame's strong suit?</p>
<p>	Q.  You and I were talking at another tame, I indicated it must be really a thrill to knock off Michigan.  Your response to me, I'm paraphrasing was, "No, it wasn't a surprise.  We expected to win."  I think you're talking about attitude. </p>
<p>	Q.  Where along the line do you get the feel that the team attitude is going to be where you want it for Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  You can sense it?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you don't feel it's right, what do you do?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coaches like to say the extra month of practice for a Bowl really helps.  Could you understand a circumstance under which you wouldn't want to go to a Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you looked further if you prefer to go to the Insight Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  You addressed it a little bit, but what have you seen that Pete Carroll has done out there to get this thing turned around really so dramatically? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at some of the lines that are out there, I'm sure coaches don't pay a lot of attention, but a 23-point underdog, how much will you use the underdog as a coach to motivate the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk to me a little bit about Matt Shelton?  Could you kind of sum up Matt's contributions this year in his role with the Irish?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think Matt would have a chance to play football in the future?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much of a priority do you place on recruiting in Southern California?  In general, do you think it's harder to sell kids on Notre Dame these days because of the parity that exists in college football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you believe there are inherent advantages and challenges when it comes to recruiting at Notre Dame that are unique to other programs? </p>
<p>	Q.  In your three seasons at Notre Dame, have you found anything in particular that is a big challenge that is particular to coaching at Notre Dame as opposed to where you've been before? </p>
<p>	Q.  It seems to come with so much more attention.  Does that mean everything you do is scrutinized far more than anything you did at Stanford?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does that mean a season that doesn't include a national championship isn't necessarily going to be accepted by many people because that's what they've come to expect out of Notre Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  You're the most recent coach to beat USC at the Coliseum.  Have you seen that building has actually turned into a strong home field advantage for USC where it might not have been in the past?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you were at Stanford, there was no question what the big rivalry game was.  I know there have been a number of surveys by both USC and Notre Dame fans about what they think is the big rivalry game.  Is this the big rivalry came for Notre Dame, considering all of the rivalries they have? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how the schedule for USC with the three bye weeks kind of broke up the season.  At the other end, they have now their two big rivalry games back to back, then there's the whole BCS thing down the road.  How does that impact a team coming into a game like this where it's not just this game, it's all of that at the end of the season now?  How does that affect coaching a team on a week like this when you have other things to think about besides just the big game that's coming up? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you describe your emotions as a coach, the ups and downs from the time you went into Tennessee and played a great game there, won, to the aftermath of Pittsburgh, elations, the lows, how you felt in that arc?</p>
<p>	Q.  How significant is this game at USC in terms of everything you're trying to build, things you've been building?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to your days as a player at Michigan State, is there any USC-Notre Dame game that you remember, an OJ Simpson game or any game that comes to mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about how much attention USC's offense gets?  Its defense is a top five unit in every meaningful category.  What makes them so effective on that side of the ball?</p>
<p>	Q.  With your PAC-10 background, could you qualify the significance of being ranked fourth in total defense and second in scoring defense, but playing in the PAC-10, which is historically known for run-and-shoot type offenses?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're going against a defense that is statistically as sound as this one, how do you avoid your offense feeling maybe over-tentative, looking at this game as, "We need to play a perfect game"? </p>
<p>	Q.  As it relates to fifth-year seniors next year, what is the time frame for inviting guys back?  When do you make those decisions?  Post Bowl? </p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of making that sooner than later, what impact does that have on recruiting in terms of how many scholarships you're going to have to work with or not?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of behavior, since everybody in America has been talking about the Detroit situation, I was wondering, it flows into what you're trying to accomplish as an educator, what has gone through your mind the last couple days as you've seen all this unfold from a distance? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a sense of fan versus player?  You mentioned at the very beginning you teach non-retaliation. </p>
