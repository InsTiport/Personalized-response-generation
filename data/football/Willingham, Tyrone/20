<p>	Q.  A few years ago at Stanford you had the 3-8 season, I wonder if you learned something during that time about yourself and about how kids react to adversity that you can apply to the situation that you're in right now?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yesterday on -- inaudible -- made the following statement, for those of us who actually  -- inaudible -- you knew that this was going to be a down year because it was not going to play  -- do you remember that conversation with him and how would you assess that statement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you consider this team more lacking in discipline than, say, last year's team or other teams that you've coached, not in behavior off the field, I don't mean that, but just the lacking of the disciplinary things that you need in order to succeed?</p>
<p>	Q.  People on the outside would say, for example, that the 12 men on the field, or rather, the 12 men in the huddle after the time-out, that's an example of lacking in discipline.  Would that fall under that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Every game counts obviously for one win or one loss, but considering the nature of this that Notre  Dame has won 39 straight against Navy and the fact that you are 2-6, does this game then take on even greater importance to you and this team because of the situation that you're in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could that have been me?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do they play for right now other than pride, is there something out there, a goal, practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think you said that one thing you need to do is changes without working it  -- do you expect to have this week --</p>
<p>	Q.  In a game like that, where you're trying to do what you can to score, do you ever question yourself as to go over field goals  -- is there such a stigma or do you not worry about that and you just want to try to get as many points as you can to try to get somewhat into the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seemed like a number of third downs, Brady threw about 30 yards short of the first down marker.  Is that a play that there was nobody else open and that was the last person to go to, or was that a play you're depending on a receiver being able to make the catch and get the extra few yards?</p>
<p>	Q.  The win streak, even in the past years, it's weighed more heavily on Navy.  Do you think this year it might weigh more heavily on your team to keep that streak going?</p>
<p>	Q.  It looked like some players came out injured, can you talk about Bobby, Molinaro --</p>
<p>	Q.  And Molinaro?</p>
<p>	Q.  And if you were to actually lose if a game like, they specialize in run defense and that could be a big concern this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  And at this point is that more troubling than maybe another game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a step back and talk about what the season has been like for you personally especially compared to last season when you were 8-0 and now you are 2-6, what has it been like for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about the pressure, is it building or do you ignore it regardless of what your record says?</p>
<p>	Q.  Any bright spots with the 2-6 record?</p>
<p>	Q.  What names jump out, young people?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking at  the Florida State game, did anything surprise you in term of their offense or defense you were not anticipating?</p>
<p>	Q.  What you've scene of the Navy highlights, how do they compare with any other teams this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you maintain your cool on the field, you're so  -- you have to be frustrated when an easy pass is dropped and 12 men are in the huddle or whatever, but we never see you slam your hat on the field or appear to be frustrated, I'm sure you are, how do you manage your anger?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Nick Setta still out this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  The thing that stood out to me on offense was the consistent inability of the receivers to get past the first down marker on third down plays.  Does your offense call for a lot of catch-and-run situations in that or why aren't people more cognizant of the first down yardage they need?</p>
<p>	Q.  The other thing, and maybe this is just my observation, it seems to me that you're not running as many crossing patterns as you did that were effective in the earlier part of the schedule, with people, receivers going from one side of the field to the other.  Has there been any change in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  On Saturday you said you thought this team was headed in the right direction.  Can you elaborate on some of the signs or signals that you see that indicate that this team is moving where you want it to be moving?</p>
<p>	Q.  You had the toughest schedule in the nation according to the most recent statistics, however, you have not really seemed to bring that up as an excuse for the record.  Why is that, and do you feel the strong schedule is a factor for the 2-6 record?</p>
<p>	Q.  Lastly what were your thoughts on the numerous fans that left the game early on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  I've heard you talk about Julius Jones on this offense, seems to be not necessarily the only guy but really the most prominent guy that really can make a play or make a guy miss or maybe make up for a miscue from another position or missed block, something of that nature.  What do you see from him just on the sidelines; do you think that's a fair assessment of his ability?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game, you described him as a guy that you just need to see a very small amount of daylight a very small hole and he can do the work from there; is that something you coach or just something a back has?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think the average yard for carries between Julius and Ryan is a difference of about 1.9.  What has maybe prevented Julius from taking on more of the lion's share of the carries?</p>
<p>	Q.  Looking back at the Navy game last year when Gerome Sapp went down in practice and the secondary seemed to struggle a little bit to curtail their option, what do you take from last year's game and apply it to this year in terms of understanding their system or getting the secondary to understand the system; are there new wrinkles to it this year, or is it exactly the same where you kind of know their facilities?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that maybe the biggest struggle last year, players maybe not understanding their responsibilities as much as maybe you needed?</p>
<p>	Q.  And how do you coach that this week any differently with that much younger secondary than what you had last year obviously with Dwight and Quinn and Lionel all new to this?</p>
<p>	Q.  You played USC and Florida State, they are 2, 3  in the BCS rankings --</p>
<p>	Q.  What is a more difficult match-up, do you think?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about your red zone offense and maybe what's going on there that isn't happening or what's going on that's not allowing you guys to be as successful?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you attribute to youth at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  First off, not that  -- I'm not trying to say that he was solely responsible for the offense's struggles, but with Brady Quinn struggling like he was Saturday, was there any thoughts of putting Carlyle Holiday in there because he is the back-up quarterback and he has not played for a while.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it something that's thought about a lot because he really has not played in I guess over a month and he is one play from being in there?</p>
<p>	Q.  In the current NCAA statistics Notre  Dame is 117th out of 117 teams in passing efficiency.  Can you react to that, does that surprise you or what?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering also if you were considering starting Carlyle against Navy rather than Brady, especially because Brady has such a low completion percentage.</p>
<p>	Q.  Bob Morton was another lineman who was taken off the field in Saturday's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you watch Brady play, it seems, is he settling too much for underneath routes, it seems like he's glancing downfield but then quickly throw underneath, is that something the defenses are doing, or is he settling a little too quickly for that sort of dump-off pass?</p>
<p>	Q.  What needs to change, I mean you talked about execution and whatnot, but how do you get out form the bottom of that pass efficiency statistic?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are the players still comfortable with the job Brady is doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is Brady Quinn going to start this Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  Two-thirds of the way through this season, I think Notre  Dame and Alabama have combined for a dozen losses, traditional college football powers and everyone does talk about the parity in college football, especially after the '85 scholarship rule.  Can you compare from back in the day when you were playing, having played at a traditional Big  10 power school, kind of, you know, just give us a sense of how the landscape has changed, how it is these days, places like Fresno State and Oregon State can compete with the Notre  Dames and Alabamas of the world?</p>
<p>	Q.  We hear a lot about how football has overtaken baseball as the most popular sport in the States.  Do you find when you're recruiting that football is that much more popular now than when you were playing high school football?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do schools and programs adjust their expectations, is it unrealistic to expect certain programs to keep winning championships year after year, is it more a case of that there are going to be more competitors on the landscape and it's going to be harder to do it just numbers-wise?</p>
<p>	Q.  For the guys that are red-shirting, is it hard for them because they wasn't really contribute in games and how frustrated have you seen them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last year after the game in Baltimore you said your team was not as focused as it should have been, do you think that will not be a problem after Navy almost won that game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it difficult when you've beat a team 39 times a row that they are a threat or does the situation you're in preclude that?</p>
<p>	Q.  I notice, and I'm not on this teleconference every week, but an hour of questioning and very few questions have been on this upcoming game, but so much on the big picture of your program; is that what you deal with on a weekly basis, so many issues that so many people want to know about, is it hard to sometimes focus in on the upcoming opponent?</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of differences do you see between this year's Navy team and the one you've had to prepare for and play last year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see that more on the offensive side of the ball or defensively?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to last year, was that 8-0 start sort of a blessing and a curse that it raised expectations so much?</p>
<p>	Q.  The after affect of it, everybody is saying Notre Dame is back after that  --</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as building a foundation, can you state  in three years or five years where you are and how many years  --</p>
<p>	Q.  But till you have your recruits in and your base that you feel, would that be a fair evaluation of how you are doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Till you have your people in place and your recruits, obviously this is pretty much only your first class in there right now.</p>
<p>	Q.  What you said about the possible quarterback change, what made you decide --</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you thought about playing Carlyle?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why didn't you ultimately?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you look at all of the guys you recruit as yours as opposed to one class?</p>
