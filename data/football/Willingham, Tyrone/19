<p>	Q.   Your record at Notre Dame now in single-digit games is 9 and 3.  To what do you attribute the ability to win those close games?</p>
<p>	Q.   Largest lead this year I think is only 7 points.  Does that inhibit the growth of a football team?  In other words, it prevents you to play maybe some of the backups as much as you would like in order to develop them as the season progresses?</p>
<p>	Q.   What is Anthony Fasano's status?  Will he be available to play this weekend?</p>
<p>	Q.   BYU, do they look familiar at all in a sense that they kind of struggle, hot and cold defensively, and had a disappointing season from what they expected at the beginning of the year?</p>
<p>	Q.   Julius has had a season where it has been obviously a couple of really good games but couple of games where he hasn't had much production.  Is it because of the situations you think more than his ability, I mean, that you have been forced to pass more in some of those games than giving him the opportunity?</p>
<p>	Q.   Seemed like in the game Saturday you just decided to go with Julius rather than go back and forth.  Is that something that you expect to do for the rest of the season or is that just a one game --</p>
<p>	Q.   In this game you are not going in with the idea of Julius carrying the ball more, it's whoever is playing well, whoever seems to be doing well will get the  --</p>
<p>	Q.   Ryan is not healthy?</p>
<p>	Q.   Have you been impressed by Julius's attitude this year?  I know one of the -- in the past, it's not always been the strong point of him, but have you been impressed with the role he's taking with the team?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is it first by example or is he one of the vocal people in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.   Talk a little bit about teams -- especially in the Navy game a lot of the times they were winning the field position battle.  I think they have had 7, 8-yard edge every time they get the ball.  How big a concern is that?</p>
<p>	Q.   Kind of piggybacking off of that a little bit, I mean, what do you think about your special teams' play as of late?</p>
<p>	Q.   Also in the last couple of weeks it's been noticeable that Julius Jones has moved off of the kick return team.  What has been the reason for that?</p>
<p>	Q.   I'd like to ask you a question as to what you think this win does for you, the team, and what kind of spiritual emphasis has this win brought because there's a lot of prayers been going up for a win like this?</p>
<p>	Q.   Talk a little bit about the offensive line development; especially in pass protection against Washington State you guys gave up seven sacks and have not given up one in the last three games.  How much is that just a matter of maturation?</p>
<p>	Q.   I might be able to do that. </p>
<p>	Q.   I think a lot of times when people ask a young quarterback about going into a system, speed of the game usually comes up first.  Is that true for a young offensive line as well, do you think the game slows down a little bit?</p>
<p>	Q.   Dan Stevenson, his status?</p>
<p>	Q.   Maurice, I think everyone had high expectations for him.  You look at him he's 6'5:  215, 220, 225.  What maybe has prevented him from, you know, being kind of that difference-maker type guy that I think people believed he could be or would be this year?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is that a situation where it would be more as much  a mental situation than certainly a physically one?</p>
<p>	Q.   Coaches may look at players, some guys need a kick in the butt; some guys need to be kind of brought up slowly; some need a pat on the back.  What is kind of Maurice's personality in that regard in how you kind of coach him up through this tough time?</p>
<p>	Q.   Last week you indicated that Nick Setta would be ready perhaps in two, three weeks.   Assuming he is and looking ahead to the end of the season and the success of Fitzpatrick who -- any likelihood you would continue to use Fitzpatrick even if Setta is healthy?</p>
<p>	Q.   Foot?  Leg?  Ankle?  What can you tell us?</p>
<p>	Q.   What was the problem with the field there, exceptional number of people -- players losing their footing last week?</p>
<p>	Q.   Any way to practice for that?</p>
<p>	Q.   How important is the crowd, home crowd in your support?</p>
<p>	Q.   The report of 300 or so students turning their tickets in before the Navy game, did that surprise you to support you and how did the team react?</p>
<p>	Q.   Maybe that's good.   If indeed that happened, I know it would be hard to police something like that, but suggest that perhaps can't do it with the seniors, but next year deny ticket privileges to those who did that, what would your reaction be to that?</p>
<p>	Q.   You indicated last week I think I understood you to say some of the other teams in the country and the recruiting process promised recruits that they would play.  Does that happen to Notre Dame and what is the recruiting process, anybody promised if they sign with Notre Dame, they will play?</p>
<p>	Q.   Maybe give us a brief comparison of the teams coming up, strength against weakness for this week?</p>
<p>	Q.   Brady Quinn the rest of the season I know you have said repeatedly since he's been the starter that you like the job he's doing and you have seen good things from him.  Are there any specific things you would like to see him work on and improve in these final few games of the season?</p>
<p>	Q.   I know ball control and keeping the ball is big every week, but you mentioned BYU might be the most pass-happy you face this year.  Is it more important to run the ball and to keep control of the ball and keep control of time of possession in this type of game so your defense doesn't get worn out?</p>
<p>	Q.   Given DJ's performance this year, coming in and what happened on Saturday, is that the kind of kick at the end of a game that could make or break a kicker's career?</p>
<p>	Q.   Knowing DJ, how do you think -- what side of the equation would he have fallen?</p>
<p>	Q.   Last year at this time you had four veterans in your secondary.  This year with the injury to Glenn Earl, your experience has gone way down.  Why is it so important essentially in the secondary where so much is being out there alone and sort of being able to react to things and figure out what you need to do on the side?</p>
<p>	Q.   Talk about how important getting a win is in learning the process; how important it is for the kids to see the fruits of all that effort they have put in in practice and kind of see that it  -- see it come back to them?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is Glenn Earl is out for the season now and can you tell us any other of your starters that are ailing and perhaps miss this game or the rest of the games?</p>
<p>	Q.   A question about recruiting if you can address it.  Doesn't seem to be an enormous amount of running back depth in the program right now.  Is running back going to be a point of emphasis in recruiting and have you seen enough of Travis Thomas to -- for the scout team or whatever to comment on how he might be doing?</p>
<p>	Q.   I am curious, obviously Senior Day you will have a group of seniors playing their last game at Notre Dame stadium.  I am curious how have the seniors sort of handled the adversity of this season?  Have they all stuck together and done pretty good job handling it?</p>
<p>	Q.   Can you share some of the goals you still talk with the seniors about for this season or is that something you want to keep between yourselves?</p>
<p>	Q.   Will you do anything different in the game or in preparation for the game being that it is the last time around for these guys?</p>
