<p>	Q.  How do you assess this recruiting class?  How would you describe how it all came together? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going into recruiting, what was your focus?  You talk about a good class.  I'm assuming you accomplished what you set out to do.  What was your main objective going into recruiting?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  I think we counted 33 visits, which is probably the lowest amount of official visits to come to Notre Dame.  Did you anticipate having more visits and they just didn't end up coming in or were you confident you could get such a high percentage of that 33 to sign? </p>
<p>	Q.  What is the maximum amount you can bring in?  Is it 56?</p>
<p>	Q.  You were accustomed at Stanford to bring in an amount about like this?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rex Hogan was (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Will you pursue a full-time recruit coordinator, somebody with a title similar to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  With such a specific number of targets, do you have contingency plans towards the end of the process where if you're not getting the commitments or expecting the signing that you hoped for, do you have other directions you could go or would you rather take a smaller class?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there any kid that you weren't sure of, the name popped up, you were relieved or didn't know they were coming in?</p>
<p>	Q.  Who is that you're talking about?</p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of times at Notre Dame, the day of signing, (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Comment on your philosophy, approach to recruiting players who have verbally committed to another school. </p>
<p>	Q.  What is your approach or philosophy to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Our perception is that people from the south, there is (inaudible)?  Have you found that to be true?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) the ability to play other positions, maybe more so than with other classes.  When you start out targeting players, was that an emphasis?</p>
<p>	Q.  You signed two offensive linemen.  Did you want to sign more than that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Were you looking to sign more than two?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) the way he fits into the defense?</p>
<p>	Q.  Greg Olsen has a reputation as one of the best players in our country.  Can you talk about the background with his family, his brother being here?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  The last couple of years in recruiting here, the final day has been kind of a disappointment, losing players.  The last couple days, you really closed out very strong. </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible). </p>
<p>	Q.  You picked up four players in the last two days.  What was this last week like as far as being on pins and needles?  What was it like for you, this last week?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  How important was it to attract a player like Geoff Price?  Do you look at that as more of a luxury this season?  What was your approach to that?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) reserve for transcripts?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would that be new ground here?  Are you concerned with that?  Is that something you have discussed?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would one of those include Julius Jones for next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  When would you know for sure he's coming back?</p>
<p>	Q.  On this list every year there's a couple mysteries, (inaudible) into the defensive line. </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have a kicker coming in?</p>

<p>	Q.  I know you said something about the true strength of this recruiting class will be evident two or three years from now.  Obviously you hone your skills at judging talent, but talk about the inherent uncertainty in trying to project what a 16-year-old or 17-year-old will play like five years down the line. </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm wondering if you got a sense around the nation, how much excitement was back at Notre Dame?  Maybe that's why some of these players were signing with you, their confidence had been sort of restored. </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't like to isolate on individuals.  Is there a position or any of these kids that you could see, because of their skills and the need you have, that might be able to move into the two deep say in the defensive backfield, for instance?</p>
<p>	Q.  Trying to get the all-around athlete, it looks like a lot of these players excelled in other things, from boxing to track, basketball. </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to specifically ask you about a couple of local kids.  What led you to recruit Jeff Samardzija?  What qualities did you see in him?  Also the kicker, Carl Gioia?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much do you rely on your current players to give you feedback on the recruiting process?</p>

<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Was there anything consistent this year in terms of that you had to address, whether it's negative, (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  From a football standpoint, did you have to address the offensive problems over the last two years?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  When a recruit comes to you and says they're not feeling as comfortable as they thought, do you wish them well, or do you try to resell them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Recruiting is more than just a 12-month process, you initiate contact early.  Can you tell me, were there guys that were on your target list while you were still coaching at Stanford? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you won't know about this class until two or three years down the road.  Is it almost comical to you how people rate these classes, speak so definitively about this team has the best class, guarantee their future?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)? </p>
