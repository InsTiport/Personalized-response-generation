<p>	Q.   Coach Baer made a comment about a player not being in the game and not being aware of that.  What is the normal procedure for that?  Do the position coaches decide who is in the game and the coordinator doesn't, tend to that and  then they communicate to him?  How is that handled?</p>
<p>	Q.   Wouldn't necessarily be uncommon if he wasn't sure of the specific personnel in the game?</p>
<p>	Q.   Do you think the players are at stage where they might be fighting the emotion of feeling sorry for themselves with the way the season is going?</p>
<p>	Q.   Your interception total is quite low, which is three for the year.  I know you played a lot of man-coverage on Saturday which makes it many times difficult to get interceptions because your back is to the quarterback.  Do you then try to run more zone coverage just so you can put yourself in position to make interceptions or is that to force turnovers or is that completely dictated by what the opposition does?</p>
<p>	Q.   Jerome Collins played quite a bit.  Can you comment on his progress and do you see his playing time increasing?  Coach Baer had indicated after the game that he was pleased with the way he had performed Saturday.</p>
<p>	Q.   What are his assets?   I know mainly like during the preseason, you are looking more as a guy that can rush the passer, but has he developed into some other areas as well?</p>
<p>	Q.   The white shoes Saturday, was that an emergency situation with your footwear or how did that come about?</p>
<p>	Q.   You described last week as a must-win.  What does that make this week?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is that one of the things you talk about now that you can't be -- you can have an effect on who does win the National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.   After last year's game it seemed like they were a team that was in disarray, changed quarterbacks, they really seemed confused by what you did.  Notre Dame had reestablished itself as a power.  What has happened since then?  It just seems like they have got  -- it switched --</p>
<p>	Q.   Are you convinced that this team is a team that you can knock off a team like Florida State?</p>
<p>	Q.   Chris Rix last year obviously you guys did a good job of keeping him from not doing much at all.  This year he is obviously playing well.  What do you see that he's doing differently?</p>
<p>	Q.   Courtney Watson, I assume you think he's the best linebacker in college football.  What makes him that?</p>
<p>	Q.   What kind of leadership does he provide?  Is he somebody that talks a lot or is he more by example?  What type of leadership does he provide?</p>
<p>	Q.   What is the state of health of Darrell Campbell right now?</p>
<p>	Q.   Ten years ago the last time Florida State came into South Bend,  Notre Dame was kind of at the height of its program in recent years.  What do you see is the state of the program in comparison to where it was then and what would you see to take it back to that status?</p>
<p>	Q.   When you look at your running game right now and how it is performing and the inconsistency, how do you explain maybe what is going on there?</p>
<p>	Q.   You are saying then maybe sometimes it's the score that's maybe taking  --</p>
<p>	Q.   Talk a little bit about the kick coverage, kickoff and punt returns, what has been some of the difficulties there in executing?</p>
<p>	Q.   I think in the BC game there were four instances where a kickoff or punt required Notre Dame to make a tackle.  D. J. Fitzpatrick wound up making two of those tackles.  How troubling is that not only the philosophy in terms of punt coverage but also knowing that Nicholas Setta is hurt already and you probably, I would imagine, you don't want your kicker out there to make tackles out there?</p>
<p>	Q.   Freddie Parish IV, he played a lot defensively earlier in the season; that seemed to have tapered off a little bit.  I am curious what maybe some of his struggles  -- things that have gone on that prevented him from seeing much time defensively and what he needs to do get back in that rotation?</p>
<p>	Q.   With Glenn Earl banged up, does that kind of move him up a little bit or is he working more specifically only at the free spot where he's still behind?</p>
<p>	Q.   What do those receivers to, maybe they are a little bit better against BC whether it's just making plays, getting open, things of that nature, that allows them to have statistical success?</p>
<p>	Q.   Any improvement to the receivers like Sean or does this team kind of play to them, being open more vertically?</p>
<p>	Q.   Rhema is a guy has made plays for you all season.  What do you say to him after an instance like in the first half or he has a drop or -- he knows as well as anyone that he could have easily taken that all the way.  What do you say to him to kind of like snap him back into it, to have him forget about it and move on?</p>
<p>	Q.   The last few games the offense has either been heavy off passing or heavy off running, or a combination of both.  What do you look at this Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is Florida State compare to any other teams you have played against this year?</p>
<p>	Q.   What is the status on Nicholas Setta?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is there a likelihood he will play before the season is out?</p>
<p>	Q.   Take us through scenario of an overtime game, let's say there's a change from weather conditions or who you are playing, in terms of whether you prefer to have the ball first or second and if so, or if not, why?</p>
<p>	Q.   Bobby Bowden now is the winningest coach in Division 1-A.  Talk about what you see from afar as the attributes that he's been able to bring to  build  such consistency there?</p>
<p>	Q.   When you talk about stability, it seems like ten years like Bobby Bowden's or Joe Paterno's that people who have been in a place for a long time seem more and more rare in Division 1-A.  What are some of the demands -- I guess with the way the demands or pressure has changed on coaches at that level that maybe diminishes how long someone stays at one place?</p>

<p>	Q.   You talked a little bit about Courtney Watson and his role as a leader as a linebacker.  Can you talk a little bit about how Brandon Hoyte's game has perhaps improved?  I think at the start of the season some of the coaches were talking about how Brandon Hoyte needed to be a little bit more polished.  Talk about the progress you've seen in his game?</p>
<p>	Q.   How much has somebody like a Courtney Watson and a Derek Curry done to bring Brandon along in terms of tutoring him on the field?</p>
<p>	Q.   Also you were talking about the kicking game earlier.  A lot of times when a program loses a quarterback to graduation, a tailback, a defensive end, people sit up and take notice.  Talk about the effect of losing a veteran like Joey.  I think sometimes from the outside people don't notice the value of the punter.  But a guy where he can place the ball where you need to, who can hit spots, who can create  -- talk about some of those things that a veteran punter can do.</p>
<p>	Q.   I was looking through the Florida State coaching roster and Coach Bowden has had some coaches that have been with him long time   - one 27 years, 20 years, 18 years.  Talk about the kind of stability that that brings.  I mean, I guess you have had Kent with you from the start at Stanford.  Talk about the rapport that can build up and how does that improve and affect the football team when the coaches have that?</p>
<p>	Q.   You are not spending as much time coaching your coaches?</p>
<p>	Q.   Dove-tailing on that previous question about length of service, could you see yourself coaching to the age of 75 and do you think we'll see any such coaches like Bobbie Bowden or Joe Paterno coaching that long?</p>
<p>	Q.   Yes.</p>
<p>	Q.   In your two seasons at Notre Dame you of sort of experienced the highs that come with the success at this job and sort of the lows this year with what happens when your team doesn't meet expectations.  How do you, as a coach, with your coaching staff, really keep an even keel and just go about your job the same way in both situations?</p>
<p>	Q.   You mentioned before how you think this football team has a good opportunity to upset one of the better teams in the country.  How much of a role do you want to see the crowd play into that game?  How important is that going to be Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.   Following up on that question with the crowd and emotions, how much do you play on Notre Dame's mystique with your kids?</p>
<p>	Q.   Different question, what has happened defensively that that was clicking so well last year for you and maybe isn't right now?</p>
<p>	Q.   Is Glenn Earl ready to go?</p>
