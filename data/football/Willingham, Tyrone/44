<p>	Q.  You seem to be avoiding the whole black coach thing, but you have two black coaches meeting in a high-profile game, and I think you've been in one other game, is there anything significant at all about the fact that you are coaching against a black coach this week?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the opportunity to go 4-0, the best start for Notre Dame since   --</p>
<p>	Q.  First, what would that mean?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you reminisce a little bit about your playing experience in this series against Notre  Dame, I think it was in'76?</p>
<p>	Q.  How did the Michigan State/Notre  Dame rivalry compare to, say, Michigan State and Michigan?</p>
<p>	Q.  Darryl Rogers (ph) said that he thought you were a coach before you were a coach.  Did you always have those kind of aspirations?</p>
<p>	Q.  And besides the obvious, going 4-0, what does this mean to you, what does going back to East Lansing mean to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  No plans of getting together with any of those old friends back there?</p>
<p>	Q.  How good did the goal of becoming a head coach at your alma mater compare to being a head coach at Notre  Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  At Stanford, how serious was that a consideration, looking at that job, if it was open ?</p>
<p>	Q.  Last week after the game, wonder if you had any opinion about the Carlyle Holiday touchdown that he fumbled; that he didn't have possession when he crossed the end zone, wonder what the aftermath has been?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have an opinion on college going to instant replay?</p>
<p>	Q.  If the shoe had been on the other foot, if they had fumbled like that and won the game in a close manner, would you address that with your team, or does that fall under the category of nothing that you can do about or change; and so therefore, you wouldn't dwell upon it?</p>
<p>	Q.  You wouldn't even discuss it with them, the impact of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you went up 22-17, you're up five, you chose to go for the two-point conversion that failed, if you kick the extra point there and then moments later Nick Setta kicks a field goal and you're up nine, two scores, that's an easy second guess in retrospect  --</p>
<p>	Q.  When you make that decision to go for two, is it based upon how you feel your team is playing and the chances of kicking that field goal then to take the nine-point lead, or is it just an automatic when you're up by five that you're going to go for two?</p>
<p>	Q.  The swinging gate, is that what you call it  --</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the philosophy there, when you line up like you do and shift over, what are you looking for?  Who is going to get the snap?  What are you looking for  -- you probably won't tell me that  --</p>
<p>	Q.  What are you looking for now that you're going to shift over and kick?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about things changing about the time you were make your decision to go to school.  If you had not gone to Michigan State, where would you have gone and how might your life is have been different?</p>
<p>	Q.  Toledo?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talk about three coaches at Michigan State that you had involvement with, Kenny Stoles (ph), Darryl Rogers and then an assistant for Buddy Waters?</p>
<p>	Q.  Where there a lot of people in East Lansing rooting for your team to win Saturday?  When you were in Minnesota, or even at Stanford, how much attention did you pay to what Michigan State was doing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything that you have to do to guard against the team getting too excited?  Do you have to do anything in regard to preparation so that "five straight" does not become something to focus on?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wondered if you can talk about Kent Baer, when he was your position coach and then what you see and saw him that made you want to elevate him to coordinator?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you came from Stanford to Notre  Dame, were the schemes pretty much the same, or did you feel like he incorporated a little bit of what they were doing here at Notre  Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  Derek Landri, can you comment on how he's progressing physically and if he's getting closer to playing or practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if a great Heisman Trophy candidate would emerge from a Notre  Dame team, if you would look at that as a positive, or being a team-oriented guy, if you would think that maybe that wasn't such a great thing?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you kept track of your old Stanford team, looking to see scores or stats?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said several times that your concern going into the game is on your team, but with the way Michigan State lost at home last week, I would imagine you would expect them to really come up with a  -- to be ready to play and fired up for this game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Ryan Grant, I know you said the other day that he's been getting steadily improved and getting better and better.  In what areas has he made the most improvement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Given the short period of time, do you feel like the team has taken on facets of your personality?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's the most recent thing has given you a sense of acceptance by the Notre  Dame community, and is there something that's happened since your arrival that you still feel like an outsider?</p>
<p>	Q.  In terms of acceptance, I understand when you first came here you went through a drive through at McDonald's and -- inaudible -- does that still happen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most recent one?</p>
<p>	Q.  The defense has been, obviously, one of the strong points, in particular the secondary, but what type of things does Michigan State problems present especially with their passing game and in a receiver like Rogers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Recently you mentioned that you were hoping that Justin could be a weapon of sorts, how is he progressing?</p>
<p>	Q.  After the game he was pretty forthright, saying that he's a long way from being able to play the run at this point.  What are some of the things he needs to do to make himself a little bit more complete?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you guard against a letdown, or your own team looking ahead as maybe Michigan State happened to last week?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've talked a lot about how when players are injured, you just want the next player to step in and continue playing.  When a guy like Jeff Faine limps off the field and Carlyle Holiday gets banged up like he did in the game, what goes through your mind in that situation where the backups have not had as much a chance to play?</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you do to prepare them when you they don't have as much opportunity to play any games or get the reps in practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  And can you talk about how the challenge that Coach Diedrick had coming in, with having to install a new system with players who are not familiar with it and the job he's done?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know you don't like to single out one group, but the offensive line had two false starts and three holding penalties on Saturday, and false starts have been a problem all year.  Have you been able to determine a reason for that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rashon Powers-Neal got hit in the first quarter, got up, and didn't come back, do you know what happened to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did he?</p>
<p>	Q.  It wasn't  -- just checking.  It wasn't like a concussion or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Baer was quoted as saying even though you know all about Notre  Dame from a distance, when he got here, he was still surprised at the intensity of it.   What did you learn coming here that you could not have even from the outside?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you remember the moment that that struck you?  Were you standing someplace?  Was it walking on campus?  Was there any one thing that crystallized?</p>
<p>	Q.  Seems like you are always described as a private individual.  Can you give us any insight into what you would be doing during the rest of your time  -- most of it is devoted to football right now, but when you go home on Saturday night, do you pick up a book, a movie, what are other things you would be doing besides looking at film?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there a reason why 6:30?</p>
<p>	Q.  That's about it?</p>
<p>	Q.  I don't know.  Thanks.</p>
<p>	Q.  What kind of player were you at Michigan State?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>	Q.  Why were you terrible?</p>
<p>	Q.  What's your feeling on both recruiting two-sport athletes or athletes who excel in football or other sports, and having several with you this season?</p>
<p>	Q.  And also, you said you were a terrible football player, but in baseball, I notice, if this is right, that Michigan State figures had you for 11 assists as a junior.  Would those all have been outfield assists?  That's an extraordinary number.</p>
<p>	Q.  Did they think a small guy could not have a rocket arm and throw anybody out?  Were they running on you?</p>
<p>	Q.  If my math is right, the six sacks that your quarterback got and is 15 rushes, that sounds like about 21 hits.  How concerned are you about the number of hits Carlyle is taking in these games?</p>
<p>	Q.  In your mind, how do you chalk up those sacks, to the rush or your pass protection or Carlyle's decision process or a combination thereof?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you express your sentiments, how do you feel going against a team that's been embarrassed?  Would you prefer the alternative?</p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of Michigan State, did you have any association with Rolly Dotch (ph)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you discuss your philosophy of running a football team in terms of discipline?  Where was that perspective shaped?</p>
<p>	Q.  Yeah, just your philosophy of how to run a football team, where that came from and who maybe taught you a few things that you have instilled?</p>
<p>	Q.  Many members of the media have given you a lot of praise for the good record and also the attitude and confidence that surrounds the Notre Dame team this year, but at the same time, some have questioned that whether the players at Notre  Dame now and recently are well equipped enough and talented to compete at the BCS level.  Do you feel those comments fail to do justice to the players on the team, and could you comment about the quality of talent issue, as it's been applied to this team?</p>
