<p>	Q.  Can you maybe comment on what has gone into making this Michigan-Notre Dame rivalry such a big thing, and what's gone into the history of it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little about the differences in the early season schedule, how much you learn about your team if you play a team like Central Michigan as opposed to Washington State.  With Stanford, you started with extremely hard teams, teams not quite as talented on paper.  I'm curious if you learn more about your team when you go against a tougher opponent that might give you a little bit harder of a game?</p>
<p>	Q.  When it comes to Carlyle Holiday, seemed to show quite a bit more comfort in the short passing game, his accuracy there.  When it comes to pocket awareness, sensing a defender coming or blitzing, how does he improve in that regard?  Is that something that can be coached or something a quarterback just has?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think he still has a few steps to go in that development?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about Rhema, his development through the off-season, obviously his role has expanded quite a bit this year.  Just looking at him on the field, the way he carries himself, he seems very much in the Arnaz mould in terms of body type.  Do you see similarities like that?  Just talk about Rhema's development?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about his off-season development, some of the strides he made to put himself in a position to really help the team out more this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Brandon Hoyte led the team in tackles.  Can you talk about how he manages to do that game after game?  Do some players just have that homing instinct?  Every game he started, he's led the team in tackles. </p>
<p>	Q.  He seems like a very cerebral player.  How much of his football instinct is fed by knowledge and studying the game?</p>
<p>	Q.  One of the Michigan's linemen yesterday said about their tailback that this year the difference in his running is he's running with his heart, not just his feet.  Can you say anything similar with Julius, his performance in the first game?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the loss of Godsey, Greg Olsen, I was wondering how that may affect some personnel you have on this year's roster, how you look at players moving from tight end or to that position, and also how it may affect recruiting, not only this year but next year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about the freshman on Saturday.  Was that something you planned to do?  Can you comment on the contributions they gave you?</p>
<p>	Q.  You say the best player is going to play.  Is it important to demonstrate that to the freshmen so they see evidence that that is the case?  Sometimes freshmen don't play because they're freshmen. </p>
<p>	Q.  Earlier question.  Michigan has won a couple pretty lopsided challenges.  What kind of challenges does that present for you in preparation?  What kind of things do you have to take into account?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan was a game you won at home last year.  There were a couple others like that.  You talked about the atmosphere, how that can help a team.  On the other side, going up to Michigan, particularly a young offensive line, some other players in that kind of atmosphere for the first time, what kind of challenges does that present?  How do you prepare them for it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Chris Perry, what he shows on the football field? </p>
<p>	Q.  Similar with John Navarre and Braylon Edwards.  Seems like the experience, he's grown a lot as a quarterback. </p>
<p>	Q.  For you guys, Courtney Watson, what will he add to your defense, not just physically?  He calls a lot of shots out there, right?</p>

<p>	Q.  Given that the loser of this game will perhaps have a difficult time climbing back into the national championship hunt, when you have such a tough schedule, would that be advantageous for teams like Michigan and Notre Dame to have a post-season playoff?</p>
<p>	Q.  It's hard to stay in the hunt if you lose an early game, whereas if there were a playoff, would you have time to recover, make an eight-team or 16-team bracket. </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you see such a system being possible without a playoff?</p>
<p>	Q.  Carlyle talked about his development earlier this season, really trying to fine tune things over the summer.  Talk about what you saw in the first game from Carlyle?  Is he a different and better quarterback, and how? </p>
<p>	Q.  Going back to Courtney for a second, when you first saw him play, whether that was when he was on the other side of the line or on your side, what did you really appreciate about him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Have you also seen some other growth in trying to teach some of the younger guys like maybe Brandon Hoyte how to become better linebackers?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, all your time spent at Michigan, when was the last time you were actually at a game at Michigan stadium?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything in particular you remember about that game, any other games you've been a part of there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now that Brady Quinn has played, there's no question about whether he's going to play this year, are you going to look to maybe get him some more experience along the way, plan things to get him in the game at some point?</p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan has played two games, you've obviously played one.  Is there any advantage to playing two games as opposed to one or does the fact that you guys had to play a hard-fought game against a quality opponent make up that difference?</p>
<p>	Q.  What does the cornerback situation look like this weekend, considering the injuries to Jason Beckstrom and (inaudible)?</p>
<p>	Q.  Going back in this rivalry a little bit, it seems this game tends to affect the rest of the season for either team.  The team that wins, it can kind of propel them up and onward, sometimes hurts the season of the team that loses.  Can you talk about the experience of beating Michigan last year, how that helped propel your team on to what turned out to be quite a good season?</p>
<p>	Q.  UCLA Coach Karl Dorrell has mentioned you as somebody he followed and paid particular attention to.  Can you talk about your relationship to him and why you think he can be successful out there?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned going into Michigan stadium, trying to win in their house.  Do you do anything specifically during the week to deal with 100,000 people, all the sort of things that's involved in that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any specific memories as a player?  You probably don't have any more trainers, coach catching on fires.  Anything like that?</p>

<p>	Q.  Last year the position that Courtney Watson played, that position led the team in tackles for the season.  Can you talk about the chemistry of seeing the two of them start together, Brandon, especially adding in the experience of Derek Curry?</p>
<p>	Q.  The development of Justin Tuck and the luxury of developing next to the other three guise you mentioned. </p>
