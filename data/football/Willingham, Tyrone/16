<p>	Q.  What were some of the logistical things or tangible things that made this, the situation that you have in this class, different than your efforts last season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you sense at all  -- inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Are you expecting a couple of more to be added to this list?  And also, you mentioned different dynamics of different recruiting meters.  What did you find challenging in this particular recruiting year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Your offensive line, you have two signings, was that the number you were looking for, or do you think you would like to get more than two offensive linemen?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin Brown, he was a name that was out there for a lot of people; is he a diamond in the rough?</p>
<p>	Q.  Similar question, about Abdel, what did you see in him?</p>
<p>	Q.  With two quarterbacks in this class, how important was it to get two to add to the depth of the position, and with those two guys, what you feel like they can bring?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about the recruiting of the tailback position, Darius Walker and Justin Hoskins?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Tregg and what attracted you to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  We look at a lot of these lists, how much do you pay attention to who else is recruiting a kid in terms of whether you make an offer to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  What about position and flexibility?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you describe the evaluation process, because those following recruiting  -- maybe you offered a kid way back in May and sometimes kids are offered in November and December  --</p>
<p>	Q.  When do you make those offers?</p>
<p>	Q.  Junior Jabbie, and that there may be were others that were close graduates, is this something new?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is this a new trend for you, have you done this at Stanford before and what do you like about those kind of players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Vernaglia, what are your impressions of him overall?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is what you have him listed here based somewhat on your needs more than maybe what he projects himself?</p>
<p>	Q.  Jabbie is a real confident guy, real interesting guy to talk to.  Can you talk a little bit about him and what you see in him?</p>
<p>	Q.  The recruiting process, because there's a lot of evaluation that goes on, what coaches are doing, and can't necessarily talk about it, but if you had to go back, would you do anything differently about this year?  Would you change anything in the way that you approach the season, offer people earlier or do anything different?</p>
<p>	Q.  You said you disliked word "potential," but so much of this is based on potential.  Is the process, you really have to think about kid's potential when you are recruiting them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does the processes that you have to follow as a representative of Notre  Dame, is that in any way a hinderance in the speed with which that you can offer a scholarship to a player, or are you personally more comfortable with being more deliberate in making offer?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a disadvantage; do you find that that's a disadvantage?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is there anything you want to do, that you would promote to the university that would help speed up the process in any way?</p>
<p>	Q.  It seems like every program has a couple of players that were not necessarily all that highly-ranked, but just happened to make an impact on a particular coach.  Notre  Dame had a kid like that named Joey Getherall a couple of years ago who you coached against.  How do you go about looking for those diamonds in the rough that are not necessarily at the top of every recruiting list?</p>
<p>	Q.  If you are sort of considering a kid who doesn't meet the standard five parameters that would fit a certain position, what else do you look for, whether it's something about them mentally or competitiveness, what do you look for that gives you an indication that maybe there is an undersize kid who might be able to fit or make an impact?</p>
<p>	Q.  Does landing two quarterbacks bolster a depth at that position, does that allow you to shift Carlyle Holiday to wide receiver and make him more interested in wanting to return for an additional season at a different position?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate on Ryan Baker, you said earlier you were pleased with the athleticism of this class, but then you mentioned something about toughness.  I wondered if you were influenced in some of your recruiting by toughness of players?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you say what features that Ryan Baker had that attracted Notre  Dame to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned before about how no one knows how these classes are really going to be until the process is played out, but unfortunately  -- recruit being ratings these days  -- it become do you have to address something about this class, do you have to try to disspell that notion that this is a down class for Notre  Dame?</p>
<p>	Q.  In regards to John Kadous, in your evaluation, what did you see in his ability that made you think he could possibly make an impact on this program?</p>
<p>	Q.  Curious, the Ryan Baker situation, was he just not signed today?</p>
<p>	Q.  You can't comment on if there's a possible or anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  But you are still actively recruiting him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Terrail, what stands out about him?</p>
<p>	Q.  The low percentage of guys that came in for game days that show up on the list today, is that the natural nature of the game that it's kind of removed from the January/February recruiting process, or how do you look at that situation in the future of judging whether we want to continue to bring a lot of guys in for game day, do you look at that later in December or January?</p>
<p>	Q.  Inaudible?</p>
<p>	Q.  When it gets down to it, coming off a losing season, is that the most difficult thing to overcome in recruiting?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that in the past some past, the banquet week has been a big recruiting week, is that by design, do you just want the banquet to be something special for the players?</p>
<p>	Q.  So would it be reasonable to assume that next year the banquet would return to that week for you?</p>
<p>	Q.  A report was brought to my attention, and tell me if this is accurate, that you spent seven hours in one kid's living room; is that true?</p>
<p>	Q.  Not anywhere close?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that true?</p>
<p>	Q.  I wonder what you would talk for seven hours about.</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it a matter of, are you just waiting for some faxes to come in, or are some kids put themselves back on square one and?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the NCAA rule, is today a dead day, is it an active day, is it a dead period or anything?</p>
<p>	Q.  The NCAA rule says we can't list them or speak about them unless we have their permission?</p>
<p>	Q.  So when you can you have person-to-person contact?</p>
<p>	Q.  No.  You say you are still actively recruiting two more, but you can't have personal contact with them today.  Can you tomorrow or the day after or when can you?</p>
