<p>	Q.  Other than obviously Maryland's talent and ability to stop the run, after you looked at the tape, what was the source of the problems that you did have running? </p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how many players are injured , that you move on to the next player and expect him to step right in and perform to a high level.  Do your players ever express surprise at how much confidence you show in them, especially when, for example, you have a linebacking core that all three of which were starting their first games? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were asked about coming through the tunnel -- inaudible -- at that point you said no.  Now that your first home game is right around the corner, have you given that any thought? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered, I don't know how much you got to see Powers-Neal in the spring, can you talk about the fall he's had and his progress that you saw in the Maryland game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you evaluate Omar Jenkins, his play, and what you expect from him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was  curious, some defenses are a little bit more celebratory when they make a tackle and have a little bit more swagger, and some guys like to talk on the field to the offensive  players.  What's your opinion of those kind of things?  What do you like as a coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it kind of fun, having been a Big  10 guy, to play some Big  10 teams and play that style?  I think you might have played Michigan State while you were at Stanford and that might have been it.</p>
<p>	Q.  Ineffectiveness in the red zone, inside the 10-yard line, how important is that to get that correct and kind of put your finger on what may have been the problem Saturday night in terms of when you're in scoring position, you had to come away with field goals?</p>
<p>	Q.  (Inaudible) ... does that make it any tougher to make it go against that kind of player the next week? </p>
<p>	Q.  What do you do now if Watson is healthy, and how much did his friend's play surprise you, if it did at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  What was your reaction to being ranked?  How important is that to you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you address that at all with the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  How concerned are you, if at all, about keeping your team on an even keel after a win that has made pretty  -- resonated pretty strong with Notre  Dame fans, media?  There's a lot of type hype, especially with the first home week; and does that have anything to do with the fact that maybe they are not sort of  -- not available to the media for two days after the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have any background with Joe Tiller, familiarity?  And I just wondered, when you came into the Big  10, did you use any parts of his offense to try to incorporate into yours and have you ever kind of studied his offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  A lot of coaches talk about missing game one and game two, the most  -- inaudible -- do you agree with that and if so why do you think that that's the week that so much happens? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is there any one or two areas that you expect to see the most improvement in that you can talk about? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coaching-wise, is it one of the hardest game things  -- having gone all of a sudden where you have a week where  -- you've gone from five or six weeks getting ready for one team and all of a sudden you have four or five days?</p>
<p>	Q.  The first game, second week, has one of Notre Dame's worst record for first-year coaches, they are 8-5, lost three straight now and literally never won a second game under Coach Davie.  Do those stats worry you at all?</p>
<p>	Q.  Paraseghian and Devore  --</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about the need for improvement in all areas.  How can the defense improve on a shutout?</p>
<p>	Q.  Purdue's style of offense would suggest that Preston Jackson will play quite a bit  -- how would you assess their first game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about how pleased the players were with how there were defenders around the ball at all times almost.</p>
<p>	Q.  What do you remember about the atmosphere at Notre  Dame stadium when you've come in as an opponent? </p>
<p>	Q.  It gotten a reputation of being a little bit apathetic in home games.  What would you like to see Saturday and how important is that in terms of creating a home-field advantage for the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Talk about Nick Setta and his demeanor.  He seems really to think of himself as a football player first and a kicker as kind of a secondary part of that. </p>
<p>	Q.  There's a lot of talk about Purdue's offense.  What have you seen about their defense and the challenge that is presented to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Goolsby, did you see indications during the spring and preseason that would be a prelude to his fine game Saturday?  That he was capable of that type of performance?</p>
<p>	Q.  I think you had 14 occasions on Saturday where you had 3rd and 7 yards or longer.  Was that a major concern of you coming out of the game and if so what do you do on first and second down? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about the factors that led to the success that you had in special teams on Saturday? </p>
<p>	Q.  When you look at Seth's return, people will focus on the blocks that were thrown, but there were a number of decisions made by players not to do things that may have been equally important? </p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned you thought Nick had a very good chance of making the field goal, but was there any underlying current of, "Hey, I'm going to show everybody on this team, Nick in particular, how much confidence I have in him? </p>
<p>	Q.  Since last off-season, did you or the coaching staff alter anything in Carlyle Holiday's delivery and mechanics or was his success mostly having to do with getting a chance to throw the football?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Kyle or Dan and what you've seen on videotape from the Illinois State game compared to when he played last year and what type of quarterback he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  We all saw the piece why John Saunders and it's clear that you recognize the importance of success from society's point of view.  Would you agree that getting a head coaching job of any kind at the division one level is difficult, regardless of your ethnic background? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just wondering if you've had a chance to hear about Drew Borchard's Major League debut yesterday and if you could talk about what type of person he is? </p>
<p>	Q.  He hit a home run in his second at-bat.</p>
<p>	Q.  Lou Holtz got in trouble for rattling the cage.</p>
<p>	Q.  Well, whatever it was.  (Laughter).  Anyway, my question is, with Purdue being a basically West Coast offense, would that help your defense in reparation from their practice against your own offense? </p>
<p>	Q.  What does Vontez bring besides being an explosive back who can bring the ball back to the middle like he did on Saturday?</p>
<p>	Q.  How about as a leader, maybe in the locker room?</p>
<p>	Q.  You get to see a lot of cool things as a coach.  You can see players overcome a lot of elements, injuries and transitions from new positions.  Can you talk about Arnaz Battle and the fact that he came out and responded against that game in Maryland?</p>
<p>	Q.  Assuming you were speaking the pep rally and luncheon on Friday, wondered if you did anything at Stanford similar to that, and did that cut into your preparation time?  How has your first week been with that? </p>
