<p>	Q.  What are some of the characteristics of the Michigan State team that has made it so difficult for Notre Dame to beat them here in the last seven years?  I know you've only been part of two, but I'm sure the characteristics have carried over. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a characteristic of the program when you were a part of it as a player? </p>
<p>	Q.  The thinking has always been around Notre Dame that the two most physical games on the schedule are Michigan and Michigan State.  Is that still the case? </p>
<p>	Q.  Does Michigan State recruit to that type of style of player, I mean, a player that may be a little bit more physical than the average football player? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you comment on the performance of your interior defensive linemen up to this point?  I think your Top 3 guys are Greg Pauly, Trevor Laws and Derek Landry have combined for 21 tackles already at those two spots, which is a pretty high spot at those positions at this stage of the year.  Could you comment on how they've performed up to this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  You said a freshman might get a little playing time this week.  Were you surprised how much you used him?  Was that a plan or did he earn it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is the biggest problem for someone this early in their college career just learning?  I think he wasn't there for maybe passing situations. </p>
<p>	Q.  Is it learning the coverage, that sort of thing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you go into the game this week expecting him to have more of a role than last week's game?</p>
<p>	Q.  Anything about the way he performed surprise you?  Did he show you anything that you hadn't seen in practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Third time going, Michigan State.  Is it still a little special playing at the alma mater or at this point is it just another team?</p>
<p>	Q.  The Big-10 offers instant replay this year.  You as the visiting team have the choice as to whether to have that or not.  What is your choice for this week? </p>
<p>	Q.  Was there instant replay when you were in the system in the NFL during that time? </p>
<p>	Q.  Just seeing if you had dealt with it before. </p>
<p>	Q.  Talk a little bit about Darius and the development?  You didn't play him at all in week one.  What happened differently in week two practice?</p>
<p>	Q.  Nothing?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you get a guy like Carlyle ready to go back there and return punts after he played quarterback for nearly four years?</p>
<p>	Q.  Would you consider using him on kickoffs? </p>
<p>	Q.  Is that a position where a guy either has it or he doesn't, fielding punts? </p>
<p>	Q.  Isiah Gardener is not listed on the roster on this week.  Is he no longer a member of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you expand on that?</p>
<p>	Q.  What did you see maybe in Darius this fall that kind of let you know that he could help you this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Now, when you talk about maybe the situation, that the timing wasn't right, playing him in a season-opener, did that have anything to do with being on the road at all? </p>
<p>	Q.  Did you expand maybe on some of the factors?</p>
<p>	Q.  How you doing, coach? </p>
<p>	Q.  Will you tell me after this line of questioning. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was curious what other freshmen you might be considering that could help you this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  How about your philosophy about freshmen on special teams?  Is it that equation where burn a year or... </p>
<p>	Q.  And then when you're considering that, do you go to an individual freshman - let's pretend Carlyle was a freshman this year - and you say, "Carlyle, I'd really like to use you on special teams."  Do you ever give it to him as, "You're involved in this decision"?  Do you say, "Carlyle you're playing or you're sitting"? </p>
<p>	Q.  I'm just curious what you think. </p>
<p>	Q.  What would I do if I were the coach?  I would probably involve them in the decision. </p>
<p>	Q.  I want to know what you say. </p>
<p>	Q.  All right.  We'll move on, but you're going to regret that (laughter)?</p>
<p>	Q.  I didn't say it was going to be vindictive. </p>
<p>	Q.  With a guy like Darius coming in and all of a sudden the spotlight is so big, a few people in the media have interviewed him here and there, then all of a sudden you have a big crowd around you, a lot of demands.  What do you as a coach feel is your role in terms of helping to nurture that situation? </p>
<p>	Q.  I mean, even the crazy stuff that happens off the field, too, do you as a coach talk to them and say, "You might be getting people knocking on your dorm in the middle of the night, wanting your picture"?  Do you address those kinds of things or do you let them figure that out themselves?</p>
<p>	Q.  How do you think Darius is handling it so far?</p>
<p>	Q.  Some of your players mentioned yesterday that after the game, you danced in the locker room.  Can you confirm or deny that? </p>
<p>	Q.  I wondered if there was any chance you might be able to show us what that might have looked like? </p>
<p>	Q.  I am assuming.  I have two sources on this one (laughter). </p>
<p>	Q.  You spoke in the beginning of the season of the confidence of the team.  Was there anything special that you and your staff did during last week's practices to reaffirm that? </p>
<p>	Q.  What are some of the factors that went into you going for it on the fourth and goal?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little about Maurice Stovall in terms of the mental strides like you feel he's made so far this season? </p>
<p>	Q.  After the first game at BYU, I think he had three penalties, do you sit down and talk to him about that, encourage him to stay aggressive and try to not necessarily forget about it, but don't let that hinder his instincts? </p>
<p>	Q.  Have you seen him become more vocal in many ways this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  You were asked about Brandon Hoyte last week.  On media day, you talked about character as one of the cornerstones of what you want this program to be, academics.  In many ways, does Brandon maybe symbolize what you want this program to be about?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you see him as a guy that a lot of other people look to on this squad, not just linebackers, but across the board? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you sign it for me (laughter)? </p>
<p>	Q.  Thank you very much (laughter). </p>
<p>	Q.  Some of the emotions you showed on the sideline, I know those are spontaneous.  Do you get a sense that the players need to see that from you from time to time?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about how important body language is to kind of gauge someone's state of mind.  A couple of guys said it was great to see that from you, even though they do know the passion you bring to the game and practice.  Can you talk about the impact that body language has coming from you? </p>
<p>	Q.  How does Darius' performance last week maybe impact the runningback position at this point? </p>
<p>	Q.  Of course with Ryan coming back, how does that impact this?</p>

<p>	Q.  Obviously, people down here are talking about Darius and everything as much as you guys up there.  Can you recall the first time you saw him play in a game?  What about him really struck you right away when you saw him?</p>
<p>	Q.  How did he handle the first week not playing?  Did you have to say anything to him?  Was he upbeat, positive?</p>
<p>	Q.  You've discussed at length Darius' field of vision, what he can do on the field, what he brings to the team.  What about his mental makeup convinced you as a freshman he was ready for one of the biggest stages Notre Dame has? </p>
<p>	Q.  Michigan State in its first two games this year has been on the short end of the time-of-possession battle.  When a team can win the time-of-possession battle, which I'm sure you try to do every week, what does that do for your defense other than just the fatigue factor?  Does it allow them to have a little more pop?  Do they hit harder?  How does it change defensive play? </p>
<p>	Q.  In addition to the physical? </p>
<p>	Q.  The team obviously has done so well against the run so far.  Does that allow you to do as a coach and a staff?  Does that give you some luxuries with the defense doing such a good job against the run? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Dwight Ellick, the confidence he brings?  How contagious is that among the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is that confidence that he exudes, is that something you see that sort of runs through the team, especially the DBs? </p>
<p>	Q.  How blessed do you feel to have such a solid group of leaders on the defensive side of the ball? </p>
<p>	Q.  We often hear after a tough loss a team saying they have to just put their game out of their minds and move on.  I'm assuming the same is true of a big win.  As emotional as that win was on Saturday, you have to -- do you have to get it out of your mind by the time you hit the practice field today?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the offensive game plan on Saturday, was that a result of a different philosophy on offense or simply you were able to do more by the way the game was going?</p>
<p>	Q.  With the way college football is now, with the parity, is it a case where from week to week almost anybody can beat almost anyone, depending on how well each team plays?  Is that something that really I guess the fans, the media are still adjusting to, the fact it is so volatile?</p>
<p>	Q.  What is the pressure like setting up a program like Notre Dame?  Do you feel it's easy to manage? </p>
<p>	Q.  Tomorrow? </p>
<p>	Q.  How long did it take you to adjust, to make it easy to manage that?  Is it easy for you to manage that?  Did you come in and you were able to kind of play it off?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it different than it was at Stanford? </p>
<p>	Q.  What jumps out about this Michigan State game?  What players really impress you that you think you might have to do something with?</p>
<p>	Q.  Is it more satisfying now winning as a coach or was it more satisfying winning as a player? </p>
<p>	Q.  No difference between either one? </p>
<p>	Q.  Question about Michigan State personnel, their strong safety, Eric Smith.  I don't know if you saw any film without him in the lineup.  What sort of difference does he make to the Michigan State defense? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know you kind of glazed over the quarterback situation.  Michigan State said they were going to start Stephen Reaves, the redshirt freshman.  Seeing how it's a young guy, do you intend to put more pressure on him?  How do you go about preparing for a younger quarterback as compared to somebody who might be a veteran? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you have a certain policy that you follow when someone gets hurt?  Do you say someone can't lose a starting job to an injury, or is it always in the best interest of the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  If I'm correct, last year was the first year that you coached against Coach Smith at any time. </p>
<p>	Q.  He's a different kind of guy.  He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in the summer for his vacation.  Have you had any dealings with him?  How would you describe his coaching style?</p>
<p>	Q.  No.  But he's a different sort of character.  Certainly where you come across as a reserved sort of person, except for the occasional sideline leaps that are caught on camera, he comes across as certainly a very outgoing, fun-loving type of person.  I guess what I'm asking is... </p>
<p>	Q.  When Eric comes up here, certainly.  Even though you wouldn't dance for us today. </p>
<p>	Q.  I couldn't compete, I know that.  In terms of his coaching style, how would you describe it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Do you tell your team to forget about the recent history against Michigan State?  Players here for five years are familiar with the troubles you've had.  Some don't seem to be aware of it.  Do you tell them to forget about what's happened with that?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're talking about the history of a series or what happened a week ago, how much is the structure that you bring to the program and the way a given game week will work, plan so far ahead, how practices are set up, how much is that designed to kind of keep the players focused on the present and keep their minds from wandering either back to previous games against Michigan State or what happened last week?</p>
