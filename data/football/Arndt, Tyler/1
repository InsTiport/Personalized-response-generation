  TEXAS STATE   7  
    TEXAS TECH - 33  
  
 Q.   Rob, when you scored that touchdown, ran that in, you guys, 13‑7, had to feel like you guys were right in the game with how your defense was playing?   Did it feel like that?  
    ROBERT LOWE:   Yeah, it felt like we was coming back with momentum.   I knew we needed to come out in the second half and get something going, get the offense going because the defense was playing well, so I was just trying to make a play.   
   
 Q.   Xavier, how did you feel that the defense played tonight and how as a whole, as a team did you feel like this was your best game against Tech over the last three years?   
    XAVIER DANIELS:   I felt like we did pretty good.   We could have done better.   Obviously we didn't get the win, so we didn't play good enough.   But I felt like I had a pretty good game.   I felt like there was a couple plays I could have done better, but I felt like this was probably one of my best games.  
   
 Q.   What were you doing to keep Tech's quarterbacks sometimes from scrambling, had a hard time finding open receivers.   What was your game plan going in and how do you feel it worked?   
    XAVIER DANIELS:   I mean, just when he started scrambling, find your man and stay on him.   Don't let people run free.   We kind of figured he was going to scramble a little bit, and whenever he scrambles he's careless with the ball so we were trying to get takeaways from that.   
   
 Q.   And Tyler, what are your thoughts on the interceptions and the turnovers that you had in the first quarter?   
    TYLER ARNDT:   Those are things, just I've got to avoid.   On the 1‑yard line twice, can't turn the ball over.   That's all on me.   I had two turnovers tonight.   I've got to get better in that aspect of the game.   But no, defense played great tonight.   You can chalk this one up to offense.  
   
 Q.   Do you think those two turnovers set a tone at the beginning of the game?   
    TYLER ARNDT:   I think so.   Our defense was playing really good.   I felt like we could have gained a little momentum if we would have punched it in down there.   We kind of let them down.  
   
 Q.   How important do you think it is for a senior player to not turn over the ball?   
    TYLER ARNDT:   It's real important.   You know, I made a bad throw down there at the end zone, left a guy short, I had David Lewis at the back of the end zone, threw it off my back foot, just underthrew the ball, they picked it and then another turnover.   We had a read the guy got from behind, and laid it on the ground.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, you guys had the ball 1st and goal at the 1 or whatever it was.   What do you think changed with Tech's defense, or was it more what the offense was not able to do at that stage?   
    TYLER ARNDT:   I think it was more what we couldn't do, not being able to come off the ball on short yardage, those sorts of things, to get it in the end zone.   That's what I noticed.  
   
 Q.   Xavier, this was your first interception since 2011.   If I would have told you you would have three interceptions tonight do you think you would have had a chance to win the game?   
    XAVIER DANIELS:   Yeah, I felt like we could have kept them to less points, a couple things we could have done better.   We've definitely got to film to watch and definitely get better.  
   
 Q.   Rob, can you hold your head high knowing in the fourth quarter, two‑possession game, if the fake punt works you're driving down the field and have a chance to really put a lot of pressure on Texas Tech at home?   
    ROBERT LOWE:   Yeah, if the fake punt would have worked it definitely would have given us a lot of momentum.   I feel like in the second half we were moving the ball well and the line was locked good, it was opening up the hole.   It definitely would have gave us momentum if we would have got that fake.   
   
 Q.   Xavier, did you notice a difference in the way the defense attacked each individual quarterback?   
    XAVIER DANIELS:   Yes, ma'am.   The starting quarterback, he's more of a scrambler, and we kind of made him up a little bit and they brought in the backup and we kind of kept the pressure on him and forced him to scramble out of the pocket and make a couple bad passes.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel Tech deserves a 25th ranking after playing them tonight?   
    XAVIER DANIELS:   Yeah, you've got to give Tech credit.   They're a very good football team.   We definitely had a couple mistakes on defense that we've got to clean up, but they're definitely a good football team.   
   
 Q.   Tyler, what do you think it's going to take for the offense to get to where the defense is right now?   The defense is playing at such a high level and kind of carrying the team.   What does the offense need to do to pick it up and what are you going to do as leaders to get them to where it needs to be?   
    TYLER ARNDT:   I think it starts out in practice.   We're coming off the off week, bye week, whatnot.   I thought we had a good Tuesday and Wednesday of practice and then we came back and had Tuesday and Wednesday to prepare for them, and that set us that far behind.   You could tell tonight we struggled on offense.   We've got to come in and take the game plan and hit it running in practice and be able to prepare.
