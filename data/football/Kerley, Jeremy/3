   JEREMY KERLEY: The feeling of knowing you are at BCS, it feels good.  
  
  Q. What's your feeling about playing Boise in this game?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: It is a good feeling. We played them last year. Now it is just business. We are here. We got to get it done.  
  
  Q. At this point, you feel like you just need to get the win. It doesn't matter who it is against; it is just a win?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: Yeah.  
  
  Q. How big of a motivation is the end of the season for you?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: I think it is a big motivation.  
 Texas Christian University hasn't been defeated in a long time. To have that for us is big. You want to keep it going.  
  
  Q. Do you feel a couple years ago, it was Boise State that set the bar pretty high for you guys in a game against Oklahoma here in the Fiesta Bowl? Is it special you get to go against them and knock them off, that you have that opportunity?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: That's what you think about. But then again, you try to stay within yourself and play within yourself. I mean, it is there but you don't really think about it that much.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you have the weight of the smaller schools on your shoulders?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: Not so much. I kind of look at our school as a little different from everybody else's school. Not to say we get overlooked. I think we put in just as much effort as any other big school.  
  
  Q. Last year's game was so low scoring and there's -- you guys have a great defense. They got a pretty good defense. Do you see that kind of game again, or do you think the offenses are going to win out this year? Or is there any real way of knowing?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: I don't think you can tell that yet. It will be a really good battle. Looking at Boise State's defense, it is ranked right up there. It will be a battle.   
  
  Q. Do you think it is going to be more on the low-scoring end?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: If I had to say so, I would probably say it will be low-scoring.  
  
  Q. So when you go back to special teams --  
 JEREMY KERLEY: There will be a big difference.  
  
  Q. Is there any excitement to be in the University of Phoenix Stadium?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: There is a lot of excitement.  
  
  Q. Have you watched some games there?   
 JEREMY KERLEY: No, sir.
