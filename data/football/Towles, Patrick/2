Q. We talked a little bit about the ways to contain Jackson a little bit, and there were things you guys wanted to do to keep him inside the edge and things of that nature.  What was it like trying to manage him?
JOHN JOHNSON: It was tough.  I definitely underestimated their offensive line.  They had holes all throughout the tacklers, like you said.  We weren't gap sound.  I think we just got washed out of our gaps.  I haven't watched the film yet, but once he hit, it's like, you can't stop him.  Once he gets going, it was tough on us.
Q. What did you see on defense?
JOHN JOHNSON: Like I said, I think we weren't gap sound.  We got washed out of our gaps, and yeah, he faked one way, I think we went too hard to the ball, and he just, like you said, put his foot in the ground and got vertical.
Q. The secondary has given up a lot more of those explosive 20-plus yard plays this last year.  Have you noticed any changes in the scheme of last year or how you guys are approaching an offense in the secondary?
JOHN JOHNSON: I don't think it's scheme.  I think the talent level is higher.  That was probably the most talented team I've ever played against.  All around, they had a whole bunch of guys that can go.  I don't think a scheme is just -- I think it's the talent level, and we've got to practice harder and get accustomed to it.
Q. Just talk about the pressure you were under today from the front seven.
PATRICK TOWLES: Yeah, you know, that's an extremely talented football team.  They do a very good job pressuring.  They've got home a lot all year long.  They've got some really kind of complex blitzes.  It's a really good football team, and I can't give enough credit to them.  They played really, really well.  We did not, so that's why the score was what it was.
