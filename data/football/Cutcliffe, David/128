<p>	Q.  Coach, just a quick question about your statement.  At the very beginning it said, "Everywhere I look these days I see opportunity and I know well that many will say I'm squandering a fantastic one."  Is there anything besides your health that caused you to make this decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  And is it just a case of just recovery?  I mean, I'm not sure what stage you're in. </p>
<p>	Q.  And long-term you hope to get back into coaching in the next year or two?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was going to ask you if you thought you might get back into it, sounds like you're open to that in the future.  What do you see as the immediate future for you and your family?  I understand the house has been sold and I guess you'll be moving?</p>
<p>	Q.  Curious what the doctor's original prognosis was for your return and if maybe there's been more complications to set you back or was this kind of what you thought might be a problem all along, that you just wouldn't be ready come summertime?</p>
<p>	Q.  Did you have any discussion with Charlie about who might take your place?</p>
<p>	Q.  How much did the first health problem you had at Ole Miss, when you first got there, how much did that come up in your mind in terms of when you looked at your family and your young daughter about just taking some time off?</p>
<p>	Q.  I was just sad to hear about this, and they kind of, you kind of answered my question.  I want to make sure that this was not a permanent retirement. </p>
<p>	Q.  And it seems like your family has supported you in whatever move you made.  How does your family feel about this?</p>
<p>	Q.  The coaching world is going to miss you for awhile.  Good luck. </p>
<p>	Q.  I was wondering, when did you come to this decision?  When did you start kind of feeling like this might -- you might be leaning this way?</p>
<p>	Q.  Now what kind of date had you targeted for return?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you kind of, I guess, curse your luck, since two years ago in that season --</p>
<p>	Q.  Without going into the gory details, what's it like to go through one of these things, wake up and you're all rewired all of a sudden?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you had been a coach for 29 years, this will be your first significant time off.  Have you thought at all about in addition to the recovery, anything you might do on the side?  Whether it's, you know, volunteering to help out at the local high school coaching or doing some television work.  Have you even thought about any of that yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  You mentioned that you're moving to East Tennessee, will the doctors transfer the care there?  Do you already have all that set-up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Most of my questions have already been answered, but I do want to know, are you still doing your rehab in Mississippi?</p>
<p>	Q.  And do you know how much longer you'll be there?</p>
<p>	Q.  I know that your son graduated, did that play any kind of role in this since he did graduate from high school?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wanted to ask you a question, you once mentioned that your son had talked about going into coaching one day.  And now with the added stress that you had these last couple seasons and the culmination of your health problems, I guess would you deter him from that or would you tell him that it's such a high stress career these days with the amount of pressure that's on a head coach at the college level?</p>
<p>	Q.  Wanted to follow-up and ask, did you even before the surgery and health problem this past spring, did you give any thought about sitting out a year just because Chris was coming through as a senior and just kind of taking it easy for a year?</p>
<p>	Q.  While you were recovering several SEC coaches did a teleconference wishing you well and that kind of thing.  I guess, have you talked to any of any of the other coaches around the league just about how you've been doing and what this profession can do to a coach when the stress level kicks up?</p>
<p>	Q.  Let me ask you to expand on one of your answers a little bit.  Do you have a personal or have your doctors given you a timetable down the road when you'll be a hundred percent?</p>
<p>	Q.  Based on the fact that you are now a coordinator and that you're not a head coach, at the current time, did it make the decision a little easier, knowing that you would leave your current position in very good hands with Coach Weis; and had you still been a head coach at Ole Miss or anywhere else would you have made this same decision?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you're fully recovered and ready to go back to coaching, is returning to Notre Dame at all a possibility somewhere down the line in your mind, given that they treated you well throughout this process?</p>
