OKLAHOMA STATE INTERVIEW
JUSTICE HILL: Justice Hill.
Q. What do you think about playing here, what's Lubbock like in terms of atmosphere?
JUSTICE HILL: The environment, the fans, everybody out there, it was fun.  Actually motivated us a lot.  So they were loud.  Probably the loudest game I've been in this year.  It was a fun game.
Q. Did you give Mason any advice on how to run the football at all tonight?
JUSTICE HILL: No.  He actually needed to give me some advice.  I think he got more (indiscernible).  That's a good one.
Q. Does this feel like this was your best game ever?
JUSTICE HILL: I mean, doesn't feel like the best game ever, but it's a good game.  We won.
