		  FRAN TARKENTON: Mick's a man of little words but a lot of action. He's so proud to be in this class of 2015. He waited 37 years to get to the Hall of Fame. He just wanted me to tell all of his teammates who are here and thank them for being here, our great coach and fellow Hall of Famer, Bud Grant, all of the Viking fans who have come from all over the country, and all the rest of you fans, and even you Steeler fans who beat us in that Super Bowl. Thank you.
