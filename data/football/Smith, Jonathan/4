Q. Coach, if you can just talk a little bit about Alabama's defense.  You guys are going up against a great defense.  What challenges do they pose for you guys?
JONATHAN SMITH: Well, they are definitely good and they they've got some good players.  They do a sound scheme.  That front seven is as good a defense as we've played and so they create some problems that way.
They've been great at getting some turnovers.  I think a lot of things start with them that way is creating havoc and getting the ball.
So we've got to be awesome with the ball and kind of do what we've done for the year.  We've had some success.  So you get to this point and you want to do a good amount of what got you here.  At the same time, we've had a month to prepare.  You want to show some new wrinkles as well.
Q. So you changed your game plan up a little bit, going up against these guys?
JONATHAN SMITH: You know, you just show some different things.  So, again, it's that fine balance and doing what got you here and having to be able to show them some things that they weren't ready to prepare for and you know, again, we've got some good players.  We've got to put them in a good position to have some success.
Q. Talk a little bit about Browning.  He's had a great season.  Sophomore.
