Q. What did you see on the play?
TATE HAYNES: It was a pretty wide opening. I thought I'd have a good shot at it. I think I really got pretty lucky, honestly. But it was a great play. Marcus was right there to recover it, so yeah. But it was wide open.
Q. How many times have you heard the words young and defense put together?
TATE HAYNES: A lot. That's what I've been hearing a lot from the media. Yeah, I think there's a culture in our defensive back room that's been set, and it's kind of the expectation level of how we should play. People have doubted that just because the older guys have gone, but now that we're in the next phase, we've got a lot of young guys, a lot of talented guys in the defensive back room that I'm pretty excited about.
Q. David, when you go on a blitz, is that an indication that Steve has a lot of confidence in this so-called young defense that, look, you guys have got to go out and make plays no matter what your experience level is and I trust in you guys to go out there and make plays. How important is that to you?
TATE HAYNES: Really important. Whenever defense is called, all 11 guys are expected to do their job. Whether it's me -- we have all kinds of personnels. So whoever's in there is expected to --
Q. In other words, my point is that it's going to be aggressive, and you like that?
TATE HAYNES: Yeah, absolutely.
Q. There were a lot of questions about the young defense. How were you able to gel as a unit, whether it be summer, on the field, off the field? How were you able to gel to create a result like you guys had today?
TATE HAYNES: It didn't come from today. It's come from the work we put in since January. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did I answer that?
