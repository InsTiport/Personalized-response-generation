   THE MODERATOR: We have Zoltan Mesko.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: I mean, I have been doing pretty good. But, you know, the team is more important than any individual effort. So it's kind of tough on all of us to go through this.   
 But what we have to do is just look forward to Penn State and the week after that, you know.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: He's doing fine. I mean, I love the guy no matter what. We have a strong relationship within the kicking group. He'll always be, you know, a great kicker. You just have to forget about something that happened in the past because you can't do anything about it. No regrets. So move on.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: Sometimes it's let it hit and roll. Sometimes it's put it over his head. Depends how team the returner is.   
 But it is something I've gotten more comfortable at. Everything has a learning curve to it. Hopefully I'm at the top of that learning curve.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: Yeah, everything. You have to read the whole defense and return team.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: At times. At times. Sometimes you just call it on the sideline. Sometimes you look for the option.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: Whenever it's called. I don't have the option to roll out every time. Whenever Coach Rodriguez tells me I have the option.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: My coach is Bob McClain. He's a graduate assistant. He's done a good job with all of us, keeping us focused on everything.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: Yeah, I mean, I've played against him the past two seasons. He's a great returner. So I got to hang the ball high or roll it a little bit better. Everything's got to be done a little better this week.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: I mean, fast guy. No. 1 recruit in the nation in my class. He's very dangerous. I know he had the return against Wisconsin last week. That raises some eyebrows every time he does that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: What I would say is that he's managing the team very well. What you have to do with Toledo, it's over. More than 24 hours, you got to forget about it. It's not like life or death. It's not like you have a kid that's terminally ill. I'd rather have this than be 6-0 and have the kid. That's got to be a tough situation. But you've got to look at it, it could be worse.   
 We just got to move on, have a positive outlook. And I feel like the team has done that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible)  
 ZOLTAN MESKO: I guess that's why we're recruited here. We're not the people we truly are if we keep winning and we show our happy faces. A person gets truly tested in times of adversity, like how are you going to respond. So this is a great opportunity for us to do that, to show who we are.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
