<p>	Q.  Offensively, how do you plan to -- you want to stretch the field a little more.  How do you plan to improve things compared to a year ago particularly? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rich, you and the players have all talked about the improved attitude and maybe feeling a little bit more of a momentum in the off season than maybe in the past.  Anything you can put your finger on; is it coming out of the probation, them knowing you and you knowing the players better, anything like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  You spent a lot of time in the NFL where you settle everything on the field.  Give us your thoughts on the BCS process and how fair it is or unfair it is in your mind? </p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk to me about your freshman class coming in and when you will know exactly or how you think they will be eligible and what problems you might have there and also talk a little bit about Abdullah Muhammad and what role you see him playing this year? </p>
<p>	Q.  Also, an NFL college-type of question, how much has the NFL philosophy trickled down into college in the last 10, 20 years in terms of the offenses they are trying to do that now other defenses doing that.  How has that changed since you have been at both levels and you have seen it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, one of the main differences between Andre Woodson and the graduated Shane Boyd, how has the team reacted to Andre's leadership?</p>
<p>	Q.  Rich, what do you think about the new NCAA rule that allowed freshman to come in, take classes, I guess, in July?  Did you have any guys take advantage of that?  What's your stance on that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you had mentioned all the freshmen that you have got coming in. What kind of contributions are you expecting from any or all of the freshmen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Most coaches, obviously, want continuity as far as their coaching staff and keep things going on.  You, obviously, had a lot of turnover.  I guess half your staff turned over. Is that necessarily a good thing, bad thing?  How has that worked out for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how much pressure do you feel in terms of job security this year and you do think there's a magic number out there for you? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, in college, or in the pro's, have you ever chewed out a player to the point where they started crying or have you ever seen that happen? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, have you ever -- what's your policy on scholarship that South Carolina is dealing with right now?  Have you ever not renewed kids that you didn't think can kind of cut the mustard?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you have got Dominic Lewis playing defensive end this year, after he played tailback and fullback last year.  How hard has it been for him to adjust and willing to make the switches to find a position to contribute? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rich, talk about the little bit different look on your defensive front this year, and, also, what looks to be kind of a bad run, bad luck run of attrition at linebacker. </p>
<p>	Q.  Rich, talk about, other than linebackers, what are some of the position that you anticipate maybe a lot of competition, maybe some movement from the depth chart that you had at the end of Spring?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked about the freshman. Can you elaborate tight end Zip Duncan, what you expect out much him this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Can you elaborate on Zip Duncan?</p>
<p>	Q.  As far as Pully, I know you will know more next week, when you guys start practicing.  How much do you think he has been able to accomplish this summer? </p>
