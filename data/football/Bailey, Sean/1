<p>	Q.  D.J., talk about the two quick touchdown passes.  Do you feel it put LSU back on its heels? </p>

<p>	Q.  D.J., describe your touchdown that you made going around the left side there.  It looked like it was going to be a play that developed to the right side.  You took it the other way. </p>
<p>	Q.  D.J., back to that second touchdown, how important was the pump on that TD?  Did you see that on film, that the opportunity would be there one way or the other? </p>
<p>	Q.  D.J., how does it feel to be part of a group of seniors that are going to close out their careers four 10-plus win seasons in a row, second time in school history that's happened?  Second SEC Championship.  I think what's neatest probably for you guys is to see the seniors make big plays tonight.  Jennings, McClendon, you, Minter.  The whole team played great, but the seniors really, really made plays tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, defensively this week in practice, how much did you work on not getting beat by the long ball? </p>

<p>	Q.  Can you talk about making the most of your one year as a starter.  You're one point from being undefeated as a starter. </p>
<p>	Q.  Sean, can you talk about what this year's been like for you.  You had the two big touchdown catches in the Boise State game.  Then some tough breaks and some tough drops for you.  But to come back like this when you heard all year that other receivers should be getting more of a chance, can you talk about what this means for you tonight, to top it off like this? </p>
<p>	Q.  For Quentin, can you talk about your first defensive series, your first play, you sacked Russell.  It seemed to send a message to him.  He seemed pretty rattled the rest of the night. </p>
<p>	Q.  D.J., when things were difficult for you and you weren't getting on the field and thought about leaving, how much was a night like tonight in the back of your mind? </p>



<p>	Q.  Mark, where do you go next for your next offensive coordinator? </p>
<p>	Q.  This was not an easy win, but were you surprised that you dominated LSU so much? </p>
<p>	Q.  After last season, everybody was talking about the big losses you had, SEC caliber players.  Now you're going to have a lot of losses from this team.  Do you think you have the players coming back to sustain this and keep this growing? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk a little bit about being picked third in preseason, even after coming off three straight years of Top 10 finishes.  Does this feel like a little more respect for the program of the team, or doesn't that matter?</p>
<p>	Q.  In this area of me-first athletes, what does it say about D.J. Shockley, that he would stay behind David Green that long and persevere, and what did you do to guide him along?</p>
<p>	Q.  Were you surprised by the special teams in this game?  LSU wasn't quite as productive as expected.  Georgia had the blocked punt for Marcus Browne's returns. </p>
<p>	Q.  What was the last thing you said to those guys before they came out on the field, the last official go get 'em?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you feel like they did that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Two questions.  First, can you talk about the running game.  Throughout your season, you're not necessarily flashy with your stats, but you seem to move the chains and that was the case tonight.  Then also, your seniors that have led you all season, can you talk about what kind of residual win like this and their performance leading you all season could do for the program for you in the years to come. </p>
<p>	Q.  What does it say about the team when they play their best game last, especially when it's for a championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  The secondary came out strong from the beginning.  How important was Tim? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know sometimes these things are a little hard to quantify, but over the last few years you've taken a Georgia program, which was always considered to be a very good program, to a championship level.  How have you guys done this? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you talk about Sean Bailey and kind of the up-and down year he's had, then the night he had tonight. </p>
<p>	Q.  You had two long passes from D.J. to Bailey.  Did you see something early on with LSU that you could hit them early?  Second question, how excited are you about a Sugar Bowl playing West Virginia?</p>
<p>	Q.  How does the emotion of this game compare to 2002?  How does the feeling of accomplishment compare to it? </p>
