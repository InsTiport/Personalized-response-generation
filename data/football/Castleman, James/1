THE MODERATOR:   We'll begin with opening comments from Coach Gundy. 
COACH GUNDY:   As I said out there, first I'd like to thank TicketCity and the Cactus Bowl, all the volunteers, the community in the Tempe, Phoenix, Chandler area, Scottsdale, everywhere we had a part in this week.   All the volunteers. 
It was a great bowl week for our players.   I mentioned to them that it was the best three weeks of preparation for a bowl that we've ever had.   Even the year we won the Fiesta Bowl, I thought this group maximized their opportunity for success. 
Showed up here first couple days, they had a lot of free time, and we allowed them to enjoy the area.   On the third day we buckled down.   The players bought in.   They did what they were told. 
We didn't have any issues from them throughout the week.   We had good leadership from our mature seniors.   They came out and played hard. 
I thought our defense was tremendous.   We were able to rush the football.   We ran for 150‑something yards.   Our goal was to be able to rush for at least 150.   We were able to get big plays.   Receivers made catches.   Quarterback set in the pocket. 
We did have a couple turnovers.   But kicker made kicks.   He missed one there at the end.   We should have centered the ball.   That was my fault.   I don't know what I was thinking‑‑ I know what I was thinking.   I was getting too greedy.   With Castleman blocking and Des running, I thought we could convert it. 
It was more of a short‑yardage formation.   I should have centered the ball up and let him kick a PAT and ended the game.   I felt bad about that once it was over. 
Other than that, I couldn't be more proud of our group.   I thought our coaches were excellent in all three game plans.   The flexibility.   We missed a couple tackles on the return.   The guy that returned the kickoff for them is a good player.   We have to continue to work on that in the off‑season.   We can't give up those big plays. 
But a big thanks to the fans, the families, everybody that followed us out here.   This was a great finish for this team, to be able to win the last game on the road, to be able to get eligible for a bowl, to prepare the right way, to come out and win. 
Have a lot of respect for Coach Petersen and Washington, always have.   Had good conversations with him during the week.   His teams are very, very well‑coached.   They're not somebody you want to go against because they're going to uncover every stone.   They know details.   That's their tradition and his tradition.   So we knew we were going to have a challenge there. 
For the most part I thought our offensive line held up fairly well against their pass‑rushers.   They got to us two or three times.   But they're really good.   You're talking about guys that have been recognized nationally. 
So it was a great win for Oklahoma State.   Just happy for the players and the fans and even that loves Oklahoma State football. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   No.91, talk about the package.   Does it have a name? 
COACH GUNDY:   Tell him what the name is. 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   It's called 'lahi,' which means big in Polynesian. 
COACH GUNDY:   We named it that for Ofa because he was upset he didn't get to carry the ball or catch a pass.   He doesn't have near the ball skills that the guy sitting next to me does. 
We named it after him and we threw it to him. 

Q.   Mike, you held the ball for 20 minutes in the first half, ran the ball well to start the game.   How important was that? 
COACH GUNDY:   We talked about it throughout the middle of the season, that offensively there were so many three‑and‑outs.   We would hit some plays, be explosive.   But you can't have five or six three‑and‑outs. 
We were having a hard time figuring out if our defense was playing good or not.   They were on the field the entire game. 
It was different tonight.   So the offense was able to use some of the clock, but also move the ball and score, allow these guys to make some adjustments and rest. 
Second half, it's almost human nature.   We have so many players on offense, you look at the score and you say, Okay, you have to play percentages.   If we get just a few stops, it will be hard for them to catch us.   So we're a little bit more conservative than what we would be.   When that happens they're going to score some.   If you look back on it, you say, Just open it up again. 
It worked out the way we wanted it to in the end. 

Q.   James and Mason, what was y'all's reaction when Coach Gundy sent in that play for you to throw it to James on the third down late? 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   Honestly, I was just ready to, you know, carry out the assignment.   I didn't think he was going to throw it to me until the middle of the way I saw the guy that was supposed to guard me, I saw him fall.   Oh, man, Mason might be throwing me the ball. 
Ended up he did.   I concentrated as hard as I could on that ball to make sure I caught.   That's the only thing I wanted to make sure I did.   I didn't care if I got yards after, I just wanted to make sure I caught it.   He did a good job of getting me the ball, putting where he put it.   I was just happy I was able to make a play for it. 
MASON RUDOLPH:   James did a great job of catching the ball, a critical first down.   Offensive line did an incredible job.   Open there all night, giving me time, getting a good push off the ball. 
When coached called that, we were focused on executing.   That's what we did. 

Q.   Des, it's been kind of a crazy, emotional couple of months for you.   What is it like to finish your career being the MVP tonight? 
DESMOND ROLAND:   It means a lot to me.   I'm sure it means a lot to the players on our team.   The coaches, they really stuck with me through 2014.   It was a real rough year.   This past season was real rough for everyone, players and the coaching staff, going with the losing streak. 
But we bounced back and we stayed focused and we stayed positive.   We ended on a two‑game winning streak.   It's good for these young guys.   They got momentum going into the season. 

Q.   The biggest question mark coming in was whether your offensive line would hold up against Washington's front seven.   Progressively as the game went on, they gained confident.   Talk about the play of the offensive line. 
MASON RUDOLPH:   Credit the offensive line.   Like I said, we ran the ball so well early, they were kind of on their heels.   Like I said, those guys on their defense are incredible.   They got a couple guys that are projected to go first round on their defense. 
We knew it was going to be a battle going in.   Our offense played great.   We ran the ball well, kind of were able to keep them guessing whether it was pass or run. 

Q.   Mike, with Mason Rudolph how impressed are you with the way he played down the stretch this season?
COACH GUNDY:   Our football team was impressed with his toughness and grit, what he put into it. 
I said this in the media press conferences during the week, that he's still a young player, and he makes mistakes.   He corrects them.   He continues to move forward. 
Our players, our quarterbacks, know that in order to play quarterback at this level, you have to be the toughest guy on the field, period, 'cause you're going to take hits.   In most cases you don't have a chance to deliver a blow yourself.   You got to be the first one off the ground.   You got to keep playing.   Your attitude, everything, confidence level has to be good. 
We're proud of him for that.   It's very unusual.   I don't know if there's another guy that's come in as a true freshman and played on the road, on the road, on the road.   But we're proud of him as well as the rest of the team. 

Q.   Mason, what has it been like for you?   You played three games, not a home game, now you've got a bowl win?
MASON RUDOLPH:   It's great.   I mean, you know, from the first game, the first game week against Baylor, the coaches and team did a great job of kind of bringing me in, getting me those critical reps that I needed to move forward. 
I think this offense as a whole kind of gained confidence after Baylor.   Took strides into obviously this game, having those extra practices back in Stillwater and here really helped out with, you know, my steps forward. 
The offense, I thought we all took a big leap.   We were able to put points on the board tonight. 

Q.   Seth, you guys had a phenomenal first half.   Take me through the game from a defensive standpoint.   After that, comment on what it's like for you to see 91 turn into an offensive star?
SETH JACOBS:   I was joking along the sideline, He's got to be the offensive MVP.   Des ran hard and did well. 
But give credit to the defensive line, everybody else throughout the defense.   Doing our job, doing what we were coached to do.   Give credit to Coach Spencer for drawing up a good game plan and everything. 
Give credit to Washington, as well.   In the second half they went in and schemed, put out some good schemes and stuff.   Got to give them credit.   They're very talented as Coach Gundy said.   Notorious for pulling out gadgets, being very detailed in what he does. 

Q.   Seth and James, Washington's coach was up here and the wording he used in the first half, he felt like the offense was kicked in the teeth by your defense.   Describe what kind of energy you felt you came out with in the first half. 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   I feel like our energy might possibly be the best we've ever had this whole year.   Seeing us come together like that, it was phenomenal. 
I think it was just the preparation we had all week.   Like coach said, this is one of our best bowl preps we've ever had.   In the past four years, I'd have to agree with him. 
Seeing how everybody connected with each other, especially the last two games, coming off that win, preparing for this bowl game, this whole bowl prep was through the roof. 
Everybody wanted to attack.   I feel like that's what we did the first half. 
SETH JACOBS:   Everybody went out there.   When we had success out there in the first half, it was fun.   We were having fun playing ball with one another.   It was just a great feeling.   We just went out, played hard for the guy next to us.   That's pretty much something that's been preached to us from the get‑go.   I'm happy about that. 

Q.   Mike, reiterate where this program is now, the total change the way the season was going. 
COACH GUNDY:   Well, we all live in a society today where people want to know what the latest results are, kind of what have you done for me lately.   I told the team that. 
Oklahoma State football is looked at differently from coast to coast than it was 10 years ago.   These guys, Des and James, have been around here, we won a lot of football games.   You can lose a few and people all of a sudden forget.   That's okay.   That's the way it is. 
So as I said earlier, the last regular‑season win and the bowl win, these two guys and the rest of the seniors, should take a lot of pride in saying, We're going to find a way to finish. 
You can say what you want, but these last two games are going to put a really good taste in the mouth of anybody that loves Oklahoma State football, loves Oklahoma State University.   Makes a big difference. 
It is what it is.   Just like during the season, when I kept getting the same questions, I was getting frustrated in the media conferences, I didn't have an answer for you, didn't have an answer for anybody, and at times I didn't feel like I had an answer for the team.   That really frustrated me. 
We were able to make a few adjustments.   But these guys made decisions to get it done.   So they put me in a better mood.   Now I'm happy. 

Q.   James, among all the games you've played, where does this one rank?
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   Being that I got to play a little offense, I'm going to have to put it up there in the top five. 
COACH GUNDY:   It's his top game, c'mon. 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   It's definitely my top game.   Coach let me get out there, catch the ball, run and block for Des, so he could punch the ball in there a couple times. 
I'm happy I just got to be a part of this community, part of this family.   These are my brothers.   Man, I'm going to remember them for life.   I can't wait to catch up with them down the road and talk about this game. 
Coach Spencer talks about that you're always going to remember your last game.   I promise you I'll remember this last game. 

Q.   Mason, you have three games playing at quarterback.   You have one play as a receiver.   Want to talk about that. 
MASON RUDOLPH:   Yeah, that was something we kind of put in the game plan in this bowl practice.   I was pretty psyched up to run it.   I never thought we would call it in the game. 
Shep made a great throw back to me.   The offensive line did a great job of blocking downfield.   I tried to get as many yards as I could.   Shep showed off his arm there.   He's got a cannon on him. 

Q.   Des, James mentioned you'll never forget your last game.   I'm sure you wouldn't have this any other way.   And, Mike, how would you sum up Des's four years?
COACH GUNDY:   I want to say first that these four guys are so classy.   I think you can tell by talking to them that this is what Oklahoma State football is all about.   These guys are well‑spoken, they talk about team, their coaches.   They don't talk about themselves.   I'm very proud of them for that. 
After I mentioned, after the Oklahoma game, the last six weeks have been tough for Des.   We all know why.   But I saw in his eyes where he was hurting for a pretty good time. 
But he came back.   Oklahoma State football and his family and his coaching staff taught him how to fight through adversity.   That's what football does.   That's what we do at Oklahoma State. 
We're together, like James said, as brothers.   You're going to get thrown curve balls in life.   You're going to have difficult situations.   Life is a marathon, it's not a sprint.   You always do what's best. 
Guy comes in the last game to get in a bowl, runs the football effectively, essentially got us set up in overtime for the game‑winning field goal.   Carries the ball 32 times in the game.   You don't see a lot of backs carrying the ball 32 times.   He's earned it.   Hopefully he's learned a great life lesson.   Hopefully the guys that have watched him have learned a great lesson so we can move on in the future. 
DESMOND ROLAND:   I wouldn't have it any other way, no matter how our record turned out.   I look back at these last three to four weeks of preparation going back to before we played OU, we really enjoyed it.   We had a lot of fun. 
We made a lot of memories.   People had to sacrifice on our team.   We couldn't be selfish.   That's the most I'm going to remember about my career. 
Of course, we won the Fiesta Bowl my freshman year.   But we really had to earn these last two wins.   Like I said, people had to make sacrifices.   That's the best part about it.   We finished on a strong note. 

Q.   James, how was Mike Gundy's dance in the locker room?
SETH JACOBS:   He didn't do it. 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   He didn't hit it today.   We might convince him to do it when we get back to the hotel. 

Q.   James, that play, how many times did you practice that?   Did you feel comfortable with it? 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   It was actually the whole bowl prep.   As soon as we started bowl practice is when we kind of threw it in there. 
All year I've been joking around, Coach, throw me in there, put me at tight end, stuff like that.   Sure enough, he let me do it.   We practiced.   Mason coached me up.   Des coached me up.   They all coached me up on technique, how to do stuff.   They did a really good job of doing that. 
We continue to practice, continue to practice.   I feel like that's why it went so well throughout the game. 

Q.   James, do you think being an offensive player is something you could have done for the last four years?
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   I think I might have been able to help out the offense a little bit here and there. 
But the offense we have right now, I mean, they did a great job throughout the year.   Yeah, we had our ups and downs, the defense as well. 
I wouldn't have minded playing the offense and helping them out a little bit. 

Q.   Now that the season is over, you can either praise him or dog him because he's a kid.   James, you and Des, comment on this guy playing quarterback. 
JAMES CASTLEMAN:   I'll have to give him his props.   I honestly didn't think a young quarterback like him would be able to come in and do the things he's done, honestly.   I thought that, but yet I was still going to be behind him, help him out as much as I could.   Boost him up, C'mon, man, you got it.   Don't worry bit. 
None of us had to do that.   He did it himself.   The play where they threw me the ball, he was like, Coach, run it again.   I saw something, let's run it again.   I saw something, let's run it again.   He was really good at trying to fix his own mistakes. 
He might be young, but he definitely played like a senior. 
DESMOND ROLAND:   You have to give credit where credit is due.   I'd have to say I'm proud of him as a player, as a freshman.   He didn't play like a freshman.   He wasn't spooked at all.   He was a leader from the start.   He was being real vocal. 
He had an amazing game today.   He's a tough guy.   I think in the first quarter, he had like a baseball‑sized bump on his left hand.   He could have easily sat out for the rest of the game.   The very next series he came back, didn't complain at all, finished strong.   He led us to the victory today. 

Q.   Mason, how has your season changed the last month?   Now you go into the season as the starting quarterback for Oklahoma State?
MASON RUDOLPH:   It's been a rise, no matter what role I've played for this team I enjoyed it, from the first game when J.W. was playing, Daxx's time.   I love these guys, this team.   Guys like Desmond, you can play with the whole year, hand the ball to him.   Never had a runningback like him in high school.   It's nice to have weapons around you to use, offensive line men, then receivers to play for you. 
It's been great three stretches.   I think there's a lot of work to be done in the off‑season, a lot of mistakes to be cleaned up for sure. 

Q.   What does the future hold for Oklahoma State football? 
SETH JACOBS:   I think it's bright.   That's what I would say.   We're going to go in.   We'll get about a week off, then we'll go back and work hard, have a good winter, good spring, good summer. 
This is a time where young players improve, prove themselves as worthy to be on the field. 
MASON RUDOLPH:   Like Coach Gundy said, we had a lot of young guys this year, a lot of young guys on defense that stepped up, took strides this year.   We're all really looking forward to next year, have an incredible off‑season, getting the guys bigger, faster, stronger, coming out in 2015 and making a statement. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
