Q. Talk about the blocking, kind of wedged up the middle.  Did you see anybody who in particular threw a good block for you?
AMBRY THOMAS: Honestly, this is our whole special teams unit.  They all did their job.  The first return, we set it up.  And that one hit pretty good.  It was like, okay, we come back.  Now we're on the field return, see what we do.  It did what we were supposed to do.
Q. What were the temptations you felt down the stretch?
AMBRY THOMAS: I knew once I got to going, I was really gone and nobody was going to catch me.  Our philosophy is see a little, see a lot and that's what I did.  I saw it a little bit.  And once I got up, I seen a lot and I just ran.
Q. When you broke that arm tackle, is that when you --
AMBRY THOMAS: Yeah, when I broke the first arm tackle, I felt I was off to the races.  The second one I really didn't see him so it didn't budge me that much.  I just knew I was gone.
Q. First kickoff return for a touchdown since Jehu Chesson in 2015.  Explosive plays have kind of been here and there, I guess.  Not anything consistent.  What do you feel that you can add as far as in terms of the explosive plays?
AMBRY THOMAS: I believe when the ball's in my hands I'm a playmaker.  And I just gotta get the ball in my hands.  I'm on special teams, just gotta do more.  If I gotta run kickoff like the Florida game, I just gotta make plays to get on that field.  That's what happened today.  Because once I made that play I just opened the distance.
Q. How much of a discussion, I guess, have you guys had in terms of putting the ball in your hands more, maybe getting more involved in offense?
AMBRY THOMAS: Not at all.
