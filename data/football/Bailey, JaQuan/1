  Q. JaQuan, sum up your emotions right now.
 JaQUAN BAILEY:   Man, like -- just -- I definitely am proud, though.  I will say that.  I am definitely proud of the way our team just kept fighting.
 Q. JaQuan, what was the difference between the first half and the second half?
 JaQUAN BAILEY:   Just simply just executing, just taking one play at a time and just playing Iowa State offense, defense.  I don't know.
 Q. You guys hold them to the field goal there late in the fourth quarter.  What's the emotion and the tension like for you guys as a defense to watch on the sideline that last drive just come up a little bit short after moving the ball?
 JaQUAN BAILEY:   Well, to be honest with you, the whole time, we all thought we were going to win it.  Then I guess the ball just didn't bounce our way.
 Q. What does it say about you and this defense to hold OU to just five punts in that second half and that last second field goal to at least give your team a chance for another comeback victory?
 JaQUAN BAILEY:   It wasn't good enough.  We still lost.  Just it wasn't good enough.  It was still some great effort, but it still wasn't good enough.
