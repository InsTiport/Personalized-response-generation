CLAY HELTON: Very proud of our football team from their preparation standpoint through the week and getting to this game, facing some adversity early.  Coming back to tie it at half-time really felt like we had great momentum going into the second half.  And then at the end of the day, mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense.
