Texas - 38, Baylor - 7
Q. It seems like every week different guys are making big plays.  Is that the sign that this defense is really evolving into something special?
CHARLES OMENIHU: Oh, yeah, I mean, we have playmakers all over the field, like from the first group to the second group to the backups to the starters.  Everyone is making plays, and that's what's been so good this year.  We're a deep team on defense, and it's lovely to see that.  One play you're in, you come out, you ain't got to worry about the guy coming in because you know he's just as good, so it's a good feeling.
Q. How big was the pick six early just for you guys?
CHARLES OMENIHU: Oh, yeah, DeShon is a bother, man.  That's a dude right there.  That's a real guy.  It was good.  It was like a jump start kind of deal where we just, all right, now it's pedal to the metal, full go.
Q. I saw you leave the field at the end of the game.  Are you all right?
CHARLES OMENIHU: Yeah, I'm good.  I'll be good.
Q. Is that the formula for this team is strong defense and kind of set up the offense with short fields, things like that?
CHARLES OMENIHU: I mean, we just -- both sides just go out there and try to do their thing.  I don't necessarily think we have a formula, just going out there, both sides playing hard, pedal to the metal, and that's what both sides are coached to do.
Q. You guys have been working so hard the last couple weeks, finally got this win.  How good does it feel?
CHARLES OMENIHU: It feels good.  Winning feels good.  It's always good to win.  We need to continue this feeling, so we'll get back to work and go on for the next opponent.
