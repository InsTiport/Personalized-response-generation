Q.   Coach, how would you evaluate officiating tonight? 
COACH PATTERSON:   I can't talk about the officiating, but I will watch it.   I'm not happy.

Q.   Your defense played pretty well after the first quarter.   How are the adjustments that you guys made in terms of being able to slow their offense down? 
COACH PATTERSON:   We had to challenge them.   Nobody had challenged them.   I mean‑‑

Q.   Offensively, you guys had trouble establishing a rhythm through a lot of the first half.   You got a little bit more of that in the second half.   What was the key to that and what were the problems?
COACH PATTERSON:   Number one, you can't have as many penalties as we had.   If you're going to do that‑‑ that's why I'm late getting here, because I'm not very happy at all.   You can't be 2nd and 15 in somebody else's house and get an opportunity to win.   So it's a really easy concept.   You have to have attention to detail and you've got to go play.

Q.   What do you think caused those penalties?   Was it the atmosphere? 
COACH PATTERSON:   I don't know, but we'll fix them Sunday.

Q.   Do you think the penalties kept the offense from doing a good job in the first and second quarter, or was it just a lack of spark? 
COACH PATTERSON:   No, I thought they hurt us all the way.   You have to give their defense credit, takeaways.   But it's really hard.   It's really hard to move the football when you're 2nd and 15, so...

Q.   How would you evaluate Trevone Boykin's play tonight? 
COACH PATTERSON:   We can't throw the ball to them.   We didn't win.   That's what quarterbacks are supposed to do.   They're supposed to win.   Last year when we turned the ball over, we didn't win ballgames.   When we didn't turn them over, we did.   Now we turned the ball over tonight.

Q.   In the fourth quarter, what do you think was the turning point?   You guys were making a nice drive and then it stopped?
COACH PATTERSON:   Well, yeah, you had the questionable fair catch which was a touchdown.   I still have to see that because nobody has seen it.   But we don't tackle the guy down the sideline.   We stop him, we have a chance to go kick a field goal and go win. 
I think you have to give them credit.   They found a way to do what they needed to do and we didn't.   You're tied up.   You've got to find a way to win.

Q.   Devonte limped off the field late in the game.   Do you know anything about his status? 
COACH PATTERSON:   He'll be fine.   He'll be fine.
