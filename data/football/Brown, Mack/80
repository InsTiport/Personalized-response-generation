<p>	Q.  Coach, you're coming off the perfect season and Gary off two tough losses.  How do you prepare your guys for such a seemingly overmatched game and not to look ahead to a National Championship?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, Vince is on Cloud 9 coming back to his hometown.  Have you spent any extra time this week pulling him aside with all the distractions he's going to have with all the family and friends here to watch him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, Gary said that he showed his team the 2001 game on the trip over.  Did you do the same with your group?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, Gary says he loves these conference championship games.  You have more to lose.  Can you tell us again your thoughts on whether or not these conference championship games are a good idea. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, just regarding Vince's background, I've read some stories he came from sort of a troubled youth here in this town.  Can you talk about what you know about that and the amazing path that he's taken to get where he is today. </p>
<p>	Q.  Home field advantage, they say there could be 60- to 65,000 in orange and white, and Colorado has a sliver of people.  Coach Barnett said earlier this is not a neutral site. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, have you talked -- how much have you talked to your team about the 2001 game?  I know there was just one guy extra that played in it. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, Vince told us he promised you that he would make sure that Texas got to this game, in part because it's in his hometown.  Can you tell us when he said it and how he said it?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, would you talk about their kicking game, and especially in a field position kind of game, how it might change your philosophy with Crosby there?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you put yourself in Gary's position for a minute and talk about what you think it's been like for him the past week to try to prepare for this game after such a bad game against Nebraska?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, after four years, can you give your impressions on Rod Wright and what he's meant to the defense, and the fact he's another Houston guy who's coming back for the Lombardi announcement?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, look at the recent history of the sports and there's so many upsets usually the last couple of weeks in the season.  Do you address that with your team and what have you done to get to the Rose Bowl?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, a lot has been written about how light-hearted you kept it this year.  How tough was that for you?  Coach Switzer doesn't remember you talking jive in '84 and '83.  Was that orchestrated by you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, are you a closed-roof or an open-roof kind of guy?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, can you talk about the progress Jamaal Charles has made?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, could you discuss your offensive line and how they have helped this running back by committing more this year?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, how much have you not shown at this point in the season?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do you think you have Brian Carter in this game tomorrow?</p>
<p>	Q.  And finally, do you assign a graduate assistant or something to start looking at USC, even though your main guys are focused on this game tomorrow with an offense like that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, can you smell the roses yet?</p>
<p>	Q.  The more you win the more outside schools will look at your staff, maybe try to raid you.  Locally, Coach Akina's name has been mentioned.  Can you talk about your assistants and the process you have to go through where you might lose some of them?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, Vince has said he's going to come back next season.  Do you envision any kind of scenario that would happen down the road where he would change his mind?  And a follow-up to that, there have been several Longhorns in the past that have had some great years up until their senior year, and they have decided to stay, and they credit you.  What do you think of that?</p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Mack, it's been a perfect season up to now.  There are still two games left.  Do you think there are still things to improve in the team?</p>
<p>	Q.  Mack, back to distractions for a second, is the Heisman something that Vince can use to his benefit and to you alls' benefit?</p>
