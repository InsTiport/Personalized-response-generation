<p>	Q.  Mack, just to clarify, what was the run you were talking about that Vince made, the one against Kansas? </p>
<p>	Q.  That game and that particular comeback, can you talk about maybe what he gained from that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what's your preference on the running back situation to replace Cedric?  Would you prefer to have one guy come into camp and just set himself apart or would you mind going with two guys if you had to? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, will you red-shirt Jamaal Charles? </p>
