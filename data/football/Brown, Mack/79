 COACH MACK BROWN:  Thank you very much.  Good morning.  We had a great time yesterday at Disneyland, and I want to thank Matt and the people at Disneyland.  We had a tremendous group of hosts that helped the kids get around after their interviews, and they just had a fun time.  It's good to be able to watch your guys in a week where there's so much attention on their football abilities go back and be kids, and they were picking at each other about which ride to be on, and it was just fun for the coaching staff to be able to watch them, and then the ESPN Zone is one of the fun things they do out here because they get to eat and play video games, and modern day kids with music and watch a football game on TV, it's a special time for them. 
 We're proud that our football team did what they were supposed to do academically and they were all able to come to the Bowl game.  It's amazing when you flip on TV at night and you see so many young people that are not eligible for their Bowl games and what an awful thing for a young man to play a lifetime to get to this point and then not be able to play, and we're proud of our guys that are 12-0 with the right to get here. 
 There's been a lot of attentions put on the distractions for this week, and very honestly, these two programs probably get as much attention day-to-day in college football as any in America.  So if there are two programs that can handle attention that some people call distractions, these kids come to SC and Texas for this kind of week, so really they embrace it, and I think our guys and it's obvious SC has done it, will play up to the expectations more than let there be distractions. 
 There's been a lot of talk about are we the away team or home team, and looking at it, very honestly when you're the home team there's more distractions because your friends are around and your family is around.  We thought sometimes it's easier to play on the road than at home. 
 I want to thank the Rose Bowl Committee and the hosting committee because they're trying really hard not to make us feel like an away team.  It is a Bowl game and they've done a great job of making our guys feel welcome and making sure that the people around them are making them feel welcome, as well. 
 As far as the SC team, I like Pete, so that makes this week easier.  If you don't like the other coach, it's a longer week, but I've always liked Pete.  I admire what he did for a long time in the NFL and he's obviously bridged the NFL to college football as good as anyone can possibly do. 
 They are the team in college football right now.  They've done a tremendous job.  You can't question what they've done, so it's easy for us to have respect for them.  And at the same time, we understand that we have an opportunity, because they're so good and we're playing so well right now, to be the team that's been the best in college football.  That's a goal that we set a year ago.  We felt like we would be playing -- we felt like we'd be back in this game, and we felt like we'd be playing SC in this game, and all of that has happened now, so it's a fun four or five days now building up to the game. 
 Q.  This year is for all the marbles.  Since last year, what's the biggest thing coming back here that you've seen so far and that you're expecting for the models and -- the national title last year was just a BCS thing, but what's the biggest thing you're looking for?
