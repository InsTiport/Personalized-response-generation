		   COACH EDSALL: A couple too many opportunities on defense on third down, you know, we couldn't get off, we didn't tackle that well on defense. 
Notre Dame is an outstanding football team, they had something to do with those missed tackles, and offensively we couldn't get a whole lot going and, same thing, dropped passes; that didn't help with the continuity of what we needed to get done. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: He broke a bone in his upper arm and we will know a little bit more after I get back out of here and talk with our doctors. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: I believe so. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: He's not going to be back ready to play, I know that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: Rest of the year.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: No, I think C.J. played well, when he came in. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: Well, it's missed tackles, it's not gettin' off on third down. Some guys not fitin' things the way we need to fit 'em. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: I thought he did some productive things. Again, just something that -- we had a couple of other guys that were banged up during the week so that's why he got an opportunity. 
 He did well with his opportunity. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: You know, every game is a different game, but you're always disappointed when you lose. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: You know, they're getting experience out there. They just have to keep working to get period of time. They're getting better, but they make mistakes, as freshmen usually do, but it's good that we got 'em out there and they're getting some playing time and they're eager, but, again, they made some mistakes tonight. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: There is always things when you watch the film that you can take positive out of the game. 
 You know, when you don't win, it's not as positive as you want to be, but there are going to be some things that we get, but we have to be more consistent. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 COACH EDSALL: That we have to just, you know, stop making some of the mistakes that we've been making week in and week out, and we have to correct those. 
 We've got to tackle better, get off on 
third down, we got to make third downs, we can't drop the ball, and you got to understand it, you
got to do the little things right all the time in everything that you do, and if you do that you 
give yourself a better opportunity to win. 
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.
