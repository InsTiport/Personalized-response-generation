SAQUON BARKLEY: We're really excited, especially coming out here and playing in the Rose Bowl, especially coming to California.  Like I said before, it's real cool right now in State College in Pennsylvania.  Experiencing new weather, go out a little bit, have fun, experience the town, I was able to go to Hollywood, see like Michael Jackson and Bruce Lee.  But just excited to play in a game like this in the Rose Bowl.  This game is special and just the tradition it holds here, and I remember growing up and watching games and watching USC and Texas go at it.  I'm just real excited to be able to play this game and represent Penn State.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: My favorite part is definitely walking in Hollywood and seeing all the stars.  I mean, that's all the stuff you see on TV, so I was actually able to experience that in real life.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
SAQUON BARKLEY: They're a really good defense up there.  Up front they're physical and big.  They have a really good nose tackle.  Obviously everyone knew Adoree' Jackson and what he was capable of doing.  The linebacking corps is really good, and they swarm to the ball.  They're fast and they're physical, so I'm excited to go against a defense like that, and it's going to be a real challenge for our offense.  I'm excited to see how we perform against them.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Not really any word because obviously we're off for like a month or so not playing football, but any mistakes that we were going to make, I think we got out in practice, get the jitters out in practice and get back into the flow, and those last two practices really helped us a lot.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, after winning that game, obviously you saw very little of your teammates and then found out we were playing the Rose Bowl, got to come and practice a little bit, get a little head start.  I feel like we're really prepared for this team, and it's going to be a really good game for us.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Definitely USC versus Texas, the Reggie Bush-Vince Young match-up or Matt Leinart-Vince Young match-up.  Definitely that game.  That's one of the games that sticks out to me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Not really when I was a kid because I was more of an NFL fan growing up, so I was more into that, but I watched college football, obviously, but I was way more of an NFL fan, so I never seen myself actually being here playing in the Rose Bowl, but the fact that you're here and to be able to play in this game, we were at the Beef Bowl the other day and they showed a video about the tradition here, and I didn't even realize how special this game was.  You hear about it, but when you actually hear the Heisman players that played here, the All-Americans that played in this game, really shows you how special this game is, and it is really special to you to be able to play in this game.  I remember sitting in that chair getting goosebumps and getting excited to play.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: My favorite NFL team growing up was the New York Jets.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Well, I didn't watch them, but when I was younger, a lot of people said I'm similar to a Barry Sanders when I was real young.  I was able to run all across the field and run back and forth.  I used to watch Barry Sanders highlight tapes on YouTube and stuff and got to know him.  But I grew up watching the New York Jets, Curtis Martin, No. 20, what's his name, Thomas Jones, a running back like that that played for the Jets and watch them grow.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I think our play speaks for itself.  You can go with that, saying that Big Ten teams are slow, but we've been really explosive this year and probably, if not the, one of the most explosive teams in the country, and like you said, Ohio State was one of the most explosive teams, too.  That reputation of the Big Ten not being fast, I think that's in the past, especially for our team.  The way we play is not that type at all.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Well, first of all, Adoree' jumps out to you right away.  I mean, he can do it all, offense, defense, on special teams.  Any time that the guy gets the ball in his hands, he can make something happen.  They're really good up front.  The front seven is really good.  They're fast and they're physical, so I'm really excited to go against them to see how we attack them and see the challenges they bring to us.   
 Q.  Do they remind you of any of the teams that you've played this year?  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I wouldn't say that.  Like you said, Big Ten football is a lot different, so I wouldn't say that they remind me of any team.  Obviously a lot of teams have similarities to each other, the way they attack each other, but I think they're going to watch a lot of film on Big Ten defense and watch the way they're going to attack us because some Big Ten teams have success against us.  But I don't really see a lot of similarities in my opinion.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: The difference, well, just give credit to USC.  They're really good.  We've faced a lot of really good defenses before, but they're really good.  They have a great cornerback over there, a great linebacker, last year was a freshman All-American, a D-tackle who's explosive and can be a game breaker if you allow him to.  All around on the defensive side of the ball, they are really good and they disguise the blitzes really well.  They blitz a lot, so we just have to prepare for them like any other game and just play our game and play how we play and start off faster, to be honest.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I mean, I'm not as healthy as I'm going to be in week whatever it is.  I think if you ask anyone in this room is 100 percent, they're going to give you the same answer, no.  If you ask anyone in the country if they're 100 percent, they're going to give you the same answer, no.  It's a grind.  The season is long, but it's what you love to do and you love doing it for a reason.  But I'm as healthy as I could be right now, to be honest.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: The thing that impresses me with 96, I can't say his name so I'm not going to try, he's just massive.  He's really big, but he's not like a big guy who just takes up space and is not elusive at all.  He's real twitchy and quick and he can beat you with a power move or surprise you with a quick spin move.  He's balanced.  As a running back you've got to be more aware of that and can't let it affect your game too much but be more aware of that guy is capable of doing that and how you're going to set up your runs and set up the defense.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: No, I don't feel like a star whatsoever.  Some people have recognized me.  I have taken some pictures, but that doesn't make me feel like a star, to be honest.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I don't think there's any extra motivation.  We always play with a chip on our shoulders.  We've always been the underdog all year, so that's just our motivation right now.  We play for each other, so we're really excited to come out, especially represent Penn State in "The Granddaddy of Them All".  We don't really need no extra motivation in my opinion.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, that's who you want to be.  You want to send the seniors off on the right note, especially after what the seniors have done for this program, a real big reason why this program is still intact and the way it is now.  So you want to send them off on a good note and you want to send them off with a win.  Obviously, we were able to send them off good on senior night, got a Big Ten Championship for them, so now we've got to go out and get a Rose Bowl for them.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: You're talking about just the bowl games in general?  Yeah, definitely, the layoff that you get, a lot of teams don't get that chemistry back together or how they've been playing all year.  You see a lot of mistakes happen that you usually don't make during the regular season, a lot of special teams mistakes on the offensive side of the ball because you haven't played football in a month whatsoever.  You've just got to come out and take it one play at a time and be patient and play your game and play how you know how to play and trust the system and trust your coaches to set you up for success.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I mean, we want to see you blow the team out to be honest, but if it ended like that, in our way -- if we win, I'm going to be excited, I don't care how, if it's 45-0 or if it's 45-44.  I just want to win, to be honest.  That's the only thing that matters in our eyes, and that's kind of the standpoint for the whole team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I don't know I have a lot of favorite movies -- I like musicals, low key, like Grease, Hairspray, but my favorite movie?  Probably Friday Night Lights, I would say Friday Night Lights.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I don't know enough about it.  I used to watch Star Wars when I was a little kid.  I haven't really been watching it, so I would say probably rated.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Actor.  Actor.  Michael B. Jordan.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Who am I closest to on the defense?  There's not really one person I'm closest to.  I have a lot of close friends on this team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Jarvis Miller, that's my roommate, J. P., Garrett Taylor, Andre Robinson, Marc Allen.  Those are probably the best guys.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I mean, it's a letdown for any team that doesn't get in the playoffs and is that close because you're a competitor and your goal in the beginning of the year is to play for a National Championship and nothing less than that.  But I mean, it wasn't meant to be that way.  We were blessed to play in the Rose Bowl, and Rose Bowl is not a bad second option whatsoever, but obviously you want to play in the National Championship, but you only can control what you can control.  We did what we had to do.  We stated our case, and the committee felt we deserved to be five, and that's the decision, and we've got to live with that and go on and can't let that affect us and play our game and come out and execute in the Rose Bowl.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I mean, yeah, the focus that's coming into this game is the same as any other game.  I think it's a key for us to continue to be like that because you can't get too hyped with the media, with the game itself and how special the game is, which the game is truly special, but if you start focusing on stuff that doesn't really relate to the game, then you catch yourself not playing how you're able to play.  We treat every game like it's the Super Bowl, and it just so happens to be that this game is "The Granddaddy of Them All".  We've just got to continue to keep our focus and come out when the game actually comes out, execute, take it one play at a time, trust in each other and believe in each other.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: When you have that O-line in front of you, as a running back, you've got to be confident.  Those are the guys that make stuff happen for you, and they've been making stuff happen for me all year.  Like I said, I think on the offensive side of the ball, we're very special, and if you look around on the field, you see a 6'6" tight end that can go up and make a one-handed catch, the best wide receiving corps in the Big Ten, and I think probably even in the country.  Trace McSorley, the best quarterback in the Big Ten and the hottest quarterback in the country the last five to six weeks, it just makes you confident there, also, too, that you've got guys around you that are playmakers that are going to make a play and at any given moment they can make a play.  And I feel like they feel like that about me, also, so the trust on the offensive side of the ball is just so high, and when you have a team that just trusts each other and is so confident in each other, that's hard to stop and hard to beat.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Really excited.  Love seeing media, love talking in front of media, so I'm excited.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I wouldn't say it was special, but as you do a couple, you get used to it, you get more relaxed and you get more comfortable.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: My family loves it.  Unfortunately they're not going to be able to make the game, but I know they're going to be here in spirit and I know they're going to be watching at home.  My sister is going to be able to make it, my mom and dad is not going to be able to.  But they're really excited for me.  They're really excited for the experience I'm going to have out here.  I always said I wanted to go to California and unfortunately we were never able to able to make it, but I'm able to get here with Penn State, so they're really excited for me.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: It exceeds my expectations.  It's Cali, downtown LA.  Our hotel is right across from Staples Center.  The only thing I haven't seen so far is a superstar or a star, but being able to walk in Hollywood last night and seeing all the stars on the ground and seeing guys like Michael Jackson and Bruce Lee, those are two of my dad's favorite people of all time, it's just special.  I don't know, it has some mojo to it I guess you could say.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Probably a Kardashian to be honest.  That would probably be the people I would like to see the most.   
 Q.  What about a sports figure?  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Sports figure?  LA Rams, Tavon Austin I guess you could say, Todd Gurley.  Who else is over here?  That's really it.  That's what comes to my mind.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I have two.  My mother and my father.  I mean, that's just an easy answer for me.  What they've done for me and my family, they've been through a lot, been through a lot of struggles, and been through a lot of adversity, but always able to fight and overcome it.  I wouldn't be the man I am today without them, so definitely them, and the reason why I play this sport or do whatever I do is for my family.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: It's going to be similar to every other game.  On the offensive side of the ball, going to make mistakes, play your game, make plays, and when the plays come to you, make it.  Defensive side of the ball, do what they've been doing all year, being great for us, making big stops for us, and special teams, be consistent.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Barry Sanders.  Like I said before, I never watched him play really because I wasn't old enough, but just watching documentaries and watching his highlight tapes and seeing how he carried himself as a person, not only as a running back, probably my favorite running back I ever saw.  I would love to be him, actually, but just the way he carried himself, after he'd score a touchdown, give the ball to the ref.  Obviously times have changed.  You can have a little fun now with your teammates, but yeah, definitely the reason he carried himself would be the reason why he's my favorite running back.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I think it would be a 10, but you've got to maintain it.  You can't let it get to you too much or let it affect your game.  Obviously I see myself getting goosebumps.  I get goosebumps a lot when I'm at social places, especially when you walk up and see the Rose Bowl sign, and then when you actually step on the field, and if you really think about the tradition and the legacy that's been on this field, it's going to give you goosebumps.  It's going to make you feel a part of something special.  I'm just happy to be able to represent Penn State in this game to be honest.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Adoree' Jackson.  I think that's a given.  He's the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year.  That guy, he's good.  He's good.  He's a playmaker.  When that guy gets the ball in his hands, you've got to be careful and be aware of where he's at at all times on the field.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, I was just talking about this with my teammates the other day.  I'm just really excited to play the game.  I mean, obviously all the stuff is cool, but I'm just really excited to be able to go out there on Monday and actually play this game.  We haven't played football in like over a month or so, so I'm just really excited to play the game, but the buildup to it is really special.  I think the Rose Bowl committee is doing a good job in my opinion showing us an experience that we would never forget.  I'm doing stuff that I've never done in my life, and it's only Friday, the morning of Friday, so we still have a couple more days left here.  But I'm just really excited to play in this game.  I mean, words can't describe how excited I am.   
 Q.  What's been the best part of the trip so far?  
SAQUON BARKLEY: The best part of the trip is just itself, coming to LA, being able to play in the Rose Bowl, practicing, and actually probably being able to spend another moment with the 2016 team.  Obviously a lot of us are coming back next year, but not everyone is coming back, so this team is never going to be here again, and we have a really good season so far, but you want to leave your mark, you want to leave your legacy with this team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Really valuable, especially in bowl games.  When you take that much time off, it can really affect you.  But I really think we got that out the first two practices so I'm glad that we had those practices and being able to prepare that early, and also the extra practices before we even came to California, get a jump start on the team, on USC.  We usually go through our normal schedule that we usually do, our Sunday, Tuesday schedule, and we're more farther ahead than we were against another team earlier in the year.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I think we're really -- like the best way to describe it is a family.  Obviously we fight like brothers and we love each other like brothers and we compete for each other, not only for the program, it's for the University of Penn State across the jersey, we compete for each other and we fight for each other and we want to be successful for each other.  That's why I really say we've been successful as a team, just the trust and the care we have for one another is really special.  It's easy to say and it sounds clichÃ©, but you really have to be in it to actually experience it and actually understand what I'm saying or feel what I'm saying.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, it just shows you how special this place really is, how special Penn State is.  The adversity that we have been through, and also credit to USC and that program.  I think we're two of the most historical programs in college football, and that just gives credit to us to show how special both programs are that we're able to overcome sanctions or whatever that quickly.  We were able to overcome ours in five years, and no one when those sanctions dropped had any mind that we would be at this point right now, but five years later we're able to play in the Rose Bowl in The Grandaddy of Them All, be 11-2, Big Ten champs.  It's special.  It's a real credit to the coaching staff, Coach Franklin, Sandy Barbour and everyone up in the higher office.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, it feels nice, and especially for myself, and I know my class, my recruiting class, we came here, we wanted to be a reason, we wanted to be a big part of why Penn State is the reason we was coming back and why Penn State is where Penn State is now.  Obviously we're not done, we're not satisfied, but being able to maintain that goal in two years and being able to play in a Rose Bowl, it's just real special, and it's what you came here for, it's what you dreamt of when you committed to Penn State.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I give a lot of credit to him, not only him, but the whole coaching staff.  They're the reason why.  Obviously you can have as many talented players on the team as you want, but if you don't have the right guys leading you and the right guys coaching you you're not going to do nothing with it.  Main thing I like he don't just focus on football or the coaching staff.  They're real heavy on school and just making you a better person and a better man and preparing you for life in general.  I've got to give a lot of credit to the coaches and definitely Coach Franklin for holding this program together, and obviously allowing me to come to this school, allowing all my brothers to come to this school, and without them we wouldn't really be here.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I'm only a sophomore so I still have a lot more time to grow, but from my freshman year to now, I've felt I have grown so much as a man and so much as a person, and I just feel better as a person, so yeah, I would strongly agree with that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I have like -- I remember the game, but the thing I remember the most would be the USC and the Texas game, Reggie Bush and those guys go at it and Vince Young leading that drive to win the game and scoring that touchdown.  It just makes you understand how special this game is.  Once this game started, once we were announced that we were playing for the bowl game, I just could not stop watching Reggie Bush highlights.  Reggie Bush is one of the greatest running backs to ever play in college football.  The fact that I'm going to be able to play at the same stage that he played on, it's just so special and means a lot to you as a running back and as a player.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Well, it's a different feel because one, it's obviously hotter.  A lot of people -- I think we're adjusted now, but you're adjusting to the layover, being three hours behind.  Earlier you're a little tired, but I think we got over that hump now, and obviously the heat, it's a lot hotter than what it is right now in State College.  That's probably the biggest struggles that we have, but I think we came over that, and I think we needed that in those first two practices and really get us in shape for this game.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: It hasn't been challenging, but I mean, you are busy.  I think the Rose Bowl committee does a really good job of having events for us, and it's not boring events, it's events that you enjoy, you have fun with, like the Beef Bowl, the historical event there, that's special, and being able to see all the Rose Bowl memories and the Rose Bowl games and the highlights of the Rose Bowl, yeah, I would say it's busy, but it's a fun, busy schedule, and that's all credit to the Rose Bowl and Penn State.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Unsung hero?  Um, I would say -- you want a player or can it be a position?  I would say the O-line, definitely the O-line, and if I had to pick a player, in my opinion who don't get as much credit as he should, that would be Brian Gaia.  He's a leader on the team.  He's the one that makes everything go.  Obviously Trace makes a lot of calls at the quarterback position, but it starts with Brian Gaia and his decision to set us up for run games, and he's been the reason why I myself and all the running backs are successful in the run game, not only him but the whole offensive line, but he's a leader there and the guy that makes the calls, and in my opinion Brian Gaia is a guy that doesn't get as much credit as he should on the offensive side of the ball.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Just itself, the game itself, the tradition of honor.  When you step on that field and if you really think about it, the history and the games that have been played here, just really special and really means a lot.  If you really think about it, I know when I step on the field, that's going to cross my mind and I'm going to get goosebumps and just be excited to play.  I'm just going to be excited to be able to represent Penn State in such a prestigious game like this.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, I stepped back and thought about the history, but it really hit me at the Beef Bowl when they showed the video of the history and the highlights of this game.  That's when it really hit me the most.  That's when I really was like, wow, I already knew the game was special, but I was like, this game is truly, truly special, like 19 Heisman players, 2,000 or something All-American players in the games.  I really sat back and I really thought about how special this game was, and it really hit me at that moment.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Definitely going to Hollywood and seeing the stars and recognizing the stars and recognizing the people and taking pictures with them and seeing the talent on Hollywood.  Reminds me kind of a lot like New York, like Times Square.   
Definitely watching the walk in Hollywood and seeing the stars and seeing the talent, that was my favorite moment so far, and obviously LA and stuff and seeing the city and taking pictures and being right across from the Staples Center.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, it's real special.  Obviously you want to compete for a National Championship, but the committee felt that that wasn't -- we didn't belong there right now, so the fact that you're able to play in the Rose Bowl and your second option is not a bad option, and to be able to play in "The Granddaddy of Them All", and like I was saying, the tradition and the history and the players that play in this game, it's just real special.  You want to send the seniors off in the right way.  Obviously we're a young team and have a lot of people coming back next year, but not everyone is coming back next year.  This is the 2016 season and it's the last game to put our impact on this team and this season and our legacy, so you want to go out with a bang.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, the first day of camp.  I was trying to be like -- I had no doubt.  The first day in camp I felt like that we were going to be able to contend for a National Championship.  It's all about us believing in each other, and we believe in each other, and we don't need outside forces to help us motivate us to play the game.  We've been underdogs all year, but yeah, since the first day of camp I really thought that we could be National Championship contenders.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, the Big Ten compares a lot to the Rose Bowl.  In my opinion, and I think a lot of people agree, Big Ten is the toughest conference in college football this year, and being able to go against teams such as Ohio State, Michigan, Indiana, Michigan State and so on and so on really prepares you for any game that comes your way in the off-season.  So I would really say that they really have done -- Big Ten, our competition really did a really good job of preparing us to play the next game.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: We made a huge step from last year.  Honestly we all were bought in last year, and I feel like this year we really are all bought in, and we really understand how special this group is and how talented we are and the opportunities that are in front of us.  We worked hard.  It's so much better when you see the time and effort you put in actually come forth and be able to have a successful season.  I feel like we grew a lot in his three years and my two years.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Special.  It really hit me when we were at the Beef Bowl.  I thought about it when I went home, but when I saw the tradition and the legacy and the history here, it really hit me how special this game is, and the fact to be able to play in this game and represent Penn State, it just makes it even more special.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Jarvis Miller?  You actually went up and talked to then?  Yeah, Jarvis Miller, I think he's me.  Not for me, I don't get too much into it, but no, I love Jarvis to death.  That's my roommate.  I see him as like my little brother.  He won't agree with that, but yeah.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah.  It was one of those events that he was going to come home, but you look at so many times for you to go home yourself, so you've got to take full advantage of it.  But I'm pretty sure I'll make a trip to Connecticut some way, somehow and he'll make a trip to Pennsylvania where I live.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: No, my parents were not able to make this game.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I'm pretty sure I can give you a phone number, but I have to ask Kris Petersen first.  If Kris Petersen allows me to, then I'm allowed to.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I would say we're very explosive.  At any given moment, a big play could happen.  We're fast.  I believe we're physical, too.  That's one word, but one word to describe it would be explosive.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: I feel like he has like kind of -- I won't say he's Johnny Manziel, but he has that Johnny Manziel factor, can make a whole lot of something out of nothing.  There's been plays when plays were dead, and he would use his feet to scramble and look downfield and give an incredible ball and a wide receiver would go make a play.  It was funny sometimes being back there and watching him scramble and make a play, like whoa, how did he just do that.  He's a heck of a player.  He's a great quarterback, and he's a great player and a great leader for this team.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: Yeah, as a running back you don't want to be one-dimensional, or I don't want to be one-dimensional.  I feel like I have the talent to be able to catch the ball in the backfield, run downhill, run outside zones or use my speed.  I want to be an all-around back.  Actually I'm not satisfied where I'm at.  I want to continue to grow to be better.  I'm only 19 years old so I have a lot of room for improvement.  But yeah, you don't want to be one-dimensional.  You want to be an all-around back.  You want to be able to do it all.  In my opinion, that's how Reggie Bush was.  You kind of want to be a back like that.  Yeah, that's something I want to do.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
SAQUON BARKLEY: You get a little excited but you can't get too excited and show your tendency that the play is coming.  But you can see it, and when you know you're going to get matched up with a linebacker, you've got to win.  You've got to win your one-on-ones, and that's really what the game of football is about.  Being able to get the opportunity -- when you see the opportunity, that opportunity comes, you've got to take full advantage of it and not get too excited because you can miss a play and the play might not end how it should be.  I do get a little excited but I try to keep it inside and hold it in.  Sometimes the wheel route, I might not be open and it my set-up something for some other guys, too.
