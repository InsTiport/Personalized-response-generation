<p>	Q.  Marcus, before the season started there was a lot of questions surrounding the defense and now you hold the number-one scoring offense to 14 points.  Talk about the defense's performance. </p>
<p>	Q.  I have a two-part question; one for Matt, the other for Justin.  First for Matt Mauck, having won the National Championship, does it make it easier for you to make your decision to return having won it; and second for Justin, as a freshman, how do you feel winning the Most Valuable Player and winning a National Championship. </p>

<p>	Q.  Justin, could you talk about your touchdown run and why you had so much trouble running in the second half?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin, you were so far down in the running back order at the beginning of the year, can you talk a little bit just about the change and what this means to you?</p>
<p>	Q.  Justin, a year ago you were watching games from the stands; can a kid from Lake Charles, Louisiana have scripted a better ending?  </p>
<p>	Q.  For Matt and Marcus:  A lot of USC players made a point of saying they weren't even going to watch this game.  What would you say to them right now.  Do you consider yourself a national champion or the national championship or are you willing to share it?</p>

<p>	Q.  For Matt, Matt, you just said a minute ago you wanted to thank Coach Saban and his staff for the time and effort they put in.  I think during the telecast Brent Musberger said he attended the practices yesterday and he said your team was the most prepared and just went off like clockwork.  Could you elaborate on what the preparation was that you did ?</p>
<p>	Q.  First play from scrimmage Justin broke off a 64-yard run.  In terms of setting, making a statement, setting a tone for the game, how important was that in terms of the way that the evening progressed?</p>
<p>	Q.  For you personally, has the magnitude of what just happened sunk in or do you think it's going to take a little while for that to sink in? </p>
<p>	Q.  Some coaches advise players to return or some coaches advise players to leave.  What will you do in Matt Mauck's case, given the fact that he will be eligible to return for next season.  Will you ask him to return or leave that up to him?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk a little bit about what caused the problems with penalties and the mistakes that were made tonight?</p>
<p>	Q.  Do your earlier statements mean that you're still going to hold yourself to the 24 hour rule?</p>
<p>	Q.  When you took the job could you have ever imagined the passion that this state has for LSU football; and the fact that you won the National Championship now, talk about how it feels to take it to that next level?</p>
<p>	Q.  You talked about competitive character, your team's ability to withstand some adversities tonight; where does that come from?</p>
<p>	Q.  Oklahoma was coming up quick and quick snapping, what adjustment did you have to make there; and secondly do you think this will now merit you a national sponsorship with the Little Debbie Company?</p>
<p>	Q.  Could you talk about Travis and Corey and how their play at cornerback, press coverage affected not only this game, but the way they improved and influenced the success of your defense?</p>
