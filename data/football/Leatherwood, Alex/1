Q. There was a lot of talk about what you guys wanted to do. You wanted to come back and you really wanted to make this year about winning.  Talk about the discipline it took the entire year and with the distractions, and just what it meant for you to come back and have this opportunity?
ALEX LEATHERWOOD:   I mean, just like you said, there were a lot of distractions:  COVID, the off-season workouts, the whole nine yards.  It was an unprecedented year with a lot of adversity.
But we just stayed the course, you know what I mean.  Tried to stay focused and took everything day-by-day and really got everybody bought in and locked into what we wanted to achieve and we came out victorious.
Q. It meant a lot for you to come back and get this done.  Reflect on your years at Alabama and what has the coaching staff meant to you and what do you take away from your career here?
ALEX LEATHERWOOD:   I mean, looking back on it, it's some of the best years of my life.  I feel like I learned a lot throughout the years about myself as a player and about people and just a lot of things, how to handle adversity, how to work hard, how to do a lot of things, you know what I mean, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
I don't regret coming back, and I love everybody on this team and all of my past teams because you just don't get the opportunity to have a family like this, you know what I mean.  College football is special and I'm glad I got to be a part of it.
