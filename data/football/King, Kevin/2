Q. No one is really giving you a chance against number one.
KEVIN KING: Well, I mean, that's the thing.  It's the way we play.  Our mindset is we assess ourselves as the hunting.  We've got to see ourselves as the hunted.  Those guys are going to go out there and get after it every play, get after it every game.  So it's just another game, another opportunity to go get that done.
