Q. You have to play a quarterback that has really progressed throughout the year, but he's a true freshman.  Jalen Hurts is a true dual threat for Alabama.  Watching that guy on film, what jumps out about Jalen Hurts?
KEVIN KING: Definitely got a strong arm, capable of making every throw on the field and he's definitely got -- can hurt you in the run game.  So to do both those things can hurt you.  So we got to contain him.
Q. You guys have been here since this past weekend.  You got here on Christmas Day.  Bowl activities abound.  I know they have something fun for you to do every single day.  What's your favorite moment so far at the Peach Bowl?
KEVIN KING: I'd probably say going to the Ebenezer Baptist Church, just being able to see, you know, a lot of the civil rights activists who are right there, right-hand man to Dr. King and somebody I looked up to very much.  Being able to see them and hear them, that was great.
Q. Kevin, how have you guys changed the culture of Washington?  A couple years ago, Chris Petersen comes in.  Last year, you're a seven-win football team.  Yet the expectations from the outsiders were pretty high.  You guys lived up to it.  How did the culture change at Washington?
KEVIN KING: I just think everybody bought in.  Coach Pete has a very unique system.  He teaches and coaches very well, and I think everybody bought in.  Nobody -- we don't have any outsiders.  Everybody's one with the team.  I think that shows how we play.
