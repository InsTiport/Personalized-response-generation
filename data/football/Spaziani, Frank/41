   THE MODERATOR: We'll bring on Coach Spaziani. Coach, just a brief opening message and then we'll go to questions.   
 COACH SPAZIANI: Thank you.   
 Well, we're obviously pleased with last week. We're looking forward to playing Kent State. We've been on the field with them a few times before, so we understand the challenges ahead of that.   
 With that, any questions.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about your quarterback situation, how they played in the opener against Weber State?  
 COACH SPAZIANI: Here's how we feel about our quarterback situation: we've obviously improved it from where we were, but we still have competition there. We're looking forward to seeing how that plays out.   
  
  Q. How is Mark Herzlich doing after his first competitive game in several months?  
 COACH SPAZIANI: Well, he's out practicing. He seems to be full-go. We're hoping for an improvement.   
  
  Q. What type of improvement do you need to see from Dave to kind of make you think he's the guy to carry on?   
 COACH SPAZIANI: Well, we need to see management of the game to our satisfaction. There's a lot of things that aren't visible to the fan or media looking in the stands. There's a lot of little things that need to be cleaned up.   
  
  Q. You're still kind of unsettled with the quarterback decision, I guess?  
 COACH SPAZIANI: Right.   
  
  Q. How do you think Mark played? Were you surprised that he got in as much as he did?  
 COACH SPAZIANI: You know, I'm very surprised that he was able to run out of the tunnel from where he came from. So we're very pleased that it worked out for Mark, that he was able to get back on the field.   
 Having said that, he only had a few days of practice before. I mean, the circumstances, he has to work himself into game shape and a lot of other things besides not playing for two years or whatever it was.   
 THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for being with us. We look forward to talking to you next week. Good luck this weekend.   
 COACH SPAZIANI: Thanks. Take care.   
 THE MODERATOR: This concludes today's edition of the ACC football coaches teleconference. We'll be back next week for our edition at 10:30 a.m.
