 Q.   How big a factor is prepping for conditioning and pace for you guys?  
COLLIN KLEIN:   I mean, it's going to be important.   Obviously they play fast.   We've played against some teams that like to play fast, go upâ€‘tempo.   
We know it's coming.   It's just about preparing hard, doing the best we can.  
   
 Q.   Have you adjusted out on the field practicing?  
COLLIN KLEIN:   We try to practice as fast as we can any week.   Just more reps for us in all facets.   
It's definitely in our minds.   We're preparing for it.   There's no magic formula or nothing.   
   
 Q.   What is the MO of this defense from your perspective?   
COLLIN KLEIN:   From their defense?   
   
 Q.   When you look at their defense.   
COLLIN KLEIN:   I mean, they're a good football team.   Really good football team.   It is like they are do a lot of different things.   Can't hang your hat on one thing.   Force turnovers, pressure the ball, have athletes that can run around, cause havoc, give you a lot of different looks.   
We're going to have to play well.  
   
 Q.   Any teams you faced earlier this year that they remind you of?  
COLLIN KLEIN:   Each team has its own unique identity.   There's some similarities here and there, et cetera.   They're their own animal.   We know that.   Just preparing the best we can.
