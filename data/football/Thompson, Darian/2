  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
DARIAN THOMPSON:   As long as we do our job individually, I feel like we'll be okay. 

Q.   Talk about Coach Yates. 
DARIAN THOMPSON:   He's brought a lot to this team.   He has tremendous experience.   He's extremely intelligent.   He knows exactly what he's talking about.   I really enjoy having him as a coach because he's been through it all.   He's leading us to great places. 

Q.   Did you know him before he got here?
DARIAN THOMPSON:   He recruited me.   When he was at Boise State, he recruited me, then left to A&M, now he's back. 

Q.   What did you think when you heard he was coming back?
DARIAN THOMPSON:   I thought it was great.   I thought it was great for the coach that I came in with to be able to be here with me through my last years. 
It's been tremendous working with him. 

Q.   You give up 35 points or whatever, how do you find the confidence in the fourth quarter to make that stop?
DARIAN THOMPSON:   We just can't never give up.   We gave up 35 points.   I mean, how do we know the offense isn't going to score 36.   We just got to keep on playing every single play, every down, play as a team, play as a unit. 

Q.   Is there a guy on the Arizona offense that stood out to you watching film?
DARIAN THOMPSON:   I think the quarterback is the Commander‑in‑chief.   He does a great job running the offense.   He's the big play‑maker, I believe. 

Q.   Will he scramble to make plays in the pass game or take off and run?
DARIAN THOMPSON:   He does both.   He'll run the ball.   If he drops back to pass, gets pressure, he'll find a way to keep the play alive with his feet, find a receiver downfield.
