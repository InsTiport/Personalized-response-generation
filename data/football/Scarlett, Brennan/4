 Q.  Did they do anything you didn't expect or what was it like trying to defend those guys?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Didn't really do too much we didn't expect.  But as a defense, had a few misfits, missed assignments and they busted a couple big plays on us.   
 Q.  You played a great game though, you really did.  You really looked good.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Thank you.  I appreciate that.   
 Q.  You got after Adams.  You sacked him at least once, didn't you?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah.  I guess.  Couple times.  A shout out to the DB's.  They're back there covering their butts off.   
 Q.  But there was some key sacks, just a couple of big plays that didn't work out.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah.  Wanted to get that victory.   
 Q.  How did you think their offensive line was?  Did you think they were big and tough?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah, I think they're a good unit.  Definitely, they're no easy task.  We prepared this week, hard for them, knowing that the Ducks, Oregon's a great team, with a good O line.  So we came in prepared for it.   
 Q.  Obviously, you could win the PAC-12 north next week and there's still a lot to play for.  It's probably going to be on the fifth-year senior guys to keep moving forward, do you think?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah, right.  As we say, it lasts 24 hours, we will view film, see what we can do to improve for next week.  And then it's on to the next one.  Try to go get that PAC-12 championship.   
 Q.  For you does it have special meaning?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: I would be lying if I said that it didn't.   
 Q.  What are you thinking about?  It's kind of interesting, don't you think?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah, it's definitely going to be an interesting day.   
 Q.  You must know a lot of those guys, right?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah.  I know all of them.  Some of those guys I played with for four years.  So good guys over there.  But we'll prepare this week, I'll prepare this week.   
 Q.  So you are going to be playing for us though, right?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Oh, yeah.  Come on.   
 Q.  That was a joke.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Come on.   
 Q.  Is this something you put out of your mind until now, now that the game's here.  Have you been able to not think ahead to the big game?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah, definitely, I've been taking every week one at a time.  Every week try to go 1-0.  And now this week, nothing changes.  So we'll get after them.   
 Q.  I wish you luck.  You could stay and get a Ph.D. and play a couple more years.  
 (Laughter.)   
 I don't know if the NCAA is going to let me do that.   
 (Laughter.)   
 Q.  I really enjoyed watching you play.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Thank you.   
 Q.  Your brother plays here too, doesn't he?  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah, he's actually a freshman here.   
 Q.  That's great.  Your whole family must be proud.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: They all came out for the game.   
 Q.  That's great.  I'll bet they will be here next week, too.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Oh, yeah.   
 Q.  Thank you very much.  
BRENNAN SCARLETT: Yeah.  No problem.
