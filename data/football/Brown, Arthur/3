  THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   You've faced fastâ€‘paced teams this year.   Physically, how do you stay with the team?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   It's all about preparation throughout the week.   I'm confident in what our coaches have planned for us, that we'll be ready to play this game at a high level.   
   
 Q.   Did you go back and watch the Baylor tape a lot?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   You know, we definitely focused on what we needed to correct from that game.   Once we got to the point where it was time to move on, we definitely did.   
There was definitely a lot to learn.   We missed assignments.   
   
 Q.   How much can you learn from what Stanford did to Oregon?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   Our coaches did a great job of keeping the game inside the white line, I say, but off the edges, contained them in that manner.   That's something we take note of.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
ARTHUR BROWN:   He's impressive.   Shifty.   I really haven't seen a player that has been as shifty as he is.   Like I said, I'm definitely up for the challenge.   
   
 Q.   Is that one of the first things you did is watch the Stanford tape?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   No, I wouldn't say it was the first thing we did.   
   
 Q.   What do you think your strength is?   What are your strengths?   
ARTHUR BROWN:   I would say sideline to sideline having a (indiscernible) pursuit to the ball.   I need to play my own assignments soundly.   
   
 Q.   When the head coach of the other team says you're the best linebacker they faced all year...   
ARTHUR BROWN:   Playing for Chip Kelly is truly an honor.   It's something that comes with our preparation.   I have a lot of great support, as well.   
   
 Q.   Your family, are they going to be in Arizona?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   Yes, sir.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to stay in contact with the program after you leave?   Is that something you want to do?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   Definitely.   Like I said, that's something that I really admire in the Miami program, they have a lot of their guys coming back, spending days with the program.   I think that would be great for Kansas State if me and some other guys come back to the program.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel like Manhattan will always be a home for you?  
ARTHUR BROWN:   It always will be.   I've had great experience.
