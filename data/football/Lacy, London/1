LONDON LACY:   All week, it was just about executing.   Execute some plays but not as much as we'd like them to.   
   
 Q.   I mean everybody gets excited when an FCS school upsets an FBS school.   But most of the time it's kind of like this.   Do you still want to play in these type of games against these type of teams when the odds are really stacked against you?  
LONDON LACY:   Oh, yeah.   I mean, as a team, we're competitive.   Any situation we're put in, we're going to fight as hard as we can, despite who the team is.   We're still going to play Aggie football, just compete.  
   
 Q.   How about health‑wise, you guys come out of this pretty good, do you think?  
LONDON LACY:   We're fine.   Take care of some guys, just get back, get ready for next week.
