<p>	Q.  Coach, they mentioned they expected you to run the ball, and you came out passing.  How much of a difference did that make? </p>
<p>	Q.  How surprised were you about the turnovers that A&amp;M had today?  Uncharacteristic of that team. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, you talked earlier in the week about Rick.  I guess was this the perfect ending to it? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick, could you talk about this day, what it was like for you.  There were a lot of stories during the week about how you had persevered and all that.  I saw a quote where you said you expected them to make you throw the ball.  Obviously that worked pretty well for you. </p>
<p>	Q.  Gerald Riggs, I talked to you earlier this week about what it's like coming into a team's backyard and winning the game, watching their fans leave.  As far as the games go, you said you did it at Tennessee, you did it at Florida.  Now you've done it here at Texas.  What was the feeling like watching their fans leave in awe of being beating 38-7? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach Fulmer, you went into some quick counts.  I don't know if you were trying to keep a certain defensive package in.  They had people moving around.  Was that one of your game plans to get them to start in a defensive package? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, what about the fact, I know you talked through the week about wanting Bowl success because you've had some recent Bowl failures.  Your team looked excited early, coming out, jumping up.  Did you put a lot of emphasis on everybody getting into the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, the Auburn game in Knoxville seemed to be a turning point.  Since that, both sides of the line really seem to have stepped up and had a much bigger impact, played at a higher level.  Were there adjustments that you made out of that or anything you point to that you'd attribute that success to? </p>
<p>	Q.  Rick, was there anything that you did specifically or anything you saw in A&amp;M's defense that you were able to exploit out there? </p>
<p>	Q.  It looked like you defensive guys were getting a strong push into the backfield on the majority of the plays.  Were you surprised at all that you were able to essentially push Texas A&amp;M around like you did? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, your team is a Bowl veteran team.  You guys are used to this.  You've been doing it for 16 straight years.  A&amp;M is not?  What kind of impact did that have on the game? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the defense, you guys were able to keep their big play-makers, Terrence Murphy and Reggie McNeal, Courtney Lewis, pretty much shut them down.  Can you talk about how you were able to be complete in taking all three of those guys pretty much out? </p>
<p>	Q.  Kevin, can you talk about after their two early turnovers, especially the second one when you tore McNeal's helmet off, he seemed a bit rattled, maybe begun shy, but he was definitely thinking. </p>
