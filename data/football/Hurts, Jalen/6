 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: (Chuckles.)  Hello, Damien.  What was that, sir?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We're kind of experienced.  We've been here before, and going into this game we want to use it as an advantage.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Um, you know, just got the experience and all the stuff that comes with the game, just it being a great environment, and I expect another great environment this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think like all the other games you want to approach it the same.  The objective is to win, and that's what I'm sure he wants to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: You can't put it higher than any other.  You have to approach it just like the others and as far as preparation, that's the same.  You want to be as prepared as you possibly can be and be ready to play.   
 Q.  Just win.  My job is to win and to try my best to lead the team and do so.  
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I feel fine.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Like I said, just approaching it the same way.  Doing the best I can to lead my team, be a team player, execute offensively, just doing the little things, so hopefully we can come out on top this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think everything happens for a reason.  I think we've earned it.  Everybody put a lot of work in this off-season.  We made the decision that we were going to do anything and everything to get the opportunity again and here it is.  We've got to do what we can to take advantage of that.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think naturally you're going to improve with natural maturity, with experience, being able to learn from -- take certain situations and learn from them, I think that improves you all around and all around in your game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: For sure, for sure.  I think the game slows down, you know, the longer you're in it.  So I think that's helped.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think they're a very experienced be unit.  A lot of guys have experience, a lot of older guys, they're fast, they play really good defense.  I mean, crazy stats, you know, they do it all.  They do a good job of doing what they're coached to do so for us offensively we have to be ready to go against that.  We have to prepare and know what we need to do to execute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: It's the national championship game.  It's a game -- it's another game that we need to win.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They make plays when needed to, they play plays, they make catches, they play throws and blocks, they do what they're coached to do.  Just like Calvin does.  Calvin happens to get all the catches, that's what he's coached to do.  We're just trying to do a good job of doing what Coach asks us to do and go out there and play our hardest and execute the best we can.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I've said at this podium before I know how it feels.  I'm kind of experienced with it.  I want to use that and -- take it and use it as an advantage and kind of use it to where it can help me, benefit me.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think regardless, where it being a national championship game, both teams are going to come out ready to go, both teams are going to give it their all.  There's going to be a physical game, everything is going to give it their all and we have to come out ready to play and do our job.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I don't really like it but it is what it is.  People are going to say what they want.  I can't help that I'm at 223, really strong and can run well, I can't help that, but it is what it is.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I'm just playing ball.  If it so happens to be that I have to make a play on my legs then I make the play.  If it's hard to catch me then I guess it is.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just approaching it like we have all the others.  Nothing really changes.  You just want to be best prepared and be ready to play and be ready to execute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Everybody's dream is to go play at the next level, obviously.  I think that's why we come to Alabama so we can have the opportunity but there is no telling, honestly.  You always have goals and dreams, but I'm taking it one day at a time.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think that's always the goal is to win a national championship.  I think every off-season for every team around the country that's what they strive for and work for.  To be fortunate enough to be in this situation that we are, we have the opportunity and we want to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: It will mean a lot.  It will mean a lot for this team.  We worked so hard for it.  We worked so hard to be in this situation so like I just said, we want to take advantage of the situation that we have.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They're fast, they have a lot of experience.  They're a good team.  You look at all the stats for a defense they're right up there in every stat.  They do a really good job of doing what they're coached to do and as an offense I think we have to be ready to execute against a really good defense.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think the key to the game is being able to do your job.  If you can do your job, execute to the best of your abilities and do it effectively, be efficient, kind of -- just be dominant.  That will be the key for us.  That's how we try and play and that's how we try and approach every game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I mean, it's college football.  I guess that can happen any week.  They're a good defense, regardless of last week's turn out or whatever.  They're a really good defense and we respect them.  We expect them to come in full affect on Monday.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I get it when I can.  It gets interesting at times but, you know, it's all easy to enjoy.  Everybody loves winning, and hopefully we can finish this thing off how we want to.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: All due respect I don't want to talk about Auburn.  We're in the national championship game and if you want to talk, let's talk about Georgia.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I know y'all have heard Coach Saban talk about the short turn-around, and it is, but we've got to handle it as pros and be best prepared.  We have to prepare with the time given and be ready to play.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Anything can happen.  Anything can happen.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I just think, you know, we'll try and go out there, execute, be smart with the ball.  We do a lot of ball security drills in practice, maybe that's paying off.  I think that's something we harp on a lot and I think that's something we have done a good job with this year.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Um, just me being the person I am.  I mean, I don't let too much bother me.  It's easy for me to brush things off, I guess.  Just going out there and doing my job.  I always say everybody in my building, everybody in my complex, everybody knows what's going on, regardless of what the outside world may think, everybody knows what's going on inside the building, and that's all that really matters.   
 Q.  College football is so competitive and there is little margin for error.  Every year Alabama seems to be in the championship game.  Why are they here?  
JALEN HURTS: I think it starts from the top with the head coach, Coach Saban.  He does a great job of setting the tone and making it known how he wants things done.  I think as players we do a great job of buying in to what he asks us to do and he's been doing this thing for a long time.  He's very experienced, and he has -- he has all the right credentials.  So we just trust in him, trust in the process, and it will take you a long way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: That's always the standard and the goal, not the expectation, because first expect to be here, that's disrespecting the game and disrespecting everybody else working for the same goal.  I think it's just something we work for.  We put a lot of work into.  I guess if we work hard enough we get it, I don't know.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Don't lose.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just don't want to lose.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I mean, they're kinda one of a kind, I guess.  They do it really good.  They force a lot of interceptions, they rally to the ball, they have a front seven, a Butkus Award Winner, they have it all.  So for us to come out as an offense, we have to be ready to play against a stout defense.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think our offensive line is kind of -- I think they've done a good job all year.  They get a lot of criticism, too, like everybody but those are my guys.  I trust 'em.  I wouldn't go out to war with anybody else.  They do a great job of doing what they're asked to do, and I know they have my back.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I just like putting points on the board.  I just like putting points on the board.  Whatever it takes to win.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I mean, it's the national championship.  It's the biggest game of the year.  If you can't get up for that, I don't know what to tell you, honestly.  I don't know what to tell you.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I just think we have to be ready to play, regardless.  Georgia is going to be ready to play, regardless of if they've been here before or not.  For us, we have to approach it as another game, and we have to be ready to do our job.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We can't let that affect us.  We won't.  We'll just have to go out there and play and execute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Execute.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I'm sorry, what was that?   
 Q.  Your strength coach smashing last year's -- what did that say to you guys?  
JALEN HURTS: Talking about the video?  I think -- I mean, we don't want to just participate in this game.  We have kinda been here and done that.  That's not something we really want to experience again.  So coming into a national championship game, the goal is to win, and that's what we've been working for.  That's our goal and that's what we want to try to accomplish.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Doesn't matter where you practice.  I mean, gotta play on Monday.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They're fast, physical, experienced, and they do a good job of doing what they're coached to do.  So for us offensively we have to be ready to play against a stout Georgia defense.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Everybody is their own, everybody is one of a kind, everybody has their own traits but I think they're a really good defense and they do a good job of stopping people offensively.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: He's fast, he rallies to the ball, he's a really good tackler, he's a great defensive playmaker.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  How has Coach Saban helped you block out the noise being the quarterback in at Alabama?  
JALEN HURTS: It's not that hard to block out.  Y'all can hype up whatever y'all want, it's nothing to me.  Between me and Coach Saban, that's understood.  The biggest thing for me and Coach Saban, I need to execute, I need to do my job.  All the other stuff that comes with it is kinda understood that that doesn't affect me.   
 Q.  A lot of people talk about how hard it is to play for Coach Saban, do you find that to be true?  
JALEN HURTS: He expects a lot.  He does a great job, he's a great coach.  He's one of the greatest.  He has a lot of respect in the game of football, but, you know, he's one of a kind.  He's one of a kind.  He does things his way, and his way is usually the right way.  So I think it's big that if he's going to coach you, that you trust in him.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: A little bit more experience, I guess, but experience comes with natural maturity, kind of increases how poised you are and overall ability, you know, that's what we work on all off-season.  So I think my overall game has improved, and I think it's helped this team.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We want to use it as an advantage.  Kinda been here before, and we just want to use it as an advantage.   
 Q.  What's the best part of this experience?  I know you did it last year but what's special to you being able to play on stages like this?  
JALEN HURTS: Just being able to soak it all in.  It's a new team every year.  You have to understand that there are freshmen that have never experienced this before and for this team, we want to soak it in and have fun with it.   
 Q.  Everybody spoke last year about your poise as such a young player, and we are all like okay, he's developed as a down field passer, all those things.  I want to know as a leader, how have you matured the most, and in what way has that impacted the team the most this year?  
JALEN HURTS: I guess toward the end of the season maybe last year, I started to come out of my shell, I guess, and being a leader, more vocal, I guess, and since then it's kind of improved and it's always kind of gotten better and transformed to where I'm a dominant leader on the team.  I think I try to use this as a helpful thing, trying to be a servant leader, being helpful, helping my guys out, trying to indicator to them.   
 Q.  What do you have to do Monday night, you have to do Monday night to win a national championship?  
JALEN HURTS: Go out there and execute.  Execute and do my job and just play my game.   
 Q.  Have fun.  Good luck.  
JALEN HURTS: Thanks.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just film study, getting reps at certain plays, going out there and practicing, practicing hard every day.  Every time I get the opportunity to touch the field I want to practice with a purpose and that purpose is to improve.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: He's a great receiver.  He makes plays, he knows how to get open, and he's a really good -- really good player and a really hard player to stop.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Well I would say that it's two different games.  High school is high school, and college is college.  I don't think the two compare at all.  College football is a much faster game, bigger guys, playing with bigger guys.  It's all different.  I don't think that's a good comparison.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I don't think so.   
 Q.  What's the difference between this team now compared to this team last year?  
JALEN HURTS: Well, I think last year's team, you hear Coach Saban say it all the time lost our identity toward the end of the season, lost focus and this year we don't want to lose any focus, we want to remain focused and remain having that laser focus and keep the goal in sight.   
 Q.  How are you maintaining your focus?  
JALEN HURTS: Just locking in, you know, worrying about what I need to worry about and focusing on executing and leading my offense.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Go out there and play.  We've been doing a good job of preparing.  Just go out there and play our game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just play, that's all, just play.   
 Q.  What is the identity of this team now?  
JALEN HURTS: I don't know.  I guess we'll find out after this game.  I'll answer that question later.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think that's just with time, experience, being able to experience certain things, being more mature and being more comfortable in certain situations, being able to handle certain situations, being more comfortable in them.   
 Q.  Were you nervous last year at this point and where are you this year?  
JALEN HURTS: Last year I don't think I came into the game nervous, but looking back on it now I can say that that's a different guy.  That's a different quarterback from where I am now.  Was I nervous?  No.  But am I a different quarterback?  Yes.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Certain things that are unspecified.  You can't really pinpoint 'em.  But gradually and over time there have been strides made and improvements and we want to use everything we have as a team, everything that a player has personally as an advantage.   
 Q.  Do you think this is the best defense you've seen so far this year?  
JALEN HURTS: I think they're a really good defense.  They do a lot of really good things, make all the right plays defensively, turn the ball over, play fast, and they're an experienced unit.  So for us, we have to be ready to play against them.  They're really stout.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Yeah, well, I mean, last year we lost in the national championship game, we let that game go.  This year we let one go against Auburn.  Hopefully that's the only game we let go this year.   
 Q.  Is that the ultimate chip on your shoulder as far as motivating you guys?  
JALEN HURTS: I'm not really focused on Auburn, but for us, we want to win the game.  We have an opportunity of a lifetime.  These things don't come around every year.  Nothing is guaranteed.  So for the opportunity we have right now, we want to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: It's nothing.  It's just kinda something you smile at and just go back to work.  Just go to work.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: No.  Everybody is going to say what they want, everybody is going to have the opinion that they want to have.  That's fine with me.  At the end of the day the sun will still rise in the morning and for me, I have to go out there and go to work every day, go to work with my team, lead my team and try and win games.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Everything happens for a reason.  Last year I guess we weren't meant to be national champions, whether it be one play away or four seconds away, whatever it was.  Right now we have an opportunity that we want to take advantage of.  We're here, and we want to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: As far as what?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I just learn to embrace everything, embrace it and take it all in.  As far as going out there and playing on the field, just go out there and play.  Nothing changes.  Trust in your preparation, trust in the play caller, trust in your guys around you and go out there and play, execute.   
 Q.  You guys know so much about each other.  Do you have to do something different this time around?  
JALEN HURTS: No, I just think for us we have to go out there and play our game, play our game and trust in our preparation and trust in our coaching and trust in the team, trust in everything.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They're closer to here so I guess so, but we're three hours away, it's not too far and our fans do a great job of traveling.  We expect them to be there live and in full affect.   
 Q.  How does Georgia's defense compare to what you face in practice every day?  
JALEN HURTS: I guess they're quite similar.  Our defense and their defense is very experienced unit, fast, physical, good linebacker crew, good front seven, good DBs so it's a lot of similarities.   
 Q.  What do you think of the President coming to town?  
JALEN HURTS: That's cool.  That doesn't change what I have to do to win the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I missed it, but I saw the video.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: No, I think it's a big game, it's the national championship game.  We have the opportunity to do something really special and as a team I think that's something we want to take advantage of.  We want to take advantage of this opportunity that we have.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Be ready to support, be loud and be the great fans that you are.   
 Q.  How much of a chance have you had to see -- (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: What are you asking?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I've seen the things he's done.  He's done a really good job.  He's only lost one game.  That's really good.   
 Q.  Can you relate at all to his rise to being a starter?  
JALEN HURTS: He's a freshman and I was a freshman kind of put in that situation.  To each their own.  He's kinda got it his way and I got it my way.   
 Q.  Do you think at all about the legacy of this program and how significant this game is to that legacy and your role in it?  
JALEN HURTS: I think every game is really significant.  I think every game has its importance.  Every play has its importance.  We can't let a game, can't let a play kind of pass by.  We have to go out there and approach it with I'm going to give it all I have, every opportunity I have.  I think that's what we're going to try to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Sorry?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: From Georgia?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Coach Schumann?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Laid back guy.  I'm sure he's doing a great job there at Georgia.  He's just a cool guy, kept it really real with me the whole way through, and he was really honest.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: It was a big thing, you know.  We've came a long way.  We worked really hard to have this opportunity that we have and I think it's big that we do everything we could possibly do to take advantage of the opportunity at hand.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They've seen a lot more.  Calvin has seen a lot more.  He's been in the game for a longer time.  He's experienced.  He has a national championship.  He has all those things.  I think that helps him.   
 Q.  First thing that jumps out at you about this defense?  
JALEN HURTS: They're fast, physical, experienced, and they do a really good job of doing what they're coached to do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I'm good with everybody, you know.  Rashaan -- whether it be Mekhi, Rashaan, the whole "D" line crew, all the DBs, the outside backers, whatever it is.  We all have a great relationship.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: They're all funny.  They're all characters and all great people to be around.  I'll definitely miss those guys.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Something that shouldn't affect -- not supposed to affect you, I guess.  Mental clutter, it's not something you want.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I don't know.  I don't fight it.  I don't have it.  I just drop it off.  I focus on what I need to focus on.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: No process.  You're asking really broad questions.  Can you give me some detail?   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Well it's a process that obviously works, and if you want to be successful, it's a process that is worth trusting in.  Coach Saban does a great job of doing what he's done for a really long time.  For us as players, I think it's big that we trust in him and I think that's what we do.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just buy in.  If you can buy in and trust in it, then everybody else will be okay.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think we just want to take that game and learn from it, try and use it positively.  Try and use it in a beneficial way, use it as something that we can kinda learn from.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: That's something you've got to cherish because it's not going to be like this forever.  You only get four to five years at this place and it's definitely a blessing.  It's something that we want to -- it's something that we're going to remember forever as a team.   
 Q.  I'm wondering, are there any things that you can point to that would make us see you are a different person now than you were a year ago?  
JALEN HURTS: Just more experience, kinda know what to expect with the different environment and stuff, obviously playing different teams.  Just have to be ready to play like always, prepare, and be ready to play.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I wasn't the biggest recruit.  I only made -- no one expected me to come here and start at quarterback, I had four guys in front of me, all higher recruits than I was, all went to League 11 and all that.  I think when your number is called, how do you answer, how do you respond to certain situations.  I was in a situation where I kind of took advantage of it and I took advantage of the opportunity and just kinda been rolling since.   
 Q.  How are you a different man?  What have you learned about yourself as far as character and developing as a player?  
JALEN HURTS: I think the older you get, you know, the more you learn, obviously, and the wiser you are.  Tend not to let things bother you, you focus on what you need to focus on and you keep the main thing the main thing.   
 Q.  Does it help coming from a -- (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I definitely think it does, it does.  Being around the game of football all my life, experiencing everything that I've experienced, I think, has kind of groomed me to where -- groomed me into the man I am now.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Well, in the fourth grade my aunt was my teacher so I guess she is probably the most important teacher I've every had.  She has been my family, I love her and I appreciate everything she has done for me.   
 Q.  What lessons in the classroom did she impart to you?  
JALEN HURTS: She helped me with my writing skills.  She was my English teacher and my Language Arts teacher, and she helped me with those things.   
 Q.  Do you believe a teacher can change a student's life?  
JALEN HURTS: For sure, if that teacher is able to connect with that student and is able to, kinda, bond with them in a special way, I would surely think that they can change their life.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I haven't.  I want to get this one done and hopefully we can do that.   
Damian, look at that hand!  (Chuckles.)   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: No.  I saw a jersey over there so I was going to cheat but, no, I can't spell it, T-O-N-G-A-V-A-L-I-O-I-A or something, I don't know.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Yeah.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think Georgia is really fast.  I think they do a really good job of doing what they're coached to do.  They do what they do well.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think to each coach their own.  Coach Smart is going to do what he wants to do.  He can take what he wants from here I guess.  He's going to -- it's his team, he's going to do it his way.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Mr. Trump coming to the game doesn't change our preparation, doesn't change our mind-set on winning the game.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Just to be able to experience the things that we're experiencing together, doing it as a team and kinda soaking it all in as a team.   
It will be something special, hopefully and hopefully it's a weekend that we can remember and take in for life.   
 Q.  As an underclassman, how much do you guys want to try to send these seniors off on a good note?  
JALEN HURTS: I think you always want to end the season the right way, and I think we're blessed with the opportunity of a lifetime, and we want to take advantage of that.   
 Q.  Do you remember your first team back in Texas what position you played?  
JALEN HURTS: I played for the East Houston Aggies.  I had a baseball background, so I could always throw the ball far, but I started off playing tight end and some safety.  I just kind of moved around a little bit but we won the Super Bowl one of those years.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Outside people, external factors, that doesn't affect our confidence.  We're going to be okay.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think the defense does a good job of doing what they're coached to do.  Their objective is to not let us score and ours is to go out there and score, so we have to go out there and execute to the best of our abilities on both sides of the ball.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We watched 'em, when Coach is not telling us little bits and changes we definitely watch 'em.

 Q.  Last couple of years and you your teammates worked so hard -- (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We honestly don't worry about that.  We don't really care what others think.  For us, we're in this together as a team and we know what we have to do.  We know the opportunity that we have and we wanted to take advantage of that opportunity.   
 Q.  What's been one of your biggest motivating forces this season?  
JALEN HURTS: Just getting back and trying to be on top.  Trying to win it all.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We don't change anything.  We're going to try to do what we've been coached to do, do what has got us here, and we're going to go out there and play Alabama football.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I think so.  Just going out there and trying to take advantage of the opportunity.  We understand that we came in as the fourth seed, questionable of not even getting in at all.  Everything happens for a reason and we're here now and we want to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: No, I don't have one.  I don't have one.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: It's just like I guess when I ran him over there the other day.  In practice he stands behind us and there will be times when we are flushed out of the pocket or we're rolling out and we kinda run into where he's at and he has to run out of the way so every time that happens after the play whether it be me, Tua or Mac, he's like, "You see that quickness?"  I'm like, "Okay, I see you, Coach!"  So when it happens in a game, and after the game, after it happened, I came up to him and I'm like, "So, Coach, you get all those reps in practice?  You've never been ran over in practice.  All those opportunities you've had to move out of the way, you've always done it?  What happened in the game?"  He said he didn't see me.  He said I was too much of a shrimp to hurt him anyways.  He's a jokester.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Well I think the biggest thing was, you know, for him -- he bounced back from a national championship loss and the next year prevailed and he won it all.  I knew instantly that was something I wanted to do and I called him three days after we played them, trying to get advice and see what he did that whole off-season, see where his mind was and to see how he handled things.   
You apply some things, you don't apply all things but he definitely helped me.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I guess be humble.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: You know the hat's comin' off, you know the hat's coming off.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

JALEN HURTS: I don't know, there's a lot of beautiful women in the world.  I don't know.

JALEN HURTS: Rashaan has no hair.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: This is the national championship game.  We have to be ready to play.  It's the opportunity of a lifetime and we want to take advantage of it.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: We want to finish it the right way.  We definitely want to finish it the right way.  We know the heart broken feeling and we know how it feels and we don't want to feel that again.   
 Q.  (No microphone.)  
JALEN HURTS: Coach Saban is going to always be the same guy.  He's never going to change.
