 Q.  How is practice?  Is that an accurate representation of what you guys go through to get ready for the game?  
JALEN HURTS: All the other guys, everybody else says I have it easy because I'm the quarterback.  As a quarterback, at practice, you have to make sure everybody's into it, everybody's doing their job, moving around, flying around.  So you go out there and let it happen.
