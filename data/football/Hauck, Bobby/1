COACH HAUCK:   Congratulations to North Texas and Coach McCarney, nice job, proud of their efforts.   With that, I'm proud of our team, they did a nice job, particularly our seniors who did a nice job turning this ship around.   I'm fired up about them, for them, obviously wish today would have gone a little bit better you know, North Texas did a nice job, particularly their rush defense was really good.   
They kept us from getting our run game going, just wasn't enough, we weren't good enough on 3rd down.   We had enough 3rd down situations where we had the upper hand, but good job by them, and also with (inaudible), all the Heart of Dallas Bowl people (inaudible).  
   
 Q.   Did you feel especially, when you mentioned the 3rd downs, did you feel the defense got tired?  
COACH HAUCK:   Yeah, we played a lot of plays there.   There were some long drives.   I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we had a couple of drives where we were on the field a whole bunch, and probably too many plays on defense in the second half.  
   
 Q.   Bobby, did you notice them doing anything particularly different defensively after that 95‑yard drive that you had?  
COACH HAUCK:   No, there wasn't a whole bunch different.   Dan can obviously address that, as well but they've got a good defense, and they played well, they made some plays.   We had a couple opportunities that we didn't capitalize on.   Really what happened to us in particular in the first half, to a degree in the second half, as well, we would get something going and then we'd take a negative play.  
   
 Q.   Your offensive line hasn't given up a sack all season.   Was it something they were doing?  
COACH HAUCK:   You know, they pressured a little bit, but it wasn't wildly (inaudible) pressure.   They won some up front.   I don't think that we handled their line extremely well when they were gaming us, either in our draw or in our run game, in that situation or in pass protection.   They covered us up a little bit, and they were getting some push and making Caleb move his feet.   Again, they have pretty good players up front, and they did a nice job.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible) if you could say anything to them what would it be?  
COACH HAUCK:   Well, I just did.   I told them I was proud of them and in particular our seniors for having turned the ship around.   We were not good when we all came together a few years ago.   I told them I was proud of them and looking forward to everybody being back in January so we could start on next season.  
   
 Q.   Caleb, can we get your thoughts playing your final college game, just what your thoughts are right now as it all wraps up?   
CALEB HERRING:   I'm grateful for the time I've had here.   Obviously looking back on my years here, I've become a better football player and a better man because of the things I've been able to do here.   I would have liked to go out on a bit of a sweeter taste, but the time here I've had is nothing short of amazing, and I'm just proud to be a Rebel.  
   
 Q.   Bobby, a few things off the top of your head (inaudible) get back to a bowl (inaudible)?  
COACH HAUCK:   Yeah, we have a lot of guys coming back.   Obviously losing this guy is a major catalyst to what went on this year, winning seven of our last ten games in the regular season.   You always have to replace your seniors, but we have our entire offensive line back.   We only lose two starters on offense in Caleb and Tim.   Defensively we lose some guys that are awfully good players for us, so we have to shore that up.   You keep recruiting and you keep developing your young guys.   That's college football.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about how you felt the momentum of the game changing there when they scored and got a three‑and‑out for the first time in the game?   
COACH HAUCK:   You're talking about the first score?   
   
 Q.   No, the second half.  
COACH HAUCK:   Yeah, when they went down and got the touchdown the first half, again, we had them in a 3rd‑down situation.   They converted and we didn't on the defensive side.   Certainly that was the first lead they had in the game, and then this year we've had difficulty with the coin toss.   I think we've only started the game with the ball maybe twice, and we've scored almost every time this season coming out of the locker room.   It's uncanny how well these guys have played coming out of the locker room.   They stopped us, went down and got a score, that was a little bit of a change for us.   But when that happens we've got to go make plays.  
   
 Q.   Does leadership ability help in situations like this?   
COACH HAUCK:   Well, Caleb is obviously a well‑liked, strong personality on our team.   He's played awfully well.   He's been so consistent throughout the year.   It's been special to watch the evolution and development, and I think his teammates have enjoyed that as well.   Like any time, when guys go out the door, it's almost like a wake in there.   But we'll move forward and we're hoping he hangs around a little bit and helps out.  
   
 Q.   Even at Montana or every place you've been, personally the satisfaction given from where you came, is this one of the highlights of your career so far?   
COACH HAUCK:   Yeah, this is one of them.   You always look retrospectively at it, and you kind of more remember the guys when the season ends.   They're a really fine group of guys, and the coaching staff, the locker room, that's generally what it comes down to, the relationships.   This group I'm really proud of.   It was fun for me watching them go out there and compete, celebrating with them.   As I told them, it's tough not to look at the last three hours, but as we move forward into next week, I'm hoping we focus on what we've accomplished and that's a lot.   
   
 Q.   Caleb, what one lesson from Coach Hauck will you take with you?   
CALEB HERRING:   There are a lot of good lessons in general with the game of football, some of the things I've been through with the program, to have a great coach like Coach Hauck to be there to coach you through it as both a player and as a man, just how to deal with adversity, to make the best out of a situation.   Sometimes in life you get dealt a hand, the way you respond to those hands is everything.   I think that's pretty much the main thing in my career here that I've learned is to deal with adversity and make the most of it.  
   
 Q.   For both Caleb and Devante, after being able to take some time away from today's game and think about the season, what will stick out most to both of you?   
DEVANTE DAVIS:   We've sticks out to me (inaudible) is turning the season around.   It's bad we lost the last game and got to walk out of here after a game like that, but the thing that sticks out the most is the leadership (Inaudible.)   Just make sure we can come out and win games (inaudible).  
CALEB HERRING:   Just as a team coming together and making that decision to stick it out and to keep fighting.   A lot of the moments that happened are a result of that, so I think that when a team comes together like it did last year, off‑season workouts, things that nobody will talk about this year, but those are the memories that we made together when nobody was looking at that overall impacting the season and got us where we are today.   Definitely those off‑season workouts without the coaches, just the guys out there throwing the ball around and debt getting some extra work in, those are the things that are going to stick out.  
   
 Q.   Coach, talk about the performance of Derek Thompson at quarterback.   
COACH HAUCK:   Yeah, in fact we had all their games this season obviously, and we watched them all.   It was in my mind his finest performance of the year.   He took some good shots, we hit him, knocked him down, roughed him up, he got right back up and did a nice job.   He's not only a good player, he's a tough player.   Frankly in previewing film during the season, I didn't think that he could do what he did today, and kudos to him.  
   
 Q.   How can you use that and why can you use this maybe as a foundation for future success?   Can you use something like that as a foundation?   
CALEB HERRING:   As a leaving senior, I guess it's about the legacy.   I think there's something that went into this year and that's gone into this program that is going to go for a long time because it is good to have pride in something.   I think that's what we have now is our pride and our work ethic, and I think going forward for our guys, there's plenty of people that are capable of replacing any outgoing senior.   I think that the team motto will echo out throughout the years.  
DEVANTE DAVIS:   (Inaudible) that's not going to change (inaudible) everybody coming back on (inaudible) this game is going to help, knowing we don't want to feel like this again going forward.
