THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)   
TIM VIZZI:   Absolutely.   That was one of the things we touched on.   One of the biggest things was to send the seniors out with a win in our last home game of their career.   We're really happy to be able to accomplish that.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to it?   How did you do it?   
TIM VIZZI:   It was an overall team effort.   We had a score on defense, a score on special teams.   The defense stopped them all night and the offense got it done.   We did just enough to get the win.   It was a complete team effort.   
   
 Q.   What was your reaction when you returned the punt?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   It was a heck of a play.   It really flipped the momentum when it wasn't exactly going our way.   A huge play to tie the game.   
You can't say more than that was one of the few plays of the game that really made a difference.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIM VIZZI:   Absolutely.   Just talked about getting a nice hold up, stunned the guys up front.   Gave me some room.   I just owe it all to them.   Made some blocks.   Was able to spring one off.   
Definitely felt great.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
J.J. WHITAKER:   I just played him.   It was man coverage.   I had inside leverage, so just had my eyes on him.   Put my foot on the ground, made a play.   
   
 Q.   This is a perfect way to send off the seniors.   What's going through your head right now?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   Speaking for the other classmen, we're just really excited for the seniors.   It's a great win.   It's going to be the last memory at Qualcomm Stadium, playing here in front of the whole crowd.   I couldn't be happier for those guys.   
Yeah, it was another tight game, kind of like we've had all season.   We were just fortunate enough to win this one in the end.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel the experience from the last games helped?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   Yeah, every game that's close, we can win at the end.   Luckily we made plays tonight.   
   
 Q.   Speaking of tight games, seems like you love the overtime game.   Four this season.   What's the key to getting those overtime wins?   
TIM VIZZI:   Definitely it's just believing that you can win.   This team never has a doubt in their mind.   At all times we're all talking to each other on the sideline, We got this, we got this.   
Everybody comes together.   We always seem to get enough done to get the win.   That's exactly what happened tonight.   
   
 Q.   How disruptive was their defense, especially in the second half?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   They have an incredible defense.   They get pressure, the front four.   Their front seven are really good.   Their DBs, they kind of wait for opportunities.   
They made a big play on the interception.   They had a great defense.   Kind of gave us some trouble at times.   
   
 Q.   How big was it to get the conversion?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   The third down in overtime was huge.   The offensive line did a great job on that play.   Adam is Adam.   He runs really well, so...   
   
 Q.   J.J., what was the key to holding them to low yardage?   
J.J. WHITAKER:   Concentrating, executing our game plan.   We have a game plan each week.   We practice as hard as we possibly can to execute it.   We did.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
J.J. WHITAKER:   I had man coverage.   All my eyes was on him.   I seen him put his shoulders down.   I put my foot down, made a play on the ball.   
   
 Q.   Just the way the DBs played tonight, what does that mean tonight?   Do you feel like you validated yourselves?  
J.J. WHITAKER:   Of course.   We've had confidence all year long.   Being a young group, we have to have confidence.   That's what we pride ourselves on.   
   
 Q.   (Question about the catch early in the game.)   
TIM VIZZI:   Lock is a great player.   He's made tons of big plays over his entire career here.   
He stepped up again when his number was called.   Brushed the other one off.   Knew he had opportunities coming his way.   When he got that opportunity, he made the play.   Happened to be the game‑winning touchdown.   It was awesome.   
   
 Q.   Where does this game rank?   
TIM VIZZI:   It's up there definitely.   Last year we won a conference championship.   But we beat Boise at their place last year.   To beat them here in front of our home crowd as our last game at home, that was really something.   
   
 Q.   Seemed like all the seniors had really good games tonight.   What was the energy like out on the field?   
TIM VIZZI:   Everyone knew that this is the last game.   So you got to leave it all out there on the line.   
Going into overtime, like I said before, we believed that we were going to win.   Everyone believed that.   Everybody did their job.   We got the job done.   
   
 Q.   When you went into overtime, you've done it four times now, do you almost have a sense of confidence in that?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   You know, I don't think there's a huge difference.   The excitement, it's always the same going into an overtime game, especially this one, playing such a quality opponent in Boise.   
The excitement is always there.   We've won close games in the past, and I think that helps our confidence a little bit.   But we were excited and our defense stepped up and made a huge play.   
   
 Q.   Was that play designed for that?   
QUINN KAEHLER:   There's three legitimate options.   If you have time, you want to look downfield.   If you get rushed, you got to hit it off to the fullback going underneath in the flap.   
I saw that [] Collin had a little bit of room.   He made a great catch on it.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
TIM VIZZI:   You can't dwell on the past.   Once that game was over that Sunday, put it behind us and focus on the next opponent.   
This week the opponent was Boise.   They're a really good team.   We know we had to prepare really hard for them.   We had a great week of practice.   We got the work in, did just enough.   
But they're a quality opponent.   They're really good.   We're happy to come out with a W.   
   
 Q.   What does that say about your defense, you go to the overtime?   
J.J. WHITAKER:   Confidence.   Everyone on our defense is confident.   Everyone wants to make plays.   
When we got our name called, we knew what we had to do.   
   
 Q.   (No microphone.)  
J.J. WHITAKER:   Yes (smiling).
