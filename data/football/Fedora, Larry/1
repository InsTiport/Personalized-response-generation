THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by North Carolina head coach Larry Fedora.
COACH FEDORA: Looking forward to getting back in Kenan Stadium and playing in front of our fans against Western Carolina who is playing their last game of the season.  So I'm sure their coaches will have them ready to go and looking forward to the game.
Q. What challenges does Western Carolina present, what type of personnel do they have?  What do they do that concerns you?
COACH FEDORA: Well, one, they've got a quarterback that does a great job in their offense.  They've been averaging over 500 yards.  He runs the ball very well.  And he throws the ball well.  So I think the kid has done a really nice job with their offense.
Defensively, you know, they're a multiple front.  They're going to be in a 3-4 and 4-3 and mix it up throughout the game with different blitzes coming from the different sides.  It will be a challenge for us.
