LARRY FEDORA: We're putting the finishing touches on our week of preparation today and getting on a plane and flying to Pittsburgh this evening, so looking forward to a great game against a really good football team tomorrow night.
Q. After playing that close game against Miami, what have you been pointing to with your team to say, all right, this is what kept us in that game last week, and this is what we need to capture every week?
LARRY FEDORA: Well, really the theme hasn't changed.  It's been, again, to take care of the football, and that's something that we didn't do, create some takeaways on defense, and we did do that, and we need to play much better on special teams than we're doing right now.  The theme is that we're very close, and we're playing with a lot of young guys and a lot of inexperienced guys, but we're very close, and if we can eliminate the mistakes, we can win some football games.
Q. I was just wondering, the improvement you've been seeing, especially in the Miami game, how have the things you did in that game different from things you were doing in previous games other than turnovers and things like that, what basic things you've been doing better?
LARRY FEDORA: Well, defensively we were able to shut down the running game.  I think we gave up 1.8 yards per carry.  Offensively we made more explosive plays than we had, so that meant guys were making plays when they had opportunities.  You know, and everybody knows what the issues are; we turned the ball over four times, and then we gave up a game-changing play on special teams.
