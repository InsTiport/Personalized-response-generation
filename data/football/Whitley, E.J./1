<p>	Q.  Mike, have you had any kind of update you can give us on Taurance Rawls? </p>
<p>	Q.  Can you just assess where your quarterback situation is right now. </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, and players, I know it's a new season, new chemistry, new players and all that.  What do you draw from your successes last year, picked as the bowl win, and how will you handle a Top-10 team?  What kind of residual effect is there from something like that? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, can you talk about the significant improvement your defense made last year from the year before, and what areas you still want and need to see them make improvement in this year. </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, has Cody Fuller decided if he is going to play football next season?  If he does decide, can he get back into the starting rotation or regular rotation, despite the time he has missed in the spring? </p>
<p>	Q.  Speaking of Kentucky Fried Chicken and special recipes, what do you credit for being able to plug in different quarterbacks and leading the nation each of the past years? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, how has Robert Johnson's move to receiver gone thus far? </p>
<p>	Q.  I know he played the position in high school, but how has returning to that been? </p>
<p>	Q.  Coach, how would you rank this group of receivers compared to others?  Where do they compare athletically or experience-wise? </p>
<p>	Q.  For the players, obviously, your head coach has a good sense of humor.  What are practices like and what's the season like playing for Coach Leach? </p>

<p>	Q.  Mike, how well do you think your non-conference schedule prepares you for the Big 12? </p>
<p>	Q.  Mike, what do you think about moving the A&amp;M games around? </p>
