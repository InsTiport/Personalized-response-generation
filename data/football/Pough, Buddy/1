South Carolina State - 24, Louisiana Tech - 53
COACH POUGH: We thought that Louisiana tech was a good bit better than the team we played against last week, and for us to have the success we had in some phases of the game I thought was better for us.
We are just trying to work our way through these first couple games, first three games actually right now to see if we can be the team that we want to be once we get to our league in about another two weeks.  I've got to take my hat off to Skip and this crowd.  That Higgins kid was pretty good.
Q. Do you think the rain delay had anything to do with y'all's performance?
COACH POUGH: You know, I don't know.  It was the same for everybody.  You do what you can.  You know, the circumstance was one that we couldn't fix so we had to just do the best we could under the circumstances.
