Oklahoma State Cowboys 37, Miami Hurricanes 34
Q. We talked to you a couple days ago about the excitement for the game.  How do you feel now that it's in the books and you're leaving Orlando with a win?
TYLER LACY:   I'm very excited. I feel like our team came out there and got the win.  Everybody was having fun, flying around to the ball and offense was picking it up today and the defense was, you know, doing their jobs today.  Special teams also had that fumble and that came in clutch for the win.  I think it was a good team win.
Q. What changed for you guys when King gets hurt and Miami goes to a different quarterback?
TYLER LACY:   I mean, nothing really changed for us.  Our game plan was still the same.  The backup quarterback that came in, he could still run the ball and still do what King does, and he has experience back there with the guys he has.  So we didn't change the game plan.
Q. You guys as a defense as a whole this entire year have been really good, but going into next year, you guys are going to be losing some guys.  What do you see and what are your thoughts on the crew that you guys may have next year on the field?
TYLER LACY:   Everybody is going to have to step up and do better than what they did this year and I'm really excited for next year and what we have in store.
