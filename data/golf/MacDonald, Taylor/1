 Q.  3-under on the Highlands Course.  Good first day.  Tell us how you did it?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: Drove it well occasionally.  I just missed it in the right spots when I did miss it.  Just hit a lot of greens and made a couple of putts.  It could have been a little lower, but can't ask for too much.  It was a good fun day, actually.   Q.  How long have you been in the U.S.?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: I've been here this is my third week now.   Q.  What are you using as a base for operations?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: I had a Houston camp, and a Golf Australia camp as my service providers, and then I have two homes to stay, families, one for the Western Amateur and one for here.   Q.  This is Atlanta.  TAYLOR MACDONALD: Atlanta, yeah.  It's good for them to host us, and I just base myself with the families that I get, if I get them.   Q.  Did you see this good of a score coming playing well?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: I played well at the Western, just real solid.  I mean, if you hole a few putts, you can shoot a good number, but it's not going to be too drastic.  If you hit driver well, you can really grab it by the throat.   Q.  Is it more the fact that you hit it close or did you hit some putts of length?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: I hit a few close ones to four or five feet, and I had a few par saves from eight to 10.  So it was a good mixed bag.  Didn't hole any big ones, but tomorrow hopefully.   Q.  Where does this course stack up from the courses you've been playing in the U.S.?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: This is probably more a bomber's golf course.  You need to get it out there and give yourself less to the green if you're going to lay up, obviously.  But you've definitely got to hit driver well and long, and I'm starting to do that, so it's good.   Q.  What is your length off the tee?  What do you hit driver?  TAYLOR MACDONALD: Probably 300 yards or thereabouts.   Q.  Great first day.  TAYLOR MACDONALD: Thank you.
