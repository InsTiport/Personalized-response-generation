  Q.  Gavin, 1-under 69, heck of a score out there today with the wind.   
 GAVIN COLES:  It was cool.  I fought it really well.  I scrambled well.   
  
  Q.  Do you think that, you know, round of 1-under feels more like maybe 3, 4, 5-under?   
 GAVIN COLES:  You know, in the wind this course -- I don't think I've played very well here before.  It was interesting.  I'll take 1-under and I'll sit and watch.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever seen the course with the wind like this?   
 GAVIN COLES:  We played like this in Australia.  It's nothing we haven't seen before.  Probably play a little bit more conservative and you have to sometimes hit shots off the tee that you normally wouldn't hit off the tee to get yourself close to some of the greens and you can play attacking it.  It's just a little bit different.   
  
  Q.  Do you have the same game plan in mind for tomorrow then?   
 GAVIN COLES:  Probably not because the wind might blow from a different direction.
