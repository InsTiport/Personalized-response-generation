 Q. General thoughts on the round. 
 PETER SENIOR: I didn't play quite well yesterday. Sort of got off to a good start, but, yeah, I just basically balled out. 

 Q. Course playing harder? 
 PETER SENIOR: No, I just didn't play very well. I have had some good putting which sort of saved me. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 PETER SENIOR: Anytime you finish in the top-10, you know you played reasonably well. 

 Q. What do you think about the course? 
 PETER SENIOR: Fantastic. 
 The whole place has been great; it's been a great week. 

 Q. Thanks.
