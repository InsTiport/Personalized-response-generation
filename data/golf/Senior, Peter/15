 Q. Great round today, minus 7. Just kind of take us through your round and tell us --
 PETER SENIOR: I started off pretty good. I played reasonably well the front nine, made a couple of bogeys from shots that weren't really bad shots that were just a yard short of being pretty good. So it's that sort of course where you can make a lot of bogeys from good shots. And on the back nine I struggled a little bit but I got it around in a couple under and I tried hard to make a birdie coming in, just to try and get a bit closer to the lead, but that just didn't happen. 

 Q. Did you watch some of the, were you doing some scoreboard watching. Because you were catching up?
 PETER SENIOR: Yeah, I always look at the board when they dropped to 9-under and I was at six I figured if I could make a few birdies and then I holed along one at 12 to go to seven and I thought that, Geez, there's a chance here if I can get a couple of quick ones but I just parred all the way in.
