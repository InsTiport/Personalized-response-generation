 Q.   Please talk a little bit about your round today.   
PETER SENIOR:   Very disappointing, actually.   I was struggling all day.   I made a lot of birdies, made a lot of bogeys.   But just didn't play very well.   
Drove it in the rough a lot today, which the lies I got in there were pretty bad.   So I just had difficulty making pars.   So I was happy to get away with 71 today.   
   
 Q.   Are there any areas you really want to improve on to kind of move up the leaderboard the rest of the weekend?  
PETER SENIOR:   Yeah, I need to hit it on the fairway.   I played the back nine today very badly.   I could have had 6‑ or 7‑over the back nine.   But I scrambled it around a bit.   But I had 4‑under the last 10 holes, so it sort of got me back into it.
