 Q.   Start with your round today.   
PETER SENIOR:   I played a lot better today.   Hit 16 or 17 greens today.   So a big difference from yesterday.   
I had a lot of opportunities today and didn't make any.   I made a lot of putts yesterday when I played badly, but really wasted quite a few out there and it could have put me in a good position for tomorrow.   
But if I play like I did today and hole a few putts I still have a chance, I think.  
   
 Q.   How did the weather affect your play at all today?  
PETER SENIOR:   No, not really.   The course has been playing pretty good.   Fairways are great and greens are good too.   
If you play well, you get rewarded around here.   
   
 Q.   And then just your thoughts heading into the final round.   It looks like you're currently fifth place?  
PETER SENIOR:   Need to get off to a good start tomorrow.   I haven't been starting very well.   I bogeyed the first couple holes in the last couple of rounds.   So you need a bit of momentum.   Those first four holes tomorrow, if you can make a couple of birdies to start and then maybe turn maybe 3‑ or 4‑under the front nine you got a chance.
