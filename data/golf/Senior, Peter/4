Q.   Talk about your round today. 
PETER SENIOR:   Struggled again.   Didn't do much.   Only had the one birdie the whole day.   So I had some chances coming in, but just didn't make anything and 71, can't be too displeased any time you finish up there in a Major Championship you've done all right. 

Q.   What was it like to watch your partner today?
PETER SENIOR:   Yeah, he played pretty good.   He drove it well, he hit a lot of good iron shots.   He made a couple of really good par saves which kept his round going.   But he's a solid player.   People haven't heard of him because the Japanese guys don't travel that much.   I think Joe Ozaki has been the only one really that's done much golf here in the U.S.   And he played good. 

Q.   You knew him before?
PETER SENIOR:   Yeah, yeah, I played quite a bit up in Japan and I know quite a few of the Japanese players.   And I spent a bit of time with him and they're all good solid players of the but they are just comfortable with home. 

Q.   What was the key to his shooting such a great round today?
PETER SENIOR:   I think he got off to a very, very good start.   Birdied the second, birdied the third, made a great up‑and‑down from 130 yards on the fifth hole.   Just things to keep your round going.   And he hit some good iron shots but he putted really good today and that's how you do it.
