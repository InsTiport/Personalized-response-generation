  Q. Nice birdie on the last to get to even par for the day. What can you tell me about your round?   
 PETER SENIOR: Yeah, well, didn't really start off that well. I hit a few roughy shots, made birdies on the back nine.   
 I played the back nine badly today, but it was nice to finish with a birdie.  
  
  Q. What can you tell me about your week overall?   
 PETER SENIOR: Pretty good. Played reasonably solid the whole week, didn't play particularly well today, but that's golf.
