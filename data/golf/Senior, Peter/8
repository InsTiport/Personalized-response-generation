  MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Senior, 68 today, and finished 3 under par for the Championship.  
   
 Q.   Well, done.   
PETER SENIOR:   Thank you.  
   
 Q.   Three birdies and a bogey today to get yourself close to it and a second top ten in two years.   
PETER SENIOR:   Yeah.   Played pretty good all week.   Didn't putt very well this week.   Greens are very difficult to read.   A lot of break in them.   But all in all, the course played pretty well, and I'm pretty happy.  
   
 Q.   Was this reminiscent to you of any courses that you've seen in your travels in your golf career on the other side of the ocean, maybe?   
PETER SENIOR:   Well, it's linksy, so it's got some characteristics of some of the courses.  
It's just, when I first arrived here, I thought it would be something a little different.   I thought it would be a little more treeâ€‘lined than what it is.   But this week, priority was put on driving, which we don't normally get.  
If you hit it on the fairway, then you had a possibility of shooting a good score.   And that's what the game's all about.  
   
 Q.   Did you get to the point where you felt comfortable on the greens?   Were they still so slow going up and fast coming down that it was tough to get used to?   
PETER SENIOR:   No, I had no problem with the speed.   I just had problem with how much they were breaking and how much they weren't breaking.   I'd stand over one putt, and it looked like it wouldn't, and it broke a lot.   Then the next one looked like it would break, and it would run pretty straight.  
So every time I stood over a putt, I was in two minds, whether it was going to break or not.   I think that was the biggest problem for me this week.  
   
 Q.   Great performance.   Thank you so much, Peter.   
PETER SENIOR:   Thank you.
