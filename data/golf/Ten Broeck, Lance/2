Q. Within three strokes of the lead as we stand.  How does that sound?LANCE TEN BROECK: Sounds good.Q. What did you do well today?LANCE TEN BROECK: I hit a lot of greens.  I didn't really make any putts at all all day long until the last two holes.  I made a couple putts on last two holes to birdie the last 2. Before that I had a lot of opportunities.  I was hitting my driver pretty good and a lot of good irons.  So, excited about the weekend.  Seemed to play better today than yesterday.Q. What were the club selections and the distances on 17 and 18?LANCE TEN BROECK: 17 was 180.  I hit a 6 iron to about ten feet, and the last hole I had 199 and hit a 3-iron to about 20 feet.  So I made both those.Q. How did the course play today compared to yesterday?LANCE TEN BROECK: Well, when we started off the wind wasn't quite as strong.  It started to pick up a little bit.  Slightly different direction.  Greens are a little bit, I'd say, on the soft side if anything.Q. Still?LANCE TEN BROECK: It's all good.Q. The fairways don't seem as firm and fast as many had thought, at least at this point.  Is that fair?LANCE TEN BROECK: They're firming up.  The ball is rolling a long way.  Yeah.Q. Caddie, how well do you take your help?LANCE TEN BROECK: My caddie is very experienced.  I kind of know what I'm doing.  We haven't screwed up yet.Q. How do you feel about the position, you know within three strokes and the wind could be high and the golf course is firming up?LANCE TEN BROECK: Well, I'm sure somebody is going to hang in there at, you know, 5, 6, 7, 8-under.  You never know.  I feel very excited how I'm playing and looking forward to the weekend.Q. What is going the best for you?  Is it ball striking or --LANCE TEN BROECK: You know, a lot of -- my irons have been pretty good.  I really haven't had to -- I think today I only missed maybe two greens all day.  So, I only had to chip once and I putted the other time. So, it was a pretty stress-free round except for the -- I couldn't get any putts to go.  I was hitting some good putts, leaving them just short, dead in the hole, or slightly misreading them.  It was nice the make the last two.Q. What do you do now, you got the whole day?LANCE TEN BROECK: Nothing.  Go get something to eat, take it easy.  Got 24 hours, probably, until I tee off.  I'm not going to go practice, if that's what you're asking
