Q. All right.  Played pretty well out there, 1-under.  Your overall thoughts on the course and how you played.LANCE TEN BROECK: The course played nice.  The greens were a little softer than I thought they would be.  The fairways are perfect.  The course is in great shape.  Little windy but you hit the ball in the fairway you can score.Q. Going off early tomorrow, how do you think that will change the way the greens run, the wind, anything like that?LANCE TEN BROECK: I think tomorrow morning should play nice.  Wind shouldn't be quite as much and the greens will probably still be a little soft and should be a good morning.Q. Couple birdies out there for you today.  You were able to go right at the pin, kind of get up a down a couple times?LANCE TEN BROECK: Seemed like my first putt was a 10-footer and second one was a 4-footer, last would be was about a 16 footer, 18 footer.  I had a lot of birdie chances, really.  I had a couple bad drives and made bogies coming in.  Other than that, I played pretty good so I'm happy
