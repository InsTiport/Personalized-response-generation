  LANCE TEN BROECK:   Played well all day.   Hit my driver on the fairway for the most part.   Putted just so‑so.   Missed about a four‑footer for my only bogey and I missed countless other putts.   
I mean, if you hit the ball on the fairway, the course was there to shoot a very low score.  
   
 Q.   Did you see Tom?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   He was 7 under through 10 or something.  
   
 Q.   Shot 28 on the front.   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Okay, yeah.  
   
 Q.   So obviously the front, it looked like there were a lot of low numbers on the front.   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   The back nine is harder for sure.   You got three hard par 4s on the back nine, on 12, 16, and 18 are the longest holes.   It's a good course.   You hit the ball on the fairway, you can score.  
   
 Q.   Got to be pleased with your score.   You're 4 under, good start.   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Oh, yeah.   I wouldn't think I would shoot this low, to be honest with you.   So I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   Course conditions.   Everyone is talking about how hard, hard, hard they were to begin the week, and now we're seeing some low scores and that‑‑  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   I thought it was harder in the practice rounds as well, but it seems like the tees are always moved up a little bit in the tournament but not on the back of the back tees.   You get used to the course, you kind of know where you might be able to miss it on some holes.   
Playing in the morning too, the greens are a lot softer than they're going to be in the afternoon.   So it makes a big difference.  
   
 Q.   Did you like the way you were coming in this week and making practice rounds?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   You know, I don't really play that much golf.  
   
 Q.   True.   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   The last nine weeks, I've caddied eight weeks, and I played in a tournament in Iowa on the Champions Tour the other week.   This is my tenth week in a row.  
   
 Q.   So you've got to be‑‑  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Yeah, I'm happy.   I've been hitting it pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Does being a caddie at that high level‑‑ I'm sure you've been asked this before.   Does it give you a different perspective out on the course?   Does it help you?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   It probably helps a little bit with your course management.   You still have to execute.   That's the bottom line.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   And you were saying your putting was so‑so?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   I'd say it's very average, but it was getting better as the day went on.  
   
 Q.   Do you wish you could play 36?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   No.   I'm happy to be done at 4 under.   But I had two putters in my bag yesterday, a long putter and a short putter.   I stuck with the short putters.   I thought I'd feel like an idiot on the 1st green with a long putter I never used before.   But I still got beat up.   It got better as the day went on.  
   
 Q.   Was that nerves?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   No.   I just don't putt that good anymore.  
   
 Q.   Sounds good.   Thank you very much.
