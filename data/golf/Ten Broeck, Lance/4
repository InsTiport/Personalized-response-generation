  MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, Lance Ten Broeck shot a 71 today and finished 3 under par for the Championship.  
   
 Q.   How's the golf course today?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Golf course was‑‑ played a little harder because the wind was a little different direction.   The greens really aren't that‑‑ it's probably a little bit of me, but the greens aren't that fast, unless you're above the hole.   Those are the only ones I can get to the hole, from above the hole.  
   
 Q.   All in all, your assessment of your week of play?  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   I thought I played really well, except for I didn't putt well at all the whole week.   Average, at best, I'd say.   I struggled all four days putting.  
   
 Q.   Someone tells you you're in the top ten at the U.S. Senior Open?  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Oh, yeah.   Great week.   No doubt about it.   I had a great week.   So I get back next year too.  
   
 Q.   What is your competitive schedule?   Are you right on‑‑  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   I don't know if a top ten gets you into the next Champions event or not in a Major.   I don't know how they do that.   I don't know.   If I don't, I'm going to try to qualify for the one in Minnesota in two weeks.  
   
 Q.   Did you enjoy your week overall?   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Oh, yeah, had a great week.  
   
 Q.   There's been a lot of your peers have been pretty impressed by what you've been able to do.   I'm sure it's gratifying to know that they‑‑ what they think of your game?  
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Yeah, it's good.   I'm very happy.   All good?  
   
 Q.   I think so.   
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Thanks, guys.
