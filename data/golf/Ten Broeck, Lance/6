Q. Lance, 66 yesterday, 66 today.   One shot out of the lead after 36 holes in the U.S. Senior Open.   You've been on the road 8 out of 9 weeks.   Who's more surprised, you or the guy you've been caddying for, Tim Herron? 
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Probably Lumpy is pretty surprised.   Like you said, I haven't played much golf.   When I do practice here, you don't know if you're playing good, bad.   If you are playing good, you don't know how good you're playing.
Yesterday I played great, but today I struggled a little bit getting into the fairway often, and I'm fighting the putter the whole way.

Q. Working as a caddie all these years now and having played as well, has caddying given you some greater perspective on the game that maybe necessarily you didn't have when you were really playing week in and week out? 
LANCE TEN BROECK:   I think it helps me with my strategy or just your overall attitude on the golf course as far as trying to press.   You've got to play safe sometimes, and sometimes par is your friend.

Q. You got up on line last hole, held onto the driver, pretty gutsy play.   What's going to be a strategy for 36 holes to go here?   Is it going to be aggressive or maybe a little more conservative? 
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Well, I'm fairly aggressive from tee to green.   Once again, on the green, I can't get the ball to the hole.   I'm fighting to get to the hole.   I just want to get it up there a foot away and tap it in.

Q. We wish you good luck.   Thank you for your time. 
LANCE TEN BROECK:   Thank you.
