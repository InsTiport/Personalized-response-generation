  Q.  Talk about what you're trying to get fixed.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Just the swing, getting in a better position at the top, you know?  The takeaway is the most important thing out there.  If you get the takeaway right -- it's like changing your grip, it's very easy, but when you really hold onto it and try to hit a ball, it's really difficult.  So it's the same thing.   
  
  Q.  Is it a little inside?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  It's a little inside, but the hand stays out.  If I'm going inside then there's more extension.   
  
  Q.  Was today more what you expected from the three of you?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, pretty much.  That was more how we thought we'd play.   
  
  Q.  Could you sense early on that everybody was kind of --   
 VIJAY SINGH:  We were more into it today.  I was so far out of it at one point.  I guess the momentum with Phil and Tiger making a lot of birdies --   
  
  Q.  That caught on a little bit?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah.   
  
  Q.  That helped get you in a little better position going into the weekend?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I'm going to probably be more aggressive going into the weekend.  I'll feel more comfortable probably and play a lot better, so we'll see.
