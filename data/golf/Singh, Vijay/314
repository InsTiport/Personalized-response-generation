Q.
Talk to me about your match today. 

VIJAY SINGH:  I played nicely, didn't do anything too drastically wrong, just played very steady.  I made four birdies, just steady golf, and didn't make a mistake.  When I did get into trouble, I made two good putts for pars.  I played as good as I can today.


Q.  You took pretty much control of the match.  There wasn't any turning point?

VIJAY SINGH: No, he wasn't doing much.  The only thing he had a chance with was probably on the 14th hole.  I hit mine by the hole about six feet and he missed a short one.


Q.  What's your next match?

VIJAY SINGH:  Don't know.
