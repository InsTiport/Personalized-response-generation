Q.  Well, it seems like you shot even par yesterday and rarely have two average rounds in a row; you came back and put yourself in contention again for the weekend.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I'm going to have to play well on the weekend.  I don't think the guys are going to come back.  The golf course is tough but there's a lot of birdies out there.

I'm playing well.  I'm hitting it a little better than I did yesterday, and I can feel my putting coming back.  Hopefully I show up tomorrow with a better score.

Q.  Any explanation for being able to do that, come back?  Not that yesterday was a bad round, but come back and shoot yourself back into contention?
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, I've been trying something with my swing, so yesterday was    it wasn't right there.  It felt good on the range but didn't feel good on the golf course.  Today it was the same thing, lesser expectations, just getting out there and trying to enjoy it.
