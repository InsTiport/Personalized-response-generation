JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  I know you're disappointed, but you shot a great round today   the best round by three strokes.  Talk about your round today.
VIJAY SINGH:  Wasn't good enough, that's all I can say about that (laughter).  I did everything good except make one more putt.  I mean, the one on 17, I 3 putted that one, and I just    it was a sad one.

You know, I played well.  I can't complain about the way I played, the way I finished.  Give me a 66 before the start of the day, I would have taken it.  But you learn a lot from rounds like that that, you know, the previous three days you cannot throw away shots.  It's going to haunt you the end of the day.  You know, today it did.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN: You mentioned earlier, your longest putt all week was?
VIJAY SINGH:  Probably six, eight feet.  It's not that I putted badly; I just didn't make any putts.  I hate putting in windy conditions like that.  We'll see what happens.  I mean, I'm playing well.  I'm feeling good about my game.  Try again next week.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  On 18 there, Stuart hit in that back bunker.  I don't know if you really noticed his shot or if it changed your shot selection at all.
VIJAY SINGH:  No, I hit a perfect second shot.  Just didn't move enough.  It's very soft there.  I knew I just wanted it to turn a little bit more.  You know, three yards left, would have been up there somewhere.  But I hit a poor putt, you know.  Could have got it closer than that.  All week, the ball has been going so fast.  Today for some reason it didn't.
