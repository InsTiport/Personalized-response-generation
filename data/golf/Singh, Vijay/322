Q.  It seemed like the golf course was really winning the contest today until it laid down a little bit with the wind in the afternoon.  You came up with five birdies coming in. 

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it played a little bit easier, the front nine was playing very tough. 


Q.  Yesterday was a demoralizing afternoon for the international side, Ernie Els tapped it off with a chip-in at of the last but you bounded back hard.

VIJAY SINGH:  It was a good team talk yesterday and the captain said he's going to go out and do something and he did and put a strong team back together again.  The team played really well.  He hung in there and birdied coming in.  Yesterday we wanted to win so bad and we just had a good team talk and go out and enjoy the game and that's what we did.  Retief and myself, we played well together and splitting us yesterday wasn't a very good idea, so we got back and he really played well.  He was out of the holes quite a few times but when we needed him, he was the one. 


Q.  Did the conditions favor the International Team today? 

RETIEF GOOSEN: Some of the guys hit the ball a little bit better in the windier conditions.  I had a couple good shots to help him out.


Q.  You are in better shape for Sunday than yesterday.

VIJAY SINGH:  It's going to be a tough one tomorrow.  The team that is down comes out strong the next day so hang in there.
