 Q.   Birdied 15, 16; eagle was impressive at 17.   You're right there.   
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, I have to deal with the first nine, though.   The 9th hole has been a torture for me.   (Indiscernible.)   
Get it going on the back nine, you know, tomorrow is another day.   The pins were a little tougher today, so that's why the scores are not as low.  
Playing well.   I found something in my putting that's working really, really good, so hopefully tomorrow I can get some going.   
   
 Q.   I've followed you quite a bit this year.   You've played so well.   You got to believe really confident going into tomorrow, because sooner or later this is going to click for you.  
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, you know, the problem was my putting on the weekend.   I felt really weird with my putting stroke.   It worked good for two days and come under the gun.  
But this week has been looking good.   I've changed my grip a little bit and it's flowing really freely.   So that's a big plus.  
   
 Q.   Did you discover it amidst the round or before the round?   
VIJAY SINGH:   No, no, no.   I putted well all week.   I didn't make that many the first two days, but the strokes were good and rolling at a good pace.  
   
 Q.   It's fun to watch you play, so good luck tomorrow.   I think you got a real shot tomorrow.   
VIJAY SINGH:   Thank you.
