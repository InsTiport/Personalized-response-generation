CARNOUSTIE   ( 72 , -8 OVERALL )
VIJAY SINGH: I don't know if I can even speak at the moment, let alone tell you about my round, because I'm so cold that my lips are all numb!

It is just so cold and so difficult to get the right feel. In the circumstances I'll take a 72. I'm OK overall, but I hope it's a bit warmer at St Andrews tomorrow. I will try to be focussed, because it's possible for me to come through and win from here if I play well.
