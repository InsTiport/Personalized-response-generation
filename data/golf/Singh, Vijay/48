   VIJAY SINGH: I just couldn't get it going. I made a bogey on the next hole.   
  
  Q. We heard you had 229 yards out.   
 VIJAY SINGH: Let's see, what did I have? I know I hit a 5-iron.  
  
  Q. And you got to see it go in?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I hit it just like I wanted to and just hoping it was going to get up on the green somewhere, and it kind of just went in the hole.  
  
  Q. More thrilling than a hole-in-one?  
 VIJAY SINGH: I guess. You know, you can get a hole-in-one, but a double eagle is kind of one in a million. But I'll take it.  
  
  Q. Kind of a frustrating day, though, you'd make birdies and then follow them up with some bogeys?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah. I played the par-3s really badly, 3-over. I bogeyed the 16th, which was probably one of the easiest holes on the golf course if you have the right club to hit it. But it's another day tomorrow.  
  
  Q. And you're still driving the ball well, 32 of 42 fairways for the week.   
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball pretty good off the tee. I just need to make some putts and hit it closer.  
  
  Q. You're putting well, as well.   
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I'm not putting well enough, though. I'm giving myself a lot of chances but just not converting them.
