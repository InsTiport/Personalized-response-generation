Q.
Talk making an okay day; that made it suddenly worthwhile?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I hit a good drive and good 9-iron and went in the hole.  I was surprised.  It was straight at the flag, and I just saw it land and the guys started cheering and I guess it went in.
Q.  Too dark to actually see it go in?
VIJAY SINGH:  I saw it go in.  I saw it disappear.  The one on THE last hole was difficult to see.
Q.  Something like that can take an okay day and put a nice bow-tie on the end of it.
VIJAY SINGH:  I played decent, I didn't play great.  I just didn't make any putts all day.  It was a tough day, trying to hang on, trying not to -- guys coming up tomorrow morning with good weather, they are probably going to shoot the lights out.

I'm in good position.  I know tomorrow morning the guys are going to come out and probably be leading; 6- or 7-under will probably be leading but two days to go.
Q.  How many total holes did you play today?
VIJAY SINGH:  36, and enjoyed every bit of it.
