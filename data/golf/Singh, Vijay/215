Q.
Is it your right knee or your left knee?
VIJAY SINGH:  It's a little sore.  Marking the balls and lining up the putts was a little hard.  It's not bothering me when I'm hitting, a little bit but not as intensely as when I walk.
Q.  Just assess your game.
VIJAY SINGH:  I played well.  I missed out on two drives.

I couldn't get the speed of the greens.  It seemed like they were much slower than what we played the last two days.  I kept leaving everything short.  I did make one run and it went way by.  Hopefully I'll get the speed tomorrow.
Q.  They say the fairways are faster, though, it's hard to keep the balls in the fairways.
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  You can keep the drives in the fairways.
Q.  Anything that you did particularly well?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know, I hung in there.  I wasn't impatient.  I was very, very patient throughout the day.  When I did hit in the rough I just went and saw the lie and played on from there.
