   VIJAY SINGH: I don't like the wind, though. It goes from 10 miles an hour to 30 at times, so it left you hanging there and tough to do, you know. Take the opportunity when you can.  
  
  Q. How is it going?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah. Made a good birdie on 17 and 16, two good putts, you know and that's how it went.  
  
  Q. Are you happy?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah. No pain and just all good.   
  
  Q. What do you think about your tee time tomorrow morning?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Hopefully tomorrow morning there will be less wind. I've not played this golf course without the wind.  
  
  Q. How bad is the wind?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Windy conditions are tough. You give away a few more shots and it's longer and wait for the wind to calm down. Very normal play, you know.  
  
  Q. How do you deal with it?   
 VIJAY SINGH: It's tough to deal with it, you know. You hope for the best on each shot, and you do what you have to.  
  
  Q. What about the heat?   
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, keeps it cool a little bit. Try to find the shaded area as much as possible. Process all that you can do.
