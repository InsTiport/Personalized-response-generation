VIJAY SINGH:  I think that was the key, just hang in there with conditions like this.  It's not going to get any easier, but I'm really, really happy with that score.
Q.  Can you compare these conditions with any other place that you've played?  This is pretty unique for this desert, to have these kinds of winds.
VIJAY SINGH:  Normally it blows and the rains are coming down, but this was very unusual, clear skies, beautiful weather, but it's just so windy.  I think the greens were a little too fast, as well.

But we managed to get out there and finished, and I'm glad I finished.
Q.  What do you think about the way they watered the greens?
VIJAY SINGH:  Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to play.  The wind has calmed down a little bit this afternoon, but you've got to do what they say.
Q.  How happy are you with your round?
VIJAY SINGH:  Very.  I struggled all day.  I wasn't hitting the ball the way I wanted to or the way I was yesterday, but I managed to scrape around, make a lot of par saves.  That's what you've got to do when you're not playing well, you've got to make pars.
Q.  How difficult was that lob on 18 and how close did you come to rolling it up?
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, I got away with it a little bit.  I didn't hit it as far as I wanted to, but it was a safety shot, too.

But I'll take a par there, as well.
