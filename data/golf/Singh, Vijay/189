Q.
Comment on making that par save on the last hole.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, especially missing a few coming in.  I didn't want to finish on a bad note.  I had a good read and I hit it and I said, "I hope it goes in," and I put a good stroke on it.
Q.  What are your impressions of this golf course?
VIJAY SINGH:  Very good.  You can score very low here.  Well, you think you can score very low here, but the greens are so hard to read.  They're really tough.
Q.  We have some weather reports and it may get a little windier and chillier the next couple of days.  What changes will you have to make?
VIJAY SINGH:  I mean, normal conditions, my 7 iron goes 175, here is goes 165.  With the weather getting colder and windier, I think they're going to go nowhere.  That's the thing, it's going to play two or three clubs longer every shot.

It was pretty nice out there this morning.  If it stays like this, then I think we'll see lower scores.
