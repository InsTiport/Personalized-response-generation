 Q.  Talking about his round? 

 VIJAY SINGH:  Played decent the beginning of the day.  It wasn't as bad as yesterday. 

 It's not playing easy by any means.  We were hoping it would rain on Wednesday.  When it didn't, we knew it would be difficult. 

 Just playing solid golf and my putting is decent.  You've got to drive it.  I think this is the toughest driving course. 

 Q.  On the score boards? 

 VIJAY SINGH:  They are so big, if you don't see them then you have to be blind. 

 I don't know what the winning score will be. 

 In conditions like this you can get really quick.  Need to maintain rhythm.
