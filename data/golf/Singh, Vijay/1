Q. Safe to say that you had a interesting start?
VIJAY SINGH: Safe to say I wasn't feeling the best when I got here, but I warmed up well and I hit some good shots and made some nice putts in the first few, and just kept it going.
Q. This golf course, anything in particular you like about it, the setup?
VIJAY SINGH: Well, they're small greens, so if you hit a decent iron shot, you're going to have a decent putt for birdie.  Although the front side is a little bit more undulating than the back.  There's a lot of real humps and hollows on the front side.  But there's a lot of birdie opportunities.  If you drive the ball well, you're going to have a lot of chances, and they're tricky.  It's tricky out there.  If you just pick the wrong club, you're on the wrong side of a slope, you're going to have a tough time putting.
Q. Did it play any longer than it did in the practice rounds?
VIJAY SINGH: No, they moved the tees quite a ways forward, yeah.  3 normally we played from the back, they moved it forward.  I think 4 was quite a ways forward, as well.  5, as well.  Made it a lot easier.  Instead of 460, playing probably 20, 30 yards shorter.
Q. Overall would you say you're pretty happy with your --
VIJAY SINGH: I'm pretty happy, yes, considering the way I felt and the way I was -- I warmed up to the week, it wasn't very pleasant.  But a good start like this can kind of keep you going, keep your blood flowing.  I didn't play poorly.  I hit some squirrelly shots, but got away with it, you know.  Hit a lot of good shots, too.
Q. You're not out of position --
VIJAY SINGH: No, it's the first day, so...
