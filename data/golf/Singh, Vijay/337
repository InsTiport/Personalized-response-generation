Q.
Hole 18, great way to finish. 

VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I hit a driver, good drive and a good wedge and made a good putt.


Q.  Talk about your round today. 

VIJAY SINGH:  I played quite well.  I started off nicely, you know, kept the ball in play, hit a lot of good shots to the greens and had some nice putts.  It's very hot out there and there's crosswinds, but I played very solid.  I'm quite happy with the way I played.


Q.  Ending on such a good note, that's got to be a great way for you to get some sleep and come back tomorrow morning. 

VIJAY SINGH:  Conditions will be a little bit easier tomorrow I hope.  An eagle on 17 was great.  I pushed my second shot into the bunker but made a good putt there and made a great putt here.  I'm really pleased about it.


Q.  A lot of people talked about the bumpy greens.  How tough were the greens to read?

VIJAY SINGH:  Well, they're not hard to read, it's just hard to keep the ball in line because there's so many spike marks.  If I was the only one playing on them, I wouldn't have a problem.


Q.  How much of this game is mental where you have the confidence going into tomorrow?

VIJAY SINGH:  Well, you've got three days to go.  It's more than just another day.  You've got to be focused on what you're doing tomorrow.  I feel good about my game, especially playing tomorrow morning.  I'm just going to go out there and focus on what I'm doing and play a hole at a time and see what happens.
