Q.
Talk first about how tired you are right now. 

VIJAY SINGH:  I'm not tired at all.  I'm just disappointed we have to come back so early tomorrow.  I thought we'd come back around not at 7:15 but at 8:00, 8:30 and then finish the round.  I guess everybody has to do the same. 

The golf course is playing a lot different when we started our second round -- sorry, fourth round than when we started our third round.  It was a lot windier and more difficult.  Just when we were finishing, it was perfect and we couldn't have better conditions for golf.  There's no atmosphere out there, though, you know.  The crowd that stayed -- it was really good to have somebody watching you.  But the last round of a tournament, it didn't feel like that.  It's a shame because of the weather and you can't help it.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  I'm playing quite nicely.  I'd like to make some more putts and I'll be okay.


Q.  How important is another victory for you?

VIJAY SINGH:  Any time you win it's a great achievement.  I think the last one was Byron Nelson, it's been quite a while, and I've been playing very well, so I'm just going to go out there and see if I can finish it off.  I'm playing with J.L. and he's playing well, so I just hope I make a few birdies and we'll see what happens.


Q.  I know you had to run from third round to fourth round.  Did you get to eat in between?

VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I had a sandwich, it was no problem.  I only had to play another four or five holes, so it wasn't a big deal.
