Q.   4â€‘under par, little trouble there on 14, but still a good round despite that. 
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, I played pretty nicely.   Coming in was kind of difficult here with this rain and mist and whatever you call this.   But I played nicely.   I played nicely yesterday too.   So I'm in good position waiting for the weekend.

Q.   Real good position.   Scores yesterday really low.   Everything's coming back?
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, I would have thought that yesterday the weather was unbelievable and today this.   I'm in a good position, and I've got Monterey tomorrow.   So we'll see. 
I like that golf course.   We'll see if I can shoot a few more under and get in position for Sunday.

Q.   Feeling good about your swing and everything?
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, it's coming along.   It's healthy.   No more issues with my back, which is a good thing, so I'm ready to go out there and hit the ball the way I want to.
