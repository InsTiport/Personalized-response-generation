 Q.  2-under today.  Played pretty well out there.  VIJAY SINGH: Yeah.  I haven't played this golf course and haven't practiced with wind like that. It's all new.  Have to figure it out.  2-under is always a good round starting out.   Q.  How did the afternoon wind -- it definitely came in right in the middle of your round.  VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, it was pretty strong.  You have to be very careful.  It's a pretty tough golf course.  Doesn't let up at all.  You have to be on your game all the time.   Q.  Now, you're off tomorrow morning.  VIJAY SINGH: Hopefully the wind is a little calmer.   Q.  What do you have to focus on?  VIJAY SINGH: Hit it in the fairways.  If you hit the fairways, you can keep your score low.
