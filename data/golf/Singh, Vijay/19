  VIJAY SINGH:   I'm swinging much better, swinging a lot freer, so hopefully I can do something on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   The conditions, a lot of people questioned the conditions this morning if they should even have gone out.   
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, it was suspect.   It was almost unplayable on the driving range, and getting those guys out on the first tee was a little bit unfair.   But it dried up and the greens were playing pretty good.   There was very little water on the fairways.   It ended up okay.  
   
 Q. You Â’re playing a little better; is there something you found?   
VIJAY SINGH:   I changed my driver.   Driving the ball is very important for me.   If I can drive the ball off the tee like I used to, it sets up the whole game for me.   
I've been struggling pretty much all year.   But got this new driver, it's first week on the bag and it's got some heat in it.   I'm getting it out there, 300 plus, and straighter, so makes playing very easy.  
   
 Q.   Which driver is it?   
VIJAY SINGH:   It's a TaylorMade.   It's an older version of a TaylorMade, so Stage 2.
