VIJAY SINGH:  Overall it was a tough day.  I'm glad the way I finished.  I finished with a birdie, I'm one back and I'm in good position.  Hopefully I can go out there tomorrow and shoot a good one.
Q.  Heading into today's round you had made something like 29 out of 30 putts inside of ten feet.
VIJAY SINGH:  I'm making a lot and I'm missing a lot, too.  I just feel pretty solid with my putting right now.  I've worked very hard with what I'm doing and the machine that I'm working with, working with my stroke, and it's good.  I needed something to boost my confidence, especially the way I finished the last two weeks.  I'm ready for a win, and hopefully it happens tomorrow.
Q.  You mentioned you're going to go work on a couple things on the range.  Anything specific?
VIJAY SINGH:  Really I'm not happy with my driver.  My driver is really letting me down, and if I can just know how to hit it down the middle, I think I'll do okay.  It's really close.  We'll just make some adjustments and see what happens.
Q.  The last time you had a stretch where you hadn't really had any top finishes, you went out and won The Masters, so hopefully that's a good omen for the next couple weeks?
VIJAY SINGH:  Hopefully.  Hopefully I finish well this week and win next week at the Open.  I'm swinging well, playing well, I just need to work on ball striking for this week and next week.
