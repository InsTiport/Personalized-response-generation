  Q.  During the practice rounds, you said you thought 10-over could win; if this is the easy day and there are currently two men under par, what does that tell us about where we're headed?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  It's going to be a tough week.  We got some rain overnight and that softened the greens quite a bit.  You could tell the difference playing today than yesterday.   
 Yeah, it wasn't easy by any means.  I mean, you have to still hit the fairways and you have to hit the greens.  I think the pin placements -- the tough ones are still out there.  So we are in for a long week.
