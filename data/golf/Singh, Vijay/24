 Q.   Nice playing today.   Nearly.   
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, you know, the 3â€‘putt on 7 kind of messed me up.   Then bogey on 8 straightaway.   I was in good rhythm then.   
But I hung in there.   Had a lot of the good shots, and really, really happy with the way I putted.   Really happy with my caddie and my form.   
So it's a good start for the season, and I'm really excited.  
  
 Q.   And your attitude going into this end of the year, which is actually the start of the new season?   
VIJAY SINGH:   You know, I practiced pretty good.   I've got a new kind of move going with my golf swing.   I thought it was going to take longer to get in there.   For some odd reason it kind of got in there right away.  
It's a great feeling.   I got a lot more power and I'm hitting it longer, which is good to know.   I drove Garrigus time, so that's not too bad.   
I'm looking forward to next week now.   I feel it's in there and my whole game is coming out.   The putter is really, really hot, so that's a good thing.
