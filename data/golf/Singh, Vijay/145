  Q.  Well, you got it going on the weekend, 64, 67, 64 on the weekend.  Pretty good.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, golf game is coming on.  I was a little disappointed on the first day.  Figured a few things out, lack of focus, and I'm not putting enough attention on the first day.  That's why my first score is so high, pretty poor.   
 You know, I'm very optimistic about the next few weeks.  I'm playing well, feeling good, and the putter is coming around.   
  
  Q.  How is your partner playing for next week?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know, we'll have to find out.   
  
  Q.  After you won the Mercedes, obviously weird conditions there with all the stuff like that and elevation changes, did you have to adjust your game a little bit to kind of get back to kind of more normal golf?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yes and so.  Maybe my expectations got a little too high.  But the second week, again, it was pretty windy, so I had to figure that one out.  I putted horrible in San Diego.   
 You know, this week the putter started coming around, the game started feeling -- I'm beginning to feel it again.  So I'm excited about the next few weeks.
