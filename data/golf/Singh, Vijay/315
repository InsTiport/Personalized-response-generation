VIJAY SINGH:  I was just forcing it at the end.  I played well, I played well coming in.  I just made too many mistakes.


Q.  What's next on the weekend for you?  Saying you do make the cut?

VIJAY SINGH:  I don't think I will.  I've got a flight going back as soon as I get back, and we'll try again next week.


Q.  If you don't play this weekend, and you have the weekend off, what are you going to do going into next week?

VIJAY SINGH:   I haven't seen my boy for three or four weeks.  I'm going back to Florida.  I'll come back on Tuesday and see what happens.
