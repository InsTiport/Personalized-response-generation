VIJAY SINGH:   I played well.  I played as good as I did yesterday.  I hit a lot of balls close and took the opportunities on par-5s.  I played nicely.  I'm a little disappointed that I only shot 4-under and a little disappointed that Chad Campbell is running away with it, you know, but we'll see what happens tomorrow. 


Q.   Tomorrow still to come, it looks like you're in good position to win that money title.

VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah.  I mean, so far I think it's -- I'm in great position unless something odd happens.  I think I've secured it.  That wasn't my concern coming over here.  I wanted to play well in this tournament and I'm playing well, I'm just not scoring as good as I want to.


Q.   I know you've gone low a lot of times, a lot of places, and aren't easily impressed but I'm wondering if you can see that Campbell is 10-under for 16, what do you think about a guy putting up that score?

VIJAY SINGH:   It's great playing, because the pins are not that easy.  He's playing well and it must be probably one of the rounds of the year right there.  11-under, 11 birdies in 16 holes so far, that's good shooting.
