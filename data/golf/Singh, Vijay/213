Q.  What do you think of the course?
VIJAY SINGH:  I think it is great.  The greens are getting firmer, a lot better than last week.  A lot more playable anyway.  You know, the golf course is playing good.  They lengthened, I think, one hole out there, 7, which is playing totally different.  It is going to stop guys from reaching the green there.  Probably add a stroke to the whole golf course.
Q.  Is ten reachable for you?
VIJAY SINGH:  10 is, I think today would be a little bit difficult with the wind.  Ten has always been reachable.  I think 70, 80 percent of the guys are going to reach the green, yeah.
Q.  What kind of different mindset do you have from last week?  Are you more relieved to be out there or do you feel you have to make more birdies?
VIJAY SINGH:  I think the golf course plays easier.  It is easier to hit the fairways.  It is more of a relief to come out here and tee up and not worry about if you are going to miss the fairway and you are not going to hit the green.  Over here if you miss the fairway, you can still run it up if you have a long iron into the green.  And still have a putt left and not worry about hitting a good shot and having a possible chip shot to the hole.
Q.  Does it make it a little easier on the brain cells so to speak?
VIJAY SINGH:  I think so.  Normal mindset, normal of what you are going to do.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
VIJAY SINGH:  I am not really worried about him, we worry about ourselves.  I think we are looking forward to going out there.  I love this golf course.  It has always been one of my favorites.
Q.  What about New York?
VIJAY SINGH:  I love it.  The crowd is a little louder than the rest of the country, but you have to get used to it.  As long as they don't cheer in the back of your golf swing, everything is cool.
