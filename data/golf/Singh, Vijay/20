 Q.  Just overall, how did you play today?  Left a couple out there couple putts, overall how did you do?  VIJAY SINGH: I did the best I could.  I tried.  Nothing was going good for me today.  Started off with a bogey and bogeyed again.  It's that kind of golf course.  We have a momentum going, you can shoot good.  For me, just didn't happen.  I could have won easily and everybody would say the same thing.   Q.  What do you think ever Gene Sauers and how he's playing?  VIJAY SINGH: I don't know.  I don't really know Gene's game.  I haven't been around him that long so -- that much.  So -- but I'm sure he's playing very well. You need to drive the ball very well on this golf course and I hit too many balls just off the fairways so you can't attack the pins.  I gave it a shot, gave it all I could and came up short.   Q.  Could you see this hosting one day a regular U.S. Open?  VIJAY SINGH: It should.  It's a good golf course.  One hell of a test of golf.  They can make it as hard as they want to
