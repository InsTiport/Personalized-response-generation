 Q. How does it feel entering this week after you won last week? And then this is a tournament you've won before; what are your thoughts?
 VIJAY SINGH: I feel good about this golf course. I've played well here and have good feelings about this course. So yeah, I'm ready to go out and play. 

 Q. What were your thoughts about the last time you won here? 
 VIJAY SINGH: There was a lot of things happening at that time when I won. I became world No. 1 and all those things. It was '04 and I was having a great year. Hopefully I can top that one this year and make another win.

 Q. And one more question about your game last week. What was the strongest part of your game last week?
 VIJAY SINGH: I putted really well. My attitude was really good throughout the whole game. The whole package was pretty much on, so as the weekend got -- the first two days was okay, and as the weekend came along, I kind of played better. So that's what you want to do, you want to play well on the weekend, and that's what happened.
