Q.  4 under par.  Looking at a little bit of pain there, Vijay.  Did you hurt yourself today?
VIJAY SINGH:  No, just a little stiff in the lower back, but nothing that a good night's rest won't sort out.  I've been stiff for a whole week, but it's getting better.
Q.  Your ball striking last week at the PGA was impeccable.  The short stick really let you down.
VIJAY SINGH:  You know, the pin placements were all on little mounds, so I had to get really good lines to play.  If you were on the wrong side of the hole, no matter how close you were, you were going to have really breaking putts.  I played well, I played well today, struck the ball well.  My front side, which was the back nine, I didn't drive the ball as good.  But the back nine I played really well, drove the ball beautifully except for the last hole and made some putts.
Q.  How difficult did this course play today?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not as difficult as I thought it would be.  A lot of holes played downwind, a couple holes were downwind, so we got away with playing the harder holes downwind and the shorter holes into the wind.

I played pretty good.  It came along on the back nine.  All in all, I missed three fairways today.  I drove it nicely and hit some good iron shots was the key.

Ten 1 putts, I would have shot 8 under.  I didn't have ten 1 putts.  I probably had six or seven.  I hit a lot of greens, hit a lot of fairways.  I'm playing well.  This is a golf course that you have to manage your game.  You've got to miss on the right side.  If you're going for the green from the rough and all that, you've got to give yourself chances to get up and down.  That's the key.
