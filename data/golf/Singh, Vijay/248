Q.  Are you happy with your opening round?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it was pretty good until 18.  I would have loved to finished at least with a par instead of a bogey, one of the easier holes out there.

But, you know, it was a really tough day.  The winds are gusting quite a lot today, I don't know, 30 miles an hour.  It was hard hitting every shot, the drive, approach shot was difficult.  I'm really happy with my round.
Q.  Are you right where you want to be going into the next round?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it's the first round, so good to stay in the game.  Any under-par round today is pretty good.
Q.  How did the wind affect your game today?  Some players talk about how they have to club up.
VIJAY SINGH:  You could have clubbed two, three times up, but you just have to manage your game here.  With the wind blowing this hard, you cannot play your normal game, you have to be able to fiddle around and try to hit solid shots and trust your swing. You really have to trust it.

I don't think the forecast is going to die down.  I think it's going to be like this.  I would rather see it like this for two days and see what happens on the weekend.
Q.  When you practice when the wind is up, is that a lot different, how difficult is that practicing?
VIJAY SINGH:  We've played in winds like this before.  It's not our first time around.  Like I say, you just have to manage yourself, keep your swing intact and you have got to trust your shots.
Q.  Any thoughts Michelle Wie, with struggling out there today?
VIJAY SINGH:  It's tough for the boys over here, you know.  Going to be tough for a girl here, too.
