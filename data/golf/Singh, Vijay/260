Q.  Even par today, just a matter of not being able to get much going?
VIJAY SINGH:  Just couldn't get it going, couldn't get it started.  Every time I tried to do something if I didn't make a birdie, I'd come up with a bogey.  If I made a bogey, I'd come back with two birdies and make a bogey again.  Just no momentum going on out there.

The putts you need to make, they just weren't going in.
Q.  Talk about the golf course.  How is it playing?
VIJAY SINGH:  There's a lot of mud, you know.  The greens are so soft and slow.  Pitch shots, you think they're going to land and release, and from Bermuda you have to hit them so much harder to get any kind of feel from it, it's easier to be downhill than uphill, at least you know what the ball is going to do.

It gets a little -- it's different, you know.  The first time I played here was different than this time.
Q.  You have to hit a lot of like control shots so it doesn't spin too much?
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, you think that you have to go for the pins, and you can actually play around here playing safe, playing the middle of the greens, and hopefully make putts.

The way the pins are set up, you feel like you have to go for every pin, otherwise you're going to go backwards.
Q.  You hold the course record here.  Do you feel like you have it in you tomorrow if you get off to a good start?
VIJAY SINGH:  I need to play well.  I need to be on the ball to be able to do that and be able to make some putts.

I'm looking for a low round.  I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I think I've got a good run in me.
