 Q. Great playing out there. Can we get some comments? 
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I'm really disappointed in the score, bogeying 9 and 10 after a good first eight holes and then hitting a 5-iron and not making birdie there. But considering all, this is the first time that I've actually felt good, and coming back to the way I know how to play golf. Whatever happens, I'm very satisfied with my result this week. 

 Q. How do you handle this now? There's guys that are going to finish up tomorrow. I think you're two strokes back from the leader. 
 VIJAY SINGH: I've got no chance. They're going to come back tomorrow and I think the leaders have two par-5s to go and 17, and they're good enough players to I think --

 Q. Will you leave tonight?
 VIJAY SINGH: I'll leave tomorrow morning. 

 Q. Is that why you decided to just go ahead and finish up out there?
 VIJAY SINGH: It really didn't matter. Matt wanted to finish, as well, and go home. You know, I had a good chance to birdie and missed it left. It didn't bother me at all.

 Q. But you could read it and see it fine?
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah.

 Q. Did you mean this was the first week you're back?
 VIJAY SINGH: I mean, I've felt good all year, but Hawai'i was the first time I've played in two months, and last week was a different week playing at Torrey. Again, this week was very different, as well, with the delays and all that. But hopefully next week we get a normal tournament.

 Q. But physically you're feeling great?
 VIJAY SINGH: Physically I'm feeling really good, yes.
