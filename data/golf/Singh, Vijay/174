Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I hope so.  It's a lot of work, trying to get the rhythm good, and a good turn.  And it's not complicated.  It's nothing, it's just get a nice rhythm.  I think the swing is working good, and the putter is coming back.  I just need to be out trusting myself on my play, and it almost happened today.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I think so, from last week to today was a big improvement.  I didn't think about it as much as I did last week.  And the big turn that I've been working on, that's my key; if I made a good turn I'll have good rhythm.

My putting is a big factor, as well.  I'm feeling more and more comfortable in my game so I'm not thinking about missing it anymore.  I'm thinking about making a lot of putts and that's a good thing to do.  If you go out there and feel comfortable with your putter out there, the whole game is going to come out.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  It's just the fine tuning part of it.  It's little bits and pieces.  You can make a good turn, but if you don't complete the turn, then the rhythm goes.  And I think my golf game is all about rhythm and trusting.  I'm very critical of my own golf swing.  My caddie said, why not just go out and trust it and play it.

I think my expectation is too high; that gets me in trouble a lot of times.  I'm hitting good shots to 15 feet and I'm not happy with it.  I should take it and go and play the next hole.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, exactly, and just starting out before this.  It's like a bow and arrow, you pull the bow to the max and let it go and I'm not quite doing that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I had good yardage, probably the best shot I hit all day.  Just tried to fade it in there and it came out just the way I wanted to hit it.  That was probably the shot I wanted to remember going into tomorrow, the one shot that you hit it the way you want to hit it and it comes out.  It was a 5 iron.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I have a week off next week and will work on it a little bit more.  I'm excited about it.  I was excited about it last week, as well.

But let's not put this tournament away.  This is a big tournament for us.  I'm focused on it right now.  It's probably the best start I've had and I'm going to take that and see what I can do tomorrow.
