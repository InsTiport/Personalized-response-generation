Q.
Tell us about the hole in one.
VIJAY SINGH:  I hit a 7-iron and it went in.
Q.  How many is that for your career?
VIJAY SINGH:  I have no idea, I don't know, ten, nine, eight?  I've got quite a few, yes.
Q.  What was your yardage?
VIJAY SINGH:  I think we calculated around 185, 186, something like that.  I hit it yesterday; yesterday it went over the green, today it went in.  It was the same kind of shot.
Q.  What do you think the difference is with so many --
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, the water is intimidating if you have it front right, but it's a pretty difficult shot if the wind gets any stronger to get it close on the left side.  Either way, you can always hit at the middle of the green and make par.
Q.  Did the No. 1 ranking ever enter --
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  I was trying to win the golf tournament.  I had a chance.  The guys are not really running away.

I played really well, I just missed a lot of putts out there in the middle of the round.  If I had done what I did last week, I would be right in there.
Q.  Were you aware of where you needed to finish for that ranking?
VIJAY SINGH:  It doesn't matter.  Whatever happens happens.  I'm not concerned about that anymore.
Q.  When your ball was in the air, did you know it was going to be close?
VIJAY SINGH:  It was straight.  It was the same as -- last year it was very straight, and it was really if I picked the right club or if the wind would take the ball or not.  I guess it was the right club, right distance.
Q.  What was the advantage of the energy?
VIJAY SINGH:  I mean, there was a lot of people out there, a lot of energy.  It was fun.
Q.  It seemed like they kept yelling at you, too, on 18.
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, they were all cheered up, I guess.  I finished up with a birdie there and made it even better.
Q.  Are you going down to Fiji now?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yes.
Q.  What are your plans?  When are you going?
VIJAY SINGH:  I'm going tomorrow.  It's been a while since I've been back, but I'm going tomorrow.
Q.  How many years has it been?
VIJAY SINGH:  A long time, six, seven years.
