Q. I guess just start by talking about your round today and kind of your mindset of the?
VIJAY SINGH: I played pretty good.  I think I struck the ball pretty good.  From tee to green I was solid.
Starting on probably 11, I missed the fairway on 11 and 12.  It didn't cost me anything but it cost me attempting for birdies.  I was on the green but it was long.
13 I got away with it.  16, I don't know if it hurt me or not, Bernhard made a good putt.  And then 3-putted 17.
But I missed a lot of putts out there.  If I would have putted nicely, this thing probably would have been over a long time ago.  But Bernhard played really solid, he never missed a shot and he was always on the green and he putted nicely as well, so he deserved to win.  The way I played, he should win.
Q. Anything you look back on your putting that you could kind of find a flaw or something today?
VIJAY SINGH: I don't know, probably I over-read some putts, if anything.  I should have gone with instincts more than just over-reading it.  The putt on 17, I just over-read the first one and I was too concerned about the line than the speed.  But the stroke feels good, it's just the ball just would not cooperate today.
Q. You finished 17-under, which is a record for highest non-winner what does that mean for you?
VIJAY SINGH: It doesn't really mean anything.  If you don't win, it doesn't really matter.
