   VIJAY SINGH: You know, I missed one or two greens, but putted really well. My solid play today was my putting today.   
  
  Q. The double was right before the rain delay?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah.  
  
  Q. So that gave you a chance to clear your mind a bit, then, and kind of move forward after that?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah.  
  
  Q. How big a factor was the wind?  
 VIJAY SINGH: It was windy, but just managed the direction of it. It wasn't totally into it, except for the sixth hole, I think.   
 It wasn't that bad. It was gusty, but if you could time it well, it wasn't that bad.  
  
  Q. All right? Appreciate it.
