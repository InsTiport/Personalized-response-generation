VIJAY SINGH:  Yesterday I gave away a lot of shots yesterday to the field, and today it was good, it was good to shoot a low number just to take advantage.
Q.  How about tomorrow, you put yourself in position and you know you can go crazy out here.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, but you've got to play well here.  You can't just go crazy low because the golf course is playing easy.  You have to go out there and play well and hit good shots and make the putts.  I have to do that tomorrow.  Hopefully I can go out there and make a putt.
Q.  You made that bunker shot yesterday, how big is it to get off to a fast start, not just on 1, but on 2, 3, 4, all the way to 7, the par 5?
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, you get through the first few and try to get close to the leaders or be in the lead, and the back nine you just have to go out there and shoot it out.  I'm going to go out there, play aggressive, aggressive, not too crazy and see what happens.
