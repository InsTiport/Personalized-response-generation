 Q. Pretty good result coming out of the first round. 
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, it's always nerve-wracking to play -- sometimes it's better to play a player that you know and you know his game. But he played really well. He went to a very fast start. I was down early, and I just hung in there, got my chances. He made one or two mistakes, and I capitalized and just played well from there in.

 Q. Was there any key to kind of getting it going there?
 VIJAY SINGH: I think I made a good putt on 10 from the front of the green, and that kind of got me even, and I just played well from there in. He missed one or two good opportunities, but I missed my share, too.

 Q. This event going to the second round is pretty much the key, right?
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I've got to play a little bit more aggressive. I think I get a little too tentative in the beginning. I think I've got to be very aggressive tomorrow if I want to keep going.
