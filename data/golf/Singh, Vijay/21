  VIJAY SINGH: It was a tough start.  Doubled the very first hole.  I fought back, and I got it back to even par.  It was hard playing with Wes the way he was feeling.  You know, he was wincing on every shot, and especially on his putts.  Kind of lost my focus there quite a bit.  Tried to keep it intact all the way. But I'm happy.  I mean, it wasn't easy out there.  I didn't hit the ball as good as I can, I guess, you know. Finishing off with even, look at the scoreboard, they're not going anywhere.  It's a good thing.Q. It seemed like there were lots of bogeys, especially guys coming in.VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, the finishing holes are playing really hard.  You've got to drive the ball on the fairway.  Pin placement on the last hole is really tricky. You can play to the middle of the green and two-putt it.  Standing with a 9-iron in your hand, all you're seeing is the flag. It's okay.  I mean, I think it's not going to get any easier.  Tomorrow is going to be pretty much same as today.  I just need a good start and see what happens from there.Q. Does it remind you of some U.S. Open courses you play on the regular tour?VIJAY SINGH: Very much so.  Not as long, I guess, you know, but really tricky.  I mean, it's really hard to keep it on the fairway, and the greens are getting really firm.  You know, getting crusty out there and swirling winds. Except for 18, 1, and 9, every hole is a crosswind, left to right or right to left.  A lot are left to right holes. It's tough.
