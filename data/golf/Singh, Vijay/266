Q.
Just another day at the office, Vijay, another good round.
VIJAY SINGH:  The greens were very nice today and there was no wind, so as long as you hit the fairway, you were okay.  That's what I did.

I don't think I missed too many fairways and hit a lot of greens.  I missed one green and two greens I was on the fringe.  If you do that, you're going to score.
Q.  Does it get to a point where you're stunned if you don't break par?  Are you playing that well?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  I'm focused on the game.  I work hard.  You know, getting ready for this tournament, that's the thing.

I'm not worried about what happened last week.  This is my focus right now.  I want to go out there and I want to play well.  You know, if you hit decent shots and make some putts, you're going to play well, and that's what I'm doing right now.
Q.  Has that approach changed any in the 11 years or so that you've been here?
VIJAY SINGH:  Really I've only done the same thing, I'm just hitting a little bit better shots now and not making too many mistakes, and the ones that I do make mistakes, you know, are not as bad as the bad ones I used to do, so my bad is not that bad and my good is pretty good.
Q.  The weather is supposed to be pretty nice all week, and this is a tough course but it looks like it's going to play a little bit easier and we'll see some low scores.
VIJAY SINGH:  It's going to dry out a little bit.  The greens are going to get a little faster.  There's a few greens out there we're lucky to be playing in the morning, otherwise they would be difficult.

It's not going to get easier than what it is right now.  It's going to get tougher as the week goes on.
