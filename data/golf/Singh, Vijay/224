Q.
Talk about your round today with the swirling winds.
VIJAY SINGH:  I think putting was the most difficult thing out there.  The pins were in pretty difficult spots.  They were all over little ridges.  You hit it into the grain and as soon as it gets to the top you get downwind; 17 and 18 and 16 was exactly the same.  The wind is blowing like this and there's a lot of possible three-putts.
Q.  How windy was it out there today?
VIJAY SINGH:  It's gusty.  At times you think it's calm and you're going to be making contact with the ball and the wind comes up.  The ball can go anywhere.

This is the worst kind of wind where it's up-and-down, up-and-down.  There's no one consistent type of wind.  It's blowing steady and then all of a sudden there will be nothing there.  If you take the right club, you don't know if it's the right one or not.
