  Q. 8-under par, pretty strong playing for two rounds. Comments?   
 VIJAY SINGH: I played well. I played well yesterday, really good, and played well today. I putted a little better, but I'm really happy the way I'm striking it. It's been a while since I struck the ball this good. I'm really excited.  
  
  Q. The delay this morning didn't affect you a whole lot?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I mean, after the delay I played well. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. This time it was good for me. I played well all day anyway, so it didn't really matter. I have a good frame of mind.  
  
  Q. Two back on a golf course here that you like. Just comments on the weekend?   
 VIJAY SINGH: I mean, it'll be exciting. The way I'm striking the ball, I hope I strike it like this all week, so if I do this on the weekend I have a good chance of finishing good here.  
  
  Q. Any birdies that stand out today?   
 VIJAY SINGH: Probably have one that I got on the first hole, the 10th hole, hit it in the bunker and then laid up and hit it to six feet. That was a great birdie, so that kind of got me going.
