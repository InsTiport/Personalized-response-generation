VIJAY SINGH:  It was a little disappointing.  I had a chance to shoot a really low number.  I had 5-under through 10 and had good chances coming in but just made those bogeys, three bogeys, 12, 16 and 18, two three-putts, a bad way to finish.  I only had 100 yards to the pin and bogeyed it.

I'm playing well, looking forward to the weekend now.
Q.  Did the weather delay hurt you much at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  My play on the greens kind of went south a little bit.  They slowed up quite a bit and you had to kind of hit the ball after that.  When I started off the greens were rolling beautifully.

Hopefully tomorrow it dries out a little bit and we get the greens back again.
Q.  It might have been a bumpy finish, but you're right in there in contention for the weekend.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I'm feeling good about my game.  I'm going to finish well, get some good momentum for next week.  My focus is to try to go out there tomorrow and see if I can get close
