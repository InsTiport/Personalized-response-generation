Q. First and foremost, how big was that eagle on 9 to get a little bit in into contention going into the weekend?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, you know it's a tough golf course for me, I don't know why, but I've never really scored well here.  But this is probably the first time that I feel a little bit more comfortable doing it.   That was big.  I wanted to be within, you know, four or five and I've got it to within five now.

So for the weekend, I don't know what the weather is going to be, but I can be more aggressive on the weekend.
Q.  You've come from behind several times to, and at the Bell Canadian last year, you were in the middle of the pack and got into a playoff to win on Sunday.
VIJAY SINGH:  I need to shoot a good one, I need to get it to inside two or three of the lead.  If I can go ahead and have a good start, it's yielding a lot of birdies if you hit the fairways, and I'm just beginning to feel comfortable with my driver, so I can do it tomorrow.
Q.  How big of an adjustment is it coming over from Kapalua at the Mercedes to this golf course?
VIJAY SINGH:  It's a different golf course.  You've got to drive the ball good.  There's too much fairway out there; I think the whole golf course is very tight here.   And on Kapalua you can hit it wayward if you want to and get away with it.

That's the key here, keep the ball in play, and that's the adjustment you have to make.  The rough is not much longer and the bermuda is really thick here, so you just have to keep the ball in play.
