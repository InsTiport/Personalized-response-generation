 Q.  Your thoughts on the game right now. 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I played okay, I just couldn't get my rhythm going in the beginning.  It wasn't a pretty match.  It was -- he was 1-down, then I was 1-down.  We both played kind of half decent, but that's the way you've got to hang in there and just pull it off if you can. 

 Q.  You talked about getting down early in the match.  What do you do to pick yourself up by your boot straps and get going? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  It's good to get down early and not late.  If you are down on 1 and 2, there's a lot of holes to go.  You just wait and be patient; that's what I do. 

 Q.  Now you've made it to the third round.  You've got Rod Pampling tomorrow.  Your thoughts on that match? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  He's a good friend of mine.  But we'll go out tomorrow and see what happens.  Hopefully I hit the ball a little better than today and make some putts. 

 Q.  Any turning points on that match? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  The turning point was probably on 17, I guess.  On 15 I hit a bad tee shot and I had a good lag putt there.  I played solid.  I made too many mistakes along the way.  I made three bogeys and gave him three holes, and you never want to do that on days like this.  But I pulled it off.
