VIJAY SINGH:  Normally it's good, today it wasn't.  But Tiger played incredible the front nine.  He made two eagles and four birdies or three birdies, and that was good golfing.  And I hung in there, but I made too many mistakes.  But I was proud of myself.

I played well the back nine and I never got anything going.  When I did make a birdie, he made his as well.  But I hung in there and finished short.
Q.  The fact that he made eagle at No. 2, birdied number 3, in the first three holes, did that have an effect for the day?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really, I mean it's 18 holes of golf out there.  But I was still leading as well.  And he kept playing well and he played good golf.  There's nothing bad about my golf, he just played better today.
Q.  Is there a point in a round at all you're saying, geez, I'm playing pretty good, I'm playing about as good as I can, but this guy is just, he's a lot better?
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, I wasn't playing as good as I can.  I just didn't play good enough.  That's the bottom line.  There's a lot of chances out there and I just didn't take them.
Q.  He had a good up and down at 14 and then 15 he made a good birdie putt.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, he made birdie on 15 and I didn't make my birdie on 14, so if that would have gone in it would have been different, but he just kept putting the pressure on me.  And he made a great birdie on 17 and he kind of shut the door.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I tried to be aggressive, I think it just came out left.  The tee shot did me in.
