 Q.  Talk about your match. 
VIJAY SINGH:   Well, played pretty good.  I started off very slow.  Didn't hit too many greens.  He played really nicely.  Actually, he, unfortunately didn't make any putts today on the front nine. 

On the back nine, I made a good birdie on 9.  I had a good 2-putt, and I birdied 10 and birdied 12, 13, 14 and that made a big difference. 

Happy with my round.  Happy to get it over with.  He's a very good player, very underrated over here, and I know his capabilities, and he played well last week.  So, he has a lot of confidence going.


Q.  Do you think that you started out slow with your play and then kind of started to feel more comfortable in the round?
VIJAY SINGH:   I didn't play badly.  I didn't make a bogey today.  He didn't play badly, but he just played better on the front nine and I did a lot better on the back nine.
