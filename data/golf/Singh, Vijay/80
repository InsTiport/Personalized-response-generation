 Q. Just talk about the day. Obviously the golf course is playing very difficult. 
 VIJAY SINGH: It's not really playing that difficult if you're hitting it okay. If you miss the fairways, that's when the trouble comes. You're very happy to get close to the pins. 
 If you miss the fairway -- if you do miss the fairway, you should just play safe. But if you're over par, it always seems like you want to go for a flag and you get into more trouble. When we're in contention, we play more to the safer side so we can make par if we're in trouble.

 Q. How about the greens?
 VIJAY SINGH: It's okay. Yeah, it's hard to read the greens. Just very similar to what we played the first time at TPC. We've played here so many times, and you kind of know which way it's going to break. When you keep looking at it you know it's going to break left, but it just doesn't go that way. 
 I think the first time it's better here because you don't really know these greens.

 Q. I think it's human nature given the situation you're in. It's hard to keep focused. 
 VIJAY SINGH: Maybe it was yesterday. I was out there trying really hard. I'm going to go out there tomorrow and try to shoot -- Kim shot 6-under yesterday, so it's out there.

 Q. But looking back at your day yesterday, do you think you --
 VIJAY SINGH: When I started off I was a little bit too overwhelmed with the situation I was in. Wherever you go, whatever I did yesterday, it was like people were congratulating me before the tournament even started (laughing). 
 I want to get congratulated after the tournament. So that kind of plays a weird thing in your mind. I tried to keep focused. Two more days, see what I can do.

 Q. What did you tell yourself before today?
 VIJAY SINGH: Just go and play. I started off really shaky and bogeyed the first two, but I tried. I'll keep trying tomorrow.
