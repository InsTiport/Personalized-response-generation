VIJAY SINGH:  The course is pretty good.  The greens are different this year.  There's a lot more grass and not as fast, and today is only Tuesday.  It's going to get faster and dryer, but they're supposed to get a lot of rain.  I'm excited to come back here.  I like this golf course.  I've had good records here, and I'm just looking forward for it to start.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I think it's a good driving golf course.  You've got to be able to drive the ball well.  I don't know, for some reason every time I came here, I drove the ball good.  It's a good test of golf course.  I mean, it doesn't let up at all.  Every hole has got some sort of character to it, and if you mis-hit a shot, either way it's going to get you.  You've got to play pretty solid golf.  I don't think too many under is going to win here.  I like that kind of a game.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I woke up January 1st and I said I was going to win nine tournaments (laughter).
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  No, the whole year has been good.  You don't really wake up one day and think you're going to be able to play like I did this year.  It's a buildup to it.  You win one and then you win another one.  You get more confident, like snowballing.  You feel more comfortable and more confident.  You can't wait to the next hole and play better.  That's how it's been.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know.  You guys figure that one out.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I mean, I never knew about that record.  I just heard it like last week.  I mean, it would be an incredible thing to win ten in a season.  People don't win one and go through their whole career.  If I win this week, it'll be ten.  It would be just an incredible thing to accomplish, I think.  Being in the same boat and the same page as Snead and Hogan and just comparing against them it just -- really you don't have words to describe it.  I'm just looking forward to starting on Thursday and seeing if I can reach there.  If I don't, it's fine, but if not, I'll take nine.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
VIJAY SINGH:  Every tournament is different.  Every tournament you start off even on Thursday, and whatever you've done a week before, you can throw that out the window when you tee it up on Thursday.  To me, every time I tee it up, it's a new event.  You need 100 percent focus on that event, and I don't think about what happened in the past.  It takes all the confidence out of it, and you take that and play the round.

I take each tournament differently and give it as much importance as any other tournament I play.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I didn't work out Monday.  I didn't work out yesterday.  I had a few things to do, but I really took my son out, took him out on the golf course and gave him a lesson for an hour.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Pretty much, but I like to do that a lot.  I don't hit balls at all when I do that.  That's one of my joys to do.  Besides that, I really take it easy.  I walk on the beach or play with the dogs or do something different.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I mean, especially when you play, you're in the middle of the heat every week.  I'm feeling it a little bit, feeling the strain a little bit.  I need to get to bed earlier now than what I did middle of the season.  Come 10:00, 10:30, I'm done.  That's when you know that you're getting tired at the end of the season.  I'm glad this is the last tournament.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  See, that's another stat I didn't know (laughter).  I don't know what's going to be the next one.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I guess I've got really little to do after this week, after this weekend.  I'm going to be in Hawaii for the grand slam, and I think I'm going to have a party there.  You all are invited (laughter).

Thank you.
