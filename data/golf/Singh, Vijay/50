  Q. Vijay, nicely done today. Got started with a couple of birdies, finished with one. Must be feeling pretty good.  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, you know, I played well. I played a really solid round of golf. It started off and I thought, here we go. It's going to be a good one, and then I didn't take the opportunities on the front nine. I had some nice chances for birdies, and the putter kind of slowed down a little bit. And then bogeyed 10, but the Back 9 was a lot of birdies, so you know, I just hung in there and hit some good shots and made some nice birdies.  
  
  Q. Justin got up to 14, but that can be done around here. I mean you could just as easily go off and you could have done it today, could do it tomorrow, huh?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah. Weekend's a little different and a lot more pressure, but I just have to worry about my game and see if I can hit more solid shots and try to make the putts.  
  
  Q. What is really working for you? What's been a difference maker for you this week?  
 VIJAY SINGH: I think the whole thing. I'm driving the ball better now and controlling the ball a lot better, and putting nicely.   
 I'm not putting too much pressure on my putts, and they're rolling good. So that would be my strong point right now, my putting.  
  
  Q. Keep it up. Thanks for your time.  
 VIJAY SINGH: Thank you.
