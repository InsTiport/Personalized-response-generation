VIJAY SINGH:  I played well.
Q.  Everyone is talking about game plans with match play.  Does the game plan change at all with the conditions out there today?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  You've got to be careful with your second shots.  You have to know where to run the ball and how much to spin the ball up.  So a few holes you have to pitch it 15, 20 feet past it to get enough spin to get it to the flag.

But I played well.  I managed my game really well today, and I'm just glad the first round is through.
Q.  The second round has been your nemesis the few times out here.  What is it about the second round that you feel you have a hard time getting over the hump on?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't think it's me, I think the guy I'm playing with did better than me.  I don't know, I just am looking forward to tomorrow.  I'm playing well, I feel good about my game.  I just need to make some putts tomorrow and play the way I'm playing.  I don't think I'll have a problem.
Q.  Were you surprised you guys played this morning?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  The day was perfect; you couldn't have a better day.  It's going to be tough, but we have to bear down and play the situation.  The conditions are not good at any cost, but everybody has to play the same thing.  We just go out there and play.  We are professionals, we know the conditions, we know you can't help Mother Nature.  There were some spots that were really wet, but it was okay.  It was fine.
