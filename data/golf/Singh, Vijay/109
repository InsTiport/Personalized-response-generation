   VIJAY SINGH;  I got myself back in a little but just made too many silly mistakes. But we have tomorrow to go and let's see if we can make an early run and get something going. The golf course is yielding a lot of birdies and I am making a lot of birdies so I just have to go out and not make any mistakes. I made four or five bogeys today which is just not good enough. 

 Q.  The four birdies early on got you back in contention so is that what you need again tomorrow? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  They were good and I had a good chance on the ninth and put it in the water and that should not happen. But it did. 

 Q.  Not too far back then? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I will just come out tomorrow and see if I can be more aggressive and make early birdies.
