 Q.  It doesn't look like you're going to win.  Is this a tournament you thought you should have won? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I think so.  I gave it away yesterday on the first nine.  Conditions were different yesterday to today.  I'm satisfied with the way I'm hitting it.  There's always next week. 

 Q.  You missed a few greens but you found a way to make pars. 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I didn't miss a green today.  I putted on every green, anyway.  I played very good.  I just didn't take the chances that I had.  You know, I had a few good opportunities to make birdie and I did not do that.  
 Q.  The last two holes were a great finish for you. 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, good putts but didn't go in.  Both of them hit the hole.  You know, just the way it is. 

 Q.  When you saw Hunter's fall on 18, did any kind of flashbacks from a couple times -- 
 VIJAY SINGH:  No, I was pretty focused on what I was doing.  I knew that I had a good club.  I was focused on making a birdie and that's what I tried to do. I hit a good shot and didn't go in. 
 I hit it a little easier than I wanted to because I had too much club, but it was a good attempt.  
 Q.  You going to another course next week you've had some success; just build on this? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I've got to make a few more putts next week.  You've got to make the putts. 

 Q.  Next week you have four par 5s -- 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I don't think it makes any difference. 

 Q.  And what kind of positives do you take out of this week? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I played well, hitting the ball good and my iron shots are coming back, which is keeping my golf game, hitting my iron shots close.  Saw a lot of that this week.
