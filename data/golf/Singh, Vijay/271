BERNHARD LANGER: It reminded me of that old Bible story when little David beat Goliath. That's how I felt.  I was up most of the way but missed a few short putts, otherwise I would have been more up. He came back very strongly at the end of the second round and it was very tight all the way.

Obviously he's not happy. I wouldn't be happy if I had lost. He's No. 1 in the world and I'm somewhere in the mid-70s. He was the hot favourite. I am always tremendously motivated and 100% professional. Wherever I play I play to win and I knew my chances would be small but I played fairly well and gave him a good run.


VIJAY SINGH:  I did well to get back into the match when I was three down with the three birdies in a row. But to be honest I didn't play well enough in the match to win. Bernhard played pretty good and didn't make a mistake -- I just left it too late.
