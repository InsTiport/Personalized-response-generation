   VIJAY SINGH: I don't know -- I think it's the recurrence. It's not as bad as what I was in Tampa, but I think if I kept going, it was going to go that way.

 Q. More precautionary than --

VIJAY SINGH: Yes and no. I mean, okay with my back swing, but I'm not -- can't get through the ball as I want to, so I struggle. Take four days off and see what happens.

 Q. Hopefully get it better for next week?
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah.

 Q. How frustrating is it?
 VIJAY SINGH: It is very, because I'm beginning to swing really well, you know, everything is there, but you also need a body, too. I feel strong and everything, but it's not even my back anymore. It's when I walk now, like taking a cast off.

 Q. It's more the walking that's the problem, you can get out and hit balls and really doesn't effect you much?
 VIJAY SINGH: It affects me when I'm hitting balls. It's not my normal golf swing.
