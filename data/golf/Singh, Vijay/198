Q.  I'm sure you would have liked to have had that last--
VIJAY SINGH:  I hit a good putt.  I think it broke more than I thought.  All in all, it's a funny thing with yesterday, I could not drive a ball in the fairway.  2-over, 3-over that I shot yesterday, that kind of killed my chances.
Q.  If you look at your week, over 18 holes you had seven bogeys during that one stretch.
VIJAY SINGH:  And that was it, yeah.  I mean, if I had shot even par even or 1 or 2-under, I think I would have had a chance today.  That's the way it goes.  This golf tournament has not been friendly to me, so maybe next time.
