  Q.  Vijay, obviously a tough day with all the wind out there.  Were you pleased with what you were able to accomplish?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  I'm 2-over.  I don't know what the leaders are, but it was a tough day.  Just trying -- difficult in driving and putting, as well.  The greens were a lot faster than I thought they would be and just, you know, would have preferred even par but we've got a ways to go.   
  
  Q.  Couple guys said the wind was so inconsistent.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  I haven't played this golf course in a long, long time.  I really am not familiar with where to hit it off the tees and all that, so I drove the ball pretty decent today and hopefully tomorrow I can get it going.
