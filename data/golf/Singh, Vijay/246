Q.  Vijay, your ninth consecutive round in the 60s at Waialae Country Club.  You seem to have figured this track out over the years; is that the case?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, you know your way around and where to hit it and where not to hit it.

I played pretty well today.  I drove the ball really well and made one or two putts here and there.  But left a lot out there.  Pretty hard to read these greens
Q.  Outside of your Pebble victory in 2004, you're not exactly known for winning in a lot of windy conditions, but lately you seemed to have stepped it up in these types of weather conditions.  What do you attribute that to?
VIJAY SINGH:  Just ball-striking, able to hit the ball a lot more solid in the wind.  The ball is going to straighten out and wind doesn't affect it if you hit a solid shot.  I'm getting used to it.  I've always played okay in the wind.
Q.  What do you think will be your greatest challenge on Sunday; is it weather, is it field, is it you versus yourself, what is it?
VIJAY SINGH:  If I can get out there and have a good start and not worry about what the guys are doing, and just go out there and put a score up, that's the thing.  I'll go out there and play hard tomorrow and putt well.  I think that's the key.  I've been hitting a lot of good shots, but I'm not finishing over the putts, if I can do that tomorrow.
Q.  Do you think winning in Hawaii would be -- inaudible -- to feel like a complete golfer, not that you are not there right now?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know, I've had my chances over here.  I've never won.  Hey, maybe this week, you never know.
