THE MODERATOR:  Questions.
Q.  (About the round today.)
VIJAY SINGH:  Very up and down.  I played okay.  I didn't play badly at all.  The greens are so soft out there, every hole is a birdie opportunity.  You can't be dropping shots.

I made five bogeys (through the first two rounds) which is totally uncalled for.  It's out there.  If you go out there and make a few putts, you can shoot really a low number.
Q.  Plan for the weekend?
VIJAY SINGH:  I'll have to be aggressive tomorrow.  Depending on the pin placements and depending on the golf course.  Right now, the greens are so soft.  Congressional is not really playing like Congressional.  The pin placements are not hidden away.  You can get to the pins.  I was spinning back 5 irons.

You still have to hit the shots, though.  I am going to be very aggressive to try and shoot a low number.
Q.  A lot of birdie chances out there?
VIJAY SINGH:  I had a lot of chances and I made one stupid shot trying to hit a driver on 16.  It's hard not to be too aggressive when you are around the cut line.  I didn't want to miss two cuts in a row.  Not that it crossed my mind.  Coming in, I made a few birdies to get some momentum going.
