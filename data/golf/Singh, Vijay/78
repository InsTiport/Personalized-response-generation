 Q. Can you tell me about the round and No. 13 in particular?
 VIJAY SINGH: Hit a good drive and really good second shot. I haven't chipped in for a while.

 Q. And how do you feel about going into the final round where you're at? 
 VIJAY SINGH: I'm in good position. I'll play a good round tomorrow and see what happens. Any time you're within two, three shots back you have a chance. 

 Q. And then how do you feel about playing for Tiger's event?
 VIJAY SINGH: It's always a nice event. The event is run really well, and I've played it a few times, and it's a good golf course. A little wet, but it's a good golf course. And they really take care of the players here, so I really enjoy it.
