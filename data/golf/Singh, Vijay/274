Q.  How do you cope when it is this slow?
VIJAY SINGH:  You just get along with it. Slow yourself down And play the best you can. I have played a few of these before so I know how slow it is and your mind is adjusted to it. But it is a long day, a cold day. I don't mind playing this slow when it is warm but playing this slow when  it is cold is harder.

I played quite decent. Hit one or two loose shots out there. I didn't make birdie on the 12th hole which is important. I was in a run there. I played okay, I am surprised the scoring is so low. Everyone else must be used to this weather.
Q.  Is it like this in Fiji?

The only time it gets this cold is when you open the refrigerator.
