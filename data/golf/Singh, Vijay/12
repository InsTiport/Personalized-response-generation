 Q.  Could you please go into your restart this morning.  
VIJAY SINGH: The golf course is a little wet, but the greens are nice.  It's a pretty good golf course, so they moved the tees a little forward, so it was playing a lot shorter than what we played in the pro-am and practice rounds.  So had to get adjusted to that.   
 Q.  Type of start you wanted though?  
VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, any time you're under par or close to the lead you're always happy.  So it's a good start and we got a long ways to go.
