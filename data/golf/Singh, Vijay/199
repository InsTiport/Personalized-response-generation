Q. 1 over par, 3 under on the tournament.  It all seemed to be going pretty good until 16, 17 and came back on 18.  What happened?
VIJAY SINGH:  I didn't hit a great drive on 16 and laid up and came up just a little short.  I thought the wind was going to blow, it was right on line, just came up short and made a good bogey.

17, I hit another good drive down the middle and the ball spun off the green.

Made a good par on 18.

I played well.  I really like the way I'm playing.  I missed a few drives here and there.
Q.  You chipped up on 18 and made it for par.  How many years of experience does it take to learn not to go for every shot?  How long does it take you to know you have to manage the course?
VIJAY SINGH:  You know, you have options.  I could have gone to try to put it on the green, but it would have taken a really good shot through a little gap.  It was an easy option to lay up and go for it with a sand wedge.
