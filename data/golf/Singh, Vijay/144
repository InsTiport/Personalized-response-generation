 Q.  A 67, a nice day to play golf today is this? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it was.  It was pretty cold and windy when you started off.  It was very difficult.  I mean, the first five or six holes was chilly and we had sweaters on and it wasn't like the first two days. 
 But as the day went on along, it got warmer.  The wind died a little bit, and there were a lot of chances for birdies. 

 Q.  How is the golf course playing as the day progressed; did it get a little easier or did it get harder? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Oh, it got greens to go, they are releasing a lot more than the first two days, a little bit faster.  It's more like the Bay Hill we know.  The first two days they were very, very soft and we were picking up everything. 
 17 and 18 played pretty tough but the rest of them were playing okay.  If you hit good shots, you had chances for birdies. 

 Q.  Bay Hill you have contended very many times.  Do you like your position? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, depending on the leaders.  If they don't go crazy on the back nine, I think I have a shot tomorrow.
