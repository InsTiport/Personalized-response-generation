Q.
You're not getting your second win, but it was a good tournament for you.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I had my chances.  I played really well.  My putter really let me down this week.  All the shots that I made, to be two back was a disappointing way to finish.
Q.  I thought you said you made some adjustments.
VIJAY SINGH:  I did, but I just could not find the hole.  I stroked the ball well.  I had a lot of just missed putts.  I could have won this tournament comfortably the way I played.  I played really well from tee to green, even today.

I had my chances today.  On 10 it kind of let me down a little bit.  I had 3-iron into the green and I made bogey there.  Give me a birdie there and I'm on top of the lead.
Q.  Tell us how you feel going to the British Open.
VIJAY SINGH:  I feel really good.  I played well.  I struck the ball well.

The crowds were great.  I enjoyed myself.  They really had me with open arms, and that was really great.  I enjoyed that, and it was a great week for me.
Q.  Will we see you again sometime?
VIJAY SINGH:  If the dates are good, I will.  If it's before a major again, I will probably think about it.  I enjoyed myself here and the crowds are great and I played well, so I'll think about it next time.
