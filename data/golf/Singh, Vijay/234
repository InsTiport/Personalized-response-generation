Q.  Disappointing, but that shot had to look good in the air for you?
VIJAY SINGH:  It was a good shot.  I just hit the wrong club.  The wind shifted on me.  I kind of -- it was an aggressive shot, and I thought if I catch the right wind, i probably would have stiffed it.
Q.  The wind died on three holes and you could feel it kicking up right after; did it truck you a little bit?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know, I just hit the wrong club I think.  The air is getting a little heavier, and the wind is kind of turning a little bit.
Q.  What club did you hit?
VIJAY SINGH:  7.
Q.  What was the yardage?
VIJAY SINGH:  174.
Q.  You got No. 1 back, is that any consolation at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  I didn't think I got it back, did I?  (Laughs.)

Well, big deal.  I lost the golf tournament.
Q.  Do those numbers mean more to us than they do to you, the rankings?
VIJAY SINGH:  I just want to win the golf tournament.  I really wasn't worried about the ranking.  It's a shame that's happened but you've got to look forward.

I'm playing well, I'm hitting ball well.  So I'm looking forward to next week and hopefully I don't screw up again.
Q.  You made a nice charge at the end, two birdies in the last couple of holes, you made a nice charge, did you try too much?
VIJAY SINGH:  I was trying to win the golf tournament.  You know, if I had to do it again, I probably would have hit a different club, played safer a little bit and hopefully see if Kenny made a mistake but that's not the way I play.  I play aggressive and I went for the flag.  I just came up a little short.
Q.  These last few weeks are disappointing, but do you still like the way you're playing?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, that's what I just said.  I'm playing well and I'm looking forward to next week and two weeks down, the Masters.  My game is just coming around.  Hopefully it's going to be on for next week.
Q.  Was there a debate with you and Paul over the last club at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  No.  I picked it up and it was my choice.
