 Q. If you're going to shoot a 67, why not do it on Sunday at THE PLAYERS? Tell me about the course. 
 VIJAY SINGH: Well, it's playing different. I came here this week thinking I was a member, but I played like a guest (laughter). Until today I hit the ball pretty good. Still trying to feel my game. It's coming around. Last week was the first week I played kind of healthy, and I was thinking I was going to do better, but I'm happy to have one good round under my belt. That's a start, and I'm looking forward to the next events to come.

 Q. Birdied 16, birdied 17, and then 18 hit it in the water, but the third shot on 18, what did you hit there, because that was awesome? 
 VIJAY SINGH: I hit a 3-iron, and I aimed it way right, and I figured, just let the slope take it in. I pulled it a little bit, but it came out really well. It's the best par I've made in forever. 

 Q. 13 feet, it even got you to do a little fist pump there at the end. 
 VIJAY SINGH: I don't know, after I hit that shot in the water, I didn't figure I was going to make a par there.
