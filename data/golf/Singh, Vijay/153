Q.  You had it going on the front nine?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yes, then the bad weather came in and that knocked me out of my stride a bit. I had a good chance at 12 but it was raining heavily and I miscued one on 13 and made bogey and missed a tap-in on 14. Only two and a half feet, three at the most. At that stage I was threatening the lead. I would have been 11 under and one behind. I made a mistake at 17 and didn't get up and down from the Valley of Sin on 18. It wasn't that difficult but I needed to hit it a bit harder.

Still, playing well but the greens here are much slower than at Kingsbarns, but hopefully I can get a good one going at Carnoustie tomorrow. I like my position at this stage. Carnoustie is a hard golf course and I will see what I can do there. At least I am swinging well.

I would like to win on one of these great courses. I just fine it a little difficult to get used to the conditions and when it's cold you need to get your head down and battle and see what happens.
