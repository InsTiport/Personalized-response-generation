VIJAY SINGH:  My front nine was really -- I started out with a bogey on 1 and just couldn't get it going.  Fortunately my putter was hot on the back nine and I made some good putts and shot a good number. 

Q.
You seem to be doing that over and over.  

VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it's nice to be finishing in the Top-10, but it's also nice to win.  My goal was -- maybe that's why I'm playing so well.  I want to win any time I get in contention.  I suppose that's why I'm intent on getting low numbers. 

Q.
After starting off with a slow start to the week, to finish that well must be pretty exciting.  

VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, you know, 2-under after two days, I left it out there.  I didn't think I was going to finish like I did, but yesterday's round got me right back in it, and today's round today.  You can never count yourself out if you make the cut:  If you're playing well, you can always catch up. 

Q.
Looks like it's going to be a rare round, probably 18-under.  Is that what you thought the scores would be? 

VIJAY SINGH:  Well, I think it was going to be a lot higher than that.  I thought it would be like 14 or 15, considering those four holes that are playing at least 20 yards further, but the guys are getting better.  They're hitting the ball much longer and they're better players now.
