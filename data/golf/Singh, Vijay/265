Q.
Well, I guess your putting let you down a little bit today.  Is that accurate?
VIJAY SINGH:  No, I played great actually.  I didn't get up-and-down from the easiest spot on 10 and I birdied 11.

Towards the end I started hitting some decent shots, but these greens are pretty tough.  They put the pins in places where unless you're straight uphill, it's always a tricky putt to make.

I putted nicely.  I could have made one or two more, but I made one on 8 that kind of made my day.
Q.  And once again, heading into the weekend you're in good shape?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, so far.  I mean, I'm in good position, looking forward to playing well in the weekend if I can.

It's going to be tough.  The golf course is not getting any easier and the rough is growing, as well, so you've got to keep your head and hit it straight.
Q.  I'll bet you like it tough.
VIJAY SINGH:  I'm ready for it.  I'm playing well and I'm going to finish well here.
Q.  Did you have a long putt on 8?
VIJAY SINGH:  No, it was a 25-footer.
