Q.
Did you put the ball on the green from that bunker?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah.
Q.  You did?  I've never seen anybody do that.
VIJAY SINGH:  It was a fluke (laughter).  No, you look at it, it was far back enough that I could hit it over the trees, so it was no big deal.
Q.  The course, I guess the rough is tough where the water is getting to it.  How do you think it's going to play?
VIJAY SINGH:  There's still a lot of rough out there, around the greens, off the fairways.  There's enough rough to concern the players.

But the golf course is playing good, the greens are going to be firm unless this rain comes in, but it's playing hard and fast.  They're putting enough water on the golf course where it's playing normal.  It's not playing unusually fast.  If you cut the water out, then it would be different.
Q.  How much does the No. 1 ranking in the world mean to you and does it make this tournament a little more interesting with Tiger in the field?
VIJAY SINGH:  I guess, for the media, for the public, it makes a big difference that both Tiger and myself are here.  To me, I'm here to win the golf tournament, and if I can win the golf tournament, I don't care what I'm ranked after this week.
