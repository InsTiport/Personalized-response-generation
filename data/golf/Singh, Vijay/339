VIJAY SINGH:   I played okay.  I drove the ball nicely, at times.  I just played a regular round of golf.  Could have been a few less, could have been one or two more. 


Q.  Could have been a little better, little worse?

VIJAY SINGH:   Could have been two shots better.  I 3-putted twice.  Got unlucky a few times.  On 13, I thought it was pretty unlucky. 

It was okay.  It was a good round.  I feel I can do better, though. 


Q.  The key is getting it in the fairway?

VIJAY SINGH:   You know, you get it in the fairway, but you've got to take some risks.  I think it's bad to hit a lot of drivers out there, to hit it way out there, where if you don't hit the fairway, you can't get it on the green. 


Q.  A different strategy than other guys who are so worried about hitting the fairway that they are backing off driver?

VIJAY SINGH:   Well, I know.  If you miss it with an iron or 3-wood, then you're really screwed.  I hit a lot of drivers today and I will probably do the same tomorrow. 


Q.  Does the golf course set up well for you? 

VIJAY SINGH:   I think it's perfect.  I think the greens are a little slow.  A lot of balls are short. 


Q.  4-under is leading; is that about right, do you think? 

VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, I think so.  I think the greens will be a lot better in the morning.  But, you know, it might be my chance tomorrow morning. 

I think 4-under is a good score  I wouldn't have thought anyone else would have gone lower.  I was surprised to see Mickelson  -- that's a good score.  That's good shooting.
