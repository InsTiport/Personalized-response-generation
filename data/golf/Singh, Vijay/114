  Q.  That was actually a great match.  That was a nice putt you made on 18 to almost seal it right there at 18.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  I tried to, but it broke a lot more than I wanted it to.  I couldn't see that much break.  At the same time, you don't want to hit it way by because it's a really fast putt.  I thought I had my line right and it just didn't go in.   
  
  Q.  Any turning points in the match?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  I think he made a good putt on 18.  When he hit it left on 19, I was pretty comfortable with that and I was happy to put it on the green and I had two putts to win.  I wasn't happy leaving myself a four-footer coming back, though, but I made it.   
  
  Q.  So pretty much back and forth all day?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  It wasn't.  It was just square most of the way, and I got 1-up and then he squared the match, and that was it.  I think we only changed hands, the lead, two, three times.  That was it.   
  
  Q.  Anything else you want to say about your match?  Who do you play tomorrow?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Niclas.
