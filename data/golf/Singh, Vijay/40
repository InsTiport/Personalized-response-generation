 Q. Vijay, you're going to be close to the Top 30 in the FedExCup heading in The Playoffs. You're going to some courses where you won before. Maybe some comments about the upcoming four weeks. Kind of playing well right now. Good time to peak, right?
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah. I mean I'm not hurting anymore which is very good. Once the pain is gone I can play pain-free, I think I can play the way I want to play. I'm not trying to guide my swing. It's a good time to feel that way and good time to be playing well and I'm looking forward to the next four events.

 Q. Obviously helps your practice regimen as well. If you're not feeling well you can't practice, hit as many balls.
 VIJAY SINGH: It's not really the practice has not stopped me. It's just that you want to swing the club much more freer than holding back and that's what I was doing for a long period of time, just trying to maneuver my golf swing according to the pains that I had in my body. 
 Now I'm free and my body is working the way it needs to work and I'm able to swing, make swings the way I used to.

 Q. Do you think they changed The Playoff format a little bit with two-on, then a break, then two weeks, is that good, bad or what do you think about that?
 VIJAY SINGH: I think it's pretty good. I think it gives us a little break to rest and come back strong, you know. I think some guys be playing five, six weeks, you know, including the PGA. I think it's a good thing what they're doing.
