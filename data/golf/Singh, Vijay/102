 Q.  Just one stroke short there? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I made two bad mistakes.  I had the simplest chip on 13, and also on 14 I think I under-clubbed it.  I had the right club, I just didn't hit it hard enough. 
 And then I came back strong.  I thought I hit a good shot on 15 that kind of went long that kicked off the bank.  No, I tried.  It's a good warm-up or you can say -- a confidence-builder towards the big events to come.  Masters is two weeks off and I have to work on a few things. 
 I'm pretty happy with my results, considering I shot 73 on the first day.  Geoff played well.  I have to give him credit.  He hit a lot of great shots and putted nicely.  Somebody had to win, somebody had to lose. 

 Q.  You were standing there with a chance to make that on 18.  Was there a little bit of you that says, it's okay if I miss this, I've been around here a while? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  No, I wanted to make it.  I hit a good pitch shot that kind of bit on me.  I thought it was -- with a little rain I thought it was going to almost skip a little bit, but it didn't, it just kind of checked.
