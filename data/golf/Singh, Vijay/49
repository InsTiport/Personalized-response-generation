  Q. Maybe your driver wasn't your best today. Was your putter working? How did you feel about your round?  
 VIJAY SINGH: My driver was okay, it's just that you've got to hit the fairways. I played well, drove the ball pretty good. You're not going to hit every fairway out here. Some of the lines that you play, if you don't hit it within five yards of where you're aiming, you're going to be in the rough.   
 You know, but the greens are getting really firm and the pin placements are tough, and you've got to play well to get a good score.  
  
  Q. Are you happy with your round, happy with where you are when it comes to going into tomorrow's final round?   
 VIJAY SINGH: I mean, the leader is 8-under and I'm 2-under, so I can't be that happy. I would have liked to be about 5 or 6. But I'll have to go out there tomorrow and play a decent round.  
  
  Q. Have you seen the scores get progressively better on certain holes day-to-day, or it's been playing pretty much even throughout Thursday, Friday, Saturday?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Well, Friday was different. If you played the afternoon-morning route, you've going to have a tougher time with the wind. The guys that played the morning and afternoon got a good break.   
 But today, I think the guys going out there now are going to have a hard time. It's firming up and the wind is swirling now, so hopefully they come back a little bit.  
  
  Q. Is there one hole you don't want to see again or tomorrow you definitely want to score better on?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Well, 8 is playing really tough. I made 2 there, but it's a tough hole, tough pin placement, you just have to hit a solid shot there.
