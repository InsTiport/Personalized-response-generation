Q.  As tough as this course played is it fair to say it played tougher today?
VIJAY SINGH:  It played a lot tougher, the wind was blowing from a different direction, swirling winds as well.  Hard to judge where it was coming from, made it a lot difficult.  It got dry a little bit more, the greens were really firm, pin placements were hard.

This is the score I thought it was going to be winning the golf tournament, and my prediction came true.
Q.  Is this one of the more challenging tournaments this year?
VIJAY SINGH:  You know, the first two or three days wasn't that bad.  It's more like a U.S. Open course where it gets dry on the weekend.  Today it got really firm.  It got really firm.  I think they were expecting rain but it never happened.  It was a good test.  Still one of the best golf courses we played on TOUR and hopefully we'll come back here.
Q.  Long hitters always have an advantage, and if you were designing a golf course, aside from adding length, what would you do?
VIJAY SINGH:  I think position the bunkers where, you know, it's like the old courses where it creeps into the fairways and not 20 yards off the fairways where you hit it.  But that's what I would do, position the bunkers where you have to hit really good drives to get it on the fairways or you're going to have a problem.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
VIJAY SINGH:  I hit a good drive.  I thought it was perfect.  That's the line I took, and got stuck in one of these fir trees.  That's the way the day went, though.
