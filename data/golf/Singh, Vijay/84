   VIJAY SINGH: It's a tough golf course. You'd better place your drive very well, otherwise it's hard to get close to the hole. The greens were slow, so you had to make sure you hit your putts hard enough. I played okay, even par, three days to go, so a long way before this tournament is over.   
  
  Q. You guys are so precise out here, how much does it mess with you when you practice on a golf course and then you play on a golf course that's totally different?  
 VIJAY SINGH: Well, we knew it was going to be soft, so there was no surprise there. You know, the fairways are so perfect and they moved the tees up, so you've got to watch how we place our ball. The ball rolls off the club face a lot, and most of our shots were coming up short. That's one thing you have to take into account. The zoysia grass is different than what we played last week.   
 The golf course is playing well. It's going to dry out, and it's not going to be easy from here on. I think they're going to toughen the pin placements. The tees were all forward today, so they're going to move back now, so it's going to play extremely difficult tomorrow.
