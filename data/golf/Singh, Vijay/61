  Q. A real touch of class there.   
 VIJAY SINGH: Well, we already lost on the 13th hole. So kind of almost demoralizing. But Lucas played well. He would have made it anyway.   
  
  Q. Even though your team lost, you had a great week personally. Will you feel good leaving here this week?   
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I think we molded very well. Greg was incredible. Frank was unbelievable. You know, we had a great time. Although we lost, I think the whole team molded together very well and going ahead, this is going to be a steppingstone for us.   
  
  Q. What's ahead for you, will you take some time off or play a lot of golf?   
 VIJAY SINGH: No, I've got five weeks off. I'm going to rest my knee and rethink what I need to do.   
 I think the golf swing is coming along really well and I'm looking forward to a great season next year.
