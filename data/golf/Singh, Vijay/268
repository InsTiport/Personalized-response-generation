Q.
67, and you don't end up winning.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I thought 22 when I started off.  I thought 22 was going to win the golf tournament.  I told Jeff at the turn, I need to make 6 and he needs to make 7.  He birdied 10 and 11 and I birdied 10 and 12.  I was in line to shoot what I wanted to shoot, but that bogey on 16 kind of took the air out of me.
Q.  In retrospectÃ  -- (inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  If I hit a driver everything would have been okay, but you've got to play aggressive, and I did.

The bunker shot wasn't too bad.  It was just a nice sand wedge.
Q.  Were you aware of where Ryan was?
VIJAY SINGH:  I saw when he finished 22, and that was the mark, and that is still going to be the mark.
Q.  You're still one step closer to $10 million, Vijay.
VIJAY SINGH:  I'm looking forward to next week now.  I think I'm in that mood again, and I feel like playing again.

I'm going to go home tomorrow or tonight and prepare for next week.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  The guys are good.  The slogan does not lie.  Any day anyone can win a golf tournament.  Anybody who is on the Tour has the capability of playing well and winning golf tournaments, and Ryan just showed it today.  That's an incredible round of golf.
