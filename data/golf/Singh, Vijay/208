VIJAY SINGH:  I hit some good drives, I hit some good shots to approach the hole and I made some good putts.  I did the same yesterday.  I don't think I hit it as close as I did today.  No wind, you know, early conditions, the greens were perfect.  I hit a lot of them close.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I'm a little disappointed because I had an eagle chance on 15 from 20 feet and I three putted that one and then three putted 16, as well.  I would have loved to be at 8 instead of 6.  But it's good conditions now.  I think the leaders are probably going to finish around 11 or 12.  That gives me some more work to do today.
Q.  How crazy is momentum in this game?  When you reach the par 5 15th in two and then you three jack and    (inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it kind of takes a lot of air out of you because you really play hard to get into position and then you let it go.  Just the same thing happened last week.  You just get into position and make two bogeys and then all of a sudden instead of two or three back, you're six or seven back.

Don't put yourself in a position like that.  I should have played better the first two days.
Q.  (Inaudible).
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't really think about it.  You just go and play a hole at a time.  You can make a birdie, take it, and go to the next hole.  It was a good run.

All right, thanks.
