VIJAY SINGH:  I three-putted, what, three times, but I played well.  Conditions were pretty difficult because of the wind swirling around.
Q.  Tiger, you, Sergio and Phil, four straight groups.  The crowds are enormous out here on a Thursday.  Did you notice at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  In the beginning it was.  It was like playing the last day of a tournament.  But it's nice.  They were all into it.

The golf course was not yielding too many birdies except for Sergio, I think, but it was fun.  I enjoy that kind of play out there.
Q.  Tiger was saying that the swirls were really bothering him today.  How about you?
VIJAY SINGH:  You couldn't really figure out which way it was coming because of the trees being so tall.  If you got it above the trees the ball could go anywhere.  You kind of have a general idea which way it was blowing, but when you're over the shot it kind of died down and picked up.  It was really hit-and-miss when you did hit the ball.
Q.  After a couple three-putts like that, do you spend more time now working on your putting or do you have a regular routine?
VIJAY SINGH:  It's a regular routine really, just get the pace right and make sure you don't leave yourself too many long putts, and that's what I've got to do tomorrow.
