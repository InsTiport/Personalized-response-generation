 Q. Looking back through your time in Europe, I remember you talked very fondly of Seve, about how you spent a lot of time with him, short game, bunkers, all the imagination and creative things he brought to the game. Talk about your personal relationship with Seve when you got to know him. 
 VIJAY SINGH: He was a great man, not only on the golf course but off the golf course. Very, very sad to hear about his passing. I think not only people that knew him through golf, but everybody that knew him through what he did for golf, I think it's a great loss, and he'll be missed.

 Q. As a global player yourself, can you relate to our audience today how big he is around the globe, how people think so highly of him? 
 VIJAY SINGH: I mean, you don't really know what he did for golf, in Europe especially. He's gone, but his memory is going to stay forever. There's so many great memories from everybody. I was watching Nick Faldo today, and the memory that he had, when Seve and he hugged in I think it was '93 and '95, and it was unbelievable. There were tears in everybody's eyes. That's the kind of person he was. He had a lot of emotion.
