  Q.  Vijay, a long day, but you really got yourself into contention here.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, you know, still a lot of golf to go.  Just hung in there.  I mean, it's pretty tough going off feeling good about hitting a tee shot on 3 and then coming back, and the wind changed direction, so you have to gather yourself and just play the hole the way it's playing at the moment and on the tee.  So that was my focus.   
  
  Q.  I know it's been a long day and a lot of golf, but a couple key shots, maybe a couple key swings, good or bad?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, making birdie on 5 was good, got me under par today, and I birdied 8 and 9, which is a good way to finish, and I'm in good position to hit a good one here on 10.   
 I'm looking forward to coming tomorrow with good light and ready to go.
