 Q.  What was the difference between yesterday's round and today's round play-wise?  
VIJAY SINGH: I didn't hit that many fairways.  It was a lot more windier today.  I got some bad breaks, didn't putt as well.  But all in all, I managed.  I didn't play as bad as what the score reads.  I went 1 over.  So going into the weekend, I'll continue.   
 Q.  Is this course playing as hard as most everyone is saying?  
VIJAY SINGH: Well, if you miss shots the wrong places, then it's really hard.  If you miss fairways, it's really hard.  With the wind conditions and all that, if you miss a shot, you're going to be punished.   
It's a golf course where the conditions can hurt you if you're in the wrong spot.   
 Q.  Having played in a lot of U.S. Opens, do you feel like this is a course that you can make a lot of ground up in a hurry, or do you have to peck away at it?  
VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I can make a lot of ground if I play well.  I didn't particularly score very well today.  I had my chances.  Yesterday was a good round.  Today was -- you know, I could have been very easily even par today, but I turned around the other way.   
Come the weekend, if the weather stays, if it doesn't get too rainy, I think I can get in front.
