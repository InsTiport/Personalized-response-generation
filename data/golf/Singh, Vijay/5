 Q.  No dropped shots today.  Were you happy with that round?  
VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, could have been a lot less but the wind was really tricky.  You know, we never practiced this wind all week.  It was totally the opposite direction.  So it was kind of -- it was okay going out.   
There was a lot of birdie opportunities, so the scores were really low going out but coming back in, you had to plan yourself, where you're going to hit your shots.  I managed it pretty good.  I drove the ball well.  Unfortunately did not birdie the last hole but 4-under is a good score.  If you'd given it to me before I started today, I would have taken it.   
 Q.  To play the back nine without dropping shots into the wind, that's quite impressive?  
VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I drove it well.  If you drive the ball well, then, you know, the green opens up for you.  I was able to just carry all those cross-bunkers, which was a big plus.  But really happy.   
 Q.  How nice is it for you to be back here playing on a links course?  
VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, it's been a while.  Really excited when I came over here and looking forward to the next three days and see if we can pull this one off.
