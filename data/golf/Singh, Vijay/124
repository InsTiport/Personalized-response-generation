   VIJAY SINGH:  The way it was going, I didn't have a putt until 7.  You know, I was comfortable with what I was doing today.  I was very much relaxed with Stuart.  I like playing with Stuart and he keeps the jokes going and we just kind of mold together and played well.  I think when I was out of the hole, he was in there.  You know, we ham-and-egged very well and that's how you play.
