VIJAY SINGH:  What do you want to know?
Q.  How much of a struggle was it out there to get back into the game?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't think it was a struggle, just getting back the momentum.  It wasn't very easy out there.  The winds are gusty and the pin placements are a little harder than yesterday.  I played well, I just kept very patient, tried not to make too many mistakes, especially when you're trying to get back under par.

You know, I'm glad I finished even because that was my goal from the beginning, to get back to some sort of a decent number.
Q.  Do you approach it differently as things are going along?
VIJAY SINGH:  You try to become a little bit more aggressive when nothing is happening, and that's when you can make mistakes.  I was very patient out there and I knew there was a lot of holes, so I just went out and played my game and waited for my chances.
Q.  With the wind gusting and stuff, do you think it'll be harder for the leaders?
VIJAY SINGH:  There's three or four guys at 7 under.  I think at the end of the day if they get to 9 or 10, they'll be doing good.  I would say 8 or 9 will be leading at the end of the day.
Q.  Did you get frustrated on the greens at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  I'm hitting a lot of good putts.  It's hard to read these greens.  They're very spongy, and poa greens are always hard to make putts on, especially for me.
Q.  What's the speed like?
VIJAY SINGH:  They were a little faster than yesterday.  They rolled a little bit better today than they did yesterday.
Q.  Are you tired at all?
VIJAY SINGH:  I'm getting that way.  I was very tired after yesterday's round.  No, I'm okay.  I think after the weekend, one week off will be good for me.
