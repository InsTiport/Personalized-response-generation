Q.
Vijay, a lot of guys breathing a sigh of relief when they come off.  Are you feeling the same way after today?
VIJAY SINGH:  I wasn't worried out there, I just didn't hit my driver like I did the first two days.  You know, you've got to drive the ball in the fairway, and the par 5s are reachable and just waiting for you to make birdies and eagles.  I didn't take any advantage of that.

Tomorrow is another day.  Hopefully the wind stays the same as today.  You know, the way Sergio is playing, I've got to go out and catch him because he's not going to back off.
Q.  Was it tough to get something going today because of the driver?
VIJAY SINGH:  Kind of.  The greens were firm and you need to hit the fairways to get to the pins.  If you miss the fairways then it's difficult to get to the pins because they were all tucked away.  It was tough out there.  It was a tough golf course.  17 was just -- when you're standing on the tee box you don't know what to do because if you hit it on the green it's going to go over.  That was a relief, me making par there and getting out of that hole.
Q.  What was it like playing with Sergio today?
VIJAY SINGH:  He's a fun guy.  I've played with him many times.  He's a great kid, and most likely he's going to win this golf tournament the way he's playing.
Q.  Are you seeing anything different that he's doing?  Obviously he's making a lot of putts.
VIJAY SINGH:  He drove the ball well.  No, he played beautifully.  He drove the ball well, he hit two loose shots but got away with it -- well, he got punished, one was a double, one was a bogey.  Anyone who makes eight birdies out there today, that's great playing.  He's playing well, so he's the man to catch.
