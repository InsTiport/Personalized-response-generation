 Q.  Vijay, you had a great round going today. 
 VIJAY SINGH:  I played very well.  It's probably the worst I could have shot.  I could have made four other birdies on the front side that I missed, but it was kind of getting a little frustrating there.  Made that birdie on 9, and I told my caddie, hmm, I finally two-putted one.  Then played the back nine really well. 

 Q.  Hit a great lag putt there on 18, also.  That's got to make you feel good going into tomorrow.  No one is really making a move. 
 VIJAY SINGH:  Well, Jimmy shot a good number today, and I think Daniel has gone to 11, but whatever.  I'm going to see if I can go out there tomorrow and play like I did today and make more putts. 

 Q.  So far so good, everything you put into play in the off-season is starting to pay off, huh? 
 VIJAY SINGH:  That's it.  Yeah, I'm feeling good.  The golf swing is feeling really, really good, so that's a plus.
