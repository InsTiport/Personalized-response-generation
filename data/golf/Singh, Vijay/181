Q.  Here with the defending champion, he calls me over, he says, "You're next Mr. Slim," and then he asked me how I'm doing and I said I'm hanging in there and he looks down at my waist and says, "You're really hanging it in there."  Heck of a front nine, I've got to tell you that.
VIJAY SINGH:  Fortunately I didn't back it up on the back nine, but it was disappointing.  I had a lot of chances on the front, as well.  30 was the worst I could have done.  On the back nine, I had my chances and made two bogeys as well.  You've got to make putts out here and I find it very difficult to read these greens.
Q.  When you had 30, were there any thoughts of a 59?
VIJAY SINGH:  No.  (Laughing).
Q.  Too tough a back nine?
VIJAY SINGH:  Not really.  I was just playing hole by hole, trying to make birdies.  If you think about a 59 when you get to the last hole and you are already 10, 12 under, but I wasn't there.
Q.  Seemed like you were on cruise control until you got to 14 and you had that hiccup, did you just halt the momentum there?

SHANE BERTSCH:  I had a good chance on 12, as well for birdie.  I hit it inside of I think five, six feet and missed that one then kind of got disappointed and tried to hit a big drive on 13 and pushed it right and didn't get up and down from the bunker then bogeyed 14.  I just couldn't get it going on the back nine.  Finished with a birdie here; could have been an eagle.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.
Q.  Last Sunday, you made a big run in the final day and you said you were going to do that on Saturday night.  Anything in store for you this Sunday?
VIJAY SINGH:  Different golf course.  It's hard to shoot too many under par here, I've got to shoot a career best round, and I think if I can get my putter heated up, I think I'll be all right.
