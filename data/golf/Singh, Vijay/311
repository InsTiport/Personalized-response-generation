Q.
A general comment about your play today and conditions out there.

VIJAY SINGH:  I played all right.  It was very tough.  It was very crusty.  You couldn't really hit the putts the way you wanted to because it was just so firm.

But I'm still in there and I have a shot for tomorrow.  I have to go out and play a little better than today.
