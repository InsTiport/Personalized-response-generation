Q.   Nicely done.   You're going along through eight holes and then at 9 you hole one out and things get going. 
VIJAY SINGH:   Yeah, I saw the scoreboard, everybody was shooting lights out.   It was nice to see that chip go in.   It wasn't a long chip, but it was one that one can make.   And then I birdied three more after that and then just started making some putts, which was good to see.

Q.   22 putts on the round.   That's got to be encouraging. 
VIJAY SINGH:   It's about my lowest one ever.   It's nice to see the putts go in.   I've practiced pretty hard with my putter for a while now, and to see the putts go in, it's nice.

Q.   Talk about 18. 
VIJAY SINGH:   I hit the wrong club off the tee, just 3‑wood and tried to take a lot off it and came out of it.   But finished with a par, which was nice.   It would have been kind of bad to see a bogey there, on a hole playing so easy, straight downwind.   The hole location was a makeable birdie there, so it was nice to see it go in.

Q.   Did you think 3‑wood a lot more often today because of it being lift, clean and place in the fairway? 
VIJAY SINGH:   No, the fairways are quite generous, and if you hit it off line a little bit, it's so soft, it doesn't run out.   But the last one, because there's water on the right side and it can run out on the left side, the play was a 3‑wood.   But no, the golf course is playing easy‑‑ not playing easy, but playing easier than what I thought it would be.   The greens are holding, greens are rolling really well, so you can make a lot of putts.
