  Q.  What was the difference between today and yesterday?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Didn't get close to the holes.  I didn't drive the ball very well.  Yesterday I drove it beautifully.  Didn't make any putts.  That's the thing, you've got to make your putts to score and I didn't do that.   
  
  Q.  Last two days I followed you, you're swinging at it great.  Do you sense that, that the swing is back?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Well, it's been there, just getting it together.  Getting the timing right, and feeling the momentum, and I did not have any today.  It was just a lot of pars and just I missed the green with a bogey.   
 I like my position, two days to go and anything can happen.   
  
  Q.  Even still, only four back, heading into Saturday, that's pretty good position to be in?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I think so.  With this golf course, even five, six, seven back is not an issue going into the weekend.   
 So a lot of pressure on the leaders, I'm just going to go out and play my game and see if I can catch them.
