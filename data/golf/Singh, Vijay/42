 Q. Very nice round on a tough golf course. 
 VIJAY SINGH: Yeah, I played well, hit a lot of good shots. I think I hit three greens, but two of them were wedges. A little disappointed with a 2-under round but happy. At the beginning of the day I would have taken it.

 Q. As the wind picked up in the afternoon did that play a factor in the club selections and make it tough?
 VIJAY SINGH: Some of the holes the wind was much stronger than others. When you stand on 18 it's howling out there, but then you come down low and it's normal. It depends where you are, and what wind you got was very important.
