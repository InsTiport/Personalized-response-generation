Q.  Vijay, defending champion Vijay Singh, 5 under through 36.  Are you pleased?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, especially the way I hit the ball off the tee yesterday.  I got my driver going today and that made    the golf course is a driving golf course, so you drive the ball and you can give yourself chances at birdies like I did today.
Q.  We've heard other stories that it's a course management course.  It's also a course where you've got to pick your spots and not attack every hole location, but you believe it's a driver's course?
VIJAY SINGH:  If you keep the ball in the fairway, you're going to have a lot of chances to make birdies.  No matter which way you do it, you've got to put the ball in the fairway.
Q.  One more thing, we've just got news that Hootie Johnson has decided to step down and Billy Payne is going to take over.  Any thoughts?
VIJAY SINGH:  No, I'm just surprised.  I think Hootie did a good job and hopefully Billy Payne follows suit.  I think it's a very difficult organization to run; a lot of people put their eyes on what you do.  I think he did a great job.
Q.  Great playing through 36.  Good luck the rest of the way.
VIJAY SINGH:  Thanks.
