Q.  You had a good start.
VIJAY SINGH:   It was good.  I should have birdied a few because it wasn't playing so difficult.  You know, I left some out there, and then I 3-putted 10 and missed two really good opportunities on 11 and 12.

I'm two back, and what have we got, 24, 23 holes to go.  So there's a lot of golf to play.  Hopefully I can finish off strong and tomorrow and see what happens in the afternoon.
Q.  You played 36 yesterday.  Was it an advantage today being able to just come out and just start today's round?
VIJAY SINGH:  I don't know.  I wasn't tired or anything.  You know, this morning, it's kind of almost a disadvantage because you have to wait all day to go out and play in the afternoon.

So, you know, luckily enough I came out early and I hit balls.  I had actually two practice sessions to go out, so I'm pretty happy with the way I'm standing right now.
Q.  Conditions on the course?
VIJAY SINGH:  Perfect.  The greens are good, getting faster and it's getting firmer out there.
Q.  To win the Bay Hill Invitational, you kind of got your start here, and you had a sponsor exemption.  I know this is a pretty special place for you.
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it will be.  I finished second here once, twice.  It would be a great way to lead into TPC and the Masters.  But this has been a good golf tournament for me.  They gave me an invite early in my career and I think I owe them one.
Q.  And you're striking the ball well.
VIJAY SINGH:  Hitting it pretty good, yes, right now.
