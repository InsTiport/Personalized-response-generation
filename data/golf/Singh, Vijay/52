  Q. Vijay, bogey-free 66 always feels good. Tell me about your day out there.   
 VIJAY SINGH: It was long. (Indiscernible)   
  
  Q. What time was the wakeup call this morning?   
 VIJAY SINGH: About 4:30.   
  
  Q. You should have been asleep on 17.   
 VIJAY SINGH: I know, I was.   
  
  Q. Tell me about the course, man.   
 VIJAY SINGH: It's wet, but I felt pretty good. I got away with some nice saves on the back nine. It was just my front. And just played solid from there in. Had my chances, made some nice putts.   
 Putter starts going in, it was leading to a low number. Strength feeling more and more better. Looking forward to tomorrow, and that's good.   
  
  Q. Tell us about these greens. They get a little bit slower, but they stayed pure. You know what I mean "pure"?   
 VIJAY SINGH: They're the best greens I've putted on all year. Still kept their speed. Although they got a little bumpy at the end, but they're really in good shape.   
 It's a shame about the rain. Otherwise, we would have had an unbelievable round of golf.   
  
  Q. I know you don't eat as much as me, but with all the delays, three meals, four meals? How many did you get in there, man?   
 VIJAY SINGH: I don't eat that much. I need to keep my figure, you know.   
 (Laughter)  
  
  Q. Great 66.
