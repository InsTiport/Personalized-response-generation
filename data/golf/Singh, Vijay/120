  Q.  Just thought on a good finish.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Played pretty decent.  Played well the front nine.  Second hole I hit a good drive, good second shot, just didn't get up-and-down.  Stupid bogey on 3.  9, I think 90 per cent of the field would have got up-and-down but I didn't.   
 Had a lot of chances.  Happy to finish 7-under.  It wasn't easy.  It was pretty breezy out there.   
  
  Q.  In some ways the way you played on the front nine you got the rewards on the back nine?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, I played well.  I hit one or two loose shots and when I did a loose shot, I got away with pars.  But the easier shots, I didn't get up-and-down with.   
 You know, 7-under, it's still the weekend to go.   
  
  Q.  You're still very much in it.  It's difficult to say where you'll be at the end much the day but you won't be far away?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  I think the leader is still going to be 11.  I don't think anyone is going to go beyond that.  It's not playing easy at all.  The wind is swirling around and it's getting kind of cool again.   
  
  Q.  Seems quite gusty.   
 VIJAY SINGH:  It's consistently blowing from one side.  Just the club selection, it's easy on the back nine because we've got a lot of downhill holes, and certainly quite a few short holes.  But if you make a mistake, you know, you pay the penalty.   
  
  Q.  Can you give us the details of your birdies?   
 VIJAY SINGH:  13, I hit driver, L-wedge to about six feet.   
 14, I hit driver and 3-iron on the green about 20 feet, 2-putted.   
 16, I hit a 5-wood, sand wedge about four feet.   
 18, I hit driver, laid up with a 7-iron and hit a sand wedge about three feet.
