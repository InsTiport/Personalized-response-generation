VIJAY SINGH:  The high was really last week, and now I've got to get over it and start a new week.

You know, the rain delay kind of messed up everything.  I was ready to go.  It's not an excuse, but it does kind of affect you a little bit.  The longer you wait, the more it's going to hold you up.  I for one would get more tired than probably the rest.

But I feel great.  I think I didn't play too bad of a round, but we'll see tomorrow.
Q.   How bad was the rain delay?  How did it affect you?
VIJAY SINGH:  I was the first one to go out, so you always kind of are waiting to go out, and once they call it you're the first one to go out there, so you don't really know if you're going to go or not go.

It was pretty wet out there and I didn't have the best of starts, either, so I couldn't get a momentum going.

I was fine.  My game is good, you know, everything is good.  I need a run today.
Q.   Did the course change with the rain?
VIJAY SINGH:  Yeah, it's a lot softer obviously.  You can fly the balls right to the pins now and there's some low numbers out there.  There's a lot of birdie opportunities.  The greens are rolling pretty nice, pretty fast, so we'll see.  If the weather stays the way it is, we'll shoot low numbers over here.  I'm playing well, though.
Q.   As painful as it might be to recount, can you go over No.  8 and No.  9?
VIJAY SINGH:  On 8 I hit it in the right bunker and missed a putt for par.

9, I hit it left off the tee, tried to hack it out and left it short, then left it short again, chipped it up and hit the putt.
