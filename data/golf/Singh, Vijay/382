VIJAY SINGH:   I was playing well.  You know, I had a difficult first two days.  I think I got the best out of the draw.  I hit the ball decent enough the first two days.  Today I hit it better and I putted nicely.  Left one or two out there on the front side.  Could have been a lot better, but I'll take it right now.  
 

Q.  Is this feeling a little more like when you were playing overseas earlier in the year? 
 
VIJAY SINGH:   I only left for two weeks.  I'm playing pretty decent.  I'm feeling that I'm scoring a lot better now than I did in the earlier part of the year and putting nicely.  Reading the ball really good.  Rolling it, getting my line and rolling it and it's going in, which is good to see before two big tournaments coming up. 
 

Q.  Are these greens as good as you've had it this year? 
 
VIJAY SINGH:   No, I don't think so.  In Bay Hill, normally the greens are a lot, lot better.  They are not as good as they used to be, or in the past, anyway.  A lot of Bermuda on them this year.  They tried to cut it down, I think.  There's a lot of Bermuda showing.  You can get some hot patches on the green, but they are rolling good. They are rolling good enough.  You know, we've got to play with what we've got. 
 

Q.  What did you do on your time off?
 
VIJAY SINGH:   Took some time off.  Went out on the TPC course and played a few rounds there.  Getting ready for this one and next week
