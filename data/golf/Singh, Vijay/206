Q.  What's a mallard putter?
VIJAY SINGH:  It looks different.

I don't know, it's nothing to do with mallard, I just wanted a change and started on Tuesday and it felt good and it's rolling good.  Hopefully it will keep on doing what it's doing.
Q.  Will you keep it?
VIJAY SINGH:  That depends what it does today.  I mean, why not?
Q.  Talk about your round.
VIJAY SINGH:  Well, the key was making good putts.  I made a good one    I made some really good putts out there, and just keep the ball in play and you have a lot of chances for birdie, this is a golf course where you need to hit the fairways.  Once you hit the fairways, you have short irons at most of the flags and as soft as they are right now, it's as soft as it be; you can fire at the flags and know it's going to stop.
Q.  Do you have a different frame of mind    inaudible?
VIJAY SINGH:  No, I like this golf course.  You kind of remember a lot of good things.  I remember a lot of good things that happened to me here.  I seem to know the golf course a lot here, I'm very familiar with it.  When you do miss, it you know where to miss it.  And you know some of the breaks, as well, on the greens from how they broke previous years.
Q.  Inaudible?
VIJAY SINGH:  You could say that.  Then again, I made some good ones.  I had a chance probably to shoot 10 under today.  I had chances on 16 and 17 and missed a short one.  Maybe tomorrow.  We'll see what happens.

The greens are going to be a little bit more smoother, maybe a little fast, as well.  So come out here tomorrow and try to hit a lot of fairways and attack the flags.  That's the key is to make the putts.
