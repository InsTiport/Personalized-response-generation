Q.   Tell me a little bit about your great round of 67 today. 
TIM THELEN:   I just plodded around the golf course, made four birdies and made no bogeys.   And on this golf course that's a pretty good feat for me, for anybody.

Q.   Have you been around this area before or is this your first time here and first time playing?
TIM THELEN:   This is my first time here.   We got here actually on Saturday and played a practice round Sunday, Monday, took Tuesday off, played Wednesday, and then the four days in the tournament.   And it's a lot more than really I expected. 

Q.   Any plans on being back in 2014?
TIM THELEN:   Yeah, if, you know, if I get an invite or if I play well enough over in Europe to where I can come over here and play in 2014, obviously I will have fond memories of the golf course, so hopefully I get back here.
