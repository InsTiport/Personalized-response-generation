   MANUEL DE LOS SANTOS: It was so enjoyable out there and I have fallen in love with Kingsbarns. It is such a beautiful place. The people here are great and my partners where great today. For me it is very nice to experience such warmth from the people here. Richard was great today - we had good communication. 
 I didn't putt very well today but Richard helped me a lot on the course, it was great to play with him. I started to play in 2004, after the accident. It took me two years to get to a three handicap - I was playing off two at one point but it has gone up again! But I took to the game very quickly and it is my ambition to become a scratch player and why not? Everything is possible, believe me."
