 Q.   Talk about the course in general, your round, how it compared to practice rounds previously.   
RUSS COCHRAN:   Well, you know, we all knew it was going to be tough and it was.   The wind blew pretty doggone hard out there.   
And it was, a lot of it was on the greens.   I seemed to play the course pretty good from tee to green and I had three 3‑putts, so I was 3‑over par.   
So all in all it was a decent day, other than me needing to make some more putts coming down the stretch.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised by anything at all?  
RUSS COCHRAN:   I thought a few of the pins were pretty tough, with the wind directions and stuff.   And I was surprised that a couple of the holes played so, a couple of the par‑5s played so short downwind.   But then you know that the other side of that is that you got some unbelievable tough holes into the wind.   
So all in all it was about what I expected, a little disappointed on the greens, but I got to work on that for tomorrow.
