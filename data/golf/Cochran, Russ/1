 Q.   How did you play today?   Coming into the weekend at 3‑under.   
RUSS COCHRAN:   I felt like I scored pretty well today.   I hit a lot of great 2‑putts.   I didn't hit the ball very close to the hole.   
But just too many bogeys.   Too many mistakes.   I am making some ‑‑ hitting some good shots and making some birdies, which is great.   But too many bogeys.   I think if I could clean up some of the mistakes I would feel a lot better about things.  
   
 Q.   Where do you feel like your game is at right now to be able to contend on the weekend?  
RUSS COCHRAN:   I really don't know.   I mean, it sounds crazy, but I know I'm getting better, I wasn't playing well, all year pretty much, and I'm getting better and better, so I feel good about that, but at the same time like I said, I'm a little bit, you know, untidy around the greens and getting the ball in the hole.   
But it's a good situation to be in, because you really don't risk much, don't lose much and you can kind of get after it and try and make something good happen.
