Q.   You just finished your first PGA TOUR event.   You made the cut, you finished under par.   How do you feel right now?
JORGE GARCIA:   It was a really great week for me.   I made some very good shots, and now I know also what I have to work on for my text tournaments.   So I'm very happy with my performance. 
From the first two days, on that second day I really had to fight to make the cut, and I was able to do it.   I went 4â€‘under over my last seven holes.   So I'm very happy with my game this weekend. 

Q.   On Thursday when you stepped up to the tee to take your first shot ever at a PGA TOUR event, what was going through your mind?
JORGE GARCIA:   You know, not a lot.   I was feeling pretty calm.   I knew that no matter what happened, this was just my first PGA tournament.   But I had a lot of confidence. 
And yeah, it was really an incredible feeling. 

Q.   Did you come into the tournament with any specific goals or expectations or just to play as well as possible?
JORGE GARCIA:   Well, you know, you always have some goals to have something to look back on after the tournament.   One of those goals was to make the cut, and I was able to do that, so I really played a little more calmly over the weekend. 
Things didn't go so well for me as they did in the first two days, but I'm still very happy that I was able to make the cut.

Q.   What's next for you now?
JORGE GARCIA:   I'm going to be playing in some AJGA tournaments, and also in a few events representing my country, Venezuela.
