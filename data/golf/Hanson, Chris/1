 Q.  Chris, good start on the front nine.  How was that for you?  
CHRIS HANSON: It was good.  Played tee-to-green the best I've played all year on the front nine.  I've been working hard on that side of my game, so just being patient and hit a lot of good shots and managed to hole the putts.   
 Q.  Were the putts the key for you today?  
CHRIS HANSON: No, I just got myself in very good positions off the tee.  I was obviously in play, but then hit myself into the correct areas on the greens.  Gave myself eight chances there.   
 Q.  Quite hard to play on the back nine, to recreate that.  So how was it on the back nine?  
CHRIS HANSON: Yeah, one of those things, you've got off to a good start, but you'd probably taken 3-under, 3-under, so doesn't really matter.  You go out there, the back nine, got a good game plan out there how I'm trying to approach the course.  Stuck to that, stayed patient and made a few more birdies.   
 Q.  How was the ball running on the greens?  
CHRIS HANSON: The course is good, yeah.  It's challenging.  With the undulations you've got, you've got to manage your game really well.   
The greens rolled well today, as well.  Obviously had some rain overnight and obviously softened up a little bit, but yeah, it played nice.   
 Q.  All in all looking forward to the rest of the week?  
CHRIS HANSON: Absolutely.  Can't wait.
