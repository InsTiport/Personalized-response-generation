  Q.  A 71 today.  You did have five birdies.  Tell me about your round.   
 BRIAN BATEMAN:  It wasn't too bad today.  I didn't hit it quite as well as I did yesterday, didn't make as many putts.  But all in all, I felt I gave myself enough chances.  The wind was about the same as yesterday, so I'm pleased.  I just three-putted 8 from nowhere.  It felt like someone hit me in the back of the head with a hammer.  I wasn't expecting that, but those things happen.   
  
  Q.  It's one of those things, when it turns ugly, but there's still a lot of golf to play.  Tell me about the course conditions.  Are the greens firmer today than they were yesterday?   
 BRIAN BATEMAN:  I'm hitting the ball well and I feel like I'm keeping everything under control.   
  
  Q.  You're in the hunt.   
 BRIAN BATEMAN:  I feel good about my chances.  I don't have as much experience as some of these guys out here in this position, but it's just golf and that's what I'm trying to treat it like.  There's a lot of golf to play, a lot of birdies to be made by a lot of the players.  It's going to take more than 9 under or 10 under to win.   
  
  Q.  Do you think minus 9 will hold up for the afternoon with the sun out?   
 BRIAN BATEMAN:  The course is starting to firm up a little bit, which I think helps on the par 5s.  This morning the ball wasn't rolling very much on the fairways.  The greens are getting a little bit faster.  The course is giving a lot of birdies.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about your chances going into the weekend?   
 BRIAN BATEMAN:  I'm happy where I am.  I wish I had a few more, but I think everybody in the field could say that.
