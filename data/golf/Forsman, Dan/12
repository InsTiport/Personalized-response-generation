  Q. So you had five birdie today, played really well. How do you feel about the round?  
 DAN FORSMAN: Well, I was pleased, obviously 3-under was a good score. The wind's been blowing pretty hard today and then switched mid round, so a little tougher coming in. Made a hiccup at 17, but I made a heck of a bogey and at least am within reaching distance of the leaders, at least for the moment. So I'm excited for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What were you trying to focus on before you went into your round today?  
 DAN FORSMAN: Just trying to do what I've been doing and been patient on the putting greens. I've been hitting good shots and hitting a lot of greens and have been right around the hole. I just felt like I was stroking it well, if I was just patient, they would start to fall and they started to fall today.  
  
  Q. What do you think you're going to try to work on and be successful on to try to move up?  
 DAN FORSMAN: Same thing tomorrow. Game plan is the same. A lot will depend on the wind. If it comes out of the north and the west it's a little different golf course. Some of the holes will be a lot different than the holes that played into the wind will play downwind and we'll have to adjust to that.   
 But the greens will be firm and fast and it will be drying out because it's going to be dry tomorrow. So it's going to be an exciting round, I'm hoping to be right in the middle of it.
