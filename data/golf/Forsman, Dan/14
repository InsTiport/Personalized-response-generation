   THE MODERATOR: Dan Forsman.  
  
  Q. Sum up your day for us.   
 DAN FORSMAN: I had moments of brilliance, but I finished at 8-under, and what's leading, 13? So Johnny Miller comes to mind, and others like that, who went out on Sunday and had a brilliant round and carried home the trophy.   
 So, I'm not out of it. We could have lost the tournament today, and we got a day tomorrow to go for it. I'm thrilled.   
  
  Q. Talk about that hot stretch, give us those highlights.   
 DAN FORSMAN: The putt on 10 stopped on the lip and fell in, so that was a great save for par. Looked like it was going to be short and chip on 11, bang it's in the hole for 3 and birdied the next hole for 3. So I got to 10, didn't I?   
  
  Q. How far was the chip shot?   
 DAN FORSMAN: It was funny I was between playing a pitch shot, a blade shot, but it was about 15 feet. Then I make the bogey, the shortest hole on the course, 13. And drove it too far on 14; had a great putt there and horse shoed out, and that was dicey coming in, made one, missed one, for a 2-par. But I lost a little mo.  
 I'm in good shape, playing well. Got to work on my balance and get that dialed in with the ball striking, and I think I got a good chance.   
  
  Q. Dicey coming in, four of the toughest holes are the last five, that could decide tomorrow.   
 DAN FORSMAN: Yeah, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, bring it home. You better have it all and, like you say, a lot can happen. So if you're within two or three shots coming home, you're not out of it. Somebody finishes, a with a birdie, put some heat on anybody.   
  
  Q. Good game plan.   
 DAN FORSMAN: Very good game plan. Thanks very much. I'll think about it all night.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Dan.
