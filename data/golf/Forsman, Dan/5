 Q. Can you talk a little about the day and how you felt out there? 
 DAN FORSMAN: Well, I started out well, birdied three of the first four holes, so that got me off to a really good start and I felt some momentum building. What was it, No. 5, that long par-4 to drop back to 2. Then I birdied 7 and 8 to get back to 4-under and parred 9. 
 So I made the turn at 5-under for the tournament and got some momentum going. On 10, I didn't birdie. I had a good birdie chance at 11 and then missed that. But made some good saves, and then drove the ball a little wayward coming in, bogeyed 17 and also 14. 
 So, all in all, you know, not a bad day. Moving day on Saturday, excited to be 3-under. Who knows, tomorrow go low and maybe get a chance to catch these guys.

 Q. So what was your mentality with the roller coaster kind of day then? 
 DAN FORSMAN: It's the U.S. Open, a USGA event. You've got to drive the ball on the fairway. If you don't, you're going to scramble. Usually when you scramble, it's hard to make pars. The key is to make birdies, and if you can do that, it helps offset some of those other struggles you're inevitably going to have at a USGA event.

 Q. What kind of adjustments will you make for tomorrow?
 DAN FORSMAN: I'll try to cool off a little bit. Then I'll go to the range and work on my driver and get some confidence back there. If I do that, my putter feel goods, and I feel good about tomorrow. I'm excited for the final round.

 Q. Any other thoughts?
 DAN FORSMAN: Just that Inverness is one of the great clubs we play. USGA holds wonderful events and wonderful venues, but Inverness is a wonderful gem, and I'm thrilled to be here competing.
