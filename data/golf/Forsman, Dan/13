 Q. Just your thoughts on the opening round today and the conditions. 
 DAN FORSMAN: Well anything under par after my practice rounds I felt would be a great score. And then with the wind we have had all week, it's not letting up, so that's making anything under par even that much better of a score. 
 So 2-under today opening round in good position, I feel very good about the score.
