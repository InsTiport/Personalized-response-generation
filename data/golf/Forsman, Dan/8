  Q. Under-par score today, what were the conditions today as opposed to the first two rounds?   
 DAN FORSMAN: More overcast today so better visually. The sun was such a factor yesterday. It's totally overcast today so the greens were holding, too.   
 Having said that there are really good pins and if you get off to a good start that's the key and you hang on for your life.   
 17, the opposing holes are everything. The 17 has the pin in the back right corner back there, disaster all the way around, the pin on top, very difficult second shot. Hard to par, let alone a bogey. If you miss the fairway you're going to have a tough time.   
 Seems like the nature of the golf course is you get off to a good start, keep that momentum alive through 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and make a birdie at ten or 11 and the real fun begins.   
  
  Q. Using your crystal ball and experience, any feeling on what might happen out there today to someone who is -- is there a 3-or 4-under out there today?   
 DAN FORSMAN: I would think there is, if they get off to a good start and get momentum on their side, if you make a birdie or eagle and jump-start your round. And 3 was a favorable pin, you could be aggressive there. 4 was tough. But 5 is a short-iron today and there were birdie opportunities early but if you don't capitalize today you better be scrambling to make a lot of short putts, 5-, 6-footers, to keep yourself in the game.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thanks.
