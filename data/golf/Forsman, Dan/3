 Q.   Will you give us a few initial comments on your round today?   
DAN FORSMAN:   I played with a fine club pro, Mark Mielke from Long Island.   I was impressed.   He got three birdies on the front nine and turned at 5‑under for the tournament.   And at that point I didn't know how he was figuring in, but I figured he was doing pretty well.   
And I saw where Kenny Perry is continuing his good play.   So he was right in the mix.   
I was having trouble kind of keeping pace.   I shot even on the front.   I bogeyed 10.   10 played really hard.   Missed a short putt for par.   
But I came back and birdied 12 to get back to even.   
And I birdied 17 to shoot 1‑under on the day.   I made a nice save at 18 to shoot 1‑under.   
So 3‑under for the tournament, I know these guys are 9‑under, but a golf course like this, like Mark said, if you get off to a good start, shoot three or four birdies early and get on that board climbing early and get some excitement going your way, there's no telling what could happen, so.  
   
 Q.   How did the rain today affect the conditions out there?  
DAN FORSMAN:   Softened the greens a little bit.   And the wind blew kind of tricky after the rain.   It seemed like it was swirling out there, the club selection was a little bit more challenging.   But the golf course played very similar.   
The lone difference I suppose was the greens were a little slower because of the moisture.
