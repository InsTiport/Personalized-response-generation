Q.   Can you give us an assessment of how you played yesterday and how that changed today?   Did it get better today? 
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Yes, it did.   Actually yesterday I was probably striking it better.   I made really well and I didn't make many putts, and I finished with a double on my last hole, which was No.9, just hit in the water and came back in the water. 
But today, I just produced my best round of putting all year.   I don't know, funny thing is, the hole just looked like a big bucket to me today, I don't know why.   I just made everything.   I had 23 putts, and it's just the best I think I've ever produced in a round of golf.   So it felt really good.   It's just so much more fun when you can actually make putts. 

Q.   Is there a reason for that, or it's just one of those days?
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Well, I just went to do‑‑ obviously putting was my weakness this year.   And a few weeks ago, I went to some putt lab, just something where you find out about your stroke and everything, and we found a lot of interesting stuff. 
And I changed putter, I went to Wentworth to see TaylorMade, and they changed my putter and I have just been working pretty hard on it, and I'm rolling the ball much better, because I used to basically put spin on my ball which was terrible.   So ever since, my confidence is growing, and today it showed.
