Q. Obviously a good opening for you.  You have to feel pretty good about that, don't you?JOANNA KLATTEN: Yeah, very, very.  I think I just did a good job mentally out there.  I was patient and I just was trying to enjoy myself and really I did a good job staying shot by shot and yeah, it worked out really well.Q. Did you feel like this could potentially be a good week for you?  I know you started off well at Kingsmill two weeks ago?JOANNA KLATTEN: That's right.  Yeah, yeah, if I keep doing the same good mental job, yes, it could be, because I really like the golf course.  It sets up well for me and the par 5s, they are all -- almost all of them are reachable.  I think it's an advantage for longer hitters and you've got to hit it kind of high on those greens because there's a lot of false front on the greens.  So I feel comfortable here.Q. You mentioned it's a mental approach but is there anything that you've been working on over the last couple of weeks that you feel like is starting to click?JOANNA KLATTEN: No, I mean, nothing new.  I think it's just -- I think it's just sometimes it takes time to click.  I struggled a couple months ago but for a month, it's been better.  I just need to focus better, and today I did well in that area.Q. You mentioned you struggled earlier.  What was it?JOANNA KLATTEN: Well, it was mostly my putting.  I was having nightmares with my putting and today was actually really good.  Like I don't know how many putts I had but it was not many.  It was really good.Q. So we're here at this beautiful course, obviously a great setup around it.  Can you talk about how big this event feels?JOANNA KLATTEN: It feels amazing.  You can tell it's a major.  Hard to put into words, but the way it's organized, the way it's set up, the way the golf course -- the shape of the golf course is phenomenal.  It's great.  I really enjoy it here.
