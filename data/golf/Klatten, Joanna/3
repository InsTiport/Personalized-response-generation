 Q.   What were you hitting?   Run me through it.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Well, I hit a good drive, and I told myself‑‑ I really did; I'm not making this up ‑‑ I told myself, I like this shot.   I have a perfect 3‑wood.   It's exactly the right distance, and I've never had a double eagle.  
I really told myself that.   I hit it and I told my caddie, Oh, this is looking good.  
   
 Q.   You can verify this?  
CADDIE:   Yeah.  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   It was high enough like it landed on the green and just rolled a little bit and kind of looked like it got in the hole.   It was awesome because it was a good gallery and people were going crazy.   It was so much fun.   
   
 Q.   First one ever?  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   First one ever.  
   
 Q.   What was it with about that particular shot that you kind of called it almost?  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   What do you mean?   
   
 Q.   You said you knew you were going to make it almost.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Yeah, yeah, sometimes you feel some sort of things are going to happen.   It's intuition.   I had a good feeling about that shot.   Of course there is a little bit of luck in that.  
But I hit a great shot.   Yeah, I was expecting it to be pretty close to the hole.   
   
 Q.   That was the second one ever in this tournament.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Really?   Awesome.   
   
 Q.   Katherine Kirk in '07 or '08.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   On the same hole?   
   
 Q.   No, on 7.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   On 7.  
   
 Q.   What club?  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   3‑wood.  
   
 Q.   Distance on that, do you remember?  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   It was‑‑ I can tell you that actually now.   It was 209 meters, which is 225 yards.   So, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What was your celebration like?   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Well, I just jumped.   I hugged him.   We high‑fived.   We went a little crazy for a minute.  
   
 Q.   Do you have to buy the drinks for that?  
JOANNA KLATTEN:   I mean, I'll treat him well.   No worries.   
   
 Q.   All right.   Perfect, thanks so much.   
JOANNA KLATTEN:   Thank you.
