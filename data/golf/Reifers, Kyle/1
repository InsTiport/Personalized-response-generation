KYLE REIFERS: Very, very impressive.  He played really solid.  To be honest, I'm a little surprised he hit driver on the last hole but, you know, I know he's trying to make birdie so I give him credit.  It really narrows it up.   
He played great golf.  I have no room to talk after what I shot, if you're questioning that.  He played great golf and it was really fun to watch.  He made a lot of great putts, hit it solid.  Anytime you shoot that it was impressive.   
So, obviously out here you can't play out of the rough so he was in the fairway, hit a lot of par-3s, hit some good irons.  Fun to watch.   
 Q.  When did you guys become aware?  
KYLE REIFERS: I told my caddy actually on about the 12th hole, I said, "Are we on 59 watch here or what?"  Then he made eagle and had a couple good looks and even a few of the putts coming in that he didn't make he hit really good putts and good aggressive kind of topside putts.   
So, he played really well.   
 Q.  Looking ahead, you got the Playoffs coming up.  You're very good in The Playoffs.  Deepest you've been 50th.  What's the mindset, obviously --  
KYLE REIFERS: I need to rest up.  Kind of moved last week.  I feel like I haven't rested this week.  I'll go get some rest this weekend and be ready to go this next week.
