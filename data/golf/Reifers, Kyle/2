 Q.  Great day.  
KYLE REIFERS: No, I played really well.  It was a long day, but a good day.  So, trying to get some rest, get some fluids tonight and come out tomorrow hopefully probably have a late tee time so I can get a little sleep tonight and I'll be ready to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  Seemed like looking at the leaderboards everybody was going low today.  
KYLE REIFERS: Yeah, the conditions were out there, the greens are still pretty receptive, the course is in great shape, so I expect pretty good scores.   
 Q.  Do you think you left some out there somewhere?  
KYLE REIFERS: Oh, yeah, I definitely did.  But I also hit some really nice shots and made some nice birdies.  So all in all I'm not really looking back I'm going to try and look forward to tomorrow.
