KYLE REIFERS: Felt like I left a handful out there, some really good putts that didn't go in.  All in all, really excited about my game.   
Keep doing what I've been doing the last three days I think I'll have a good chance tomorrow coming down the stretch.   
 Q.  Seems like there are a lot more low scores out there today.  For you, what was the biggest difference today?  
KYLE REIFERS: Oh, man, I don't know.  I think the greens were maybe a hair more receptive.  I played real late yesterday afternoon and got a little crispy out there.   
You know, felt a little bit more receptive.  Kind of moving day.  As they say, these guys are good.  Scores are pretty low.  I would expect the same tomorrow.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to tomorrow, you put yourself in a great position.  What will be your thought process?  
KYLE REIFERS: Kind of like I said, just do what I've been doing.  I feel like just patience.  And the way I'm playing I feel like I can rattle off some birdies if I can take advantage of the par-5s.  I really haven't done that the first three days, and I think some other guys probably are.   
If I can do that tomorrow, I like my chances.
