Q. You must feel comfortable here?
KYLE REIFERS: Yeah, I really like this course.  I have, kind of like you said, a comfort zone here.  The kind of course that suits my eye really well.  It's kind of nice to always come back here and feel like when I tee it up, I feel like I'm going to have a good week.
Last year was my first year, but I think I ended up missing by two, had a good week.  Just kind of patience and a lot of good shots, and when it gets firm or soft, it can kind of end up a little further than you think.  So you have to have some patience.  You might hit a putt or two; I hit a couple good putts today that didn't go in that weren't very long putts and I hit good putts, and you just kind of have to keep your confidence and stay calm.
Q. Of all the courses on TOUR, where does this rank for you?
KYLE REIFERS: It's definitely at the top.  I think it kind of has withheld the test of time, and, you know, scores are never really low here.  So it's really probably one of my favorites all year.
Q. All your birdies came on par 4s.
KYLE REIFERS: Yeah, normally you kind of want to take advantage of the two par 5s.  I didn't do that today.  Hit good shots and good putts, but didn't make any birdies.  I left a couple out there, but I played really solid and I like the way my game is going into the weekend.
