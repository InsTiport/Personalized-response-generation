  Q.  Yesterday 17 greens, eight birdies.  Today you hit I think 11 greens and one birdie.  What happened overnight?   
 KYLE REIFERS:  Not much, it was just a struggle out there.  You know, I felt good, felt comfortable, didn't have much -- many things go my way.  I hit a lot of good putts that I thought kind of wobbled around and just didn't go in.   
 You know, I could have let it go, and I kind of grinded and made a birdie coming in, and I made two bogeys, so it was a relatively steady round.  I didn't get much out of it.  I had a couple chances there coming in, kind of got it together and started hitting some good shots and just couldn't buy one.  I felt like I was hitting good putts and they just didn't drop.  There's not much you can do.   
 I made a good save on 18, and that kind of kept me going and looking forward.  I'm only two off the lead, so I can't complain.   
  
  Q.  The bad news is you shot 73.  The good news is you're right there in the hunt.   
 KYLE REIFERS:  Yeah, that's all you can ask for.  I want to get on that back nine on Sunday and have a chance to win, be in contention, so I didn't shoot myself in the foot too bad.  Come out and play two solid rounds and I'll be right there.   
  
  Q.  How were your emotions today coming out as the leader of a PGA TOUR event?   
 KYLE REIFERS:  They were fine.  You know, I didn't feel out of place.  I didn't feel like I didn't belong.  It was good.  You know, it was a little different, but I didn't hit it the way I wanted to off the tee, and I kind of got in some squirrelly places and was kind of grinding all day and just didn't get many putts to drop.
