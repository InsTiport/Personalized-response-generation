Q. What's going through your mind?
KYLE REIFERS: Oh, just disappointed. I mean, at the least you like to win to the guy who's making (crowd noise). You know, I performed the way I wanted to. I can't hang my hat on that.
That last putt there, that was a little disappointing, but all in all I take a lot of positives out, and see if I can get back in this position again soon. 

Q. What a day. I know you're disappointed right now. Just talk about your emotions right now. 
KYLE REIFERS: You know, I know obviously how much a win would mean so it's disappointing, but like I said, I hit the shots and the putts that I wanted to. 
At the beginning of the day if you would have said I would be sitting here right now I would've obviously taken it.
But I have to take a lot of positives out it of and see if I can get in this position again.
