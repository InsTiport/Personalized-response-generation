Q.   Good playing today. 
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, bogey‑free round.   I took advantage of the par‑5s for the most part and hit it close on a few and didn't really make any big mistakes.

Q.   You're from Missouri; how familiar were you with this course before this tournament?
JENNIFER KIRBY:   I hadn't played it at all.   I ran up about a month ago because I had a commitment on the Monday so I knew I wouldn't play.   I just played nine on Tuesday and the pro‑am yesterday.

Q.   Last week you had a good round, a first round 67, and not quite so good the second round.   Are you going to be able to take anything from last week so you can have a second consecutive good round tomorrow?
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, like I said before, it was just a learning experience, and I'm glad I had that now, especially going into tomorrow's round, but I mean, I definitely played a lot better that round compared to this round.   I think this course is very scorable, so I think that that was‑‑ it was a good round today, but yeah, still a lot to do out there.

Q.   What was it like playing with all the Canadian girls today?
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, it was nice.   Just to have friends in your group is always nice.

Q.   And talk about the gallery.   I think you guys had the biggest gallery all day. 
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, we had a really great following, so that was really nice, the whole round long people were cheering us on.
