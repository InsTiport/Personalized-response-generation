 Q.   We saw you finishing with back‑to‑back birdies there.   
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, I just wasn't solid.   I hit a lot of bad shots and put myself in bad position.   Didn't really putt well either.   I felt like I was kind of forcing to keep things together, and it just didn't work out.   
Luckily I made a couple birdies at the end to make it a little better, so, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Sucks to maybe miss it by one or two strokes?   
JENNIFER KIRBY:   I mean, yeah, it does.   I played well yesterday.   I felt like I got away with a few shots yesterday, and my ball striking, I just didn't do well today and it really put me in a bad position.  
   
 Q.   Talk about coming in in the second round.   Was there a bit of nerves there?   
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, I wouldn't say because of that, but just because I did play really well yesterday, and there were a lot of people following our group and stuff like that.   I just felt a little uneasy at the beginning, which is weird, because I wasn't nervous at all yesterday.   So a little bit of nerves at the beginning, and it was hard to shake after I made a couple bogeys.  
   
 Q.   What are the positives you make from this week going forward?   
JENNIFER KIRBY:   I mean, yesterday was a big positive, and obviously, playing with such a strong grouping, it was really fun to watch them play.   I was right there with them yesterday, so that was encouraging.
