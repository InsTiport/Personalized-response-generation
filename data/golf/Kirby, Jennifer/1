Q.   Tell me about your round today. 
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Yeah, it was a struggle.   I mean, I putted terribly.   I didn't give myself a lot of opportunities.   So I mean that was basically summing it up.

Q.   What was the biggest difference between today and yesterday?
JENNIFER KIRBY:   The course or how I played? 

Q.   Both. 
JENNIFER KIRBY:   It was a little windier, but it didn't play that much of a difference and my putting was just really off today.

Q.   Tell me about the conditions of the greens today. 
JENNIFER KIRBY:   They're looking a lot better each day.   You know, some holes didn't look as quick and I ended up blowing it by, and then some looked really downhill and really quick and I ended up leaving it short.   I just couldn't find the right consistency on the greens today with my putting.

Q.   Putting today aside, what are you going to work on for tomorrow?
JENNIFER KIRBY:   Putting.
