  Q. How hard was it out there today?   
 RYUJI IMADA: It was pretty hard. I thought the wind blue hard yesterday but today was a whole other level of wind.   
  
  Q. Were you just thinking just make pars, and if I get a birdie and it goes in the hole, great?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm just thinking about the safe shots on the fairways and the greens and I'm always trying to make pars and I did a pretty good job of it today.   
  
  Q. I thought you played very smart, especially coming down the stretch. That stretch back into the wind, 15, 16, 17, 18, that's --  
 RYUJI IMADA: 14, too.   
  
  Q. 14, too, huh?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, 14 was really hard. I hit a great shot off the tee, luckily, and I had a 6-iron in. Usually you're hittin' a 2-iron or a pitching wedge, so you can tell how hard the wind is blowing.   
  
  Q. Where did you see the turn-around? This is not the start to a season that you're used to having. You missed three of your last four cuts but something is obviously coming and now it's starting to show.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Sure. You know, my putting has been a little bit off this year. But missing cuts the last three weeks, obviously, I haven't been playing well, but I missed 'em by 1 or 2 shots.   
 So it's not like I'm way off. Jason Dutner gave me a pretty good tip, and I'm hitting pretty well this week so thanks to him.   
  
  Q. Ball striking tip?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Sure.  
  
  Q. Because you'll give him the putting tips.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Not this year.   
  
  Q. Well done today. You've got yourself in the hunt for Sunday.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, hopefully the wind blows again and a 2, 3-under tomorrow will be a great score.   
  
  Q. Thank you.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Thank you.
