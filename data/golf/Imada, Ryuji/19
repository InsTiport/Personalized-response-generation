  Q. Ryuji, give us some general comments on what was a good day for you out there.   
 RYUJI IMADA: I drove the ball well, and I also hit my irons in good spots. I just kept playing smart golf. It's a really tough golf course and part of a good score out there. I got lucky and made birdies on -- well, actually, made good birdies on 6 and 7 and got lucky on 8 and chipped in for birdie on 8.   
 Got to finish on a good note. It was a good round.   
  
  Q. What was the best part of your game today?   
 RYUJI IMADA: I would say my irons. Irons were really good. Most of the time you can't really go with the pins out here. Sometimes you've got to play away from the hole. I did a really good job of that.   
  
  Q. Is being on the right part of the green maybe more important on this course than some other course? You talk about being in the wrong spot, downhill putt or something.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yes. The greens are really quick. If you put the ball on the wrong tier, you're definitely looking at a three-putt. You've got to get yourself in the right spot, right tier to be able to, you know, actually have birdies let alone two-putting.   
  
  Q. For the most part, you felt like you did that pretty well today?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Did that the last few days, yeah.   
  
  Q. Greens are much faster than yesterday?   
 RYUJI IMADA: About the same speed. Pins are in a little more difficult spot today.
