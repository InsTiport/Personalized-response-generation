  Q. You started off, got it back under par at least, still gave yourself a chance for tomorrow?  
 RYUJI IMADA: You know, this is a golf course where 3- or 4-under is a par. The top guys are not going to shoot over par. So for me to come out and have a chance, I've got to shoot somewhere around 10-under. It's going to be pretty tough.   
 But I had a great day on Friday, and if I can just duplicate that, I may have a shot at it, who knows.  
  
  Q. Anything in particular you'll work on tonight?  
 RYUJI IMADA: No, there's not going to be no working, practicing today. I'm pretty frustrated. I'm going to go home and come back fresh.
