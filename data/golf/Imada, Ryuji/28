  Q.  On a day when conditions seemed to be getting the best players in the world on the back nine, you shoot 68, good playing.   
 RYUJI IMADA:  Yes, it was a great day for me.  I got off to a good start and I just kept myself patient and my short game was pretty good, putted well.  I made some good putts on the back nine.   
 And the turning point probably was on 10 when I missed my tee shot to the right, and I was just hoping, you know, hope to get lucky shot, and I pulled it off and made birdie.  So that was a great turnaround point, and I just played good from there on.   
  
  Q.  When you got it to 7-under par, were you watching scoreboard at all?   
 RYUJI IMADA:  I knew I was tied for third at one point.  You know, the top's just pretty much run away with it again, and you know, again, I was trying to finish up there.  My goal today was to shoot 67, and I came up one short.  But all in all, it was a great day.   
  
  Q.  Second at Buick, great tournament this week, you almost won in Atlanta last year; do you feel like you are just on the cusp of breaking through this year and winning?   
 RYUJI IMADA:  Well, I know I was close in Atlanta.  But there's a far distance in between second place and winning.  I don't know what to say.  Until I win it, I can't -- I mean, I can't comment on it.   
 But I know I'm playing better.  I'm getting used to playing on the PGA TOUR, getting used to playing in front of people, getting used to playing with the guys who I watched growing up.  You know, I feel comfortable and hopefully my win will come soon.
