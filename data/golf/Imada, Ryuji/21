  Q. You must be pleased with the strong finish.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, it was a great finish. He made a birdie putt on 14, and I got a little bit lucky and holed out a bunker shot on 15. We made a good save on 17 and a solid par on 18. It was a great finish.   
 We played really well for foursomes, but I think we let a few get away in the four-ball.   
  
  Q. Ironic, that it's meant to be the easier one.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, it was a great experience to know what it's like, because I've never played in one of these. You know, next time we play in it together, we'll know what to do.  
 It was a great experience and all of the volunteers have been really nice, very helpful, and people have been nice and the golf course is in great condition. So, I had a great week.  
  
  Q. What's been the hardest part this week for you?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Letting my partner down here and there. Missed a few short putts, and when you miss those, it's just a bad feeling.  
  
  Q. Starting out the final round, you were well behind Spain and Australia; what was your goal?   
 RYUJI IMADA: We didn't have a goal score set. We wanted to make as many birdies as we could, and we got off to a really good start on the first hole. It's a very difficult format, so par is a good score. We finished with a birdie and eagle on 14 and 15, so that helped a lot.
