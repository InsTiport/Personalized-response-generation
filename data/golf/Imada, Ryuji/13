 Q. What a great round, a 5-under-par 67. What a way to start your round, eagle, birdie. Tell me about that. 
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, that was obviously a great start. I hit a 3-wood off the tee on 10, and I looked up and the clouds were going left to right, and my caddie told me it was going right to left. I wasn't quite sure what it was going to do. But I went with his decision that the wind was going right to left, and I hit a perfect shot, and the wind took the ball. I couldn't quite see the ball go in the hole, but I knew that I had hit a great shot.

 Q. Now, you had missed the cut here in two of four previous appearances. What does this start mean for you and how good a feeling now coming in?
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, it definitely feels great to play great on this golf course. If you shoot a 67 on this golf course, you've done something great. You know, it's just the first day, and it really doesn't mean much. But it's a great start in the right direction, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.

 Q. How was the course out there? In the morning they were talking about how the rain had softened things up. What was it like in the afternoon?
 RYUJI IMADA: Probably the same, not much wind, the greens were still soft and very receptive. I think it played as easy as it could on this golf course.
