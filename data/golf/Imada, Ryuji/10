  Q. At 7-under, do you feel like you still are in it if you can come out tomorrow and get things going? How do you think you stand going into tomorrow?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, I've got to post something really great, obviously. But the way I played today, I just couldn't adjust to the golf course. I was used to soft fairways, soft greens, and just never got anything going out there.  
  
  Q. How is your health as far as the shoulder? Was that a factor at all today?  
 RYUJI IMADA: No, not at all. My ribs and my shoulders are fine, just played bad.   
  
  Q. On 13, what kind of happened there, and what led to the shot in the water?   
 RYUJI IMADA: I don't know. I just pull-hooked it. Just one of those days where you've got nothing going and you're trying to force the issue and nothing goes your way.   
 Even when I hit a good shot -- like the last hole I thought I hit a pretty good shot, just came up way short. But it's just one of those days where you've got nothing going.
