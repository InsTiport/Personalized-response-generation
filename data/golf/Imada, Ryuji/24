  Q. With AK over in Korea this week, you're taking charge of the flashy belt. It's very pretty. Describe that for us.  
 RYUJI IMADA: It's nothing compared to AK's.  
  
  Q. You got things going again. This is such a game of momentum, and you had things going really early in the year and then of course when you won in Atlanta. Been in a little slump lately, but looked like you started to come out of it last week to the TOUR Championship. You feel like you're into something now?  
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, I think so. I always struggle in the summertime for some reason. I don't know why, but in June, July, and August I seem to struggle every year.   
 You know, it's October now, and in this cold weather I feel fine.  
  
  Q. You hit a ton of greens. That's got to be encouraging, because your putter has always been something you've been able to count on.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Yeah, especially the last couple of weeks. I found something last week that, you know, carried on to this week.   
 Greens are so soft out here, so it's easy to hit greens as long as you keep it somewhere in the same distance.  
  
  Q. You're into the top 30 and you're everything next year. From a goal standpoint, is it, what, you want to win again before this year is over? What are you playing for?  
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, that's a big goal of mine, to get another win. You know, this is still a great tournament. I love coming back here and I enjoy it. You know, I look forward to coming back here every year.
