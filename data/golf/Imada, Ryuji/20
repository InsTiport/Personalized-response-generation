  Q. You had seven birdies out on this golf course. Tell me about your day.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, it was a roller coaster round. I got off to a real bad start bogeying 2 and 4, and I was thinking about the cut line, too. All of a sudden I made some good birdies on 5 and 6, and here I come, and just five more birdies after that. Actually the weather was really nice, so it helped us. Just one of those days when golf felt easy.   
  
  Q. But after those two bogeys, it couldn't have felt that easy. What was it that turned it around? Was it one shot and you thought, okay, now I've got that feeling, I know it now?   
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, I think the birdie on 5, which I hit the tee shot in the rough and only had about 100 yards to the pin, but still a tough shot and I was able to hit it to about four feet and make a birdie, and that kind of got me settled down, and I was able to make birdie on the next hole, too.  
  
  Q. Tell me about 17. You hit it in there seven feet.   
 RYUJI IMADA: There was a hole-in-one there, so it couldn't be that tough (laughter).   
  
  Q. You know you're going to go get a free drink from Webb Simpson, right?  
 RYUJI IMADA: Oh, yeah, but that was just a great 5-iron. It was just the perfect club for me, and I was able to pull it off.  
  
  Q. You're feeling good that the weather stayed nice for you because we all know the forecast was not supposed to be that nice and the wind laid down a little bit.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Definitely. I thought that we were going to get the bad end of the two draws, but we definitely got the better end of the draw, considering this afternoon was pretty much as easy as it gets.
