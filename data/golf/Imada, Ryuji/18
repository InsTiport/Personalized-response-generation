  Q. 6-under par for you. That's vaulted you into contention. Let's talk about your round. You began with a bogey, had another bogey a little later on, then finished 4-under on about the last 12 holes. Just talk about the way that you finished today.   
 RYUJI IMADA: I finished great. Actually got off to a bogey start, and an unexpected birdie on 2. I hit a pretty good tee shot, but I hit it a little too far and had about 30 to 35 feet downhill, and that settled me down, and off I went.  
  
  Q. You, again, had birdies late in this round, as well, and a couple of good looks at 17 and 18 at the finishing holes here. Just talk about the finish.   
 RYUJI IMADA: Well, you know, I just tried to stay patient. Birdies on 14 and 15, those were -- I hit a good tee shot from both of them, but second shot went a little long on 14. I was able to make about a 30-footer down the hill left to right.   
 And 15, I hit a really good second shot to about eight feet and it was straight up the hill. You don't get too many of those out here. And when you do, you've got to take advantage of it.  
  
  Q. Quickly, the course appeared to be firming up some today for tomorrow, yes?  
 RYUJI IMADA: Definitely so. You know, on some second shots I was really worried about the ball bouncing off the green, and I was a little bit tentative about it. But the greens are getting a little firmer and quicker, too.
