Q. Great couple rounds today.  How do you feel walking off the golf course?
HOLLY CLYBURN: Relieved.  Found it tricky on the back side.  I played awesome from start to finish, just didn't get anything going in the hole, really, unfortunately, from the backside really.  Other than that, I'm quite happy where I'm standing right now.  It's been a rough couple of weeks, but, yeah, I'm staying positive and I'm liking where I'm standing.
Q. I hate to ask, everything okay?  You mentioned a rough couple weeks.
HOLLY CLYBURN: Body-wise, it's a little bit sore.  I did a stupid thing at the beginning of this week.  Did a stupid jump and tore my hip, so I am struggling a little bit.  Other than that, I'm fine.
Q. Maybe some adrenaline, because you're not putting like you have an injury?
HOLLY CLYBURN: Yeah, the physio's doing a great job with me.
Q. So you're out here playing with Lori Kane who is just a great ambassador for Canadian golf, a great ambassador in general.  What's it like walking around the golf course with her?
HOLLY CLYBURN: The crowds are amazing.  They absolutely adore her.  It's awesome.  Every two minutes or second, it's, "Go, Lori, Go, Lori."  It's great to be around.  Yesterday was amazing crowds in the afternoon.  Even this morning when we teed off at 10 to 9:00, it was quite loud.  They just love her.  It's great.  It's great for us to be around, and it's pretty special to be around such an icon like that.
Q. So right now you're one off the lead.  The highest you've been on an LPGA leaderboard.  With your hip, how do you get ready for a later tee time tomorrow?
HOLLY CLYBURN: Just keep doing what I'm doing.  I obviously had a later tee time yesterday, so just rest.  Rest is the key.  Just keep doing what I'm doing, like I said, and speak to my family and coach back at home, and see where we can go from there.
