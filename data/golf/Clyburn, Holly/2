 Q.  Eagle on 9 to end the day?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: Yeah, yeah.  I've just been waiting for something to drop like that all day, actually.  I played solid all day, and that was just a nice present on the last, really.  Just missed a few birdie putts out there, and hit a nice 5-wood in there and holed that putt.   
 Q.  Does that give you momentum heading into Friday?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: Sure.  We're going out early tomorrow, so hopefully I'll shoot something similar if not better tomorrow.  We'll see where it lays on the weekend.   
 Q.  How does this course suit your style of game?  How are you liking it out there?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: Yeah, I really like it.  From day one when I stepped on here on Monday, I really liked it.  I thought I'd probably do quite nicely out there.  I'd fade the ball, and some of the tee shots you do have to have a bit of imagination.  But other than that, just it really does suit my eye and I just enjoy it.   
 Q.  Anything you're going to change or do differently tomorrow?  
HOLLY CLYBURN: Apart from the number on my golf ball, that's about it.
