GARRY HOUSTON:  I made a couple putts on the par 5s, three really good up and downs.  Started to hit the fairways, had a few good iron shots close.  And 7, I hit it quite close in there with a 6 iron.  I had a 2 putt on 6 for birdie and birdied 7.  I missed about a 6 footer on 8 for birdie.  I hit it in the rough on the last.
Q.  Inaudible?
GARRY HOUSTON:  No bogeys out there is good for me, it's a long course.  I did get in the rough a few times but did manage to get around today.  Still the putter felt solid really, after a week off, and I didn't really make any big mistakes on the greens.  The greens were getting a little bit warm, so maybe we got the best of the weather.
Q.  In Russia, you said that you were feeling a little bit tired    inaudible?
GARRY HOUSTON:  No, I didn't feel lethargic today.  You've got to get up for a tournament like this.  This is a huge tournament; all of the big guys are here.  You get more excited about a tournament like this, put it that way.  Maybe Russia was a bit smaller.
Q.  Presumably the week off has done wonders as well, just recharging the batteries?
GARRY HOUSTON:  Yes, it's good rest.  I hurt my ribs in Russia so I didn't pick up a golf club.  You know, it did do me good.
Q.  How did you hurt your ribs?
GARRY HOUSTON:  I think it could have been anything.

I chipped it down the last four holes on Sunday because I couldn't make a backswing.  I was actually thinking of pulling out here.  The physios have done a great job here.  They have made it feel easier, just a matter of trusting it, the pain is gone, just a matter of trusting it that it will be all right.
Q.  It will be all right for the next three days?
GARRY HOUSTON:  Hopefully.
