 Q. So how are you enjoying the Olympic experience?   
URSULA WIKSTROM: So far, it's been such a great thing. We have been I think five days here and being in the village, seeing all the other athletes and seeing all the other Finnish athletes, as well, that you don't really know that well, but watching some other sports, really nice.  
   
 Q. Which sports?   
URSULA WIKSTROM: We've been watching boxing and weightlifting. Some totally different kind of sports that I haven't seen live never before. Yeah, one of the Finnish girls is going well in boxing, so we are cheering for her.   
   
 Q. What's her name?   
URSULA WIKSTROM: Mira Potkonen.  
   
 Q. What about having your husband on the bag? He doesn't caddie every week, right? This is a special week?  
URSULA WIKSTROM: He doesn't caddie every week. He caddies like half the tournaments. Not that much during the summer but mainly like the fall and the spring.  
   
 Q. How nice is it to be able to share this experience together?  
URSULA WIKSTROM: Yeah, I'm lucky in that way that I have my husband on the bag and my uncle was able to come here, as well. So we have a really cosy environment in that way.  
   
 Q. What are your expectations for this week's tournament?   
URSULA WIKSTROM: Enjoy it, play well and hopefully be able to fight on the last group on the final day.
