STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, yeah.  I've played okay here in the past, but I've not scored that well, you know, so this is all new to me, and my game feels fine.

STEVE WEBSTER:   Just patience, really.  Started off steady.  I birdied 7 from about 15 feet.  I had a few good chances before that, but I kept my mind on what I was doing and I was just hitting it nicely, really and managed to make a few putts. 

Q.  Steve, a little bit disappointed that you did not birdie the 17th or 18th?

STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, I had two good chances there.  Hit a great tee shot off the last, but it went through the fairway because   -- you know, 297 or whatever; hit 5-wood and went through the fairway.  But a great tee shot on 17.  I'm only going in with 4-iron.  Pushed it on to the green and took five there, as well.

Q.  You hit the lip on the bunker of 18?

STEVE WEBSTER:   I think could have gotten there, really.  I just didn't quite make a good contact.  The course is playing really fiery.  I hit 5-wood off 17 and 18. 

Q.  Could you sum up your career so far? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Too steady, really.  I'm just a little bit inconsistent.  It's all right shooting 70, 71 on the Tour, but you don't get any places finishing 4- or 5-under every week.

STEVE WEBSTER:   By playing with the better players, I think.  By competing in the top events and playing well. 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, definitely.  Yeah. 

Q.  Can you tell us about this fan club of yours? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Started the last few years, really.  They come to most of the events in England, and you know just a good group.  I play pool with them a lot and they just come and walk around for a few days.  About four days. 

Q.  Do you have Britney Spears written on your shoes this year? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   No.  I wanted to, but they wouldn't let me.  (Laughs).

Q.  Why Britney Spears? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Because I think it was the only time I could get on TV by somebody focusing on my shoes.  Try something different.  Miguel could not get me on TV; so I thought my shoes might. 

Q.  Why Britney Spears? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Oh, I don't know.  No reason, really.  Everybody knows her really, I suppose.  I'm not a big fan. 

Q.  Was that in Dubai? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, since the start of the season, but nothing has come of it really.  Just Britney Spears on the back of my shoes. 

Q.  Do you always have these zany thoughts?

STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, definitely.  Since I've turned pro, I've started to go slowly, but surely, loopy. 

Q.  What other zany ideas have you had?

STEVE WEBSTER:   Nothing, really.  I have them now and again, but nothing I can think of. 

Q.  Helps to be loopy on Tour?

STEVE WEBSTER:   Definitely. 

Q.  Don't get wound up about it?

STEVE WEBSTER:   That's probably why I'm playing well this week.  I tend to forget about my bad shots or silly bogeys.  Just get on with it and make a good putt or a good shot on the next hole.  I think that's the big thing about golf.  You dwell on all your bad shots, you've got to tell yourself, just get on with it.  Stop crying about it. 

Q.  Do you see anybody?  Alan Fine or anybody?

STEVE WEBSTER:   I work a lot with Pete Cowen.  He gives me a good talking to now and again if I get a little bit negative. 

Q.  Is it a loopy idea for you to win this? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   That would be a loopy idea, yeah.  (Laughs).

Q.  Why? 

STEVE WEBSTER:   I don't know.  There's no reason why.  I'm playing well, but I've got a long way to go yet.  A lot of good players up there.  It's all new to me.  I'm looking forward to it. 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Warwick's Juniors, 1993 (laughs).  I don't know, it's been a while.  Well, I can't remember.  I finished second and third a few times.  I think it was German Open where Stephen Allan won, Germany.  But, you never know until you get up there and compete with the best. 

STEVE WEBSTER:   Definitely.  Yeah.
