 Q.   After that start today‑‑  
STEVE WEBSTER:   That wasn't pretty.   It was bad enough playing it.   I don't know what happened first, I hit it really good on the range and I think I got a bit cocky on the course and hit so many bad shots the first, well, six, seven holes, and I just‑‑ I don't know, really.   And hit a really good putt on 11 and thought it feels a little bit better now.   But the first six holes, it was like I never played golf before.  
   
 Q.   Give us a sense on what you've got to do well with respect to holding the ball up in the breeze when the greens are difficult?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Well, I thought they took the pins away a bit today so that's why the scoring has pretty much stayed where it was.   Especially when you're struggling, it's quite hard to even hit the greens but the back nine I gave myself a few chances, but the course has been set up great all week.   But you've got to hit the fairways to be able to hit the greens.  
   
 Q.   The last win, Portugal Masters, it's been a fair time between drinks; how are you looking forward to tomorrow?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, too long, '07.   That was a great moment for me there.   So, yeah, I'm playing really good. I played good last week.   I just didn't make putts.   I finished 60th, which was terrible but I felt I played a lot better than that.   And this week I swung the club good apart from the first six holes today, so look forward to tomorrow.
