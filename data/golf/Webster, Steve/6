Q.   How did it compare with yesterday? 
STEVE WEBSTER:   A little bit scrappy today.   I missed a green with a lob‑wedge on the first and chipped in for a birdie which was nice and settled down.   I didn't really give myself enough chances today, so 69, happy with that.

Q.   Starting at the first today and when you came to the 10th where you had the albatross yesterday, what were you feeling?
STEVE WEBSTER:   Well, I had the perfect yardage, 5‑wood again, just pulled it to 40 feet so it was a good shot.   But it was in my mind again.   I thought back‑to‑back would be nice but didn't happen.

Q.   Do you feel that you're growing in confidence and strength as the days go by? 
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, I was disappointed how I played today .   Warmed up on the range this morning at half five and it was quite early and never really quite got going on the course, so to shoot 69, I've scrambled a little bit which is great.
Monday and Tuesday, I did a lot of work on my putting, worked on something slightly different and changed it as well, changed the shaft for a little more feel and it's working well this week.   I've not hit it great but if you can make a few putts, it's all the difference out here.
