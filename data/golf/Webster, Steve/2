Q.   What is the verdict on the week?
STEVE WEBSTER:   Obviously really pleased.   A little bit frustrated, got myself into a nice position today but strange day, the scoring was going nowhere.   I thought, it's pretty flat calm and Rory shot 63 Thursday, so it was a strange day today. 
I found it hard to get going but I put in a great two holes to finish, so really happy.

Q.   And those birdies to close, a lovely position?
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, it's a bit of a frustrating day but like I said, nobody was really doing anything.   I'm looking at the leaderboard and I'm still only one or two behind.   Finished it off good and looking forward to next week. 
It was a strange day and nobody seemed to be playing well and dragged everybody down I think but I'm happy with the week again.

Q.   Nice to back up Doha? 
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, I felt tired earlier in the week but it's great to play well on the weekend.

Q.   So many similarities to last year the way the game is progressing? 
STEVE WEBSTER:   I finished fourth in Doha and seventh here and I finished fifth and fifth, something like that.   It's obviously two great weeks for me, I love Dubai, I love coming out here and I have a lot of friends here, and it's great to play well in front of them.

Q.   You're onto South Africa?
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
