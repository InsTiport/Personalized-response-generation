 Q.  How well are you playing? 
 STEVE WEBSTER:  Playing really first, first two rounds of 66 is great around here but you need to make a lot of birdies on this course.  It's set up for scoring and you have to take advantage that have. 

 Q.  Beneficial to play with your roommate? 
 STEVE WEBSTER:  Yeah, he's (Sam Walker) played great since he's got his card.  His confidence has gone up and we play a lot of practise rounds together and it's great we took our practise round form into a tournament.  It's good fun when you're making a lot of birdies. 

 Q.  Just chatting to him, he's actually said it's beneficial the fact that you're out with your family, you're getting on together, there's good camaraderie and you help each other relax. 
 STEVE WEBSTER:  Definitely, we're so relaxed on course, I don't even know there's tournament, you know what I mean, just a really nice feeling.  And we just played good golf. 
 So it's a pity I'm not paired with him on Saturday and Sunday. 

 Q.  You had that wonderful period of three Top-10s in a row, a little bit of a dip after, but it's come back again. 
 STEVE WEBSTER:  Yeah, I had five weeks off, my back wasn't good.  I was gutted I missed the tournament at The Belfry.  Came back and played great at the Dunhill.  Frustrating last round. 
 But I got my form back straightaway this week, so main goal is to get into the Volvo Masters. 

 Q.  And to play well here on an afternoon when the greens become a little trickier? 
 STEVE WEBSTER:  A little tricky but they are still rolling good.  It's strange some of them are quite firm and some of them spin back.  It's quite difficult to get it really close.  It's looking good.
