  STEVE WEBSTER:   I had a few chances again, missed one green in regulation, played really good, really happy with my swing.   Just a bit unlucky on the greens.   If it had been a little bit of luck, you know, I'd have fancied winning.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you were conscious of the scores right down to the wire?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, I needed a big finish to get in a playoff or to win it.   Frustrating, hit a lovely shot on 16, just went over into the back fringe, and a real bad lie.     It's sitting down in the rough.   Another two feet back and I've got a 15â€‘footer for eagle.   So that's a bit frustrating but a lot to build on.  
   
 Q.   A lovely finish all told.   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, it's great.   Really happy how I swung the club today.   When it really mattered today, I swung it good, which is great.
