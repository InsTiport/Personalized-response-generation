  Q. Fairly dramatic stuff on the front nine there, a hole-in-one followed by an eagle. Talk us through it.   
 STEVE WEBSTER: Well, got off to a slow start, bogeyed the first. Missed a short putt and I thought, well, might as well go for it, and then birdied the third and then on the fifth, hit a perfect 7-iron. I just said, be the one, hit the top of the ridge, rolled down and I heard the crowd roar and that was it.  
 The next hole, I had 113 yards, hit a great-looking shot, pitched past the pin, spun back and then heard the crowd roar again. I didn't actually see them go in. But it's one of those things, I'll probably never it do it again.  
  
  Q. What was the feeling like?  
 STEVE WEBSTER: It was strange, really, because I hit great shots but I didn't see the ball go in. I was waiting for the crowd to react. It was an amazing feeling.  
  
  Q. Have you had a hole-in-one?  
 STEVE WEBSTER: I had a hole-in-one at Wentworth 2005, last day, actually, on the 5th, and on the 5th this week, as well, so it's crazy.   
 Yeah, it's nice to hit good shots.   
  
  Q. Do you know what you get for it?  
 STEVE WEBSTER: Hopefully a brand new Ferrari for something. I think I'll get a bottle of champagne which is nice.  
  
  Q. A birdie on the last, the four shots you picked up on the front nine, were you thinking it would help with a Top-5 finish to get you into Turnberry?  
 STEVE WEBSTER: Well, I got to 9-under and then I dropped a few, played the 11th hole terrible. I hit a 6-iron and about a foot behind the ball and made a double there and made a great bogey at the next and birdied two of the last five, which was brilliant.   
  
  Q. A random day.   
 STEVE WEBSTER: It's one of them days. Couldn't put my finger on it, it was either brilliant or useless.
