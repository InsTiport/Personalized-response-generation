 Q. You made four birdies in a row from the 9Th. What sparked that run?
 STEVE WEBSTER: I made the putts. It was strange, actually. I made good par putts on 6, 7 and 8 and I thought maybe, you know this could be my day for putting. I birdied 9 from about six feet and birdied 10 from six feet and birdied 11 from off the green, and another nice putt on 12 and it just felt really good with the putter. 
 Don't happen very happen. But I've got a nice feeling this week. Putting like Seve. 

 Q. The last thing you wanted then was the hooter to go and be called off the course right on a great run of momentum; so what were you feeling then?
 STEVE WEBSTER: I was annoyed really because I've got a tricky shot on 13 over the water and I was in the rough and I thought with a big downpour, the ball could be buried when I get back. But I played a sensible shot for once to about 30 feet and just made my par. But it was a bit frustrating because I had just birdied the last four holes and I fancied another birdie.

 Q. Was the golf course much different when you got back out? 
 STEVE WEBSTER: The wind changed around. 18 played into the wind and 15, and 14, so it was a bit tricky, playing a bit longer but the greens were softer, so it was easy to throw the ball straight at the pin.

 Q. How do you feel about your position in the championship now?
 STEVE WEBSTER: Really good. If I can keep my putting like that, I can be dangerous, because I've always hit it good, steady tee-to-green, but I've lacked confidence with the putting. But I've just rolled it, you know, like the great Seve today and I just want to keep doing it.
