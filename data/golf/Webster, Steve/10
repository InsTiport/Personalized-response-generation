 Q.   Steve, a good round became a very good rounds with three birdies, tell us about your day?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, I was dead‑patient today.   Played the front nine well, 2‑under par, which is a good round here.   Made a good birdie on 10 and just obviously finished really strong.   Putted good, hit my irons good.   Drove it well.   Hit my wedges good.   So it's an all‑around good day.  
   
 Q.   Fabulous form for you so far this season.   You've had three top sevens in the first four starts.   What's behind it?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Don't know.   I'm just enjoying golf more.   I've been out here a long time and maybe I was too hard on myself.   Just really started to enjoy golf and just let the results take care of itself really.  
   
 Q.   Last season you left it late to get your card and this season you have it pretty much clocked up already; how much does that help you free‑wheel now?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   I went down to South Africa before Christmas, I had never been down there before, played Leopard Creek and obviously the Mandela tournament.   Played really well there and had a couple weeks off at Christmas so didn't feel like I had a long break.   
Normally I have five or six weeks off at Christmas and it's hard to come back out here and compete.   After two weeks off, did a bit of gym work and before I know it, straight back out here and just continuing my good form.
