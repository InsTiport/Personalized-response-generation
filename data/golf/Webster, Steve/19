   STEVE WEBSTER: Just a bit frustrating, I felt like I left four or five shots out there today, which is frustrating, but I'm proud how I stuck to my guns and played great, loved it. Just a bit frustrating.  
 And missed a short one on 17 from about five feet, and bogeyed 16, which is a bit frustrating. But bounced back with birdies, and, you know, I pat myself on the back this week.   
 I absolutely loved it. I was nearly 4-over par after 11 holes first day, and to finish in a fourth or third or whatever, I've got to pat myself on the back.   
  
  Q. Defending this year, and you wanted to do something for Seve as well, but I think he'll be pretty proud of you.   
 STEVE WEBSTER: Yeah, it was a good effort. I would have loved to have won it, and dedicated it to him.  
  
  Q. What is it about this place that brings out the best in you?  
 STEVE WEBSTER: I just see the shots a lot clearer I think. Just focused and I see the shots.   
 I thought I was going to shoot 64 to be honest and be 19 under, but a bit of a stalemate, none of them really got going, but that's golf.
