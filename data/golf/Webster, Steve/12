 Q. Five birdies and four bogeys; what's the verdict on that one?
 STEVE WEBSTER: Really good. Obviously disappointed with the bogeys -- I did okay-ish, but tee-to-green I was good again. Good score in these conditions.

 Q. You've been struggling with your ball-striking you said for about a year, went to work with Pete Cowen, how pleasing to produce good ball-striking on a day like this?
 STEVE WEBSTER: The first day, I could have been 9-under the first day. That's the best I've played for about a year. We just changed a few things. To break par on a day like this, it's just a nice reward really.

 Q. What about the change in mind-set, he gave you a bit of a talking to. 
 STEVE WEBSTER: Yeah, a bit of a roasting. I think I had about a five-hour lecture, but you know, I needed it. It was good. I don't mind that. I wasn't doing the right thing in my golf swing that I thought I was doing. We came up with what I should be doing, and it just feels good -- still hit a few silly shots but can actually attack the ball and get on top of the ball, which is what I've been lacking for about a year. 

 Q. Currently 156 in The Race to Dubai; is that in the back of your mind?
 STEVE WEBSTER: It's disappointing, I made the first six cuts this year, but then I missed the last four by a shot or two, which is frustrating. But you know, golf is a strange game. You have a good week and you get your confidence back. If I can knock a few more putts in, I can go low around here.

 Q. Fancy your chances then tomorrow?
 STEVE WEBSTER: Yeah, it would be good. It was a bit of a sad day, as well. It's my mom's birthday today, so I have to do her proud today. I have to dig in.
