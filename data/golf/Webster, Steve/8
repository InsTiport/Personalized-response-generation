  STEVE WEBSTER:   The weather is perfect so I think you've got to score low on days like this.   I'm swinging well and just made a couple of putts the last couple of days which is nice.  
You've got to hit it well off the tee; it's simple, you can't miss the fairways here, because if you hit the fairways, it sets up birdies.  
   
 Q.   When you start the day and it's such a congested leaderboard, are you fancying your chances?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   I didn't really think about it to be honest.   Just trying to do my own thing and play my own game and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   But the game is in good shape isn't it?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, really good.   Last week I played really well, as well, 24th, but just didn't make the putts.   
   
 Q.   Presumably you're just knocking on the door to a degree.   
STEVE WEBSTER:   It's about time.   I knocked on it a few times.   Yeah, looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Better show us your wrist?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   I've had three injections in it now.   It's bandaged up but it feels good at the moment.   So there's no worries.  
   
 Q.   One of those that deserves some rest or you're just playing through it?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   To be honest, I only play three weeks and have a week off, which is pretty good.   I don't overdo and I've not overdone the practice, either.   Had a good practice session Tuesday, Wednesday but haven't done too much since that.   Otherwise it aches too much and I start moaning.   
You know, you can't overdo it.   It's silly, if it hurts me, I can't perform.   So just got to take my time practicing.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts into Sunday?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Well, I thought to be JimÃ©nez around here, I guess, because he loves it around here.   Pretty much the same as today, hit fairways, hit the greens, make putts.
