Q.   8‑under par with three bogeys, I think you'd better explain yourself. 
STEVE WEBSTER:   I don't actually know myself.   Took me ten minutes to work my scorecard out in there.   Obviously played great, a couple of silly holes but hit a lot of great shots today and made the putts and felt really good.

Q.   3‑under par going into this third round, Saturday is known as moving day; what was your attitude teeing off? 
STEVE WEBSTER:   Talking to my dad, I thought, I have nothing to lose, so might as well go for everything, because it's no good finishing 40th in these competitions.   You have to try to get up in the mix, it's such a good field this week, test yourself, really.   Got the attitude, go low, doesn't really matter.

Q.   You played well last week, that's this form all about?   Where does it come from?
STEVE WEBSTER:   I got back with Pete Cowen in December, worked really hard in the gym over the Christmas period.   I just feel stronger over the ball and worked hard on my putting the last couple of weeks.   Changed my putter and the shaft, a little bit more feel for the head itself.   And I'm rolling the ball really good.

Q.   We don't know what the leaders are going to do, but how many behind can you be and have a realistic chance to win?
STEVE WEBSTER:   Like Pete has always said, if you get within three shots, nine holes to go‑‑ I just got back 7‑under, so had a bit of a crazy back nine, you're always in the mix.   So within three with nine holes to go is great.
