  STEVE WEBSTER:   Played lovely yesterday.   It was a shame I had to come off really.   Played really well, got into a good rhythm.   Then went back out there, hit a few real nice shots, and, you know, could I have been 10‑under really, but it's a nice start to the week.  
   
 Q.   Your caddie said it was a Turkey shoot yesterday; so many opportunities.   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, when the greens are soft and there's no wind, you know, everybody shoots low.   So it's nice to get off to a good start.  
   
 Q.   But much breezier this morning?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   Definitely.   15‑mile‑an‑hour wind, which is a couple of clubs.   
   
 Q.   Still I take it, it's very satisfying to have that score posted after one round?   
STEVE WEBSTER:   Yeah, it's about time I had a good first round.   It's difficult if you shoot par for 1‑under or 1‑over first day.   It's hard to come back from that, but it's a good start.  
   
 Q.   So what has made the difference?  
STEVE WEBSTER:   I don't know, I was really patient out there today.   I made a few putts.   My wedge play was great.   I got up‑and‑down from 100 yards five times on the spin, which is brilliant, a lot like Luke Donald I guess.   That was the difference.
