Q.   So what are your thoughts on a lovely third round like that?
STEVE WEBSTER:   It was great, real similar to the first round.   I really felt in control and gave myself a lot of chances and made a few nice putts, which is always good.   Tee‑to‑green, I was good today.

Q.   There for the taking, the course today?
STEVE WEBSTER:   I daresay there's a couple of 64s and 63.   When the greens are good and you're hitting fairways and hitting the greens, you've got to give yourself a lot of chances and that's why people are scoring low.
There's a lot of chances, front nine I turned in 3‑under but could have been six or seven, I suppose.   A bit unlucky on the last, lovely shot that hit the bank and went in the bunker and hit a nice bunker shot to five feet but missed the putt.   Yeah, a lot of good stuff today.
