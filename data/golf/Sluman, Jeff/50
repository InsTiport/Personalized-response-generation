Q.
Talk about your round.  You had a good round in the second round here.
JEFF SLUMAN:  I obviously like the golf course.  I made one birdie last week in 36 holes.  I birdied the first two holes yesterday, so I made twice as many birdies in two holes as I did in 36.  So I got off to a good start.

And then today, same thing.  The weather is just spectacular, and the golf course, there was no wind out there early and I don't imagine there's going to be much this afternoon looking up there.  The pins were accessible for the most part and the greens were perfect, and we made some putts, Mark and I.
Q.  9 , 10 under, it seems like a lot of people are going to be bunched up in that area?
JEFF SLUMAN:  Yeah, there's going to be quite a few up there.  I asked about the cut, and he's thinking 3, and it might even go to 4, so there's some low scores out there.  But you know what, I think people want to see good scores.  They don't want to see U.S. Open all the time.
Q.  Were you disappointed last week at the Western?
JEFF SLUMAN:  I was ecstatic that I missed the cut in front of hometown (laughter).  Man, what a question.
Q.  Well, coming here, because you play here a lot and do well here, does that help ease the pain, I guess?
JEFF SLUMAN:  Not really.  You want to do well in front of your hometown, and I'm uncomfortable on that golf course and very comfortable here.  Maybe I should move here (laughter).

It's just kind of one of those things.  I don't understand why I don't play well up there, but I'm not going to let it bother me and didn't this week.  I feel like I'm playing well, and that's really all you can do.
