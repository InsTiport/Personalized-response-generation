 Q.   Give me a little bit about how the round went today.   You had a lot of birdies out there.   
JEFF SLUMAN:   I finally made some birdies.   I made two the first two days.   
It's really no secret.   I hit it really close today and finally made some putts.   Didn't make any bombs or anything, but I just hit the ball very, very close all day.  
   
 Q.   Definitely.   Talk about the back nine.   You made some birdies, you had a little rough stretch there and what did it mean to come in on 18 and finish off strong?  
JEFF SLUMAN:   It meant a lot.   5‑under for the day going to 16, hit a perfect drive and only bad shot I hit all day.   I blocked an iron, maybe hit the wrong club, but anyways, missed a makeable 8‑footer.   
I really thought I hit a perfect shot on 17 that was just short of the green and in the muff there and I missed that.   
So you talk about an all time kind of downer, you don't want to finish any worse than that.   
But I hit a beautiful drive and an iron in there about 10 feet and made the putt.   
So it take as little sting away, but not everything on 16 and 17.  
   
 Q.   What do you look to do tomorrow?   You played like this, you give your self a chance, but do you change anything in your game?  
JEFF SLUMAN:   No, I kind of stick to kind of what I know I can do, don't try and do things I can't do.   
Maybe that's the biggest lesson I've learned in all the years of playing professional golf, not trying to do something you can't do.
