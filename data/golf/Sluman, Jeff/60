Q.
You always seem to come here and make the cut, a solid finish.
JEFF SLUMAN:  Well, I mean, I just like it here.  It's comfortable, it's close to home, and I've been coming since 83.  I see a lot of familiar faces and people pulling for you, and the golf course sets up well for me.
Q.  This course seems like it does.  It seems like you're always 3, 4-under.
JEFF SLUMAN:  Yeah, it would be a nice one to travel with (laughter).  I wish I could take it out every week on Tour.  You've got to hit a variety of shots, turn it both ways, you can hit it high, you can hit it low, and the 5s aren't 5s that the long, long guys dominate.  I can get home on 2, sometimes on 10 and certainly on 17.  So it makes a big difference.
Q.  I just asked Vijay if he's coming back.
JEFF SLUMAN:  You can pencil me in.  Vijay will be back, too.  He likes the golf course.
Q.  Can you get back to concentrating on golf this week since you're not obviously running a hotel for all your friends on Tour like you did last week?
JEFF SLUMAN:  Actually last week we didn't do anything.  Everybody stayed in a hotel.  We're in a rental house right now, so we didn't have any room for anybody, so it was a nice, relaxing week for everybody.
Q.  Davis said he couldn't get his motor home in the development you live in.
JEFF SLUMAN:  Yeah, we were banning those, so we put him over on the practice field at Cog Hill.
Q.  You said last week you were on the threshold.
JEFF SLUMAN:  Finishing 40 was the best I could do.  That was a bad question, don't you think?

I told you, I was starting to play good, I just needed to eliminate some mistakes.  I played well enough to potentially win the golf tournament, even today.  Two three-putts, missed a three footer for birdie on another hole.  Total it all up, and I had a chance, and that's all you can ask yourself.
