Q.   2-under for the day through 15.  Tell me how things are going and about the conditions.
JEFF SLUMAN: Well, I mean, looking how I started, I didn't start very well.  It was windy and I bogeyed 1 and bogeyed 3.  But had to kind of hold myself together and birdied 4, 6, 8, and 9 to get to 2-under for the day.  Hit some good solid shots.  I am doing what you had to do on a very difficult golf course with a lot of wind and just put the ball in the fairway and putting it on the green.  I have been doing it pretty good.  I made all pars on the back nine so far.

Q.   The conditions obviously got cooler in the afternoon.  Did the wind die down at all?
JEFF SLUMAN: Not really.  It's still blowing pretty good out there, I thought, and kind of one of those deals kind of hoping we might catch the same afternoon break that looked like the guys yesterday did.  Still it's blowing pretty good out there.

Q.   How are the conditions of the greens?
JEFF SLUMAN: It's soft out there.  Fairways are soft and of course the greens are.  I think with the cooler north wind the greens got a chance probably at some point tomorrow to kind of firm up and get them where they want, but they are still probably softer than  the tournament would like them to be.

Q.   Put any thought  -- obviously you have a couple three holes to play, does that cross your mind that you want to speed up and try to finish  -- I guess you weren't close enough, but...
JEFF SLUMAN: I was not really close enough.  My decision on the 18th tee, I would say 9 times out of 10 you are going to want to finish, but we didn't have that option.  So no sense of rushing.
