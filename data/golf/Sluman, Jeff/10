Q. 1-under today, made five birdies out there.  Just talk a little bit about how you played your game.JEFF SLUMAN: You know, it was a tough golf course.  And on a day like today, you're starting at 2:00 which we're not used to, and then you get an hour delay, makes killing the morning difficult.  Usually most of the time we're done by 3:00 or 4:00. But, you know, this is one heck of a golf course.  The wind was up, little shifty to start.  I just missed a couple of fairways, and seemed like every time I did that I paid the price.  That's what this golf course does to you. Tomorrow I have to be a little sharper, but overall I thought I played just fine.  You know, first round, wind, and all the commotion with the delay, and I wish I would have made the last two six-, eight-footers, but at the end of the day, 1-under par not so bad.Q. Tomorrow morning you go out a little bit earlier.  What do you have to do to...JEFF SLUMAN: You know, it's a long tournament.  You can lose a tournament tomorrow.  Really can't win it. Just stick to that game plan and try and hit quality shots.  Eventually if you keep doing it you get rewarded. There are birdie opportunities, but you've just got to get a good feel for the golf course, wind, direction.  You don't get up every hole and blast driver out here.  If you do that, you're probably going to be at OKC airport Friday sometime.
