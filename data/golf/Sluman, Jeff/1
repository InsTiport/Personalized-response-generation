 Q.  Tell us the story of your play today.  
JEFF SLUMAN: I obviously played well.  You can't -- in a U.S. Senior Open or a U.S. Open, of course you can't really dink it around there and shoot 3-under.  But it's such a wonderful venue.  I've heard zero complaints or criticisms about anything out there.   
One of my favorite Coore Crenshaw golf courses, and then you consider that it's a university public facility, it's absolutely amazing.  Very, very happy to be here.  And the university, everything that they've done so far is fantastic, and what a great experience to be here.   
 Q.  What stands out about the golf course that you like it so much?  
JEFF SLUMAN: You know, everything -- it looks like it's been here for 100 years, first of all.  Every hole, every shot, everything sits in there.  Most of us guys especially, Senior Open players, when you see a golf course, there's always a couple of -- you know, if I was here, I'd do this or I'd do that, and there's nothing like that out here.  Ben and Bill did such a terrific job that you just enjoy the shapes, the width in the fairways to create shots coming into the greens, but you have to be able to hit those type of shots.  You can play close to the ground, you can play it up in the air.  It's just a great test.   
 Q.  What else did you do well today?  
JEFF SLUMAN: I hit it in the fairway pretty good.  I had a couple of errant drives on the back nine.  We started on 1.  But you kind of get in that mode of USGA pars.  If you hit it in trouble, no hero shots.  Get it out there, give yourself a chance to make par, which is what I was fortunate enough to do, and that's really what you need to do.  It's not so much just making birdies, it's saving pars out here, and I was able to do that pretty well today.
