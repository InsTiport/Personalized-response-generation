 Q. 67, low round of the day. Talk about your round today. Especially playing it down. 
 JEFF SLUMAN: I must admit when I heard we were playing it down I thought it was a big mistake. And the golf course was playable. 
 We certainly all had a little bit of mud on it, but it wasn't the type of mud that I expected, so I was wrong and they were right. 

 Q. Obviously, was there one aspect of your game today that really kind of --
 JEFF SLUMAN: I finally made some putts. The first two days I hit the ball reasonably well and missed a ton of birdie opportunities. And I had two bad holes basically starting out the first nine holes I played, I made a back to back a double and a triple, which basically puts you out of the tournament. 
 So it was kind of a rough start, but I fought my way back and I'm happy to be where I'm at, really.
