Q.
Take us through your round a little bit.
JEFF SLUMAN:  I guess I played like my Seminoles on Saturday, not very good sometimes.

You know, I didn't play great obviously, but I made a big number on 6, first probably bad shot I hit in the whole tournament and got tangled up in the trees.  It was just pretty disappointing, but I've got one more day to go out there.  You can't really hang your head.

The year is over and I'll kind of wipe this one out of my mind.
Q.  This still is an open field on Sunday, don't you feel?
JEFF SLUMAN:  You've got the best player in the field leading, so realistically, you'd like his chances against guys giving him two, three, four shots.

But we'll go out and do the best we can and go home and get in my Halloween costume.
