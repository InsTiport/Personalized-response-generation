JEFF SLUMAN:  The wind came out of the same direction yesterday and today, so I think guys had a little bit more of a feel for the golf course.  This isn't the normal wind this time of year.  But still, it was extremely testing.  The greens this afternoon after being cut in the morning and then they cut them again in the afternoon. They  were significantly faster, so, that was quite a change from the first two days. 
Q.   (Inaudible)


JEFF SLUMAN:  I had a chance to really shoot a big one.  I managed to hang in there and kind of held everything together and made a couple putts when I needed to and got some two birdies on the back to finish even.  So all and all, I am very pleased where I am at.


Q.   (Inaudible)
JEFF SLUMAN:  I will let you know tomorrow, but absolutely, these guys are not scared.  They are great players.  I was watching Craig Perks warm up.  Gosh, he looks like Ernie Els swinging the golf club.  Carl went out and just played magnificently today.  There's no reason to think that they are not going to play well tomorrow.  I just  -- I mean, selfishly, I hope I go out and play real well, but in answer to your question, anybody that's in this field really can win this golf tournament. 
Q.   (Inaudible)


 JEFF SLUMAN:  I think you just go out and play and see how you start, see what kind of momentum you have, and what kind of feel you have for the golf course, and just kind of go from there.  I think you still have to take some aggressive shots when you have a short iron in your hand, even to some of the pins which are going to be obviously tucked tomorrow.
Q.   (Inaudible)
JEFF SLUMAN:  They were pretty tucked today, and will be tomorrow too.  My caddie, they putt the dots out for tomorrow's pins and of course, we see them and they are all on the edges of the greens it looked like, so they are going to make it very difficult and challenging tomorrow and the best man will definitely win. 


Q.   You want it to be difficult?


 JEFF SLUMAN:  Absolutely.  You don't want THE PLAYERS Championship on Sunday to be not necessarily a lay-up but you don't want  -- you want to test everybody's skill and nerve on Sunday and that's what is going to happen tomorrow.


Q.   (Inaudible)

 JEFF SLUMAN:  I am sure that they have thought about this a lot and they have hit balls an play out here for a number of years to get to this point, so I am sure they are going to say let's go out and enjoy it, and not be fearful of it, let's go out and execute like we have the first three days and see what happens.  I am sure that's what they are thinking. 
Q.   (Inaudible)
JEFF SLUMAN:  These greens are like I said, I think on Friday I said with this north wind and the cool and there's no humidity these greens can really dry out and get fast and they sure have.


Q.   (Inaudible)

 JEFF SLUMAN:  I can't really  worry about what is ahead or behind me or who is tied with me.  I have just got to go out and play the way I am capable of playing and let the chips fall as they may.
