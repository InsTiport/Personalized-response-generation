  Q. Halfway point. Really solid play out there tee to green. Maybe you left a little bit out there?  
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Yeah. I've been putting really good and then just finished terrible. Three-putted for par on 15. 16, hit a terrible putt. 17, just misread it from like six feet.   
 And then 18 I caught a mud ball, and I was lucky it didn't go in the water. That thing hooked about 15 yards and then cut back about 10. So whatever.  
  
  Q. Are you having trouble reading the greens in general or with the moisture on the greens, the greens are not breaking as much today? Does the putt always move towards the money as they say here in Vegas?  
 MICHAEL LETZIG: I don't know. No, I've been putting really good. I just didn't hit a very good putt on the last five holes.  
  
  Q. Well, you're 10 under with two to play. You're in a good spot. Get the putter rolling and go out there and shoot some good numbers.   
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Sounds good.  
  
  Q. Thank you.
