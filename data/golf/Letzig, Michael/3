 Q. 64 out there. Talk about the conditions, your general thoughts on the round. 
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Conditions are perfect. Beautiful day. Course is in great shape. I just putted good, made some good putts, kept the momentum. 
 Got off to an unbelievable start, 6-under through 7. Just fell asleep in the middle of the round. Played really sloppy. Missed a couple greens with wedges in my hand. Just kind of got mad at myself. 
 Had a great finish. Birdie, eagle saved the round.

 Q. How was your game coming into the week? 
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Ball striking has been really good the last three weeks, apart from the putting. I've been putting awful, just miserable. Got a putting lesson yesterday, got some good things to think about. Rolled the ball great. 

 Q. Talk a little bit about the fall series. Two events left. Guys fighting to keep their card. Is that in your mind at all out here?
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Yeah, it sucks. But you have to be here. I shouldn't say I have to be here. I've had such a rough year, I feel like I have to play now. 
 But, I don't know, still have a couple weeks to make a good year out of it.
