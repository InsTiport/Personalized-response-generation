 Q. Michael, solid 65 in the final round. You started off with three birdies on the front side. You just kept it going.
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Played very solid all day. I mean had a really good weekend. I played solid yesterday, just didn't make anything, and I think I only missed like three greens on the weekend but yeah, good start today.
 That's what I needed to happen, needed to get off to a good start on the first four, five holes and I kind of rolled it. Played really good. Messed up on the last hole, bad putt.

 Q. Everybody 3-putts from 60 feet.
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Yeah. Whatever. I mean the goal is to give myself another tournament to play and, you know, I'm in so see what happens.

 Q. That's what I was going to say, on Wednesday I interviewed you before the tournament. We were talking about the bubble thing. You've obviously been asked a lot of questions coming into the 125. It's got to be a weight off your back.
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Yeah. Been a long year, very difficult year for me. So start playing well here the last couple months is -- I see a very positive. If I can kind of roll with this momentum I can still make something out of this year.

 Q. A.W. Tillinghast golf course, beautiful Ridgewood up in Paramus, New Jersey, coming off a Donald Ross golf course, that's got to give you a lot of confidence.
 MICHAEL LETZIG: Ridgewood is a beautiful golf course. I played there a couple years ago when we were there. I love the tree-lined fairways and it's a beautiful golf course. I'm glad to get to go back there.

 Q. How much pressure were you feeling going into today, if any?
 MICHAEL LETZIG: I don't have any pressure. I got a lot of bad stuff going on at home so this is just kind of a relief to get out here and play golf. I'm glad to come out and play well, obviously keep the momentum going.
