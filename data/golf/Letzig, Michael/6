  Q. Michael, you entered this event on that bubble. Is there any added pressure in your mind?  
 MICHAEL LETZIG: No. My year has been a bit of a struggle. Trying to get into a rhythm. You know, I'm just trying to play well so I can get into another event to play next week, hopefully.   
 I've been playing a lot better the last month and a half. Not really watching the scoreboard. I know how it updates the points after every hole and you can see it. You can't worry about it. Just play golf.  
  
  Q. It's still in the back of your mind, I'm sure. Has it been so much of a distraction that it's taken away from the ultimate goal of winning this tournament?  
 MICHAEL LETZIG: No, because, you know, the FedEx is kind of the highlight of our year. It's The Playoffs. It's kind of like the way I view it is I played so poorly early in the year that that season is over. Now it's a new season.   
 The Playoffs, anything can happen. Like I said earlier, you know, you saw what Heath did last year when he just got in. I'm trying to think about that and play good and build some momentum.
