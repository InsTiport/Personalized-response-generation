Q. Obviously, today didn't go as you thought it would.
MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, I kind of hoped to get out and play, but you kind of knew how this day was going to go.  The toughest thing is every 15 minutes an update.  Why not just give us like, hey, we'll give you in an hour, you know.
Obviously, I thought the course was pretty good overall as far as I talked to some of the officials.  They said it was kind of holding up as far as the turf.  They thought they could still play down and all of that.
So there's a lot of water, I guess, in some areas.  This final decision may be a good one.  It's been a long day.  At least the food's good here.  I've eaten breakfast, I think, twice and lunch.  So won't have to worry about dinner too much tonight.
Q. So how did you kill your time?
MICHAEL ALLEN: I guess I got in here about 10:00 and had breakfast, and I had a cigar.  Then I had a little light -- some tuna.  Then I might have had another cigar.  And then I just had some lunch.  I was going to start getting ready, and now it's been called.
So overall, it's been a pretty good day.  I mean, it's a day I kind of like, you know.  I forego the cocktails today, so it was good.
