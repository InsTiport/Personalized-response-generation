  Q. Birdie putt at the last and 65 today, how did it differ from yesterday, a little more knowledge about the course?  
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, and I just didn't make as many mistakes today. I made a bad mistake on the par 5 on the back. I was right next to the green and chipped it instead of just putting it or rescue, so I wasted a shot there.   
 Overall I hung in there when it was a little bit tougher earlier in the day and it was really blowing. And then really making the turn, from 8 through whatever I started, I hit a nice close one on 8 and then 9. So I got things kind of rolling and made a nice putt on about the 12th hole.   
  
  Q. Your experience this week here at Sunningdale, was it what you thought it would be so far?   
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I played here when I used to play on The European Tour. We used to play The European Open here, so I knew it was a great golf course. One of the reasons I came over here really was because of the golf course and the area. I loved playing here. I used to live right near here, they used to be nice enough to let me hit balls in the field.   
  
  Q. Any highlight that kept your round going, anything you did?   
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I hit a great shot on 8. I hit it about three feet there with a 5-iron. And then really 11, I hit a nice shot to about a foot.   
 And then the next one was 12, I made about a 30-footer there only thing of substance I made until the last hole. Just hung in there.
