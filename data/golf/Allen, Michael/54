 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I was expecting more wind than there was out there. I hit some shots pretty good, but I came up short of the hole. I kind of struggled. I made two birdies in the last four holes and I hung in there. So.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I was out here on Media Day, that was obviously a month ago, but having the Champions Dinner and there's some interviews and I'm getting to know my way around here a little bit. It's been very nice so far.

 Q. What do you go work on today to get ready for tomorrow?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I have to go chip and putt just a little bit and make sure I can do that a little bit better. The wind is still going to blow. It's a long walk. So you got to take care of yourself and rest up. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 MICHAEL ALLEN: It was. It wasn't easy. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. They set the course up well of the but there's a lot of good shots out there. But, plus just generally the altitude. That's the biggest thing. That's the hardest thing I have seen so far.
