 Q.   Tied for second after the first round, only two strokes back, good first round for you, do you think?   
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Yeah, I played nicely.   I made a few mistakes.   I had a little easy 3‑putt‑‑ I threw a few shots away but overall I played nicely.   Off to a good start.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward tomorrow?   They are talking about weather Sunday, but do you think tomorrow is the day to make some moves?   
MICHAEL ALLEN:   It always is.   Fred is playing awfully well.   He's not making any mistakes.   I have to eliminate some of my mistakes for sure and hopefully I can keep making a few putts and get a little closer.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel the course is playing differently, a lot differently than last year, or how does it feel?  
MICHAEL ALLEN:   I think this year the course seems to be a little wetter.   The fairway is a little wetter and stuff.   The ball is not running quite as well.   It's not getting‑‑ so it's playing a little bit longer overall but the greens are obviously perfect, the whole course is manicured beautifully, so it's really just a matter of getting the ball‑‑ keeping the ball out of the bunkers off the tee and getting aggressive on the next shots.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel pretty good about your swing so far today?   Do you feel comfortable out there?  
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Overall I think I'm pretty some overall pretty solid, quality shots.   Not quite a hundred percent, but, you know, I'm close.
