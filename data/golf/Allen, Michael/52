 Q. You had three birdies today, you bogeyed the last hole, how are you feeling?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Once again a little let down, you know, but I'm playing all right, I'm just not making any birdies right now. So hopefully I can have one good day. It's going to take a good day now, but so I still got a chance. I'm still in there.

 Q. Last day as defending champ, what are you going to do tomorrow hopefully to hold on to that title?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I need to make at least eight birdies, I know that. So, I'm still champ for another day and hopefully I can hang in there, so we'll see.

 Q. Have you enjoyed this last year?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, it's been fun. It's been a nice week. It's been a nice week. It's been a nice year. A little more recognition than normal and it's been fun. It's been nice having people call me defending champ.
