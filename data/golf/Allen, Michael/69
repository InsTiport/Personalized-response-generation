 Q.  You've been around the block a couple of times, maybe you can answer this question.  Why is it so hard to follow a really low round with another really low round? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  You know, I don't really know.  I felt good today for the most part, but you know, I just made a lot of mistakes today.  And so, you know, that's a good point, I don't know.  I need to shoot more low rounds and I'll get more evidence for you. 

 Q.  You got off to a good start, had things going pretty well, you were never in any really big trouble. 
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Just these greens sneak up on you.  You get downgrain and they get so fast, just don't expect it.  I made a couple bad putts like that and lost a little confidence with it. 
 It's a tricky golf course, and you know, I know I can do better. 

 Q.  The good news is, nobody else is going to run-off and hide and you'll be in good position for the weekend. 
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  I'm in good position no matter what happens this afternoon.  I would loved to have kept it going today but c'est la vie. 

 Q.  How much fun are you having with the whole neighborhood supporting you? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Yeah, I kind of lost them today.  They were a lot of fun yesterday.  Today I quieted them down a little bit.  Some guys were getting a little -- 

 Q.  Maybe some of those guys went to work. 
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Maybe, maybe they just couldn't make it up this morning, either.  That's just as good a chance.
