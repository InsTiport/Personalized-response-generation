 Q. First off, just some thoughts about today, how your play is and anything you can share with us? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Oh, I was in position to score off the tee, and I just wasn't hitting any good irons. I was just two-putting from 30 feet all day. Just wasn't very good.

 Q. Any adjustments you think you might have to make going into tomorrow? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, I've got to start hitting the ball with my irons a little better. I'm in position off the tee for the most part, just got to hit some better shots maybe a little closer. 
 I'm not very good at making 30-footers. If I can get out and play good on the front nine tomorrow, I'll have a chance.

 Q. As far as the game, is it physical, mental, little bit of both? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, I don't know. I felt really good teeing off the first hole and just hit a terrible shot. So I was nervous for that. Other than that, I was really comfortable out there playing, I just didn't quite play that well today.

 Q. Any other thoughts or anything you would like to share? 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I think this is a wonderful place, a pretty place for the senior tournament here. It's been a really enjoyable course to play all week.
