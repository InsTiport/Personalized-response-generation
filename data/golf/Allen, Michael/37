  Q. This is a place that celebrates kids, but also the kids at heart, right? Nice day today.   
 MICHAEL ALLEN: All those kids have parents, you know. That's me, yeah. My kids are old enough now they don't even want to come that much anymore. They actually love it, but with school now, high school and all that.   
  
  Q. How much time did you spend at the parks? We'll talk about your round in a second. You going park hopping a little bit?  
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I'm not this year. I've given all my tickets away. I thought people were happy to see me. They just wanted tickets.   
 No, we've done it for so many years. Love going to the parks here. Great time.  
  
  Q. On the golf course today, 66. You guys play good golf on that tour and you keep coming down here and taking it away from the kids, huh?   
 MICHAEL ALLEN: It's been fun. Nice thing out there is when you play well you have a chance to compete and have a chance to win. So that in itself is a lot of fun.   
 You know, we're not dead yet. We can still play. A lot of good players out there still, so it's been fun. It keeps you playing all the time, and it's a great time out there.  
  
  Q. Anything key to your round? Your caddie said, Ah, we just took advantage of opportunities we had and didn't make too many big mistakes, and added up to 66.   
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, I mean, really I'm not doing anything phenomenal driving the ball well and I've been putting pretty well the last couple weeks. That's really coming around, so I'm getting a lot of confidence.   
 I'm not really making a lot putts, but I'm not missing ones I should be making. Made a six-footer or two over the last few days to save some pars.  
  
  Q. That one off the back edge on 18 was pretty sweet.  
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Good way to end of day for sure.
