Q.   (Inaudible.)
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Probably.   That was amazing.   I mean, it's been the whole week, I get under par and start doing something decent and then I turn around and give them back.   Very frustrating.

Q.   Do you look back at where you are and think about where you could be?
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Yeah, because I had two doubles early, fought back, got it a few under par, and then just kind of hit it a little right there and the wind got it and blew it out of bounds.   But that was kind of a real blow to the gut there.   That was a tough one to swallow. 

Q.   How do you assess how you played this week?   Terribly disappointed?
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Well, I'm sure not happy.   I come here, I want to be competing for the title.   I want to have a chance to win.   That's why I'm here. 
I'm here because it's fun, I love competing, but I'm here to try to win this golf tournament, because that's what's really a lot of fun. 
So this has been a very frustrating week.   I did a lot of good things, but I'm not doing everything well, obviously. 

Q.   It's a wet golf course, does that tend to probably put a little more space between you and people above you. 
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Yeah, and the course has held up pretty well with the rain overall.   I've really been surprised.   Especially Thursday, it actually has played pretty dry.   But this rain I don't think is going to hurt the course too much.   I don't think they will get too many mud balls.
