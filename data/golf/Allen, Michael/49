 Q. How do you like your standing?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I don't really know exactly what it is, but there aren't many guys in red. I'm in good shape. I would have liked to have parred the last hole. You hate giving away shots out here, they're so hard to pick up.

 Q. Every one you get, you give away somewhere. 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Today I certainly did. Yesterday I played nice. The only bogey I had was one I got on myself. 
 Today I made five bogeys, I was lucky to make four birdies. It's a little up and down. It's easy to lose shots out here pretty easy.

 Q. The day got mixed up some with the late start?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: That always happens to me, too. Whenever I've got a lot of time, I'm always late. I was sitting around doing nothing, and all of a sudden "You've got to go." I always am late when I have a late tee time.

 Q. The pin positions, you were critical yesterday. 
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I wasn't really critical. But today there were certainly a lot more to be able to get after a little bit. There were still -- obviously all the pins are pretty darn good. But today they were not quite as unreachable, some of them. There were four or five yesterday I couldn't get a ball within 20 feet, really. Today there weren't many of them. Maybe only one or two.
