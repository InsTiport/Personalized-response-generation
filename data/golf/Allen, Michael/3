 Q.  So what was going well for you today?  What were you battling with?  How did the course play for you?  
MICHAEL ALLEN: I think the first, certainly, nine holes, I just hit the ball beautifully, right where I was trying to, right distance.  I was always in there.   
My knee started hurting on 5.  I kind of hit a bad one there, but then it was -- hit a bad chip.  That was the only green I kind of missed there.  So I made a bogey.   
But other than that, I played nice.  I hung in there.  I'm kind of making some decent short putts, and you got to keep making those out here.  I hit a lot of five-footers.   
 Q.  How did the wind affect you today at all?  Was it different compared to -- obviously, the last two days, it hasn't been quite as bad.  Today's a little bit worse.  Does that play a role?  
MICHAEL ALLEN: The wind was really tough.  As I told Billy there, like 15, it was just so downwind, hit a beautiful shot.  Still able to make par, but just off the green.  I thought it was a great shot, had a good chance at birdie, but bounced over.   
Then 18, I couldn't have hit two better shots.  The wind died on me, and then it goes over the back of the green.   
 Q.  I saw that.  
MICHAEL ALLEN: So you know, I mean, I just stand there and you got 200, just over 200 into the wind, and then it dies.  So, you know, it's one of those things.  It's golf.  It's tough.
