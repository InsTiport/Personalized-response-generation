THE MODERATOR: Michael Allen, plus 1 today, 1 under for the Championship.
Q. Your 71 this afternoon, one of the lower rounds.  I think we only had one under par round this afternoon.
MICHAEL ALLEN: Really?  Wow.
Q. Take us through the round.
MICHAEL ALLEN: I think from the start, the wind was -- a lot of wind out there.  The greens seemed to be firm, and the fairways are certainly firming up a lot.  Yesterday, the greens were absolutely as smooth and perfect as they could get.  Today, with everybody walking on them, they don't look as pretty as they did yesterday.
But overall, it's kind of a tough day.  The greens, as I said, things a little firmer, hard to get at some things, and the pins are a lot tougher.  So overall, the course played a lot tougher today.
Q. You led the field with 21 putts yesterday in your first round.  What goes into that, and maybe how did you transfer that with what the greens did give you today?
MICHAEL ALLEN: I don't think I putted quite as well.  However, I did take advantage of a few opportunities.  Yesterday, I just, as I said, I just really didn't hit the ball very well.  But I left myself in front of the greens, so I was kind of chipping up and making three and four footers.
Today, I did miss a couple early in the day, but overall, my putting's been kind of a strength so far.  I'm driving the ball a little bit better, so hitting a few more greens.
Q. Plan of attack going into the weekend.  Looks like we've got some weather going.  You're one of seven guys under par with a chance this weekend?
MICHAEL ALLEN: That's always good news.  That's kind of where you want to be at this point.  It's more fun to be leading.  But in the end, I mean, that's what we want.  We want to get in a position where we can be in striking distance, shoot 2 or 3 under a couple days.  I think you've got a good chance to win.
