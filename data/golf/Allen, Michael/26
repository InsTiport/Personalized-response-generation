Q.   You got to be feeling pretty good about the weekend.   Take me through this last round and your thoughts on it. 
MICHAEL ALLEN:   I was just trying to see if I could get out there and really get going.   We knew the course was kind of set up a little easier today.   Obviously good weather.   So trying to get aggressive and get going early and I just wasn't able to. 
Not that I think I could have caught him anyhow, but there's obviously a lot of good scores today.   There was a lot of birdies out there today, the course is playing really nice, and I wasn't the guy that was able to make them all. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on the tournament overall?
MICHAEL ALLEN:   Well personally I love the golf course.   I think it was great, it was fun.   Obviously the first day when you get winds that strong it's pretty tough.   But if the wind had been like they were the second and third day I think it's really a challenge and a lot of fun.   So I didn't mind it at all.   I thought it was a great, a good golf course. 
I wish they could fix that 17th green, just flatten that out a little bit.   That's the only one that I thought was a little tough. 
And I think the practice putting green needs to be blown up and redone.   If you have putts this extreme and you can't hit a 30 foot putt on that green.   So that would be my biggest criticism of the whole place would be to get a new practice putting green.   Because the rest of the facilities are fantastic, the range, the chipping area, everything is great. 

Q.   Will we see new 2014?
MICHAEL ALLEN:   I will definitely be back.
