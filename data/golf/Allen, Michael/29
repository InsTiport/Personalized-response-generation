 Q.   Talk about how the course played today out there.   
MICHAEL ALLEN:   For me it was awfully tough.   I hit some good shots, but I didn't even find the green, I was still chipping.   
I hit some bad shots that weren't very good and I didn't putt very well.   So the course was very difficult, the winds were difficult, I was always ‑‑ it was out of the south, the winds were a little east, a little west, it was a very tough day and I just didn't play very well.  
   
 Q.   What's your approach when the wind fluctuates that much?  
MICHAEL ALLEN:   I try to play more towards the middle and play safe when I hit it.   And when it's blowing that hard it's really hard to putt too.   And I'm not seeing the lines very well, so it was a tough day all around.   
   
 Q.   Looking into tomorrow, what's kind of your focus?   What are you looking to get done?  
MICHAEL ALLEN:   If I can chip away and get close to the leader and get closer to par, you got to go low tomorrow, get back to par and maybe have a chance.
