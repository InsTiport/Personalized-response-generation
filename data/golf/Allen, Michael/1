THE MODERATOR: Michael Allen shot a 2 under, 68 today and is even for the Championship.   
 Q.  Eagle at 11.  
MICHAEL ALLEN: Oh, I hit a great driver.  It was 268 to the front and back like 32 or something like that.  It was just a perfect driver for me.  I hit it to about eight, ten feet to the left and knocked it in.  And first kind of good putt I'd hit all day.  I really hadn't putted really well.   
 Q.  When that went in the hole, were you saying, hey, I got a chance here?  
MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, definitely, because at that point there were only two guys under par, I think they were 2 and 3.  Then I hit two great shots on 11 and -- or 12.  And just off the green in that rough against me, I hit a bad chip and kind of lost the momentum.  I felt like really, that's what me and Pete were talking about on 18.  If I could have made that, at least got it up and down, I had a good chance to kind of get going.  I kind of lost momentum.   
A couple holes, I just kind of lost myself, and it was over.   
 Q.  I know you had to wait a long time, but was it fun today, once you finally got out there?  
MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, it's always fun.  It's always fun competing in the Open, and this is always great.  It was a long time.  I mean, I would have felt a lot better playing tomorrow.  I kind of struggled.  I actually hit the ball great all the front nine, but I kind of felt like I was struggling with my body and everything wasn't quite working.
