  Q.  68 today, nice round in this wind.   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Yeah, I played nicely all day.  I played 17 good holes.   
  
  Q.  I know you made that bogey on 18, everybody hates finishing like that, but overall, you've got to be pretty happy with the way you're hitting it.   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Yeah, I'm doing everything pretty well.  I'm driving the ball nicely, hitting good, solid irons and holing some of the putts I should be holing.  So overall it's been a nice week.   
  
  Q.  How good are these greens out here?   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  They are beautiful.  If anything they are a hair too soft because the ball is spinning too much.  Other than that, they are beautiful, nice speed.  The whole golf course is in beautiful condition, the whole thing.   
  
  Q.  12-under, you've got to be happy with your position going into tomorrow?   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  Yeah, I am.  That's all I really wanted the end of the week, a few shots back and got a chance.  It's a nice change to be in the hunt, it's nice.  (Chuckling).   
  
  Q.  Now you see your name up there on the leaderboard, and, "Hey, that's me."   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  I haven't even looked, is it up there?   
  
  Q.  It was!   
 MICHAEL ALLEN:  I don't know what it looks like, I guess.  (Laughing)
