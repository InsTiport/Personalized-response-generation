 Q. What was the difference between how you performed last year at this event and this year?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: I just putted so horribly this year, I had seven or eight 3-putts and I never made a -- I never got it going with my putter. I couldn't make any birdies. If you can't make them from six feet, you really got no chance out here. And that's kind of the story of this week. 
 I played pretty well tee to green, but I just was awful with the putter. 

 Q. As the defending champion do you feel any extra pressure on you this weekend or was it a little bit more targeted?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: No, once the tournament got going it was just fun playing. It was nice when they called my name as the defending champion, but, so it's been a nice week for me. 
 But once the tournament started going it was nice. 

 Q. So overall do you feel it was a good experience this weekend?
 MICHAEL ALLEN: Yeah, it's always nice. And it's always a nice job. It's just golf. It's frustrating and it pisses me off a lot. But overall it's just a game and I have enjoyed playing it.
