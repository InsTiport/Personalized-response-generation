Q. You must be pleased with that round, 7-under and bogey-free around Kingsbarns?
TAPIO PULKKANEN: Yeah, very solid round. I think I only needed to save par for once, so pretty much good ball-striking. Had a lot of birdie chances. With a hot putter, it could have been a really low one today but really happy with the start.
Q. So you feel like you left a few out there and you could have gone lower?
TAPIO PULKKANEN: Yeah, I had plenty of chances. I think there could have been five more with a super-hot putter, but it was good.
Q. What do you take from today's round? You said ball-striking was good, but how do you then shift from Kingsbarns to then going to St. Andrews, and what do you look at for that next round of golf?
TAPIO PULKKANEN: I think St. Andrews was a little bit firmer when I played there on Monday. So it's a little bit different surface. So have to go to the range there and see how it works. I think it's a little bit similar game plan in St. Andrews. A lot of drives. I think you should make many birdie chances, so it should be a good round tomorrow.
Q. And what do you think, as well, how much have you enjoyed the format this week? It's a bit more relaxed, and having the amateurs, as well, on your team, what have you enjoyed about that?
TAPIO PULKKANEN: Yeah, I played really well last year. I finished fourth last year, so I have good memories from last year. I think it makes me -- I've always been a little bit like a team player, so I want to play for the team a little bit and that makes me maybe relaxed more.
Yeah, I think it's a good format.
