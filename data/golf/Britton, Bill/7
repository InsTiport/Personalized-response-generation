  Q. How do you think the tournament went overall?  
 BILL BRITTON: The other players or myself?   
  
  Q. For you.   
 BILL BRITTON: I didn't play very good. I'm disappointed in how I played. But it's great to be here, it's great to play with all the guys I played with. They're all really good guys, gentlemen, and they're good golfers. So it's a pleasure to play with them.   
 And I really enjoyed the golf course and the tournament. Just wasn't nuts about the way I played. Although I played pretty good part of the round today.
