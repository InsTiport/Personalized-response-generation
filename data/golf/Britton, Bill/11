  Q. So you start out with 75 and you've gone even par two straight days. That's got to make you feel good going into the final day.   
 BILL BRITTON: Yes, the first day I didn't play very good and yesterday I played very good, I thought.   
 I don't know, today I didn't feel like I played near as good as yesterday, yet I shot the same score. But I have played very good these last two days, so I feel very good about that.   
  
  Q. Going into tomorrow, obviously you want to play your best and place as high as you can. Does the idea of repeating as low club professional, does that ever enter your mind or is it just kind of play your best and see where you end up?  
 BILL BRITTON: Really just play my best and see where I end up. It was a very nice distinction last year, the PGA really promotes that, which is very nice, but I would just like to play my best and finish as high as I can.   
  
  Q. Do you think that you will -- you may have just answered this question -- but will you be aware of how the nine other club professionals in the field are doing before you go out tomorrow?  
 BILL BRITTON: No. I'm not aware of those guys. I hope we all play our best and do our best. And hopefully creep up that leaderboard a little bit.
