Q. Talk about your round today, the low club pro right now.  What would that mean to you if you walked away from here after the weekend as the low club pro?
BILL BRITTON: Well, it would be a thrill.  I'm very happy to be here and very happy to play.  If you end up being the low club pro it's really neat because they make a little bit of a fuss over you.  So that would be great.
Q. Talk about some of the conditions today.  I know it's probably not what you were preparing for all week.
BILL BRITTON: No, it was a surprise because I got here on Sunday and the course was perfect.  Really firm, everything was firm, same consistency.  Obviously -- then it got a little softer.  It wasn't soft, but it got a little softer.  Kind of that last couple days or whatever rain we had kind of took the edge off.  But then today was different.  It was a little sloppy on the fairways.  And then the ball wasn't bouncing like it had been.  But it turned out fine.  I didn't think we were going to start as early as we did, but it turned out good.  Hopefully everybody gets in.
Q. Finish with a birdie.  You finished on 18?
BILL BRITTON: I did.  I birdied 18, which is nice.
Q. What does that do for you going into tomorrow?
BILL BRITTON: Well I bogeyed 17, so that didn't feel very good, because I had played good all day.  I played good.  Any time you make a bogeys it's disappointing, but it's always really nice to make a, finish with a birdie.
