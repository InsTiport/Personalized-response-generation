  Q. What was your general thoughts on the round today?  
 BILL BRITTON: Well, I didn't play real good, but I got off to a bad start. I was struggling through seven holes. I think I was 4-over. I'm playing pretty good, I guess. I hit a bad shot at number 4 which really cost me. The second shot.   
 I kind of played the wrong shot at number 7, the par-5. I made a bogey there.   
 Then I played pretty good the rest of the way. So I was mediocre.  
  
  Q. You were even on the back nine. So what did you do to change that?  
 BILL BRITTON: No, I just kept playing golf. I 3-putted 11 for a bogey, which is pretty bad, because I wasn't that far away.   
 Then I birdied 16, which is a reachable par-5. I hit two good shots and made birdie.   
 But I played back here -- I made a nice couple up-and-downs, but that was pretty much it.  
  
  Q. How is the altitude and the weather and everything affecting your game today?  
 BILL BRITTON: The altitude, I just take 10 percent off. My caddie's been a great help in that respect. Plus playing at the altitude, I would say it's had zero affect.   
 I was a little light headed out there on the back nine and I was a little surprised, because I drank a ton last night and today and I ate all the way around, but I was just a little light headed.  
  
  Q. What do you think you're going to try to do a little better starting tomorrow?  
 BILL BRITTON: Well, I'm not going to try and do anything different. Just try and keep doing my best. Don't do anything to screw it up.
