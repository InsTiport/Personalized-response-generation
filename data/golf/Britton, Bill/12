 Q. How did things feel out there? Talk about your round. Was the course playing tough, easy? How are things going? 
 BILL BRITTON: Well, the course is tough, although I don't think that -- I think it's very playable. I don't think as near as difficult as what we had last year. It's a tough course, if you hit a bad shot you're going to pay for it. So I think it's playing great. The greens are very difficult. You have to putt well and hit the ball in the right spots. 

 Q. What do you think was your best club, your best -- short game, driver, middle irons or what benefited you today?
 BILL BRITTON: I didn't play very good. The thing I did do is I made a bunch of short putts to keep myself in there. But I played pretty lousy. I played the first two holes pretty well and after that I just stunk it up the rest of the day.
