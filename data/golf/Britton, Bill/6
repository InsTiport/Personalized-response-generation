  Q. I think you were the low pro at Oak Hill and the conditions there were pretty tough. How do those conditions compare with conditions here this week?  
 BILL BRITTON: I think it was much tougher there. Obviously the weather, the wetness here makes it less enjoyable, but I think that golf course played a lot tougher. The winning score I think was over par there. And already it's like 7-under here.   
 So the soft conditions here I think make this course a little easier. It's playing longer, obviously, but the ball's just about plugging in the fairway, so it's easier to drive it in the fairway. And then the greens are beautiful. So the course is in great condition.   
  
  Q. Just talk about your experience so far here. An even par round today, you're right on the cut line. How would you rate your experience so far?  
 BILL BRITTON: Well it's been -- I've had a great time and I shot 73 this afternoon or today. 76 yesterday. So I've had a great time, I've seen a lot of people that I've known for a long time, so it's great to see everybody, it's great to play golf, my son's caddying for me, you know everything's been great.   
 The weather hasn't been that good and I didn't play that well, I played very well for awhile today, but I made a triple and a double, so I stunk is up a little bit.
