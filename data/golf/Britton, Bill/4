 Q.   What was the secret today?  
BILL BRITTON:   I don't think there was a secret.   I played good.   I started off with pars‑‑ I hit a bunch of good shots.   
And then I didn't hit a very good 5‑iron on the 14th hole into the bunker and made bogey.   
Fortunately, I birdied the next hole.   They had the tees up and it was a par‑5, and so I got a lucky bounce and stayed on the fringe of the green and made a birdie.   
And then I bogeyed 18.   Bad drive.   You don't want the details, do you?   
I played good.   I finished good.   I birdied 7 and 8 coming in.  
   
 Q.   And that also came after a stretch I think you went bogey, bogey, par, birdie, birdie, something like that?  
BILL BRITTON:   Yeah, I birdied 3, which helped me a lot, because I was, I think I was 1‑over at the time, maybe 2.   
And then I 3‑putted 4.   
And I 3‑putted 6.   
And then 7 I really, I hit a lousy shot, but I also got a great bounce off the side of a hill and it rolled about a couple of feet away.   
And then I hit a good shot into 8 and made birdie.  
   
 Q.   Did the course play much different from yesterday?  
BILL BRITTON:   Yeah, it wasn't easy, but it was much easier than yesterday, I thought.  
   
 Q.   And the greens?  
BILL BRITTON:   The greens are perfect.   Beautiful condition.
