 Q. Can you just talk about your round today. Any comments on your round?
 BILL BRITTON: You're getting me on a bad day. I didn't play very good. I got off to a bad start, I played very bad through 12 holes, and I played okay after that. But it was a tough day. The conditions were great, it was the easiest day of the week so far. It's beautiful, hardly any wind, but I just played lousy.

 Q. Can you talk about the psychology behind, after the end of your round yesterday and not being sure whether or not you would be back here today. 
 BILL BRITTON: Yeah, of course you have absolutely no control over that, so -- and the play was ending late, pretty close to 8 o'clock, and I knew I wouldn't know. So I sort of prepared, practiced and prepared as though I was going to play and then was happy to find out that I did have the opportunity to play.
