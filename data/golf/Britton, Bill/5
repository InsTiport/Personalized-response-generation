Q.   10 has been one of the harder holes for players today.   You managed to birdie it.   What was going on at 10?
BILL BRITTON:   Well, it's easier than it played in the practice rounds.   It's straight down wind. 
So I hit a good drive and the pin was kind of up on that top left.   So I hit a good 3‑wood left, there's a fairway over there, and I had a tough pitch, but I hit a really good pitch about two feet away.

Q.   Then you went back to back with birdies out there on those holes.   How did you use that?
BILL BRITTON:   Well, a little lucky on 11.   11 was a tough shot and I was kind of between clubs.   And I tried to hit a soft fading 9‑iron and it turned out really good.   The pin was up front, it's easier to get it running down that hill and it stayed up top and I made maybe about a 10‑footer. 

Q.   What's the plan going into tomorrow?   Any thoughts, any changes, adjustments you'll make between today and tomorrow?
BILL BRITTON:   It's 8 o'clock at night, it's too late to do anything.   But I played good.   I screwed up a little bit, I hit a couple wrong clubs and then I misjudged shots, but I mean it was more that sort of error and some putting errors than anything else. 
But I think that I'm sure that everybody feels like they wish they had a couple back, as do I, but I played good overall.
