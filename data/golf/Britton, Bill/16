 Q.  How did it go? 
 BILL BRITTON:  Pretty good. 

 Q.  Tell us about how the wind and everything and the fact that it wasn't as bad today and how the course played today? 
 BILL BRITTON:  I thought the course played easier today than any of the other three days for me.  The first day was definitely the toughest, yesterday it was easier.  Today it's easier.  Although it's starting to pick up now.  It seems to me this direction, to me, is the easiest wind. 
 And we got off early, so it picked up as the day went on, but we went a good ten holes without a whole lot of wind and it's still not too -- it's picking up a little bit now. 

 Q.  You had a lot of birdies or a couple birdies, probably three or four birdies today? 
 BILL BRITTON:  Three, I think. 

 Q.  How did you do like just tell us about those holes? 
 BILL BRITTON:  I birdied seven, a par-5.  I hit it in the green side bunker and came out about 10 feet and made it. 
 Then I birdied the other par-5, 11, hit it just over that green, chipped it close. 
 And then I birdied 13.  Hit a wedge in there about 10 feet and made that. 

 Q.  How was 17 and 18 for you today? 
 BILL BRITTON:  I bogeyed 17.  Parred 18.  But 17 is not too bad today.  Pin's up, which brings the water a little bit more into play but still a short enough shot where it's not too bad.  And 18 played pretty good but I hit a 4-iron in there, but guys could be hitting less in there than I am.
