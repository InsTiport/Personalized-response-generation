 Q.  Kiradech, that was one hell of a match out there.  You guys pushed it really hard.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'm hitting a lot of good short irons, striking the ball great.  Just can't hole the putt on the front nine.  Even the short putt on 12, 13, something like that, I made about three or four holes inside ten feet.  It's not good enough.  Lower than my normal stat putts.  But the way me and S.S.P. playing, not bad golf, but Europe team performed well.   
 Q.  You guys have shown that you can do a comeback and I'm sure you're confident about tomorrow's foursomes.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, of course.  If you look back the last two years, we have no scores at the first match.  But today we got 1 1/2.  It's not that bad.  I mean, just three points behind, and still a lot of points to go.
