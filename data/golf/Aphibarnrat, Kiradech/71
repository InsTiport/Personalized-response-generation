Q.   How good was that? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:     Good start today again.   Was making like seven birdies, made a lot of putts.   The big mistake on the fourth hole was I hit a poor seven, made doubles, and bad lie on 15.   But I'm still happy with the way I started.

Q.   And it does show just how well you're striking the ball and how well you're scoring given chances?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:     Yeah, I think I have a lot of chance to finish high this week, because just have a lot of confidence from last week and the way I'm striking the ball is quite well right now.

Q.   How does this course compare to last week?   Is this one that still suits you? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, the golf course will suit for the long hitter and quite consistent.   I hit driver quite well right now, so that gives me a lot of chaps to hit my second shot.   That's why I can't make the score.
