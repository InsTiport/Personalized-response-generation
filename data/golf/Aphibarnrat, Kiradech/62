Q.   Thoughts on a good week to finish so prominently on that leaderboard? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, first event of The European Tour, and I've been playing quite well the last couple months and my target was top five this week.   I just the made the star get.

Q.   Looked like every day you got off to marvelous starts, so it could have been even better. 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yes, I was starting well the first four days, and a couple shot on the back‑‑ today was a good start again, 4‑under on the front and just make double on 10.   But anyway, finished 4‑under for the round, was so proud of myself. 

Q.   You say the start of a European Tour season, but end of the year, still a busy year, you have Thailand next week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, I've still got one more week for the Thailand Golf Championship in our country.   Just try to perform well in front of my family, and play the last event best as I can. 

Q.   To go in with this kind of form, you must think that you're playing well?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, it is.   I've been striking the ball so good since the last couple weeks.   Just look forward to playing well, and next week will be a top field, many world star players coming, and try to show them how Asian players can play with them.
