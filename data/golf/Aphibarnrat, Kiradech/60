Q.   I talked to your guy over there, he said you're to go the play next week in Texas.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah.   I'm playing next week for sure.   I'm getting my Top-10 this week.

Q.   Now, I mean just kind of talk about, you know, finishing Top-10 maybe even Top-5.   Is this kind of more than you kind of dreamed about, you know, at the start of the week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah.   I'm playing -- I don't have any status on PGA TOUR.   Just want to go out and enjoy my games and enjoy the golf course for four rounds.   I've done so well today.   I have so many putts and the big eagle on 16 making golf much easier.   Still, really tough for me in that position.   But, anyways, just have to finish.

Q.   Awesome.
