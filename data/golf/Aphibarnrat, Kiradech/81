  KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Hit a good second shot again but today Thongchai played very good.   I miss about four or five shots but get up‑and‑down, it was good.   We did teamwork.   I try work on my second shot on last two rounds. 

Q.   Between you and Thongchai, what was your strategy?   Did he tee off first? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   He teed off on the first hole and I teed off on the second hole and try and let him hit on the par 3 because his iron a bit better than me right now.   So far, we are doing good. 
Today is two or three degrees down, but everything is good.   He's a great player and he shot many good shots today. 

Q.   2‑under, 70 today, are you happy? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, format is normally we play like last year, we know we play well with I think the foursomes.   It's a very good score for 2‑under today.   It's okay.   I enjoyed it, playing with him again.   He learned a lot and he got some pressure, but he's going to be‑‑ I said to him, okay, playing really well, putting very well, better than me.   Very good up‑and‑down, like 17 and 18, we have very good putts on 17 and 18.   We miss a lot of birdie chances on four or five holes today. 
It's okay, 2‑under, it's a very good score for me and the thing is, I hit good driver today and move forward for tomorrow and Sunday.   Moving forward for going on.   I enjoy it and I hope my partner‑‑ our team is quite strong.   We have only one bogey for both rounds.   I think very good for me.   Good start for two rounds, and then tomorrow going to be moving day tomorrow.
