Q. What are your thoughts on your round out there today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Wasn't a good start.  Missed a couple putts.  First bogey today on par 5, very disappointed.  Then 3-putt on 6 inside 20 feet, it's not so far.  But overall, it's good recover.  Good comeback on the back.
Q. I've heard different front and back nine today.  Why do you think that was?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I think my key is to get my first birdie, to get my confidence back.  After I get a great birdie on 10, it was a big pull drive in the bush, and then hit it out in front of the green, big up-and-down from there.  Got away with four, got the momentum change.
Q. Great recovery at the last.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  I wouldn't want to give away the stroke and then don't want to stay so far from the top.  We were playing so well.  Wang was playing good golf.  We have good fun.
Q. Tied for the lead going into the weekend.  You must be pleased.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, pleased the way I've been playing the first two rounds.  The wind pick up a bit but still playing the same way I do.  Try to get more opportunity to hit more putts, hit more fairways, and see how the greens roll.
