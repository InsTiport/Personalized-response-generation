 Q.  How was that stretch for you, nine birdies in ten holes?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's the way to opening the round, World Golf Championships, especially in China and Asia.  Didn't start well.  Bogey, dropped shot, on the second hole I'm playing.  Didn't hit the ball solid today but putting so well.  Holed a lot of putts.   
 Q.  Have you ever had a birdie streak seven holes?  Is that your longest streak?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: So far that I can remember I think.   
 Q.  How does a start like this get you going for the rest of the week?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's a good momentum.  Just keep playing well the last couple weeks in Europe, and to be honest, playing, shoot 7-under, opening round in the World Golf Championships, there's a lot of top players in the field.  It's just fantastic start and want to keep the momentum.   
 Q.  Like you said, you're rolling it well on the greens.  Are you reading them well?  Have you played here before?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I've played here a couple times, but I'm saying, never played, finished good in this event.  The way I'm confident with my swing, and the way I'm striking the ball and rolling the putts on the green, I think it might be a good week this week.   
 Q.  65, you must be very pleased with that.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, it's the way to open the World Golf Championships, 7-under, take the tie for the lead at the moment.  Really pleased with the way I'm playing.   
 Q.  A run of birdies, nine in ten holes.  What was the key to that?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's all about putting.  I didn't hit the ball well.  I didn't bring my A Game out today but my putting is fantastic.  I holed almost every putt on the greens.   
 Q.  You've been in fantastic form.  Has the putting been the key?  What's been the key to your form?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: My iron play is really sharp at the moment but today I'm saying I hit a lot of greens but not good as I used to do the last couple weeks, but the putting can make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  How do you look to the rest of the week after an opening 65?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I just try to enjoy my game and try to enjoy the big event in Asia, especially a lot of top players in the field.  Play my own game and try to make as -- lots of birdies as I can.
