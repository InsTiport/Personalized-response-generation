KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I was happy about the result, but we both doesn't perform well today.  Especially Marc, I think yesterday take us too long, 36 holes.  We lost a lot of energy.  I hit like 2- or 3-over today, and Marc make 6-, 7-over.  But the match play, just play against one player.  Doesn't have to be a good day.  Just try to focus and play your own game.
Q. So if the energy isn't right for the first event, what's it like for the final now?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, we've got really short times to rest.  But I try to eat, add some more energy, and just playing the back nine, the final match, best golf, I don't know what the result is going to be, but just try to enjoy Scotland.
Q. And when it comes down to this stage, are you just gritting your teeth trying to say carry on, keep going?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, that's the way I'm trying to approach it, especially my caddie, as well, we make the last four players go already, so it's good enough.  The rest, we just show how we can do.
Q. Are you proud of yourself knocking out the local favourite?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Of course, happy with the result, even if doesn't have good form but it was great to win the match and get in the finals.
