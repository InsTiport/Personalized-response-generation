 Q.   Did you have a target for the round or where you were hoping to at least be?   
  
KIRADESH APHIBARNRAT:   No, I still just tried to play my best golf.   Doesn't have any target.   Just take on the game plan and take on the fairway and give me a lot of chances to putt.   
   
 Q.   Seemed like you were picking up fans as you went along.   Did you get a sense of that?   
KIRADESH APHIBARNRAT:   I think I feel it a bit, because I think maybe it's getting from the driver, but I quite enjoy to play these two weeks.   
   
 Q.   Where did you hit your second shot at 18?   
KIRADESH APHIBARNRAT:   I got 173 to the front, 180 yards to the pin.   I hit 7.   Just tried to land it on the green and make 2‑putt.  
   
 Q.   What is the biggest thing you learned from playing The Open, your first major, that you brought here to the PGA?  
KIRADESH APHIBARNRAT:   The Open was tough, same here.   I lost confidence really quickly after I make bogey on the first hole and the rest of the 17 holes is starting‑‑ driving and putting.   This week, don't want to force myself.   I can't say what score I want to shoot.   Just take on the game plan.   
   
 Q.   Has Thongchai been helping you this week?  
KIRADESH APHIBARNRAT:   I think we help each other.   He helps me a lot.   He helps me practice and he has a lot of experience to teach me some ‑‑ and you know, this type of course, you have to be focused on the fairways.   Your long game is key on this course.
