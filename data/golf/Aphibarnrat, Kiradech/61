Q.   You want to talk about your round today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah.   Striking the ball really well but the way I'm making birdie in first three rounds still very good.   I mean I make 8 birdies in the 1st round but just 2-under finish.   But today, because I doesn't drop any shot today and the putting still very good.

Q.   I know that you went through some struggles last year losing your coach and all that.   Where do you stand with that now?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Well, I'm working with my new coach and get back striking the ball really well.   Roll the ball on the green is great.   Things positive right now.
