 Q.  That's rounded off a very good week for you, a 67 to finish and that equals your best round on this golf course.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I got a really good start.  Really happy the way I started today.  Give a lot of chance but in the middle of the round, just struggling, wasn't driving well today.  But overall, still in top five at the moment, which is one of the best result.   
 Q.  What are the main positives that you take out of this week?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: You know, this golf course is really difficult.  I try to stay calm and play shot by shot and keep the ball in play is the most important.  The thing that's really difficult is the wind.  It's coming from everywhere.  I just want to keep the ball in play, keep it low.   
 Q.  You carry good form and you've had some good results already this season, and some big events coming up.  Nice to be going into those with some good form behind you?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, you know, got good form to go into the big Rolex Series coming up.  Feel really happy the way I'm playing and the way I'm moving the ball around the golf course.  Just look forward to playing all the next events.
