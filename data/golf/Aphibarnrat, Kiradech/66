  KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Today we have to say Miguel was playing great golf.   He is playing six‑‑ seven birdies, two eagles, that's a great game of golf.   
   
 Q.   Were you and Thongchai playing your best golf possible?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   No, I don't think we performed our best golf game today but just   birdies with each other but this golf course, we can make more than that.   It's not my good day and Thongchai doesn't strike the ball well on the front nine.   He said he felt tight a little bit on the back.   He tried stretching on the back nine and was recovering, nice try to come back but Miguel was an experienced player and he don't let his opportunity get away.   
   
 Q.   5‑0 down, tomorrow is another day, what sort of challenge does it set up for you guys now?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It's tough for captain right now.   He's try to adjust the team, who is going to play who tomorrow, and it's going to be tough work.   We were planning to get the point really fast tomorrow, the first three groups to make it really soon, make the games more close.   We hope to win 4‑1 tomorrow to bring the game‑‑ to bring us back in the game.
