Q. How pleased were you with the round today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'm pleased with the way I'm playing, to shoot 5-under the opening round, still a couple shots behind.  But still a lot of golf to go.  Quite happy with the way I'm playing.  Really comfortable with the way I swing last two or three months.  So like you saying, the last couple weeks, was playing great golf.
Q. I know you dropped a shot on 17 but a fantastic par putt which you must have thought was going to drop.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, just one dropped shot today.  On 17, a little bad chip, but I rolled the putt, I thought I make it, like you're saying.  But it's golf, even you get a good score, still you need some luck.  But I've been putting great all day.
Q. Tied second in Italy in the last Rolex Series event, how much are you looking forward to this week and South Africa and Dubai?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, just keep looking forward to playing all the biggest events, especially the last Final Series Race to Dubai.  The way I'm playing, it's just really confident and just want to keep going into the last events.
Q. How much do you like this golf course here?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Oh, golf course is fantastic.  Great condition.  The greens is fast and firm.  You can't imagine how nice this country is, and especially this golf course and hotel.
