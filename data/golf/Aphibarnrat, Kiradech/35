Q. Thoughts on today's round?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Still good. Hitting the ball well.  Solid golf.  Just missed one green, one bogey, one bad shot today with 3-putt, probably about 12, 13 yards away.  Got away with bogeys and get the birdies straightaway.
Q. Great way to finish, as well.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it's the way to finish, last two birdies.  My golf game's still very good. Hit a lot of solid golf today.  More consistent.  But today is completely no wind.  I can't imagine that we play here three or four years ago, a lot of wind, and it's so quiet today.
Q. Is it hard to adapt your game at all with the changes to the wind, because everyone is used to it being windy, as you said.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Not really.  But my ball flight is quite high, so a lot of advantage to hit a lot of close to the flag.
Q. And the confidence must be high after last week, as well.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, of course.  Just keep doing well and keep things positive and just believe it.
