Q. Pleased with an opening round 65?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, really happy the way I'm playing the first round, 7-under, just take the lead for the morning session.  It's a good way to start with the first group, get an opportunity to putt the good greens.
Q. Did you feel a good round was in you leading up to this event?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I really like the golf course because iron play is really sharp at the moment and greens in regulation the last few months is a lot improving.
So this course really suits my game:  Small greens, quite narrow golf course, and my driver and putter working so well, so that's why the good start.
Q. The par save on 18, your ninth hole, how crucial was that in the round?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: On 18, just tried to move the ball from the right, a little too much club in the bunker.  Chipped it out 20, 30 feet away for par.  That's a par save for me, a lot of confidence to go in the back.
Q. How impressed have you been with this golf course on your debut in The Italian Open?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's a great honor to be in the last Rolex Series, and especially the first time The Italian Open.  This golf course has been so nice.  It's an old-style golf course and it's in good shape and the greens are pure.
Q. What momentum can you take from the round today into the rest of the week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'm still hitting the ball good and putting well.  This golf course is about to hit greens and make putts.  The way I'm playing, the first round is perfectly.
