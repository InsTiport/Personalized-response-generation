 Q.  Pleased with two days' work?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Hitting still good.  Couple missed shots.  But the golf course is not really easy when you've got a missed shot.  So it's quite difficult opportunity to get to the greens, a couple good up-and-downs, a lot of good putts today.   
 Q.  A nice finish, birdie, birdie.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: The shot on 17 was one of the best shots for me at the moment in first two rounds, just from the left bunker.  6-iron from over 180 yards, inside eight feet, was a birdie chance.  Then holed that putt and made a lot of pressure.   
 Q.  How does it feel being in contention after two rounds with such a quality field?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's been great.  It's a very good start to the 2017 season, two shots back.   
 Q.  Your thoughts going into the weekend?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Just try to work with the game.  Focus on my swing and the game plan and don't worry about the results, just accept it.
