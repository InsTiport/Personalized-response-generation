Q. Tell us about your round.  I know you got into some trouble at 15 and 16, but your recovery after that was spectacular.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  3-under for the opening round is not that bad, if you didn't look at the leader's score.  The course is getting softer, so there's a lot of low scores today.  But I'm quite happy with the round I start.  But was struggling 15 and 16 but good recovery the last two holes.
Q. You're only five shots back of the leaders at the moment.  What will your strategy be tomorrow?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'll try to hit more controlled balls.  Today I hit a lot of hot balls and tried to get more distance, but the rough this week was killing me, as well.  So I tried to control the ball on the greens, give you an opportunity to putt.  I roll the ball quite well on the greens, so if I have more advantage to putt, I think the score should be much better.
Q. Will you be heading out to the putting green, driving range after this?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I work a bit on my back.  I just feel a little bit stiff after bad sleep last night, but I will go back and roll the ball on the putting green for sure.
