 Q.  A disappointing finish on 18 but overall, how pleased are you with your round, and yesterday, which have left you nicely in touch?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, I've been really happy with the result the first two rounds.  Every time you play under this golf course, very tough conditions.  You have to be really pleased with it.   
I was quite disappointed the way I finished two days in a row just the par 5, but I'm hitting middle of the fairways and got an iron in your hand and walk away with bogeys, which is quite little bit disappointed but overall, still really good shape.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about your game the first two days?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: 100 per cent on putting.  I've been putting so good.  I hole everything inside 15 feet which is phenomenal.  Just have to keep doing until the last two rounds to catch Rory.   
 Q.  Coming into this event, the first of the Rolex Series, are you looking forward to the events that you're playing in the Series this year?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, of course.  Obviously I'm playing so well in the last six to eight months, and looking forward to have a big win.  This week might be a good week to make the top, with a lot of players coming, great player in the world to support European Tour and Rolex Series.  But I just want to play my best golf and show them how Asian players are strong enough to play against them.
