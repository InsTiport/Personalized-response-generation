 Q.  An opening round of 67.  How pleased are you with that?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I'm really happy with the way I'm playing and the way we start the first round, tied for the lead.  Still a lot of golf to go.   
 Q.  Tied 27th last year but the course has seen a lot of changes.  Have you enjoyed the changes to the course?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, the golf course look fantastic.  A lot of bunkers been taken off.  Make the fairway look a little bit wide.  But the green is really firm and fast.  Still really tough course.  But it's in great condition out there.   
 Q.  And there must be a feeling that four low rounds of golf will probably win this week.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I don't want to force myself look forward to the last round.  Just want to play the way I'm start the first round.  Just keep focus on the game, stay patient and play to the course.
