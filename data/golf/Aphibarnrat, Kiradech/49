Q. Very colourful scorecard going out, 36.  Tell us what happened.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I've been struggling with my chipping a lot around the greens.  I can't get up-and-down.  I hit a lot of good shots and hole a lot of nice putts, but when I missed the green, I just can't chip near the greens.  The type of the grass and the weather is quite bad.
It's raining, and every time I chip, my club just went down to the ground so fast.  That's why the score is a lot of colours.  When I hit a good shot, I holed the putt.  But when I missed the shot, I just can't get up-and-down.
Q. But coming back, two birdies and in in 34.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, not bad.  We play under every day but not good enough to win in the World Golf events, because all the top players are here and they all shoot very low score.  I've been struggling on my chipping for awhile and just look forward to playing a very low round tomorrow to jump up and move my World Ranking up a bit.
Q. Give us an update on your back; it's been sore.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I've been sleeping on the floor for two nights, much better, but I have a bad back, tight.  Tried to loosen up in the first round when it's really tough to work because we just got half an hour to work on it.  But good recovery and I hope tomorrow it will be much better.
Q. Do you have any time to get on to the chipping green?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I will decide.  I will see with the physio, how is my back going.  If I can stand a couple hours, might be worse on my back to still go play tomorrow.
