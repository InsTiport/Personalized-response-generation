Q. What were you able to do on the final holes to ultimately win this match?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I'm all finished.  I've been behind all day.  And hopefully the putt will be long the last couple of holes.  Charles playing great golf.  The last two birdies, incredible.
Q. You played the full 18.  It was an emotional match.  What do you do now to kind of get yourself not only physically, but mentally ready for a tough opponent in Bubba Watson?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'll try to go in the gym, maybe, in the afternoon.  I just want to enjoy every single minute that I spend in Austin.  That is my goal, top-10 every week that I'm playing.  Just go out there and enjoy and show what we can do to all the spectators.
Q. Tell me what you were thinking on 16 when Charles had about five feet for birdie to put you 2-down.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I just want to finish my game, finish strong, even if he make birdie on 16, I have to make two birdies.  I have no choice.
But then he just, the 17, to putt on the last hole, which is one of the best putts in my life.
Q. It was a great putt.  I was wondering about his mark, if you had him keep the mark there, if it helped your line?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, no, actually I just -- it was like I don't worry, just forget about his mark, just forget where I hit the putt in the past.  I've been struggling with putt all day until I just holed the 17 putt.  Last three hole all great putt.
Q. Two times this week you have made putts here at 18 and a big smile on your face.  That's great stuff.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Thank you.  Just trying to do what I have to do.  Match play anything can happen, just an opportunity to make a lot of birdies and bogeys.  And then front nine, just three bogeys is not a good golf to be ahead.  I've been behind all day in such a great match.
