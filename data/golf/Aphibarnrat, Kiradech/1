 Q.  Can you talk about your round.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I managed myself quite well today, managed the energy playing against the wind and my body.  And going to the last round it was one of the happy rounds I ever played at The Open.   
Now I have a week off.  I have a couple of days off to rest my knee.  I might come back and playing The TOUR Championship, the playoff at the end, maybe two or three more events.  And then I'm going to take a big break.   
 Q.  How was it like playing through the pain all week?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It was not fun time at all when you try and hit hard and your body is not a hundred percent fit.  But today I'm getting adjusted to hitting softer, control the ball in the wind.  I think the wind has helped.  When the wind is strong you have to hit it softer, which has helped my golf swing.   
 Q.  Is the Presidents Cup one of the events you're looking at?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Presidents Cup is one of the biggest team events for Asia.  But I'm really not too sure earnings.  I'm supposed to be on the team but if I recover from my injuries and play well enough at the end of the year and I get back in my own ranking, I would love to play in the Presidents Cup.
