 Q.  Just overall thoughts on the week?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I've been hitting much better.  My ball-striking is improving.  But my short game so bad.  I can't get up and down from any par 5.  It's quite disappointing par 5 this week, you know.  No birdies and then chipped in the water today on 12.  I chip in the water and make 7 and lost the hole.  It's a turnaround.  And I didn't have any confidence around the greens.  I have a lot of work to do.   
 Q.  What's the plan before the Masters?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Still have to work on my game a little bit before I play the biggest major.  I'm not far off.  Striking ball is the best.   
 Q.  What will you be working on in the short game?  What's the problem?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's some technique is not right.  I've been struggling for last two or three years.  Not chipping well as I used to do.  I still have to work.   
 Q.  What's the last couple months been like for you?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Really roller coaster, up and down.  I mean, I miss a lot of cuts this year.  I hope I can do better but first year on the Tour is always struggling.  Just want to go again and try to get my best form back.  Doing the same thing - practicing hard and playing well and hopefully I just get what I used to do.   
 Q.  How many times have you been to the Masters?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I've been two years before, playing two times.   
 Q.  What did you learn those times to take away this year?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's all about hitting shot.  If you put your ball in the right position, you have more advantage to make birdies.  Don't put yourself in the worst position.  That's it.  That's about Augusta.   
 Q.  And are you watching the Presidents Cup standings at all?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I don't want to think about that.  I'll keep putting the pressure to me.  And if Ernie picks me, I'm playing.  If not, I just walk away.   
 Q.  What's kind of the plan after Augusta?  Are you going to play yet?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: No, no plan yet, play Augusta and then go back home for a few week maybe PGA Championship event.   
 Q.  Next week in Orlando, though, practice?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes.
