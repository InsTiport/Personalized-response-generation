 Q.  Kiradech, opening round 66 but an interesting run, bogeys and birdies?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, a couple birdies and a couple dropped shots, which is easy mistake.  Missed the putt from four feet and didn't get up-and-down on 17.  Overall, still in good shape.   
 Q.  How aggressive do you like to be on this golf course?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I'm just really playing, want to keep hitting fairways and greens because I know my putting is quite well from last week and I feel like I've got my A Game back and I'm striking the ball quite well.  Not absolutely perfect but still in play.   
 Q.  Tied fourth last week.  How nice to carry that form into one of these events at the end of The European Tour season?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, always nice to have a good start before the end of the year.  Have to climb up the Top-10 to Race to Dubai.  It not easy because there's a lot of great players, top players up there, and I have to play really well.  It's a good start last week, and three more weeks to go, and the way I played the opening round is on my side.   
 Q.  You tied sixth here last year, so you know what you need to do to keep in contention on this golf course.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, this course, there's a lot of birdies inside the course.  Just have to stay patient, put the ball in the right position, and it's a bunch of birdies inside the course.
