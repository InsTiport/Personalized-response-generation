 Q.  Nice playing.  What did you do so well that allowed you to get around in those tough conditions today?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I just tried to put the ball in the fairways and the opportunity to play a second shot.  There's a lot of birdies out there, but you can't make a mistake.  When you hit it in the wrong position, you might get hurt a lot.   
 Q.  At CIMB you were sick and ended up in the hospital.  Tell us a little bit about that.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Just my vacation, I spent some time in the hospital, two nights, and just feel fresh, ready to come out.  Just a little -- I mean, it was too hot in Malaysia, some dehydration, and some more rest, but so far I've been recovered and I'm good to go.   
 Q.  You finished top five in two World Golf Championships this year already.  What is it about the World Golf Championships you like so much?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I have to say, I'm playing very solid golf the last eight months.  I got really confident in the last two World Golf Championships, I finished top five.   
I've been playing so well last year here.  Keep knocking on the door.  Went on the top in the first round.  But just can't make the job done.  A lot of things going on in the last two rounds.   
But I've got more experience and I've got more confident going into this year.   
 Q.  And you're going to join the PGA TOUR full-time as a member next year.  What are you looking forward to the most?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: To be the first Thai golfer to play on the PGA TOUR is such pressure.  Try to win, you know, even one event.  Try to let the new generation see that we are coming from little small country in Asia and that we can play against the top players in the world, which is the biggest tour in the world, as well.  You know, just want to inspire them.
