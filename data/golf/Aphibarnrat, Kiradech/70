 Q.   Thoughts on shooting 67 around here?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Quite happy with the 5â€‘under starting round.   I hit the ball really well, and sink a lot of putts.   
   
 Q.   First time you've visited, so a course you like immediately?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I can say this course is quite suited for the long hitter, so the course is quite suited for me.   Otherwise you have to make a lot of putts because the greens quite tough and the speed is very fast.   
   
 Q.   I guess you've got to hit it in the right place on those greens, as well?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, if you've got the right position, it's not that tough.   The pin is quite giving for the first round.   
   
 Q.   Given where you've come from, you like the heat and sunshine on your back, as well?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I can say that you can see at the resort before, I was playing quite well in the heat countries.   Hopefully will play well this week.   
   
 Q.   Are you still feeling the confidence after Malaysia a couple of weeks ago?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yes, I'm doing quite well from beginning until now.   So I have confidence to come in the last event and try to finish well before I go back to Asia.
