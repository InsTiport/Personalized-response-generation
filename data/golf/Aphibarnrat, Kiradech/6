 Q.  Three birdies in the last four holes.  That was a great way to finish off your round today?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I mean, much better than yesterday.  I hole a lot of putts and it's a great finish, three birdies on last four holes.   
 Q.  What do you feel has been the strongest part of your game today?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: So far my putting was working so well.  The big key was the par putt on 13 which is like 15, 16 feet.  Then turned around to make a couple birdies at the end.  My golf game was getting there, improving.   
I still try to work really hard with Mike Walker and Pete Cowen, both of them still here, and I have a lot of work to do on the weekend.   
 Q.  How much do you enjoy playing this golf course here in Dubai?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I have to say, I really enjoy it.  The golf course is in fantastic shape.  Golf fans amazing.  Weather is really nice, really similar to my country.  Overall, we can't get anything better than this.   
 Q.  Excited for the weekend, nicely placed on the leaderboard?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, a couple strokes behind so far but the leader groups, still a lot of golf to go.
