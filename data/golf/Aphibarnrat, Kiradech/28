Q. How would you assess your performance today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's still not a bad score, 3-under to finish up the round, but it's not my A Game today.  My iron play isn't sharp as the first two rounds but my putting still working quite well.  3-under is still in the position, a couple strokes behind.
Q. How pleased are you with your position going into tomorrow?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'm really pleased with the first three rounds and my position.  Just look forward to playing tomorrow.  Try to be focused and play within myself.
Q. What do you feel you need to shoot tomorrow to win this championship?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, make a lot of birdies as I can.  It's not just depends on the leaders.  I try to shoot the lowest I can, keep the ball in play and keep the opportunity to putt, and roll the ball.  And then just hope it's going to be my week.
