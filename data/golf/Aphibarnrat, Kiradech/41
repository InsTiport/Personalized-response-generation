Q. How difficult was it?  Did you almost pull out in the morning?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Tough golf.  I decide to play because the way Jeev was doing to us, they had like 100 percent to us.  I just try to, I mean, if I pull out this morning, Europe are going to get a point.  But anyway, if I going to lose a point, I would like to try.  But I didn't play until 18 hole, but I try my best today.  Not like 100 percent before teeing off.
Q. How long have you had this injury?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I've been having it on the first round.  But it's getting better, by second round.  Hopefully it will be fine.  Yesterday it's getting worse.  Yesterday night it's getting worse.  I woke up this morning and went straight to range, hit five, six balls and go back to physio again and try to work as much as I can.
Q. Did it affect your play in any way?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I can't hit the ball -- I can tell it's not my game.  Even though I'm putting well, I hit a lot of good shots but I hit it -- I have to make this putt because I not have a lot of chance.  I'm saying it's been quite tough to play with injury.  When you can't swing it well, I don't know how it's going to be the score.
Q. I'm sure you're not happy to look at the score like right now.  Just tell me in your mind what you think did not work for Asia this week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Europe got a strong player this week and then they perform well.  I mean, everyone working well.  All the players and captain, Jeev, was playing great.
