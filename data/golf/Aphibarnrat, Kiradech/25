 Q.  How did you find that?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's not a bad day.  Still pick up 2-under today.  Didn't hit the ball good the same as yesterday.  My putter doesn't go well as yesterday, especially 3-putt the last hole is quite disappointing.  It's not the way to finish the round.   
 Q.  Are you pleased the way you came back from your double-bogey at 12?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Oh, yeah, that double-bogey coming from chipping again.  You can see the way I'm playing the last hole, all the chipping is quite killing me.  But it's good come back, three birdies after that but just one dropped shot at the end, still 2-under on the day.   
 Q.  How different were conditions out there compared to yesterday?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Today there was a little bit of wind and the pin position is tougher than yesterday.  But it's tough to say, because Dustin shoot 9-under.  The wind picks up, so it makes the golf course a little bit different than yesterday.   
 Q.  I know you're disappointed with your finish, but still in a great position going into the weekend?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  Still on the par 5, a couple strokes behind and still set up to go top ten, top five for me this week.  I'm playing good this golf course, with the way I'm playing at the moment, I can set the goal a little higher than I used to do.  Just focus on ball-striking and I might work a little more on the range after this.
