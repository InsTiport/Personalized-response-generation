 Q.  1-under par today, your thoughts?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's not a bad spot.  It's really tough conditions with the wind all around, so strong.  Makes the golf course completely different with the first round and was more difficult.   
 Q.  What's particularly pleasing to you about your game this week so far?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I got my putting back.  I rolled the ball quite well.  My short game around the green was great.   
Just today, didn't keep the driver quite as good as I used to.  I think I only hit four or five fairways all day, but need to hit more greens, as well.  When the winds pick up, you need to hit more from the fairways and give more opportunity to putt.   
 Q.  Is that something you can work on on the range for the weekend?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I'm going to go work.  But this week, I don't feel I have my A Game, I don't totally have it back, but much better than I have been in the last few weeks.
