 Q.   How was it playing links golf, different kind of course so what you're used to.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It is.   It's really tough to find this type of coordination.   I think it's my second or my third round on the links course.   And the key, you have to make a good putting and around the green you have to be‑‑ up‑and‑down around the greens is the key to links.   
   
 Q.   Do you like it, because you can be so creative, and sometimes you've hit a good shot and it's just a bad bounce.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It's good fun.   It's good fun.   It's my new experience.   I learn a lot of this type of course.   I have to focus on the short game.  
   
 Q.   You must think that Scotland is always like this with wonderful sunshine.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It isn't always this warm.   I heard Scotland should be cold, wind and rain, but it's great weather this week, quite surprised.   
   
 Q.   Have you seen anything or is it very much just golf, hotel, golf course?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   That's the golfer's life, we have hotel and golf course, that's it for me, but I'm going to try to go into town.
