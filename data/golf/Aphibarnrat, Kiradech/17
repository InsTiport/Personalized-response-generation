Q. Your assessment of your first round.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I got a good start, first 4-under after the first seven holes and then missed a lot of putt, the par putt on 18 and birdie putt on 1st, par putt on 3 and 4 which was inside 7 feet.  And then I was a losing confidence a little bit on the back nine, which is I played 2-over on the par-5.  Opening round with 1-under, I know it's not that bad but I just feel like I'm dropping a lot of shots out there.
Q. Did you hit driver or 3-wood off 12?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I hit driver.  I hit driver.
Q. Was your intention all along?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I mean, it's only two choices.  I'm not going to hit 3-wood.  If I'm going to lay up I'm just going to hit iron from the tee and leave me about 100 something.  But if I want to go for it I just want to take the water out of play and just go for the greens.
Q. Do you think more guys are going to go for that green now that it's been modified a little bit?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I think so.  I think a lot of players will go for it.  Especially you got a lane, you can just carry like 260 or 270 yard over the bunker on the left and it's going to roll toward the front of the green.
Q. Just to cut that corner?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah.
Q. Are you going to go for it every day or was it just because of the pin?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I try to play my own game, try to keep the ball in play, working with my golf swing, but this course is really difficult, the green is really small and firm, it depends on the position.  If you can hit more greens, you got more opportunity.
Q. How nice is it to have the round over and done with and have a little bit of time to get some rest?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Oh, it's nice for me.  I need some time to rest, especially that I've been traveling around and I think I'm getting a little bit tired.  I didn't swing it well from Tuesday until now, it doesn't feel like -- I haven't got my A game out there.  That's why I keep saying I'm leaving a lot of shots out there, like three or four strokes.  I should be much better than this.
