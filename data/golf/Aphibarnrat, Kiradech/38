Q. Thoughts on your opening round?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, playing solid.  I mean, 6-under to start the opening year, 2017, it's a good way to start.  I've been working a lot the last few days with my new coach, Pete Cowen.  Doesn't hit anything sharp but it's more consistent.  Doesn't have a big miss today.  Overall, 6-under for the start, I think it's great round.
Q. What was the reason for the change of coach?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I've been stuck at the same position for like three years.  Just moving forward.  Never been working with overseas coach.  I believe Pete, good background, look after a lot of top players.  Try to get new experience and jump to the next step.
Q. Your round got off to a slow start but it really got going around 16.  Talk to us about that run.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Oh, yeah.  Well, starting, hit a lot of great iron shots in first four or five holes.  Just can't hole the putt.  Then 16, I pulled my driver in the rough.  Hit like to the right maybe like 30 feet away.  Holed that putt.  Let me loose a bit.  Let me relax more when the first birdie come.
And good shot on 17 to five feet.  Those two birdies loosen me a lot, so back nine, keep me going.
Q. And the four birdies in a row?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, hit a lot of short irons and hole the putts.  That's the key, hit it in the fairways and make more putts.
