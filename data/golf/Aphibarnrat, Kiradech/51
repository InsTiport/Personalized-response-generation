 Q.  Your thoughts on how its panned out in the end?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: First of all, I have to congratulate Victor.  It was a good come back after struggling.  On the fourth hole, he made double on the par 3, and then missed a short putt.  Then the way he has come back is strong, the back nine, to win.  Nice playing.   
The way I'm playing is a good start, on fire, and then in the middle of the game, slowed down a bit and to have one birdie on the back, that's not good enough to get the job done.  It's going to take me awhile to forget the last putt.   
 Q.  The way you started, imagine you thought anything was possible because it was birdie after birdie after birdie?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, it is.  I really needed to start strong.  I was doing great with a very good start.  But at the end, just can't make birdies.  Hit many good shots today.  All the par 3 was at the flag but just can't roll the ball in.   
 Q.  Given this is the start of The Final Series, it's good news with what's to come.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It is.  You look back, the last three events, I've finished all top five and this week another good week.  Disappointed at the end but still a great result.
