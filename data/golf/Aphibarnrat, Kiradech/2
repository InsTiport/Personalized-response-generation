 Q.  It was a bit of a struggle out there for you today.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I'm hitting solid, same as the first round.  But some decision that I made on the golf course today was a little bit awkward.  I mean, on the par 5 I've been hitting in the middle of fairways, and it's all reachable.  And now with 2-over, which is quite a disappointing day.  Putter was still good, driver, everything was good.  It was just the par 5, I lost two strokes on par 5.   
 Q.  But you're going into the weekend rounds and you have another 36 holes to make a charge.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah.  I'll try to go out there and play my best golf.  I think my golf game was much improving.  Still with 36 hole for me to climb up on top there, to get myself back in the top 50 again, to get in the World Golf next week.   
Still a lot of good things in my game at the moment.  So I'm really looking forward to it.
