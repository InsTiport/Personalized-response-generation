Q. Thoughts on today's round, please?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Hitting good.  But I doesn't feel really well today.  Just feel cold.  My golf game still doing well.  Hole a couple putts.  Bad start again.  First eight holes was 2-over.  But by end of the day, finish 2-under, is not bad.
Q. You must be quite happy with your position bearing in mind, you're not that happy with your game.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Still in position.  A little bit behind.  Wang is playing great golf.  I heard a lot of noise on the back.  He made a lot of birdies.  But by the way, still in position.
Q. Is there anything you're going to work on this evening?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: No, I just want to go back and rest to clear my mind.  Get ready for tomorrow.
Q. The birdie on the last, great way to finish.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, just the last par chip, last two holes, 16 and 18.  But good recover.  Make a putt and walk away with birdies.  A couple strokes behind, so still have a lot of work to do.
