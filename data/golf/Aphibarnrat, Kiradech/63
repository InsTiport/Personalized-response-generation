Q.   Talk about this win, how important is it? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It's a big high for me, after making two birdies in a row on 13 and 14 and I was recovering by 15 to 16, it was a good match.   We are starting well.   Doesn't hit the good shot on the first couple holes, doesn't play good golf on the front nine but on the back nine we tried move a lot, fun games.

Q.   Talk about starting off slowly, how do you manage to composure yourself for the next few holes?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I mean, I tried to fight myself too much before I go out.   Me and Thongchai plan to win the first couple for us, we plan to get the first four point and just get back to the games, and every time we try to hit it to the pins, try to make a putt, try to force myself, my birdies, it doesn't turn that good, but you know, match play, you are just playing hole‑by‑hole, just one by one, but I'm quite happy with the result. 

Q.   After yesterday's round, what did Thongchai tell the team? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   We still believe.   We have miracle to come back.   If you look on the scoreboard right now, Asia got the strong come back, so I just go support my team and hopefully just make the job done.

Q.   Was it tough to concentrate out there looking at the scoreboard out there on every hole?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Of course, we are like four points behind and we are playing with the top experienced players.   It's not easy catching up on the singles match with how The European Team is playing.   But I just want to thank all the team, try really hard, whether we are going to win or lose, we just do our best.
