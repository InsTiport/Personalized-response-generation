Q. A second round 67, only two off the lead.  How pleased are you with your performance today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, still hitting a lot of great quality shots today.  The front nine, the putter doesn't work as well as yesterday but overall, I still shoot under par on the front.  Just bad chip on 12, but overall, 4-under is still in position.
Q. Do you feel you could have gone lower today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I feel that.  The way I'm striking the ball, hitting a lot of iron shots, it's been really sharp.  Supposed to get a couple birdies at the end but 4-under is still not a bad score.
Q. What were the conditions like out there this afternoon?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It was lovely, nice weather, good golf course.  A lot of crowds.  Fantastic.
Q. How much do you look forward to being in contention for the weekend two shots off the lead?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Still try to play within myself.  Last couple weeks I've dropped a shot at the end towards the finish.  Just try to play against myself, focus on the games and more patient.
Q. What do you feel you need to do to get the job done this week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Just roll more putts.  Same as I do the first round.  Hit more close.  Make more birdies; simple.
