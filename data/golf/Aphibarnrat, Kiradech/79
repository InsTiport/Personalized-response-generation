  KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   It was starting good, starting birdie, Eagle, birdie on 4,5,6, they were a good start, so make golf more easier.   Quite lucky in afternoon, second round, the wind was quite quiet.   Not so strong wind.   I know I can make a score.   
   
 Q.   You are definitely showing a lot of very good form, especially from your win in Malaysia; how is your form and would you just share.   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   My form is still very good from Malaysia until now.   My driver and my putting was doing great.   Just keep it under the game plan.   This golf course is quite narrow.   You have to hit it on the fairway to have a chance to make a birdie.  
   
 Q.   The weather here can be very unpredictable, do you feel that yesterday distracted your play and rhythm?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   No, I get used to this weather.   I play in Japan this type of weather, but some wind, like I said today, it's the quite lucky, not so strong wind, otherwise, we are going to have to see, last two days, hopefully this type wind.   
   
 Q.   You have pretty much warmed up now, especially having played the last few holes from your second round, ready for the last 36 holes?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yes, quite ready, keep myself warm and let's see on the weekend.   
   
 Q.   How much confidence do you take from the victory and being in the same position now, do you think you learned a lot from winning?   
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yes, I got experience and a lot of confidence to come here this week.   But you know, the weather is quite different from Malaysia.
