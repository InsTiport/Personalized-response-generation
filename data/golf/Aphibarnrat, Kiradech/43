Q. Outstanding win, it was nip and tuck all the way, but lovely way to finish.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  We are both playing solid golf today.  Good recovering and we hole a lot of putts today, and we were playing as a team.
Q. A lot of people looked at the pairing and thought it was quite strange with the big-hitting, flamboyant Aphibarnrat, but your rather different style, but went well.
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: We planned like that, one long hitter and one short hitter, so if there is any mistake, I can recover in the short game.  That's the plan actually.
Q. So you're playing from different places to where you would normally play from?
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Yeah, obviously I'm playing pretty good and my partner also is playing very well.
Q. You looked good as a team early on and suddenly it went from red to blue quite quickly, really important for you guys to get a point at the end?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I just hope Danny would do well and get another point and just look forward to play singles, and like last year, we still believe it can happen again.
