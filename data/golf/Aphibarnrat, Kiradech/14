 Q.  How pleased are you to walk off with a 1-under 71?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, today was really tough.  The wind is so strong inside.  I was really happy with the results.  It's not my putting day.  I've been rolling the ball really well for two rounds and hole every putt, but I think today I used too much the first two rounds.  But still under par on these very tough conditions and happy with it.   
 Q.  On such a tough day it must have been nice to birdie the first, which is a tricky starting hole there?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It is.  It's a good start, early start, but the putting doesn't work well there.  Three bogeys is coming from two, three putts, and then I miss a lot of putts inside ten feet which is not normally my game.   
But overall, I still have a good chance.   
 Q.  18 has not been too kind to you so far, so how nice was it to walk off with a par today?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I hit my ball not in the water today and I have a chance for birdie putt from ten feet but I just push it.  Walk away with don't give score away on the par 5, feels very good today.   
 Q.  You're nicely placed in contention on a Sunday, big event, Rolex Series Event, it should be a good day?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  It is a good week so far.  Just a couple strokes behind, five strokes behind.  I played with Francesco and he was playing fantastic golf.  Especially with these conditions, the way he played and the way he showed, he deserved this one.
