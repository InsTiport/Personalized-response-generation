Q.   You had a nice birdie on the last hole; how do you feel? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   The first time in a team event, today quite happy, but mistake, doesn't hit good second shot on couple holes and then I miss just one driver on 16, the short par 4, and everything is good. 

Q.   How do you find your first time playing in China? 
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Nice.   Great.   We know that each other can make a putt or can hit a shot, but I have to improve my shots a bit the last three rounds. 

Q.   What do you think of tomorrow's format, the challenge?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I have to give Thongchai a chance to hit.   My putting is very good right now. 

Q.   How do you find it? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Played well today.   Enjoyed it.   A couple holes on the back nine got to be tough for putting because the green is going to be different. 

Q.   Tomorrow is more challenging‑‑
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, I think the game plan for all together, have to plan it tonight, talking tonight about the game plan for tomorrow.   Tee shots, game plan for him, because it's first time.   He played very good.   He made a lot of birdies today.   We know the team work have to be all together.   6‑under is a good start in wind conditions like this and I think it's very enjoyable to play with him.   He's a very good player.   And also tomorrow is going to be very challenging tomorrow.   Good team work and good tee shot first.
