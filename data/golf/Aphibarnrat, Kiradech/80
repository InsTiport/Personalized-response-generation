  KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Today my putting is great.   I hole I think every chance at birdie putt.   Good approach shots, couple holes, but 13 is great today.   
   
 Q.   Did you think at the start of play today that a low round, you've still got a chance?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   No, I just keep playing my game plan.   Because my body is not 100 percent.   I have an injury with my wrist the last couple of weeks, and until now, not recovered.   Maybe I should rest.   Just try to play the best.   Anyway, it's a good round for today.  
   
 Q.   To shoot 65 with a bad wrist, that must be very pleasing?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   I made a lot of birdie putts.   
   
 Q.   Does this mean that you're holding back on some shots and not going for them as much as you would normally?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Right.   Like before, my distance is longer than this and some shots, I cannot hit for the greens in two, some of the par 5s.   Sometimes I can hit to one but I have to lay up, but this time because my body is not 100 percent, just keep on the game plan.   
   
 Q.   While you didn't expect to be with a winning chance at the start of play, do you think you've got a little chance?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT:   Yeah, I think I've got a little chance but I still concentrate on my game plan.   I don't know anybody play like 7‑ or 8‑under tomorrow but I will stick with my game plan and see what I can do.
