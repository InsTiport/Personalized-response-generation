KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I was playing the ball well and have some confidence.  Today I didn't start like first three days.  Normally would start up two or three after first five holes but today was 3-down after five.  Very strong to come back.  Strong mental, as well, today.  Just keep patient.  Even a couple holes when I start, I just feel tired that I have to walk 36 holes.  But this is match play and just play against one player.   
 Q.  So what was it that really made that match turn on its head?  You dominated on the back nine.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I mean, I just -- the key is No. 6, the par 4 dogleg-left.  Usually we have to hit like 4- or 5-irons from the tees and it was like 2- or 3-down, just go from the driver.  Make birdie from there and come back to 1-down.  Get more power to play on the rest of the holes.   
 Q.  And that makes it very much mental, gives you a bit of belief when that happens?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Of course.  I've been make a lot of tough lines and tough putts.  So just keep digging and anything can happen.  I've been up a lot on the first few holes, but today down.  So just try to do how it's going.   
 Q.  Is your energy still good?  You've got two matches tomorrow.  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It's going to be tough.  Getting the last four players is my goal.  So just try to enjoy.  I play with the local tomorrow, Marc Warren, so will be a tough round.  But if I hit the ball like I did the first few rounds, it's going to be tough for him to beat me.   
 Q.  And everybody else will be supporting Marc somehow?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, of course, just enjoy the Scottish weather and the crowd around.  Hopefully we are not in the rain and cold and wind tomorrow.  Sunshine, hot, would be my weather.  Marc doesn't expect it but it's going to be great.
