 Q.  What do you think about the pairings?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Jeev is choosing the right players to be together.  Me and Chawrasia is good group.  I've got length and he's got a great short game.  I believe this course can suit his game.  Playing against the No. 1 -- he's one of my idols, as well.  It's good to play against the top players.  We have nothing to lose, and I believe the way I played last year and the way Chawrasia is showing, it will be a top point to take away from us.   
We've got our best opportunity to get a point because the weather is on our side, and if we perform as well as I think, it's going to be a very tough match.   
 Q.  When you look back at the first edition, foursomes are very challenging for Team Asia.  How will you overcome that tomorrow?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: If you look back, it's quite unlucky the way Team Asia starts.  But this year, anyway, we are going to start much better.  We are going to jump ahead of Europe team and make everything easier in the last two rounds.   
 Q.  When Jeev told you about your partner, what did you think?  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I was surprised.  I think overnight before they announced, I have a good chance to play with him.  We practise in Europe a few times, and his game, I just love the way he rolls the ball.  I believe I'm going to hit a lot of short irons and he's going to make a lot of putts.   
 Q.  And going against Westwood --  
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, he is top player.  The way we show, anything can happen in 18 holes.  It's not easy for Lee to just take away the point from me.
