Q. Final round 64.  What were you able to figure out from your game and this golf course everyday to see that improvement?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I think I rolled the ball pretty well this week.  You look at the stat, it was good.  My putting roll and speed was very good this week and maybe the best speed.
Q. So at the Masters you sprained your ACL.  You had to take three weeks off.  Said this is a little bit of a surprise to be able to come out here and go that low.
What has the rehab been like and how do you prepare for a really challenging golf course next week that is going to demand everything from you physically?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: This week I just came out, tried to enjoy the golf game, get the feel of the ball.  Quite a surprise.  About three weeks without hitting balls.  Free with freedom.  It's great.  Enjoy every step that I play.
Q. You're No. 1 in the field this week in putting.  That is a tremendous statistic, especially heading into the second Major of the year.
What do you do between now to keep your putting as good as it is this week?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Keep seeing the ball roll to the line and matching the speed and keep doing what I'm doing right now and hopefully it will be my day.
