KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's been a big jump for me.  Yesterday was the key thing, 63 in Kingsbarns was great result.  Today, good start,2 to 4 and 9 to 11, that's three birdies, as well.  So totally, eight birdies, missed two bogeys, but anyway, 6-under is very good St. Andrews.
Q. Given your last visit to Scotland produced a victory at the Paul Lawrie event, did you come here with excitement and confidence?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, of course, I'm excited to came over and a lot of friends support this week.  It was my pleasure to be here again and St. Andrews is the Home of Golf.  I've been shooting a low score this first time at The Open, wasn't playing well, but I get used to the course and I beat it.
Q. Presumably the good weather helps?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Today doesn't look like Scotland at all, quiet and heat.  Very nice weather, very nice playing golf.  Hope to see some low scores today, because the wind is a little dry.  But hopefully tomorrow the weather stays the same.
Q. How is it with the rhythms, the dynamics of playing in a team event like this, having a partner?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, it's good fun, and I've never been before.  This is my first time to play Dunhill, and my amateur was very nice.  He's done well.  We was enjoying and have fun.
