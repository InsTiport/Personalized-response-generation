Q. So what do you make of a round of 64?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Solid round.  I've been hitting driver so good, you can't imagine how long and straight it is.  I missed only two fairways and every single ball flies like 300 yards.
So this card is about the first shot:  You put yourself in the fairways, you have opportunities to make a lot of birdies, and my putter was working better than yesterday.  Striking the ball great at the flag, every single ball.  It was a fantastic round.
Q. Looks like you just caught fire on the back nine, as if anything just went in your favour.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, I hit it like a feet away on 10 and then rolled a couple putts in.  Good drive on the par 5, make eagle.  Made the golf much easier when you're driving the ball well.  That is the key.
Q. It affects your mind, doesn't it, and the confidence, because know that you're in control of your flight.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: It is.  Honestly, I haven't played good golf the last few months.  After I hit many good shots on the front nine, and then I get my confidence back, and I believe myself that one of the top players; and my caddie keeps saying, you're not in a bad mood.  Just look forward, go forward, and then you just aim high.
Q. Presumably, that's the mantra for the weekend now, isn't it, because you're in the marvelous pole position.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  Now I can believe myself a bit, have confidence back to get back in the game, and who knows, you know, not many chances to get back on The European Tour, but playing well, I just try my best job.
