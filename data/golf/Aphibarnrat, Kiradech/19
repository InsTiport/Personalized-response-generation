Q. Well played.  You advance to Saturday.  What was good about today's round?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I just kept the ball in play.  To be honest, I don't think Jon was playing his best game.  I know that it's not the best day for him.  So it's all about friendship out here.  I'm playing great golf.  And a lot of confidence, comfortable with the swing.
Q. How tough was the course playing today?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: The golf course is in fantastic shape.  When the wind pick up, it's really tough.  I think some greens, they put some water on it, so it make easier for the player, otherwise we can't stop it.
Q. Talk about today's victory, please.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I'm playing good golf.  And I'm really comfortable with the swing.  Really comfortable with the way I'm working the balls.  And I just keep the ball in play, under the winds.
Q. It's really nice to have a perfect record, isn't it?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, it is.  Just looking forward to playing tomorrow.
Q. In the group of 16.  It was like a little sudden death today, but it really is sudden death now.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I was really enjoying every single minute here and in Austin.  And a lot of spectators was doing so good.  I don't mind playing with anybody tomorrow.  I just want to enjoy and go out and play my best golf.
