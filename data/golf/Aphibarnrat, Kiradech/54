Q. Having dropped a shot on 17, you must have feared the worse with the tee shot on 18, but it was a fantastic approach?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, it is.  I have been striking the ball well all day.  The driver has been quite well, and some missed shots.  And the worst two shots at the end is tee shot on 17 and 18.  But it's good to recover on the last hole and very nice putt to hole the last birdie.
Q. The TV commentator said your second on 15 was an impossible shot.  575 yards and you hit the green in 2?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Well, I know maybe -- hit about 280 yards with really heavy -- cold weather, I was able to hit it that long.  After I strike the ball is when it fly in the air and it was like a bullet.  It went down and my caddie is saying you might get on the green.  Like the TV commenting, it is an unbelievable shot that I can reach by 2.
Q. You won the match play.  You finished tied fourth at the Dunhill last week.  Scotland has been been kind to you and it looks like you enjoy playing in England now as well?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yes, I get to use to the weather maybe.  Hopefully one day Thailand will be the same.  We've got this weather, so I get to used it and I can be more in Europe.  It has taken for me three years, and finally I will play with the weather well and get used to the golf course.
Q. Finally, just hopes for the weekend?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Still playing the same game, concentrate, play my own game, strike the ball good, roll the greens well and just try to manage.
