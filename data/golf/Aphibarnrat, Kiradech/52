Q. Are you going to remember all the birdies you made or is the bogey on 18 going to live in your head?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I think a little bit more on 18, the last bogey.  I played golf good all day, some bad shots but still holed some putts.  Even the last hole, very difficult.  I hit a bad drive, but still in the middle of the fairway and a good chance to make a birdie and lead by one or two strokes.  Bad shot on second and made six.  But tomorrow, 18 holes to go.
Q. Was it overall a good day?  What were you anticipating?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: We were still playing the same game.  Was playing quite well the last couple months and through this week, rolling on the green was great.   Just give a chance for a putt and hope to do well.
Q. You had a very exciting front nine today.
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Good start.  Birdie first two holes and hit a lot of good shots.  Chip-in on 8 was great.  Struggling a bit on the middle, but the last, bogeyed the par 5.
Q. Have you played with Rory before?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, we've been playing junior golf.  We were talking today, in 2006, it's been so quick, nine years.  He's a very nice guy and such a good player.
Q. How have you adjusted to your game around the rest of the world?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I spent almost two years, looking back at the result, 2014, didn't play well, struggling with the weather, golf course and everything.  Then I've been learning a lot, a lot of experience that I've been playing around the world and it's a big help.
Q. Are you looking forward to tomorrow?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Yeah, of course, just try to play my game.  A lot of top players coming up.  Rory is coming up, a couple strokes behind.  Then I just play my game, try to hole some putts and concentrate.
