Q. How was that?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Got a good start, hit solid shots and rolled the putt well but at the end of the day doesn't strike the ball as well as I used to do.  Same as every day, my iron game isn't sharp enough to make.  I think so far I hit like seven greens in regulation, which is like so low.
Q. Accuracy is quite key around this course, isn't it?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: Exactly because the wind picks up and the wind get involved a lot this week and made the golf course more difficult.  A lot of chance in the fairways and on the greens, got a lot of opportunities to win this event.
Well, I still have to work hard on my game to get everything.
Q. Justin Rose at the moment is having trouble on 17, and you might not be that far off the lead.  Do you have a number in mind for tomorrow?
KIRADECH APHIBARNRAT: I have to get off to a very hot start and just keep it going.  I really need a low number to have a chance but par 5s are the goal for me this week.
