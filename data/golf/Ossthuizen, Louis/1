Q. Good week for the South Africans.  Goosen, Schwartzel is obviously up there.  1-under par today for Louis Oosthuizen.
Very well played.  Tough day out there on the Copperhead Course.  How difficult was it playing?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: It was definitely -- the wind was a little bit different direction and quite a lot stronger.  I played really well.  Left a lot of birdies out there and I felt if I could get to 5-under it might be a good target because 16 wasn't playing easy.  17 today, I think you'll see a few birdies there, it was 7-iron straight downwind, not a difficult pin.  So, then 18, very difficult pin.
Q. The guys are backing up.  2-under there.  Coming off the two dropped shots.
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: Yeah, just a normal, good standard 7-iron for me.  I got lucky with the distance there and so, yeah, probably the best shot of the day.
Q. Being here the last couple years, how did you figure it out?
LOUIS OOSTHUIZEN: I struggled on the greens always.  I couldn't see the lines and I was never -- I like the layout of the golf course.  This year the changes, I know the greens are a little slow but we see the lines and so it will be all right.
I'm going to watch this carefully if I need the stay or not.
