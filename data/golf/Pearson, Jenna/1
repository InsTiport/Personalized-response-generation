   MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Jenna Pearson into the interview room. Congratulations on your round of 68 today. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Thank you.
 MODERATOR: Monday qualifier. Actually shot 68 that day on this course. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yes.
 MODERATOR: How much did you carry over what you learned Monday into your round today?
 JENNA PEARSON: Quite bit actually, because I didn't get in a practice round on Tuesday or Wednesday. So Monday was my only chance to look at it. You know, I just had such a good feeling from Monday that I just was able to keep that going for today.
 MODERATOR: You're playing on the Futures Tour this season.
 JENNA PEARSON: Yes.
 MODERATOR: How has that gone for you kind of leading up to this? Have you felt pretty good about your game coming into this week? 
 JENNA PEARSON: I've been working on some things early in the season, so I feel like it's finally just coming together for me. You know, I'm just so excited to be out here that it's easy to play well when you're out here and you're excited for it.
 I was with my putting coach a couple weeks ago, so was working on my putting stroke. Just everything feels really good.
 MODERATOR: Native of Wheaton, Illinois, not too far from here. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yes.
 MODERATOR: What does it mean to be able to play in this event? 
 JENNA PEARSON: Oh, it's awesome. My family has come down. My mom and dad are here and my sister's going to be here tomorrow. 
 So it's pretty special that it's so close to home being my first event. So, yeah.
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Like you said, Monday was really your only, quote, practice round. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yeah. 

 Q. I think you missed the cut in Iowa at the Futures event. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yes.

 Q. What was your frame of mind coming down here? Maybe you had that day in between. I don't know. Were you still in a good frame of mind coming here?
 JENNA PEARSON: Yeah, I missed the cut in Iowa, but I felt like I did a lot of things good. You know, I just came into the week not too many high expectations. Sometimes my problem is I put a lot of pressure on myself. 
 So I just came in, and it's just a free opportunity to hopefully qualify. I did, so it was a good day. 

 Q. Just the timeline, you went to South Carolina. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yes.

 Q. Have you been out of college...
 JENNA PEARSON: I graduated '07, so I've been out a few years.

 Q. So basically Futures Tour since then?
 JENNA PEARSON: Yeah, played Futures Tour. Last year I didn't play the Futures Tour, I just played Canadian. Just was working on my some stuff in my swing. 
 But, yeah, Futures Tour after I graduated.

 Q. Your mom, I guess that was on Monday, it was a little hot. Is she doing okay now?
 JENNA PEARSON: She's doing good, yeah. She followed all day today, so she's doing good.

 Q. The players coming in here this week, they've talked about the course. The players who had been here a number of times talked about how the rough maybe compared to come years being a little thicker and that type of thing. Although I think somebody said they did mow the rough some, any situations today where you were? Any nasty rough? Was it pretty playable?
 JENNA PEARSON: I was in the rough a couple times today. I thought it was better than Monday. I was in the rough once on Monday and had to basically just chip out. So I think they did cut it a little bit, but it's still pretty gnarly out there.

 Q. Two 68s in a row. You've got to be really excited. Good position. Maybe make the cut tomorrow, hopefully. 
 JENNA PEARSON: Yeah, well, I'm going to try not to think about anything like that and just continue what I was doing today and just focus on each shot, one shot at a time. 

 Q. You went to Wheaton Warrenville South High School. 
 JENNA PEARSON: I did.

 Q. Did you play any other sports other than golf?
 JENNA PEARSON: Just golf.

 Q. How young were you when you kind of got serious about it?
 JENNA PEARSON: I started when I was probably eight, and high school was about the time I got real serious about it and kind of knew that was what I wanted to do. 

 Q. You said your folks are here today. Maybe a little more family tomorrow, and hopefully weekend?
 JENNA PEARSON: Yeah, yeah. 
 MODERATOR: Thank you very much.
 JENNA PEARSON: All right. Thank you.
