Q. Karoline, 4-under, one off the lead in what is an incredible field this week.  You must be pinching yourself.  You must be very excited?
KAROLINE LUND: It's so cool to just compete against those that have been your idols, like your whole life, and you've only watched them on television.  It's really nice to be here and compete against them and see how the level is.
Q. You've played quite a lot of links golf before.  Where did you do that and how has it helped you today?
KAROLINE LUND: I think you need a lot of experience just to handle the wind and just the links golf, and you know, it's not like playing in the US or regular courses.  So I just feel like being an amateur and played a lot of links golf, it just helped me a lot.
Q. It's important to have a good caddie.  How did your caddie help you?  Is your father on the bag?
KAROLINE LUND: He's caddied for me like many times.  Yeah, we really fit together and I think he's quite calm and yeah, it's a good match I think.
Q. I don't want to put any pressure on you, but after such a good start, do you have any goals for the rest of the week?
KAROLINE LUND: I'm just trying to be really calm and just do what I did today, and just see how it goes.  But of course, I have expectations of my golf, as well.
Q. Which are?
KAROLINE LUND: Top-10.  Let's see Top-10, yeah.
