Q. Thoughts on the finish?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, disappointing. He looks like a bomber and he was hitting bomber on my head in the beginning with his putter. There you go. I was too far after seven holes. Even if I try to come back, he gave me some help.
Q. But you did come back. How proud are you and how much can you build on that going into a new season -- this is the end -- into a new season, to know that you can do this?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Well, you never know you can do this as long as you not do it. If you do it, you know exactly. I know I can be around and golf one day will give it to me. But it's like a huge championship guys around me this week, Tommy and Rory and Jon. I did not expect anything else than what happened today. I knew if I was going to be 20-under, I had my chance. 17 was too short. That's it.
