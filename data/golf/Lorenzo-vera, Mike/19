 Q.  Your thoughts on 3-under today, please?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: That was really good actually, because I've been struggling with my driver for the past two years and now I'm finding some fairways.   
So I have plenty of opportunities of birdies, so I'm hitting the ball really solid and managed to make a few putts on these hard greens.   
 Q.  What were conditions out there today compared to the last two days?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: That was almost the same I think.  Except that they put the forward tee on 9, which makes it holidays almost compared to yesterday.  So it's more or less the same course as yesterday.   
 Q.  Nice position going into the final day.  You must be pleased.  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, well, they still have plenty of holes to play.  So maybe it's going to be five or six shots behind.  At least I'm playing good. That's what I'm trying to do and we'll see what happens at the end.   
 Q.  And it's your birthday today.  Just got the cake.  How much of a surprise was that?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: That was a pretty good surprise because there was absolutely no hint for me to see that.  And, well, Miles Tunnicliff saw me on 18 and just said a nice happy birthday, so I thought, okay, it's going to be pretty calm, and it was not.  So that was very nice of them.  Thank you.   
 Q.  Anything planned for tonight?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: No, I'm going to try to put myself in good position for tomorrow morning.  Going to stay steady, have a Skype with the family and that's it.
