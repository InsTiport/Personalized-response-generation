Q. How much do you look forward to this event every year?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Well, it's always a great moment for me to come here because the people are so nice.  The course is really challenging.  Well, it's a big tournament, so I'm always happy to play a big tournament.
Q. I think you've had one good performance in this event but it's an event that's not been kind to you the last few years.  What do you put that down to?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Mostly my attitude, asking myself too much on this golf course.  My focus was not always where it should be.  You know, a lot of friends, a lot of trying to enjoy with the public and stuff.  So not enough, as you say, focus on the game, and asking myself too much on this course, that's all.
Q. Just tell us about the final four holes.  A lot of golfers saying they are probably four of the toughest holes you play to finish a round of golf.
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, you need to absolutely hit good tee shots.  Unless you catch the fairways, the holes are a little too hard because it's big greens and you can manage to do something.  If you miss your tee shots, it's bogey time.
Q. And of course this is the second Rolex Series, a new thing this year for The European Tour.  How exciting is that to have these big money events on Tour this year?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, I'm very happy that this happens finally, because everybody speaks about the PGA TOUR as like kind of the biggest tour.  But for me, you know, we go around the world everywhere all year.  We have very different courses.  We have people coming from everywhere from the world to play.  So I think this tour has always been stronger for me than the PGA.  The Tour deserves to have these big events to be more recognised, and so I think the guys are doing really well.
