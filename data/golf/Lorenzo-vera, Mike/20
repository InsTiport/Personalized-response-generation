 Q.  It's been a pretty good week?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: It's been a very good week.  Really tough start, the first few holes of the tournament were a bit tricky, but managed to get my head on the shoulders and there you go.   
 Q.  How have things differed day-to-day because the greens have been very responsive, you've been able to attack and we've had a bit of wet.  Has it been tough mentally?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: No, it's always nice to have five meters of backspin what 7-iron sometimes, and you feel like you have fantastic contact.  That was really fun.  It changes a bit from last week, which was links and that was still hard.  So you had to adapt your game.  Clearly I prefer this game than the links course.  Missed the cut last week.   
 Q.  Being back on the main tour, sixth in France, tied fifth here at the moment.  That goes down as a pretty good year for you?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: It is a very good year, because I come back from four years of struggling.  We are working really well with all my team, my family, my brother, my girlfriend, everybody is just doing really good, and I have some really good advices.   
 Q.  And the overall experience this week, over 50,000 people have been here over four days.  Has it been good to play?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: It's lovely.  The crowd is unbelievable.  A bit like the French Open, a big week and I managed to do something good there.  So the place is unbelievable here, plus the crowd, fantastic.  There you go, just have to enjoy yourself and play some good golf.
