JOHN DEVER:   Good afternoon.  Welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship here at TPC Harding Park.  Pleased to be joined again by Mike Lorenzo-Vera.  Mike closed with a 74 today, finished the championship at even par.
Q. Very few complaints it seemed about this golf course this week, and I just wonder why.  Not that they should complain, but what did you guys like about it, and was there anything that you would complain about?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA:   No, there's nothing to complain about.  You know, they managed -- I was here last week, okay, to prepare, and I've seen the way they moved the course from actually playable to something proper hard.  That's what you expect in a major championship.  You expect like proper difficult -- every shot must be difficult.  So they managed to do that really well.
Well, it's really fair.  You hit the fairway, you've got a shot for the win.  Somewhere inside five meters if you hit a good shot from the fairway you will be able to catch a birdie putt.  If you miss the fairway, job finished for the birdie.  Yeah, they've done an incredible job.  The greens are pure all day long.  They're challenging, and everything is just perfect now.
Q. You'd like to come back here if they had another major?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA:   Yeah.  Anyplace where there is a major, anyplace, but mostly here because it looks awesome.  This parkland is incredibly good-looking, and yeah, yeah.  Now I'm going to have to go home and just keep the pictures in my mind.
JOHN DEVER:   Mike, thank you so much.  Safe travels.
