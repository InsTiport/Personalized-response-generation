Q. Good results at Doha, good results in China, good results today.  How do you feel?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Really good.  Really good.  I mean, I knew that was going to be a huge mental test here, and I was ready -- my head was ready to go there.  Sometimes my swing was not, but my head was ready.  Tough to keep the head where it should be so very proud of what I've done today.
Q. What was the biggest test over the course of the round?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Think off the tee.  The tee, if you don't catch the fairway, bye-bye.  So I try to camp as much fairway as you can, and then just don't try to get too crazy when you're in the rough, just take your wedge out and do par, or if you manage to do a great shot and do bogey, just don't put yourself in double-bogey.
Q. How difficult is it going to be maintain?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: It's going to be very difficult.  If I continue playing like that, I'm going to sleep less and less, shake more and more.  Yeah, I know what's waiting me the few days coming.  First of all, I'm going to have a good rest, speak to my psychologist, I guess, and then here we go.
