 Q.  Your thoughts please?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Well, that was cool until the end.  I've played a very solid game of golf.  Putter was very hot.  I'm very disappointed by the finish, but pleased I managed to put myself into position again.   
 Q.  You must take some positives from this week; the putting, as you say was really hot.  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, today it was very hot.  Off the tee was good.  It's been a while; I haven't been playing good off the tee, so I'm very happy about it.  Try to take the positive.   
 Q.  Understand the disappointment at the moment, but positive going into next week?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, if I can keep the driver like that all week, I think I'm going to put myself again into something interesting.
