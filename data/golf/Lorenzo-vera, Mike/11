 Q.  7-under par to open this tournament, very pleasing way to get things under way here in Abu Dhabi.  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, definitely.  I have to say I've been sick for the last two days, like really bad throat and fever, so had really bad nights.  So very happy about the start anyway.   
 Q.  What kind of challenges does this golf course throw at you?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Mostly you have to hit it pretty straight off the tee, and then after that the game is not too hard because it's not windy now, so if you manage to catch the fairways far, you're going to have plenty of chances.   
 Q.  Obviously you came very close to getting that first win last year.  Is that something that's on your mind going into a new season and being positive about tournaments?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, it's going to be definitely my objective to catch at least one, but we are trying to just be out of the result and then just try to work well and then the results will come.   
 Q.  You've just become a new dad for the second time.  How is that going at the moment?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Oh, yeah, for me much better than for my wife because I'm here so I can have sleep, so she's struggling, but she's a brave woman.  She's handling it very well.
