 Q.  Happy with your start to this tournament?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Bogey-free, and the long game was proper consistent.  Very happy the way I've been hitting the ball today was really a good performance.   
 Q.  This is one of those golf courses you have to plot your way around, and a lot you have to take into account, not having dropped a shot, must be one of the most pleasing factors.  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, I've been working really hard on my swing like the last three, four days, even in Turkey, I was out of the tournament.  I searched for something that can make me hit the driver good, and I think I found it.  Managed to hit good off the tee here and makes it easier if you come from the fairway.   
 Q.  It's been a good year for you so far.  How much are you looking forward to the rest of this week and Dubai next week?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, I'm really enjoying because I feel that I'm playing good.  It's not far from having a really, really strong week soon.  So yeah, looking forward to what's coming.   
 Q.  The overall experience of being here at Sun City and South Africa, it's a lot of distractions, but how much can you enjoy the week as well as playing serious golf?  
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Well, you have to be serious because the course wants you to be serious.  I have fun on the plane going to Dubai.  Every time, it's a great moment to be in South Africa.  The courses are fantastic every time and the quality is great.   
Here, I was talking on the course yesterday, see some elephants, see some zebras today.  It's something you don't see often.  It's nice, just pure pleasure.
