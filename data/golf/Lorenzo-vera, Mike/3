  THE MODERATOR:   Good afternoon, welcome back to the 2020 PGA Championship.  We are pleased to be joined by Mike Lorenzo-Vera.
 Mike, terrific round today, 66, 3-under par on the back nine.  Perhaps you could tell us a little bit how you closed so strong.
 MIKE LORENZO-VERA:   Well, I managed to hit really good shots.  Like proper, strong shots.  So that was nice.  And, well, I had a game plan.  I've been here for long now, because I was quarantining here.  I had a game plan and I was sticking to it, and managed to hit the good shots at the same time.  So yeah, that was cool.
 JOHN DEVER:   Thanks for visiting.  We appreciate your time.
