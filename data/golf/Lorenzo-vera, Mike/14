Q. Moving day and a round of 65 has seen you do just that up the leaderboard?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, that was cool, man.  Just managed to hit a few good shots with the work going in a good way now.  A bit late but we're going to take what's coming, yeah.
Q. Been a fairly steady start to the tournament.  Pin positions a little bit more generous today?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: I didn't check.  Honestly, that's what they told me, and I know one or two tees were up in front, so for sure it's making the holes a bit easier.  Pin positions, yeah, well, 17 was easy.  It was a bit more scorable.
Q. What do you find the biggest test is around this golf course?
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: It's not really the golf course, the problem.  It's myself.  I'm struggling off the tee for a while now, and today I managed to hit really good shots on the tee.
And then, well, just have to be patient and a bit smart here.  Sometimes being smart doesn't mean to hit a shot like ten metres short left.  Sometimes you have to take the pin on because maybe that little chip shot is easier than a ten-metre putt with a double-breaker on the green.  Just have to use your brain.
Q. Still a lot of golf to be played today but you should be nicely at the right end of the leaderboard come the end of play.
MIKE LORENZO-VERA: Yeah, well, we'll see what happens.  I'm just going to try to relax this afternoon and let hope for not too much birdies in front of me, but I think there will be plenty.
So I think maybe the lead will be around 15 maybe.  I will still be far away from the lead tomorrow morning, so keep going and see what happens.
