 Q. Obviously, you're one of the favorites in this event.   
MARK RYPIEN: Why?  
   
 Q. Besides you, who are you picking and why?   
MARK RYPIEN: Mulder, just because, one, he plays in the summer, and he hits it far, and it's a golf course he can take driver out every hole.  
   
 Q. Who are you picking in the Super Bowl? Who are you picking to win it?   
MARK RYPIEN: Who's in the Super Bowl? That's a good question.  
   
 Q. You've still got some teams. Atlanta and Seattle in the NFC.   
MARK RYPIEN: Atlanta. You wish you had Atlanta.  
   
 Q. Arizona, New England.  
MARK RYPIEN: Arizona is going to win their first Super Bowl.  
   
 Q. Are they?   
MARK RYPIEN: Yes.  
   
 Q. Redskins, pretty good year this year, got in the playoffs. What are you looking for from them in the future?   
MARK RYPIEN: I think Cousins just gained a lot of confidence from not only his players but the organization to say, hey, he's going to be our guy. As long as him and Jay Gruden stay together, I think they're going to be pretty good.
