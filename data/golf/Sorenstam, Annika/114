 Q.  What went wrong? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's not so much what was wrong.  They just played good, very well, and they did six birdies.  It's not much we could do today. 

 Q.  Did you play well together? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We had a very slow beginning.  It was very hard to start off, but the last holes was working very good, but it's not much you can do sometimes. 

 Q.  When you were playing well, what was working the best then? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We have the same type of game.  They are very similar in various aspects.  It's comfortable to play together.  We have done it so many times. 

 Q.  What would have happened that you would have won? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  They did six birdies.  We couldn't do much about it. 

 Q.  What is your feeling, Catriona?  Is it something for your game? 
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I thought I drove the ball well, but my irons weren't as quite sharp as I would like them.
