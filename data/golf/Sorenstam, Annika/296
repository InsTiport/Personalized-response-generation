 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's raining, you guys. 

Q.  Could you talk about your round.  How far you got and where you were in relation to par when you finished?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well I played 10 holes.  I wasn't really keeping score, but level, plus one, something like that.  I had a good team so I didn't have to finish on every hole.

Q.  You're a day away now or less than 24 hours away.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Don't remind me. 

Q.  How do you feel as it gets closer?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Obviously I'm very happy to be here.  Tomorrow's the day I've been waiting for for a long time.  I'm excited.  I just hope it clears up a little bit and I can enjoy it. 

Q.  How will the rain affect your play?  Obviously the course, the fairways will be a little wetter, you're not going to get as much roll, but the greens will be more receptive.  Does that help you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The course is obviously playing much longer, almost 300 yards total.  So the only good news is that the greens are softer so I can fire more at the flag.  So I'll do my best.  I'm going hit a few longer clubs than I expected.  But luckily I got them in my bag so we'll see what happens.

Q.  What about the huge galleries that have been following you for a practice round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I never seen anything like it.  Last time I saw crowds like this was U.S. Open on a Sunday.  So it was great to have them all here.

Q.  Talk about your swing?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I worked a little on my swing and I was more calm than yesterday.  I hit some good shots.  I love the golf course.  It's much different than I thought it would be, because of the water obviously. 

Q.  What kind of scores did you have going?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Around par or 1-over after 10 is what I think.  Like I said, I didn't keep score. 

Q.  How about the buttons?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I love the buttons.  It's nice of them to wear it. 

Q.  The chip in on 4.  Tell us about that nice little chip in?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hit driver on the par-3 and chipped it in for 2.  So it was pretty sweet.  But my team didn't use my score.  One guy made 2 for a 1.

Q.  How do you think you'll sleep tonight?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hope good. 

Q.  Are you able to prepare enough?  Are you comfortable going into the first round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I can't prepare any more.  I've been waiting for this day for a long time, I've been practicing a lot the last few months and I want the day to come.  It's here.  So whatever happens, happens. 

Q.  You said you didn't keep score.  Did you realize you were supposed to be posting a score and not picking up?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, was I?  Well we don't do that on my tour so I guess I got to learn the rules over here.

Q.  Are you more comfortable with this than you were yesterday?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, I think the more I play this golf course, the more I'm around everything and getting used to the guys and it's just going to make me feel more comfortable. 

Q.  Did you feel you're making history here?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well it seems like it, yes.  Sure does. 

Q.  All these people out here for just a pro-am, what do you think it's going to be like Thursday and Friday and if you make the cut to play the weekend?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I can't imagine.  This is tremendous.  All the support and to show up on a day like today is incredible. 

Q.  Is your take on this that the course will play longer?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Totally.  Like I said it's at least 300 yards longer than I expected in the way it sets up.

Q.  Is your game where you want it to be?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, it is. 

Q.  How important is the putting and chipping?  A lot of people talked about the length and how far it is, what about the chipping and putting?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The chipping and putting is obviously important because the course is getting longer and longer.  And there might be holes where, if I can't reach it, then obviously I've got to chip well.  When the conditions are tough you got to rely on short game.  So it's very important.
