Q.  You hit the ball so well, certainly you only missed one green on Friday.  You hit like 22 or 23 of the last 24 greens.  The putter just didn't come through when you needed it.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I'm very pleased with the way I played all week.  I hit the ball really well.  I think I hit some good putts.  I tried again and that's all you can do.  I'm very proud of my performance and it just seems like Meg was playing some excellent golf.
Q.  Did you think a 65 was out there?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, she's played excellent golf.  If you shoot that low on Sunday you're most likely going to win.  I thought I put on a good performance on today, that's pretty much all I can do.
Q.  Well, there's no question you played very very well.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.
