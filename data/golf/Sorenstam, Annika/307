 DANA VON LOUDA:  Three birdies out there, one bogey.  I know you were practicing putting a little bit afterwards.  Tell us how your round went.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Do you want me to go over the card or talk in general?  I'm so pleased with my round.  I know I hit the ball really well again today.  I believe I hit 16 greens, so I had a lot of opportunities.  And pretty much the same scenario as yesterday, didn't make as many as I'd like, but I was patient and I kept trying to hit it closer and closer to the pin.  That was my story today.  I felt if I just pretty much holed it from the fairway, I would get I birdie, that's what I was trying to do. 
On 14, I didn't have to read that putt.  That was nice.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   My coach is here and he says there's not much wrong, but I felt I was hitting every lip too hard or too soft.  So my speed was off a little bit.  He said it looked like the putter was coming up after I hit it, so we were working on keeping the putter low after I hit it.  When I started doing that, I felt I got a little truer roll, and it felt like the ball was tracking a little bitter.  Now it's rolling a little nicer and hopefully that will keep the line better and it will go into tomorrow.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I just walked in here and saw what Meg had.  It doesn't feel like that at all.  Like I said, I felt like I left so many out there, I was going to be behind.  Maybe other players are leaving putts out there as well.  There's got to be a reason for it.  However, the wind was a little stronger today, especially on the front nine.  I thought it was playing a little tougher.  A little tougher pin placements as well.  But on the back nine, it seemed like the wind died a little bit.  It should have been easier to score, I think.  I just didn't take the opportunity.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, tomorrow is just another day.  I mean everybody is right there, so I have to play my own game tomorrow.  Right now I just want to make some putts.  I'm going to think more about that than anything and worry about my own game.  When Sunday comes, we'll see what kind of position I'm in.  If I'm being chased, then I may play conservative on certain holes.  But if I'm chasing somebody,  I have nothing to lose, and I'll play aggressive all day long.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, that ranks way up there.  I tell a lot of people, it's not a game of how good your good shots are, I think it's how good your bad shots are.  And I think that's true.  Sometimes if I hit a bad shot, I don't end up in the woods or in the water.  That's the key here.  I might not hit it to 5 feet all the time, but I have a birdie putt.  Not a lot of things can go wrong when you have birdie putts.  It's when your bad shots are really bad and you have to drop or you put yourself in unplayable places.  That's when the numbers get really high.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Actually, I don't keep track of my penalty shots.  It's not many.  I mean, it would be less than half in a tournament, I would say.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Maybe I should do that stat.  No, I don't.  It's not that many that I think it really matters.  I think it's more when I miss a fairway, for example, then I would know it's a bad tee shot.  That's the way I would look at it.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, that sounds about right.  It's a tough golf course, but I'm playing as well as I can, I think.  I missed three greens in two days.  I would think I would be a few more under.  It shows when the other ladies are right there, that it's not that easy out there.  I have to stay positive and say, hey, I'm still leading the tournament.  I have to be happy about that.  I feel so good about my game that I'm positive and then I get down on myself as well.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, it's tough to say.  I mean, on the first hole, I have 5 feet for birdie. 
On 15, I probably had another 5-footer.  I felt like I was at least four better today and we're talking within at least six feet.  They're not gimmes, but I'm hitting them close.  I feel if I make, especially the first one, then I get the momentum and several will follow, and a lot of times that's the case when I play.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I don't feel like.  My anger doesn't go away if I hit a driver.  My anger goes away if I make birdie on the next hole.  And to make birdie on the next hole, in this particular case, I cannot hit driver, so I have got to keep playing to make birdies. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   You don't want to know.  I'm pretty tough on myself.  When I don't want people to hear and when I want people to hear.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I have become Americanized.  You should ask my parents.  I think I'm very Swedish in certain things.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I don't know if that would count, but yeah.  Yes, I do that.  If you count that, I watch baseball and basketball.  I love those sports.  Yankees.  I don't know, off the top of my head.  I'm materialistic, I think.  I don't know if that's American.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   No. 3, hit in the green-side bunker with a 5-iron -- no, I hit a 6-iron in the green-side bunker and hit it up to five feet. 
No. 6, hit sand wedge to five feet.  I was also actually in the green-side bunker.  I went for the green with a driver. 
Bogeyed No. 9, hit a sand wedge, three putts from 12 feet. 
Birdied No. 13, 9-iron to about a foot.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   139 to the pin, carry 127 over the bunker.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Breeze, downwind, left to right.  I had 238 to carry -- well, to the front of the green. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   To find my rhythm, I guess.
