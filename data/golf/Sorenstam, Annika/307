Q.  Pat Hurst, just got the tiger by the tail out there today? 
PAT HURST:  The Europeans played well, they made three birdies.  They are playing great. 


Q.  Was there a turning point in the match?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, we played very solid all day.  We got off to a birdie on the second, and then we went two up after four, so we played good and solid all day, and we just didn't make many mistakes.

Q.  What do you think about the golf course?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I love it, it's great.

Q.  Donald Ross?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I love Donald Ross.  It fits my game really well.


Q.  What would you say is the turning point out here in the match?
KELLY ROBBINS:  Well, I really never got anything going from the get-go.  We made some really good putts early when we needed to, and  --

Q.  You held your own throughout the match as far as being all square. 
KELLY ROBBINS:  Yeah, yeah.

Q.  And then the wheels kind of came off. 
KELLY ROBBINS:  Yeah, a little bit.  And they made birdies.  I mean, anytime you make birdies, you more than likely are going to win a hole, and we hit a few close, and didn't make any, but then nothing  -- we just knew that we were going to have to get something going with them making the birdies; they were doing it, and we didn't.  So no one likes to lose and I am sure Pat and I will get over it and play hard. 

Q.  Thanks very much for your time.  Thank you.
