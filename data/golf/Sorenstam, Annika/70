 Q. Annika just talk about your last round here at the LPGA championship?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well I played very well today. I made a lot of great shots especially my iron shots. Just very, very good. Just didn't convert today. I mean, I'm disappointed about my finish because I felt like I played so well. 
 It's just tough when you give it all and you just really don't feel like you are getting anything out of it. But overall its been a great week. I played very well and I'm going to take that away from this week.

 Q. Any nostalgia walking off 18?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, it is. I mean, I wanted to do well here. I felt good all week. I thought this was going to be my week. So close and not being able to finish. But it's been a great championship. I've done well here. And lots of wonderful memories.

 Q. Is there a shot you would want back? I would imagine it was the two putts you left short there?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I had a lot of putts. I don't know where to begin. A dozen or two I would do it.

 Q. How far was the putt on 18?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: 12 feet probably.

 Q. Did you find yourself leader board watching throughout the back nine?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I always watch the leader boards. I enjoy it that's why I play here. I like to know where I stand and what I do.

 Q. What do you say about Maria going into the playoffs?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I wish her all the best I really hope she will win it.

 Q. Talk about the crowd giving you a nice hand when you walked off 18?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: That was wonderful. Like I said, it's been a great place and the fans have been very supportive and, you know, I like it here. I'll miss it.

 Q. (No microphone.) Once you're done is it going to be fun to watch this. Unable to participate but still watch?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Sure. I'm here for another six months so I'm just going to focus on my game. I will be around golf I'm sure I will follow them and wish them all good luck but right now I'm just focusing on my game.
