Q.  Annika, that's another point to the Europeans.  Another five and three victory.  Does the margin of the victory matter?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't really think so.  A point is a point, but obviously it's nice to win.  I think the bigger the number, the better the momentum.  I think Suzann and I play really good together.  I'm really pleased the way it turned out.


Q.  How does today compare to what happened at Colonial?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Of course this feels much better right now.  The crowd I must say might even be bigger here.  It's wonderful to see everybody come out and cheer us on.


Q.  Suzann, how was it playing with the world's number one?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Very good.  I think we played quite solid together.  Let's keep it there. 


Q.  It seemed at one stage when the sun came out, the pace of the greens might have changed a little bit.  Did you find you had to make an adjustment?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Not really.  I've been putting a lot.  Annika has hardly been testing the greens.  I have something to work on, but they're working pretty good. 


Q.  Annika, this is a dream start for the Europeans, isn't it.  It couldn't have really gone much better?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I agree with you.  This is definitely the start that we wanted.  But, again, there's a long way to go.  We've got to be patient and look at one match at a time and go from there.
