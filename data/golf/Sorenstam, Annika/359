KIRSTEN SEABORG:  One more day left.  Do you just want to comment on the week, what your strategy may be this week?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think our strategy is we want to get the trophy back on Sunday and we've had a few days to practice and I think we're really looking forward to play.  It's going to be some tough matches, but I think we're all excited.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Pretty much how I feel.


Q.  Are you going out tomorrow together?  You're paired tomorrow together?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We don't know yet.  We've had a few combinations going, but we're going to decide this afternoon.  So unfortunately, can't give you any tips on what we're going to do.


Q.  Catrin, this is your 4th SOLHEIM CUP.  How do you think it has developed?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Oh, I think it's a huge difference between the first in Scotland and this one. Just the media, you guys.  I don't know.  We got a number the other day.  It's quadrupled, at least.  I think the rivalry between the teams are getting worse and worse each and every event.  So it's fantastic. It's getting to be very, very nice event.


Q.  Did you have gallery following you today in your practice rounds?  And if so, can you sort of give us a feel for things you're hearing and seeing?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  We had about, what, 10,000, European fans (Laughs). No.  We had quite -- Annika, you didn't play today.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I didn't.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  We had maybe a hundred or so.  They seemed to want our autographs, anyway.  I didn't hear any comments.  But there were some Europeans out there.  It was nice.  Nice to see people show up for the practice round.


Q.  Why didn't you play, Annika?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I played Tuesday and  Wednesday and think I knew the course.  And today I just kind of spent my time on the driving range and worked out the -- try and do some smaller things.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  She doesn't need to practice that much.  (Laughs).


Q.  Annika, do you feel pressure being on the top of the money list?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, I like to do well and hopefully I can play as well this week as I have the last few weeks.  I really want to give the team as many points as I can and hopefully I can support the team by being very positive and a lot of energy and points, but I don't feel like my points are more important than any other player's point.  If we get a point from everybody, that is important.  But I know that I'm probably going to play all five matches, which gives me an opportunity to collect a lot of points and I don't know if you can call it an anchor or not, but I want to play well, of course.


Q.  With six Swedes on the team, do you Swedes feel more pressure that you'll have to perform better?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I don't.  Anyway, just because we're Swedes doesn't mean -- just because Pia is the coach or anything like that.  She picked the players that she thinks are the best players and whether or not -- what country they're from, I don't think that matters.  We've all proven we can play well and that's why we're here.


Q.  Annika, do you think you're going to play all five matches for this course; wear anybody out over five matches in three days?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I was tired two years ago.  I got to play all five then, too.  But this year, like I said, I've been working out, trying to get really fit.  I feel that I play better the more I play.  So I'll be tired on Sunday, I know that, but I want to give it all and I want to play the matches and I want to do the best I can.


Q.  Have you done anything special to -- physical training or something like that to be -- to be able to go five matches and not be that tired?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Nothing like -- I'm not just working out for this week.  I'm working out for the whole year for myself, of course.  Like I said, I will be tired.  It's a lot of golf and there is a lot  of pressure.  If you play in the morning, then you get to rush in and have some lunch and then rush out again.  I'll be tired, but hopefully I can get a good night's rest between the matches.  I'm not going to do anything else but play.  That's where all my energy is going, so hopefully that will be enough.


Q.  Is it important that you have around all of the boyfriends and husbands and daughters?  It seems like you all live together in a couple of houses.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Well, it's a little stressful to have the daughter around.  But, no, it's -- we just live with the caddie or the spouse in the villas.  It's just a team, basically.  But -- oh, yeah.  Definitely.  It's wonderful to have some people flying in from Sweden, family members and to have -- I think as normal as possible, too, to not make it that much of a difference off the golf course so that we just feel good and relaxed and have fun when we step off the course.


Q.  Some of the Americans players spoke about the oddity of playing for one week out of the year against each other when you guys play together so often.  Could you comment on that, both of you?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  It is, but I think that's what makes this week so special and unique and fun.  I think we all -- at least, I really want this cup to be a good Cup out of a golf point of view and to raise women's golf to higher levels.  So of course we want to win.  We really want to bring the Cup back.  But at the same time, I hope we get to go out and play really good golf, the way we can do.  It's not really difficult.  It's just fun.  It's different.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think I agree with Catrin.  That's why this week is so special.  I'm just trying to think -- I have as many friends on the U.S. Team as I do on the European.  For some reason, you come here and you just turn very yellow and blue and this is -- I think -- because we spend so much time over here -- at least I feel the distance from Europe sometimes and this is very good for me and I've become very patriotic.  So I don't have a problem playing against them at all.  That's why I'm really fired up.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  I think also it's not all of  a sudden we're here on one Monday.  It's something we work up -- a feel, rivalry.  We work it up throughout the year, really.  We talk about it all year, I should say.  So we're pretty prepared when we come here.  We belong to Europe and we're going to fight against them.


Q.  Catrin, how different are your expectations from when you holed that putter at Dalmahoy, from that week to this week?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  I think I expect to -- I probably didn't have any expectations that week except to just go out and just be here.  Now I just want to play -- now I feel like I should play good golf.  That's the difference, I think.


Q.  What's the biggest difference in playing SOLHEIM CUP in Europe and playing in the States?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Singing on the first tee, isn't it?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Hopefully we're singing here, too.  I think when we come here, our team might -- most of the supporters -- I'm sure they're going to carry U.S. flags.  But I also think that the pressure is more on them than on us.  So in that respect, I think it's better for us.  I don't know.  I don't mind playing here at all.  The fans are very supportive. They still want our autographs.  So I guess that's a good sign, too.

KIRSTEN SEABORG:  One more question.


Q.  Annika, Pia said yesterday that she would not rule out the possibility of teaming you up with your sister.  Would you be for that or against it?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I've talked to Pia a lot about it and I think she is going to make the decision.  Like I said earlier, we're going to talk about it in a few hours; so we'll see what she is going to put together.

KIRSTEN SEABORG:  Actually the pairings have just come out and Pia is going to come in with Laura. But first Judy is going to be coming in with Meg.  So do we have anymore questions for these two?  Thank you.
