Q. Not the afternoon you wanted, but how do you reflect on the day overall?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You're right.  It wasn't the afternoon we had wished for, but the players fought very hard.  I must say the U.S. team played very well.
They made a lot of birdies.  They made a lot of putts.  And we just didn't have the same flow.  So overall, just still feel pretty happy how we had the setup.  And like I said, the girls fought to the end.
It's just one of those days in golf.  And luckily this was just the first day.  I'd like to say that we have -- it's almost like playing 27 holes out of 72, which means you have a lot of holes left.
And it's a marathon.  And the players are back at the hotel and grabbing something to eat, and we're going to start out fresh tomorrow.  And I would say that the spirit is still there, if not stronger.  You get a little fired up when you see an afternoon like this.
So we knew coming in here it was going to be a challenge.  And I have fighters on the team.  And I believe in them.  So we're just going to forget about this day.  Tomorrow's Saturday.  New points.  Go out there and grab as many as we can.
Q. So you've just released your morning foursome pairings for tomorrow.  What were your thoughts and strategy on putting these together?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: So the first one, as you can see, I'm sure you have the sheet in front of you, we've got Jodi paired off with Caroline Masson.  They both played terrific today.  Caroline played two matches.  Jodi just played in the afternoon but they're both really hitting it well.
They wanted to play together.  And I guess a little revenge was what they were looking for.  So they want to go out first.  And so there they have it.
And then the second group, Mel Reid, Emily Pedersen.  They're good friends, very similar type of humor.  Humor I don't get, but they do it.  So we sat Mel in the afternoon and she's ready to go again.  And Emily, she just told me I'm better than this.  I want to show you I can do it.  So they want to play together.
And then the third one, Anna Nordqvist and Georgia.  What can I say?  They did very well in the morning.  And so I'm not going to fix something that's not broken.
Catriona and Karine.  The same way.  They fought very hard.  They were down most of the time but came back.  And so they both rested this afternoon.  Again, I'm not going to mess with something that works.
Q. Was it always the plan to play all 12 players today at some point?  Was that something that you had banked on doing in advance or was it reaction to the great start you made in the morning?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, actually, the pairings were done 24 hours before the first match this morning.  So they were all prepared.  They knew who was going in the afternoon.
The practice round on Thursday was all based on tee times today and pairings today.  So I wanted everybody to get a chance to play.
They've been here, some of them have been here since Sunday.  It's a lot of days to just wait and wait and practice.  So I thought it would be great to get everybody out there.  Of course, we waited with three rookies, so they can stand on the tee and see it and feel it, rather than just throw them right in the ring right away.
And honestly I think that they were -- they were all really pumped, because they've been there in the morning and they were just so excited to go in the afternoon.
And we paired rookie with veteran, trying to have them balanced a little bit.  And it's just funny how sometimes things turn out.  But, like I said, I felt good about it, and sometimes things don't always turn out.
Q. Coming off of 17 it sounded like Charley made a reference to look at what U.S.A. did two years ago.  Does that play in the back of your team's mind knowing that this is still a feasible comeback for you guys going into day two?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Oh, there's no doubt.  Like I said, I have fighters on the team.  And many of them have been around different scenarios.  We all know that you cannot take anything for granted.  It's so many points are still left out there.  And just gotta keep on fighting.
And obviously you find the positives out there and we have a lot of positives to think about.  So just encouraging them and inspiring them to keep on going.  And, like I said, they fought really hard.  Charley made the eagle on that 15th.  And they were still breathing, still alive to the end.  That's what I'm proud of.
You look at that board.  And if you've been a player and you see the opposite team's color from top to bottom, it's not easy.  And you're just trying to get their mind set on what they need to do and focus on their own games.  And I feel like they did that.  However, I mean, they all played very, very well.
And Stacy, to make birdie on 17, one of the hardest par 3s, it just kind of sealed the coffin at that time.  But, you know, you can forget things pretty quickly.  And I know they have.
Q. Obviously you're highly competitive, highly successful player, but when things are moving in the wrong direction and you can't hit a golf shot yourself, how do you sort of keep calm and centered?  And just sort of what goes through your mind?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: That's the role of a captain.  You have to give them the confidence.  You have to -- what they see is what they think I am.  And I want to give them all the encouragement and the comfort.
And I still really feel really cool about it.  I have some great players.  Things are not really going in the right direction right at this moment.
Charley, early on, had wrist injuries.  And so there's a lot of things happening out there.  A lot of juggling.  And that's why she's sitting in the morning.
I'm sitting Carlota, one of the best players, probably the best form right now.  She's sitting in the morning.  That was not a plan.  But she's not performing.  So I told her.  So we are making some changes and people that are playing well are stepping up.
So you just have to kind of be a little creative, trying to give them the confidence.  And, like I said, I mean, I won tournaments after 72 holes, not after 27.  You've got to stay in there the whole time.
Q. What was your impression of the crowd today?  Obviously you're focused on your players.  But did you have a moment to take in what that crowd was bringing to this venue today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Absolutely.  I mean, I'm sure you were all on the first tee.  I mean, it was so incredible.  I mean, so many people cheering, singing, dancing.  It was electric.
I mean, this is so special.  I mean, we just stood there and just absorbed the atmosphere.  But even along the golf course, I thought the crowds were very respectful.  They clapped for good shots for either team.  And we signed a lot of autographs for all kinds of fans out there.
No, it's been good.  I really feel like they've been generous and very warm.
Q. On Charley's wrist injury, it looked bad early on then she seemed to rally a little bit.  You mentioned she's benched as a result of it or in the morning.  Is it a concern that she won't feature at all tomorrow?  What's the extent of her injury as you understand it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: At this point, I don't know, but I am going to talk to our physio this evening to figure out what's going on.  But I don't think it's a secret that she's had a wrist injury for a little while.
Charley is Charley.  I saw her in the lunchroom.  She was icing her wrist.  And I said you're going out in 20 minutes, are you okay?  She goes I'm fine.
So what can I say.  Too much texting.  It kind of gets your wrist going.  So just give her some anti-inflammatory and battle it through.
No, but kidding aside, I'm going to talk to the physio tonight.  If there's something lingering, we'll see.  I do, as you probably can figure out, I do have a plan B without Charley, too.  So we'll do what we can.
Q. Is there a situation -- there was some speculation on TV today that maybe you might sit some of the players for all of Saturday.  Is that a possibility?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You know, I don't know.  I want to see how these players play tomorrow.  The pairings I have right now was not the pairing I had about 48 hours ago.
We're adjusting to the quality of the play.  So I don't want to make a call right now.  Like I said, I've seen stranger things happen in the last few days.  So we'll see.
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
