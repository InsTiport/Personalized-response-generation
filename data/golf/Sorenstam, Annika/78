  Q. You had a solid start today, talk about what it was like out there for you.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, I played very, very well. Hit the ball beautifully today. Very happy. Just didn't make some putts today, unfortunately, but I'm very, very happy with my game.   
  
  Q. How did the course play with the rain?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It is soaking. It is so wet out there. You can fire at the pins. You get no roll off the tee. It's very, very wet, but it's still playable despite all this rain we've had. It's in great shape but it's very wet.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about where you stand?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, it's only Thursday, I'm not going to worry about where I am at the end of the day. I just want to continue to play the way I am doing and looking forward to a great week.  
  
  Q. Do you get sentimental knowing it's the last go-around?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, I'm trying to focus on my game and win the golf tournament. That's where my focus is. Try not to think about it.   
  
  Q. How was it having a big crowd following you around?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It's fun. That's why I play. Very supportive. It's fun.
