ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It sure does.  We did not get off to a good start at all.  We were really struggling, both Suzann and I.

We kept telling ourself, "Let's keep fighting, we can do this," and we started to make some birdies on the Back 9 and had an incredible finish, and it's amazing.  It's so much fun.
Q.  What's being said between you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We just went 4, 3, 2, 1.  I said, "We can do it.  We're not running out of holes.  We just have to fight."
