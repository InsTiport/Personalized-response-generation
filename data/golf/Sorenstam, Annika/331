ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Makes me smile a little bit.  
 
Q.  You got past 17.  Seven players dumped balls on that hole.  Is that about as tough a par 3 as you guys play?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I think so.  Actually, the last three holes are really tough finishing holes.  I mean, 17 is really tricky in many ways.  First of all, I mean, it's very long.  It's been windy today and yesterday.  It's water on the right, water on the left.  You don't have a lot of room for error.  Today they really kind of had a sucker pin there.  I mean, I was just going to hit in the middle of green.  I learned a lesson.  I figured, "If you make par here, that's almost gaining half a shot."  
 
Q.  (Inaudible) four shots back. 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, like I said, that's the good news.  I mean, I got off to a horrible start.  I had hit three greens in eight holes.  That's probably the worst I've done in a very long time.  Then luckily I kind of found my swing a little bit and played really solid on the back.  I'm very pleased to shot 1-under for ten holes.  Some tough finishing holes here.  If you turn that around, it's better.  But you know, I did fall a little behind.  But we still have a lot of golf left.  Hopefully I can start up better tomorrow.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, I actually think I played really good on the last ten holes, really felt like I had other birdie opportunities.  It's just that I took advantage of 18.  I had a great chance on 14.  That's just the way it is sometimes.  I mean, I wish a change of thought, and then it's  birdie, then I would change on No.  1.  That's just the way it goes (laughter).  
 
Q.  They caught you on TV muttering under your breath.  When you talk to yourself, are you speaking English or Swedish?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm mixed a little bit (laughter).  I don't know why I'm mixed.  I guess I just talk to myself, "Come on, you can do it.  What kind of shot was this?"  Or sometimes, "Take your time."  Whatever comes to my mind.  I mean, I felt great on the range.  Suddenly I come out, I'm missing every green.  It's just very tough to make up and down.  On 6, I'm going for the green with my driver.  I hit a great shot.  I ended up in an awful position in the bunker.  I'm stuck in between the lip and the sand area.  I can't even hit to the green.  I just felt, you know, my luck had to turn around somehow.  
 
Q.  There was no one point in your game that was holding you back this morning, no one thing you could pinpoint?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I wasn't hitting the ball as well as yesterday.  I mean, I was missing greens.  
 
Q.  Do you think your swing changed at all?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It didn't feel the same.  I wasn't making as good contact.  I was hitting a few shots left.  Couldn't really figure out why.  But then I stopped thinking and started hitting (laughter).  
 
Q.  How much was it the wind?  How much of it was the course?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think it's both.  I mean, it's a difficult golf course.  Yesterday I felt it was either downwind or into the wind.  Today it felt like crosswind on every hole which makes it, I think, tougher.  The wind wasn't as strong.  But, I mean, you're dealing with wind.  You have to aim maybe at a hazard, and the ball has to work itself into the fairway.  That makes it very difficult.  I mean, that's why I think I missed a few shots also.  If you don't hit it pure, you're going to end up in trouble.  
 
Q.  Do you think par is a good score?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I think so.  It's a tough course, but it's fair.  If you hit the ball well, you can score well.  I mean, again, you have to putt it well also here.  I think a major tournament or major championship has those kind of qualities.  You have to hit it well and putt well. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible) the other day with the ProAm, did he make any projections?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, he didn't.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible). 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, is he?  Well, we can shoot low.  I think he turned on the fan for us, though.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, Karrie, she's at minus six?  That's a good score.  
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Bogeyed No.  4.  5-iron on the green, 3-putt.  Bogeyed 6.  Driver in the left green bunker, hit it out, chipped, 2-putt.  Bogeyed No.  8.  I missed my drive to the right.  Had to chip it out.  On the green, 2-putt.  Then birdied 18.  7-iron.  Hit the same distance on 18.  I had 158 again.  
 
Q.  You got that down?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes (laughter).  I made a putt, it was six feet.  
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thanks.
