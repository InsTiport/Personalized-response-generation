 Q.  Annika, not the way you wanted your group to end day one, but what would be (inaudible) tomorrow?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It's like you're playing 27 holes out of 72.  I mean, we have a long ways to go.  And the U.S., they played excellent today.  In every match, they made a lot of putts, a lot of birdies.  It was tough competition.  We knew that coming in here.   
It's going to be a challenge the whole way.  And I can tell you the spirit has not died down.  I think, on the contrary, we're fired up.  If they can do it; we can do it.  So going to go home, take a shower, regroup and get some good sleep and be ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  A lot of people were very impressed with Georgia Hall's play today.  What impressed you most about what she was able to accomplish?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I belong with that group:  I was very impressed with Georgia.  We knew she would do well this week.  But she's stepped up there.  It's not an easy thing.  This stage is big.  And she has performed beautifully, I think.  So I'm just very, very proud of her.  And I told her just to shake this off; you're playing well.  Just don't let this weight hang over you anymore, move on, and I'm very proud of you.   
So terrific to have her here coming in the end and just fighting to the end.   
 Q.  Momentum is so important, especially in match play, a team event like this, how do you grab the momentum tomorrow and take advantage?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, we're going to do our best.  I'm going to speak to the team tonight.  So today is today.  Tomorrow is tomorrow.  So we're not going to look back.  We're going to look forward.
