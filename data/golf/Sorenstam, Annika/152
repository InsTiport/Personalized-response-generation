DANA GROSS RHODE:  We have Annika Sorenstam.  You just finished your second round of the HSBC Women's World Match Play, and you defeated Heather young.  Do you want to talk about your round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I got off to a great start.  I birdied the first hole and then I birdied the second hole so I was 2 up all of a sudden.

You know, I thought I played some good golf.  But then Heather fought back real quickly.  She birdied the fourth and she won the fifth.  So I thought it was a good match and then we tied with birdies on 9.  Then I made a little charge on the back.  So it was a good match, and I'm quite happy with the way I played.
Q.  You're two matches into this and Pat also survived.  Are you at all surprised that both of you guys after coming off that Open have been able to survive two rounds here?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think the key here is obviously to play well.  Pat's been playing well and I've been playing well.  I'm on such a high that I'm not really thinking that, you know, that I should be worn out, and I'm not sure if Pat is, either.  Sometimes you're just so excited that you just kind of go with things and it's not until you slow down that you realise that maybe you are tired.

Right now, I'm just looking forward to coming back tomorrow and obviously I like to improve a little bit from last year.  So that's really what's on my mind.  You know, you've just got to play and you can't start thinking about too many things.  That's one of the reasons why I work out and I want to stay in good shape and if you have to have playoffs and if you have to play matches, 36 holes, etc., you've got to be ready.  There are no excuses.
Q.  With the par 5s out here, with your length, do you see that as an advantage for you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, let's see, I mean, the second role is really long.  The ninth hole is quite long as well.  And I guess they are all long and I'm just playing them as three shot holes this week and hit wedges close and make birdie the old traditional way.
Q.  Do you feel people are gunning for you in a sense; that you're up, I think two yesterday on Virada and she came back and today you're up two and Heather came back.  Do you think that nobody is going to give you anything easy?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, I don't expect to get anything easy.  The players that are here this week are the Top 64 in the world.  I really think that they have to earn their way to the next match.  You can't make mistakes and I mean, Virada didn't make a bogey until her last hole.  I mean, that's    she just played very, very solid and you know, I expect the same thing the next match.  You've got to make birdies to win, and you cannot make mistakes or then you're going to lose a hole.
Q.  If she was going for the par 5s in two, would your strategy change at all?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, today I couldn't reach them.  It's not a matter of if I want to or not.  Today I can't do it; it's too long for me.  I'm going to continue to play the way I've been playing, just ride it out and if have some shorter distances left, hopefully I can reach it them in two.  You know, I'm looking for around 210 or something.  If I start thinking about it, everything is to carry, if I can't get 210 or less, to me I'd rather just play safe and hit it close on the third.
Q.  Inaudible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think I'm playing very well.  I think my speed is as very good as it's been in a long time.  I'm very happy with the way I'm putting.  First hole rolled in a good putt, second hole rolled in a good putt.  I feel very comfortable on the greens.
