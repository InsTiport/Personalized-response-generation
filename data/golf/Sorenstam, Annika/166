Q.
Talk about the ruling.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it was a mistake I made.  I was next to a divot and the divot was in two pieces and it was totally replaced in a really horrible way.  So I moved the divot and that's against the rules.  It's a mistake of mine.
Q.  Did you know it was against the rules?  When did you realize it was against the rules?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, Karrie told me I couldn't do it.  And I said, well, it looked like somebody grabbed some turf and just stuck it anywhere.  I mean it was loose, it was totally    I didn't know.  I knew it was a divot.  Like I say, it was my fault, but I just, I was in    I mean, the ball didn't move or anything, it was just totally sloppy done.  And I didn't think more of it.
Q.  Did you try and replace it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I was demonstrating to Karrie what it was.  So I mean, but it was too late because that had nothing to do with it.
Q.  How much did that affect you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's a mistake I made.  I mean that's just the way it is.  I mean, it wasn't that    I hit some horrible shots today.  I'm not getting any breaks whatsoever and mixed with that, it makes it very, very tough.
Q.  You still in this?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I got to give it all tomorrow.  I mean, to avoid penalty strokes.  I mean, I have four shots and two pins, you know, in four holes.  I mean, that's right there is six shots.  I could be tied for the lead.  And that's still with really horrible shots.  So it's never too late but things got to change.
Q.  The breaks you're referring to are 17 and 18?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean the middle of the hole.  I mean, hitting the pin there and then I knocked it too hard and it's just not going in.
Q.  Is it hard at all to stay patient?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's all I can.  I said this, I said the same thing for months now.  I hit some bad shots, there's no doubt about it, but I also think I hit some good ones.  And then on top of that some silly mistakes.  You just can't afford that in Major championships, or really any tournament, I would say.
