  Q. Your thoughts on having Annika Sorenstam Square dedicated in your name?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, it's sad in a way, but then on the other hand it's the decision I made a few months ago. You know, I've seen this place grow from start to final. And it's become one of the premier events on the LPGA.   
 I really feel like, you know, I've been lucky to see the growth. I feel like a big part of the Evian family. They've really treated me like that through the years.   
 Obviously, this is very special. A nice surprise, so I will always be here in spirit for sure.   
  
  Q. Every time you finish a tournament, is it so emotional?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It is. I mean, I try not to think about it. I have another ten more tournaments in another five months. You know, I just want to focus on my game. But every time I leave a tournament and look back I say those are my last steps on those stairways.   
 So, you know, things come to an end. This is my decision. I'm looking forward to another chapter in my life. Hopefully, it will be as rewarding.
