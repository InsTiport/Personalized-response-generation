Q.  Just talk about your round overall.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, disappointed for sure.  It just wouldn't happen.  I don't know what to say other than that.  I think I hit 14 greens and a lot of fairways.  I can't get it together, so it's very disappointing.
Q.  It's kind of an instant replay from last year, opening round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I don't know about last year but I can tell you it's been like this the last four tournaments I've played in.  Same thing, I'm playing well, I just can't get it going.  I'm making nothing.  I don't know, I'm very disappointed and upset at the moment.
Q.  Are you most disappointed with your putter?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  A little bit disappointed with the putter, but overall I just can't    I'm hitting good shots, driving it well, bouncing the fairways.  One of those months or one of these years I really just want to forget about it.
Q.  How about having that group, having the No. 1 player in the world, defending champion and most of the day the leader in one group?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it's a star studded group, that's for sure.  No, it's a good group.  Both Karrie and Cristie played really well.
Q.  Were you feeding off each other?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I wouldn't say I was feeding off really.  Maybe they were but not me.
Q.  Should you be?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would love to, yeah, it's not happening.
