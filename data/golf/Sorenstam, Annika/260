NEAL REID:  All right.  Let's go ahead and get started.  Annika, thanks for coming in.  I know you just got down not too long ago.  Can you just talk about how you feel to be back here in Atlanta, this golf course and how you feel about your game right now.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, obviously, I'm happy to be here.  I've had three good weeks off so I'm rested.  What else can I say?  I'm glad to be back.  I do have some wonderful memories here.  I'm glad to see this tournament and hopefully my game is ready and I'm ready and I can play some good golf this week.

NEIL REID:  Can you tell us about what you did the three weeks off.  Practice a little bit or relax.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, three weeks goes by very quickly, I guess.  I spent some time in Lake Tahoe after the L.A. tournament.  I was up there for about 10 days.  And then I flew to Orlando and started practice.  I saw my coach last week.  So I feel like I've been really busy, even though I've had a chance to rest as well.  But to get away from the tour and recharge the batteries and start working on my game a little bit.
NEAL REID:  Questions?
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm ready to go.  I enjoy being at home and having some time to rest and practice.  But I also enjoy coming out.  Especially now I had three weeks.  And that's plenty of time to get rested.  Especially after along season, the off season that I've had.  But I needed it after the Major and after winning some tournaments, I felt like it was a good idea to do that at this point in the schedule.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, first of all, I think a four day tournament is really what it's all about.  If you think about all the big tournaments that we play, all the Majors, it's more of a true test, a four day tournament.  And especially here it always rains here.  And it seems like 54 holes turns into 36 or maybe 18.  So at least starting out with four we might end up with at least three days.  And I think it gives more of a chance for every one.  It's more fair.  Especially on a golf course like this, anything can happen.  I always liked four day tournaments.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think definitely this tournament has grown a lot the last few years.  The increase in purse, you can tell by the golf course they really put a lot of work into it.  The setup is better.  The quality of the event.  And now that it's four day, it's getting closer and closer to being one of the better ones that we have every year.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say so.  You get all kind of weather here, wind, rain, sometimes the course is playing firm.  I don't know what the greens are like .  I haven't seen the course yet.  But sometimes when it's wet it plays really long.  So it really I think you have to hit the driver well.  Because then you have a chance to hit the par 5s in two.  Some of the par 4s you need to hit the driver well enough to get a short iron in so you can be more aggressive.  But it favors more of a long hitter, especially since it's always wet here.  But then again you need to have the short game as well.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, that's a great question.  It's a tough issue, really.  But I never really thought too much about it.  But I just think that people are different.  Some kids are younger, some kids are more mature.  It really is up to each individual, I think.  In golf, that's what I can relate to, I came out I was probably one of the older rookies.  I had experience from playing on the national team, I traveled all around the world and then I turned pro.  It wasn't something that I skipped high school and then turned pro.  I think that you got to be ready.  And once you're out here, you don't get any mulligans because you're 14 or 16 or whatever.  We all play equal here.  So it's totally I think up to each kid or each young player that if you come here you're going to play according to the rules and we're all equal.  So if you're are ready, why not.  A lot of young kids now days are so much more talented, so much more developed.  They work with coaches starting at the age of four, they're so much better now at a younger age.  So I really don't think that age is a big issue.  I think that more if your ready to do it.  If you're not, then take your time and get ready.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I haven't really seen that.  Because I can't say I got burned out but wasn't good enough and therefore I quit and started to play golf.  I think in tennis for me anyway it was a physically demanding sport in that sense.  I think golf is more experience, it's such a mental game I think that with age you get better.  So therefore there is no need to come out and play.  You might be able to hit the ball 300 yards, you might be able to hit the long shots, I think a lot of people think, oh, you can hit it long, you should be a professional.  That's not what it's all about.  It's about putting the ball in the hole, it's about being in contention on Sunday to have the nerves to do it.  And if you can do that I think that's what golf is all about.  And if you're young enough and can handle it, then why not.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think, like I said, a lot has happened the last few years for me.  It's been exciting.  I think this year for me to get my schedule organized so that I can, so I can work on my game to be a better player.  And if I don't have time to do that then I won't be good at the end of the year.  So I'm trying to deal with everything.  I feel like what I do, I love what I do.  I just want to do the best that I can.  I'm still trying to learn every day.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I don't know if I thrive on it, but I do enjoy being recognized for what I've achieved on the golf course.  That's a personal satisfaction of winning tournaments is getting recognized for good golf.  That's what I love.  I don't know if I'm the best person to be in the center for the LPGA, I think I represent one of many great players out here.  It's a tough role, but I figure if I can just be myself, which is what I was at the Colonial, people accept that, then I can handle it.  It's very tough when people sort of expect other things from you and that's where I find it very, very hard.  I stand for good golf and good sportsmanship and someone that loves what she does.  And if that's successful.  Then that's what I want.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, of course there was a lot of attention at the Colonial.  Three months before, even during and then three months four to five months after that.  So it keeps on going.  And the way I look at it, it's very very positive.  The exposure I got, my sponsors got, the exposure the LPGA got I thought it was very very positive.  And a lot of these events around the world that I play in, it gives great exposure.  It shows that we women are very competitive.  That we are trying to take our game to a different level.  For me personally golf wise it was great preparation.  Playing with the guys, you know, learning a lot and dealing with the pressure.  That's actually why I went there to see if I could handle it.  Hopefully going into the Majors that it would feel like, you know, less pressure because the Colonial was so big.  So I think all that have helped.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think you can all can try and do the best we can in each of these forms of celebrity.  I think the concept is right.  It's something we all have to think about.  We're all entertainers.  And if we improve a little bit on each area, I think we will all do much better, the whole tour and everybody.  But what's happened, when you compare whatever, you compare, for example, with Nancy Lopez, she's a perfect role model, she was perfect for the LPGA, she played that part.  But everybody can't be Nancy.  That's why we all appreciate what she's done.  Because she was that special.  And then in a few generations we'll get another one.  But you can't force somebody to be someone like that.  I think we all have our own qualities, whatever they are, especially now when we have a world tour with all players from all over the world.  The caliber golf is most exciting here.  Because it's never been this good.  Never.  And that's really the bottom line is good golf.  When you come out to a LPGA event you will see girls that can play and are happy doing what they're doing.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't know if it's difficult for a man or a woman.  It's just asking somebody to be something you're not.  I think Tiger again has done wonderful things for the game of golf.  And people love to watch him play.  Before him it was Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.  They only come once in a while.  Enjoy them while they're here.  They don't come around all that often so enjoy them.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was a little frustrating.  I've won three tournaments outs of four this year and I really want to win them all, but it doesn't work out that way.  I think it gets you a little more motivated and now I want to win the next three.  Things happen for a reason.  I don't know what this reason was.  It doesn't make me upset, but it makes me practice harder and makes me really appreciate what it takes to win a Major.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think it's kind of a long term plan.   One of the things I've really spent a lot of time with is on the fitness and that has taken a few years to develop.  But I'm very motivated to do what I do.  I love what I do.  And I set high goals.  I know that I don't practice    I like to practice.  I know that they're right there, but so I just kept working on things to get better.  Colonial was one of those things where I had a chance to practice with the guys, I learned so much about the short game.  How they approach the game.  That's where I think it's helped me get better.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it's been great.  I used to practice a lot of stuff and be out there all day.  Now instead of being out there all day, it's just a few hours here working smarter.  I still enjoy it.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think we all have a different opinion, obviously a different life style.  This is an opinion that Rosie has and all power to her.  I try to stay out of these issues.  It's none of my business.  I know she cares a lot about the tour so hopefully it will have a great long term affect.  I know that she's really happy about it, and that's fine with me.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Long term we'll find out if it's a good thing or not.  It's Rosie's decision that she wanted to do this, so it's not for me to tell her what to do.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think the competition itself.  As a player you look at the quality of players, the quality of play today.  To win a tournament now you got to play so much better because there's so many more players out there and they're so much better.  The younger players are stronger, the swing, their fundamentals are better.  More and more players are coming out.  Everybody is grinding, you can tell when you come to a tournament     maybe I'm talking like I've been here for 50 years, I haven't, but you can tell, the first tournaments out here for me there was less people late at night practicing.  Now there's a lot of players out here.  You have players from all around the world.  The competition gets better because there's more players.  That's why.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought a little bit about it.  I've always said that I admire somebody like that who can really balance her personal life and her golf, like Juli.  I think once I decide to start a family, I think that will be it.  I give a hundred percent on the golf course, I love doing that today.  But one day I think that that's the time where I will move away.  But I probably won't leave golf.  Because I love the game of golf.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  That's a good question.  I wanted to win all the four Majors.  So definitely it will be a little tough now.  But like I said, I want to win the next three Majors.  I won two of them last year.  There's some tournaments that I want to win.  But again it's going to be tough.  I don't know if you can look at every year, there's a lot of pressure.  So far I'm very happy with how it is right now.  The game is getting a little better, so I'm improving.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I'm a little surprised.  I don't know why.  I played college and there was not a lot of foreign players.  You look at tennis, they're phenomenal.  One of these days they will pick up a golf club and then they will compete here.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, I did.  Maybe that was a little greedy.  Maybe it was not meant to happen.  But that's the way I look at it.  Yeah, I'm going to continue.  I'm going to keep on trying.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, why not.  Yeah.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Of course I think that if I would have made that putt or whatever.  I did hit the ball well.  But, who knows what would happen.  But it wasn't, that wasn't the only reason why I went there.  I said I'm not going to play in another one already.  I might play in a skin's game or something like that, but that's it.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I was watching it from my hotel room and I thought it was so exciting.  Somebody trying to be so aggressive, go for the green in 2.  I tried, by the way.  And then she made the putt, put the pressure on the leaders and that was great.  And she rolled in a birdie.  And that's a Major championship.  It doesn't get better than that.  And then you see the future of our sport and you see young players that have the aggression and they have no fear.  That's what's great about them.  They don't know how hard it is.  They play like that all the time.  I haven't played with her other than last year at the U.S. Open, she was in the Top 5 or something up there.  I don't remember for sure.  You can tell already what a great player she is.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I want to say I gained some experience from that.  But that's a combination of obviously equipment and other things.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I do feel that.  I think we had that question before.  No, a lot of things have changed in the last few years in a positive way.  Not just golf, but life in general.  There's been a lot of positive feedback from that week and it seems like it was a year ago, but people still talk about it because it was such a unique thing.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I think it's kind of fun.  A lot of times it happens two or three times.  But they never come up to me, they will always ask him or their friend or something and they're like, well, ask her.  So that's pretty funny.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Speculation?  I'm playing this week and next week and then I haven't decided.  I haven't decided yet.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I sure did.  I was very happy for him.  Obviously I love watching the Masters.  I had a chance to play there.  That makes it more exciting.  Playing with him at the skin's game in November, and I got to know him a little bit and I was really happy for him.  That last few holes, what can you say, it was so exciting.
NEAL REID:  All right.  Thank you, Annika.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.
