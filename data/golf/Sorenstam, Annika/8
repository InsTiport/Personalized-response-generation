 Q.  Just talk about how you're feeling being involved in the very first playing of this event?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm thrilled.  I'm honored.  What a moment.  I had a tear coming up on the first tee watching my family and all the people standing there next to Nancy and seemed like everything just came together with my career and now junior girls, and here at the holy grounds of Augusta National, and it's fantastic.   
 Q.  Do you think back how great it would have been if you had an opportunity like this when you were coming along?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Of course.  But I had some great moments in my career and I'm thankful for that, and now we know that every little work we do helps young girls get opportunities for them.   
This is an historic moment, and hopefully they will continue to carry the torch, and who knows what opportunities will come ten, 15 years from now, but I mean, this is an amazing moment, and I think it's obviously great for girls golf.  It's good for golf.  I think it's great for women's sports, and even, who knows, women in business.  It's just breaking ground in many ways and fun to be part of it in a little way and have those feelings come through you, when it's just the game of golf and we can have such an impact on young people's lives.   
 Q.  You do so much to grow the game.  How important do you think this event will be in the future growth of the game?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It's tremendous.  This is just the beginning.  I think that just to be here and to see the participation and see the interest; I mean, we are all about trying to get more girls to play.  We are trying to increase the interest in the game of golf, and tournaments like this will certainly do it.  I've never seen so much exposure for one tournament, and to see these girls come up here and step it up and have so much fun and enjoy it, I mean, this is a dream come true, not just for the participants but everybody involved in the game of golf.   
 Q.  I asked Se Ri this question.  When Gary and Jack come up here, they are very competitive about who hits it further, so was there a little bit of that today?  
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I thought I would, but once I got up there, I felt like it was more about a team event, like we're doing this together, and just kind of cheer each other on.  It was so neat to see, you've got South Korea, you've got MÃ©xico, you've got Sweden, Europe and then you've got Nancy with the USA.  It's a global sport and here we are all and to be able to do this together, and we're thinking of the careers that we've had but also what we're doing right now.
