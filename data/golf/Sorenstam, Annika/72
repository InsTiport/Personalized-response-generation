 Q. (No microphone)
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You know, I think I'm in good shape. You know I played well here in the past. You know it's a Major and really two days or actually 36 holes is nothing. The way I'm hitting I'm just waiting for the putts to drop. It could be a lot of fun.

 Q. Set yourself up real good for the weekend. Do you have to go to the range or putting green to work on anything differently?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No. I mean I feel really good. I got tired in the end. I made a sloppy 2-shot on 18. I think right now the key is to get some rest. It's going to be two long days. It's going to be hot tomorrow and Sunday. You know, I worked hard this week. So I'm ready for a good night's rest. Come back tomorrow and give it all I got.

 Q. Being the veteran player coming from behind in the weekend?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You know I don't have much choice. I've been here before. Been in this before. I mean I've been in all kinds of different situations. So I'm happy I was able to keep the momentum in my round and finish with 4-under today. That means a lot to me and I'm going to carry that further. Like you said I'm hitting the ball really, really well and I have experience so it's just going to be a fun weekend and I'm looking forward to it.

 Q. Can you go over your birdies on the back nine?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: My back nine? Just the front, is that what you mean?

 Q. Yes?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah number two which was number 11 I hit a 9-iron to 7 feet then on number 6 I hit a 9-iron to 6 feet on 18 I just chipped above the front about 2 feet.

 Q. Any holes particularly challenging?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I think this golf course is challenging from start to finish it just really depends on how you hit it. I mean if you don't drive it well you can get into trouble here. 
 There are tough ones, 11 is a tough Par 5. I would say 5 is a tough one. 13 is tough. You got to drive it well. You need to be good with irons. Like any tournament you got to putt well.

 Q. What is it like playing in the afternoon round in this heat after playing if the morning?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was hard. The first, I would say 7 holes, it was very pleasant. And then, you know, the cloud cover kind of went away and it was steamy out there. I think that started up to me being a little tired. But as far as I know it's going to be the same the next two days. So lots of fluid and lots of rest is going to be the recipe.
