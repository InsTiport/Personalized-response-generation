Q.  How do you feel after your first round?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I feel great. I shot under par in the Open, obviously better than other tournaments.  It was a difficult day.  But I hung in there.  I was being patient. 
 
Q.  Comparing this to your start in '96, how would you compare the two?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It's a new week, it's a new tournament.  I can't compare my day today.  It's not an easy golf course.  And the first day, a lot can happen.  Obviously you have to be patient and go from there. 
 
Q.  How did you feel about the early start this morning?  Did you feel that was beneficial?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was very early.  I don't know.  I got up at 5:00, and that was really early. It's kind of hard to wake up and get loose.  But it's nice to get off first.  Smoother greens.  Normally it doesn't get windy, but I think the wind has picked up.
