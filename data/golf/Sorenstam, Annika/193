Q.  Annika, all you can do is win, and you've done that.  It's never too late for the team?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's never too late.  We just have to keep positive and keep grinding.  Anything can happen in this game.  I did what I could, and that's all I can do.

You know, right now I'm going to go out there and cheer them on, and hopefully we can turn this around.
Q.  They got the early momentum, and they won the first five games.  That's so important in Solheim singles, isn't it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's very important.  The Americans are playing very, very good golf.  It's tough.  Players on both on are very, very good.  You have to play the best you can, and maybe you have the chance.
Q.  It's a very intimidating atmosphere to play in.  Obviously, you've managed to do that today.  Some of the other players maybe struggled a bit with the cheering of "USA, USA"?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, but I think we all knew that coming into here.  That's what makes the this championship so great.  I think the crowds have been wonderful to both teams.  It's all about playing good golf.  I tried the best I can, got my point, and that's obviously the best I could do.
Q.  We'll let you get back there to cheer them on.  Thank you very much.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you very much.
