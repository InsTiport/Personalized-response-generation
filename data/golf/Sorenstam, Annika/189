ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I can't seem to make a putt and it's just very, very tough to be level par, I think that's probably the highest score I could have for the way I'm playing.
Q.  Inaudible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Definitely it did, yeah.
Q.  How frustrating is it?  Are you boiling inside?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I would say so, yeah.
Q.  How does that feel, how frustrating is it in a major?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I mean, it's disappointing because I am ready to play.  I've been ready and I've been preparing the way I want.  I'm playing the way that I normally play here.  Just nothing is happening.  I think a good example is on No. 17, I hit a great 6 iron, plenty of club and just slightly short and rolls all the way back.  That's just been my week; that summarizes my week.  Sometimes you can't do a thing about it.  You just have to try and keep on grinding and hope that things will turn around eventually.
Q.  What do you do tonight to get ready for tomorrow?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm just going to be with my family and friends.  I'm happy with the way I'm playing, it might not seem like it, but I'm not going to analyze too much.  I've analyzed for three days now.  I'm done analyzing; it hasn't helped.  I'm just going to play tomorrow and see what happens.

If I can take something out of this, this is what I'm learning, I am very, very patient out there.  Yeah, I'm uptight and frustrated but I'm very, very patient.  I keep on trying.
Q.  Inaudible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  My swing is good.  You are going to miss a few shots on this course.  I always do that.  But the momentum is not there, hit a lot of good shots and like I keep telling my caddie, I hit great shots but my good shots don't get close.
Q.  Inaudible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It is tough.  It's a tough golf course.  The wind, it's swirling, and you'll be on a certain hole and it will be one way and then the wind has changed.  It might even have died down or go the other way.  It's playing very difficult.

I thought the greens were a little firmer today and releasing a lot more.  It's a tough golf course, there's no doubt about it.
