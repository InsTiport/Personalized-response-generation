MODERATOR:  Thanks for joining us again today.  71, 1 under.  Going into tomorrow, a course you feel you can pick up some strokes, you must feel pretty good.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, I've been here before, I've been in this position.  I have a chance to finish it up tomorrow.  I'm excited about that.  It's been three long days, but I'm right where I want to be, and playing with Patricia again, so I'm looking forward to a good Sunday.

Q.  Did the course play different than it did yesterday?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, the conditions were much easier, the wind was not swirling as much.  It was perfect conditions, really, to score.  And again, the course is in great shape.  There were some birdie opportunities out there.

Q.  Anything interesting in Patricia's game you're seeing this week, the reason why she's on top?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, Patricia is playing very aggressive.  She's putting very well, chipping well, short game overall, I must say is very solid.  And she's missed a few shots, but she's been able to save it.  So she's been very solid. 

Q.  Annika, the scoring conditions were better.  At one point you were 6-under.  Are you disappointed with 72-71 the last two days, or do you feel that's where you wanted to be or what you wanted to do this week?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, I'd like to do better, but I'm trying, and really -- haven't really got going with my game, it seems like.  It seems I get going on a few holes, and then one or two holes later, I fall behind again.  And the rhythm is not really there.  And I'm trying, and I'm staying very patient, and I think -- I've got to be thankful for that, otherwise who knows where I would have been.  I'm trying to hit one shot at a time.  And hopefully things will turn around and I'll make some putts and shoot some lower scores.

Q.  Early in the turn you were down about five shots.  What thoughts start creeping in your mind when you're trailing Patricia by five at that point?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, we still had a lot of holes to play, and playing in a major, I really don't pay attention too much to how many shots I'm behind.  Today I was focusing more on my game.  I was trying to keep it on the fairway, hit the greens and make putts.  I'm not thinking that I'm so far behind that it changed my approach to the game or the way I played, of course.  I'm going an ahead with my playing, and hopefully I can play the way I want to play.  I've got too much to worry about my own game than look at her and her bounces, et cetera.  Today I was totally focusing on my own game, and not paying too much attention to the leaderboard or the other players in my group.

Q.  Annika, you're pretty well known for being able to focus on your own game and concentrate on what's at hand.  Tomorrow you're going to play with someone that the gallery is going to be out there rooting for pretty well, and someone that hits it a very long ways, and she's 13 years old.  Are you going to be watching her a bit, too?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Tomorrow is the day I've been looking forward to.  I'm right where I want to be.  Obviously Michelle is playing very well.  I look forward to playing with her.  She's obviously very talented.  And the way she's performed this week has been fantastic.  But again, my key is to mind my own game.  If I can just play the way I know I can, I'm not going to worry about anything else.

Q.  Annika, what about your game at the age of 13, do you remember what you did at 13?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, I started playing golf when I was 12.  So I'd only played for a year.  So I don't even think my handicap was 36 at the time.  Starting at Sweden my handicap was 63.  A year later, who knows, maybe it was 45.  So I cannot relate at all.  She is playing in on a totally different level at that age.  It's impressive to see in so many ways, and I look forward to playing with her tomorrow.

Q.  Annika, you were talking about not pressing and playing your own game.  Is the worse thing you can do on a course like this, start to get aggressive?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, I think if you're playing well, and you've got the momentum, you should be aggressive.  But when you're not exactly hitting it perfectly, and you don't have the momentum, it could be dangerous.  So therefore I'm trying to play strategically down the fairway, get in the middle of the green and have a birdie opportunity.  You've got to stay out of trouble here.  And I think to make a bogey -- I figure if I play it safe, I can make birdies and climb up the leaderboard.

Q.  How much do you think your experience here in the final round is going to be a factor tomorrow?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, we'll see, but I've been there.  I've done that.  I know what this championship means.  Patricia hasn't won a major.  She might be hungry, but I'm starving, so I'm just going to go out there tomorrow and do the best I can.

Q.  You mentioned your rhythm and getting into it, and it wasn't quite with you today.  When do you feel that begins to happen, in the early holes, 3rd, 4th, fifth hole, you figure it's coming in place for me?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I played this game long enough that anything can happen at any time.  You've got to be patient.  There are points up there when I just want to shake my head and slam my club in the ground and walk off the course.  But what does that do?  You've got to continue.  You've got to continue to play.  You've got to hit the next shot.  You have to have a free mind.  You have to keep on going.  That's what happened today, I stayed so patient.  So tomorrow I'm just going to have the same attitude.  Hopefully it's on the first hole, and things will go really well from there.

Q.  How big a difference do you think it would have been going to the final round being down five shots instead of three shots?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   It's another two shots.  So it's a big difference.  Three shots is three shots.  But anything can happen on this golf course.  And again, I'm just going to worry about my game.  I know I can shoot low.  And if I do that I think things will take care of themselves.
