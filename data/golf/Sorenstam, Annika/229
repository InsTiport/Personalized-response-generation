JOEL LAMP:  We've got Annika Sorenstam here in the interview area.  Annika, off to a great start this season, several wins to start the season.  Just talk a little bit about your general thoughts on your start so far.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Sure.  Well, I'm obviously very happy with my start.  I've played in five tournaments and I have won four, so I don't really think I could have asked for a better start.  I feel pretty good about my game.  I've had a week off, worked with my coach, so I'm ready to come here and play some good golf again.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it worked last year.  But this year I decided to have a little different approach, come early.  I'm going to do my normal routine, which is nine holes on Tuesday and Pro Am Wednesday, and the reason is I want to try to get through    I'm playing three weeks in a row, want to try to find a rhythm early.  It obviously helps to know the golf course.  I know it from last year and now again I've got a chance to see it.  My caddie knows the course really well, and that helps, as well.  I feel like I'm ready.  I mean, I'm prepared and hopefully I can just hit the shots that I intend to do and make some putts.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I mean, it's a combination of social, talk about shots, talk about swings, talk about what I do, and it gives me a chance to get to know some of the guys.

It's a lot more relaxed than it will be in a tournament, that's for sure.  We mix the conversations about golf with    I ask the guys what they do, where they come from.  You get to know them between the shots.  I don't know the percentage at all.  It's actually the first time I got that question.  Today is a social day, there's no doubt about it.  I do take some practice swings, some extra putting when we're done on the hole, you but other than that, it's all about having fun and interacting.  That's what today is about.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think the greens are in pretty good shape.  They've done some changes around here on the greens, especially with the bunkers.  You can see that they have changed a little bit and I know that they've had a tough winter, so there are some places where it hasn't really grown in yet.  If you stay on the fairway and you stay on the greens, it should be good.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought I was playing pretty good last year, and I feel good about my game this year.  It's tough to say I was playing better last year or this year.  I think this year I'm scoring really well.  I might not be hitting the ball as solid, but I'm getting the business done.  My short game is a lot better, a lot more solid.  I've had some saves from bad shots.  It's very similar.  It's improved a little bit from last year maybe, but it feels really solid.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, I have a lot of confidence.  I obviously believe in what I do, especially I trust myself when I stand on the tee.  I think experience, learning how to scramble, I don't get too uptight about a bad shot anymore.  I know I can fix it.  I look forward to different challenges; if I have a tough shot, I'm not afraid.  I think when I was a little younger I was playing with a lot more fear.  Now I just stand on the tee and I hit it, and if I don't hit it on line I find it and I can always find a way to get it on the green, and I think that's where I've really improved the last few years, just the scrambling part.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, definitely.  No, I have to pace myself a lot.  I mean, I love what I do but I never thought I could win this many tournaments.  You know, I think the key the last four or five years is I've learned how to practice with quality.  I don't practice maybe as much, but when I do practice, I have a purpose.

I have learned to figure out my weaknesses, I have learned to figure out my strengths and I know how to apply them.  I use my brain a lot more on the course, more strategy.  I know what shots I can hit.  I don't experiment too much.  I know what I can handle.

And then also I think the physical part has helped me tremendously.  I'm hit hitting the ball further.  I feel like I'm stronger, especially with the longer irons.  That's just helped me over all.  You add those things together, I think that's the combination.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I mean, I have practiced with him the last two or three years.  He's helped me a lot with the short game.  It's mostly around the greens.  You know, just a little imagination.  He can hit all kinds of shots.  He was showing me five different shots with one club, and for me it was just one shot.  Now I'm starting to learn maybe there's two or three.  That's been great to me, to see it and practice and work on something new, and having said that, I think that's really where I have improved the most is the short game.  I can get up and down from most places now.  Before it was tough.  I hit a lot of greens, but if I missed it would be a bogey.  Nowadays I'm not afraid because I can see a shot, and if you can see it, then I think you can do it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I like to compete.  You know, I'm very competitive.  Once I stand on the first tee, I'm going to give it all I've got.  I come here, I come here to play, I come here to win.  I think the key is scheduling.  You can't play every week.  If I played every week, I wouldn't feel the same way.  The way I play and the way I schedule is just be ready when I'm out.

Like I'm either on or I'm off, there's nothing in between.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I've always been very competitive.  I think, you know, in golf, though, I would say I've learned a lot the last few years, what works, what doesn't work, and I think a lot of people think I practice every day when I'm home; I don't.  I do take a lot of breaks, and therefore I think I'm fresh when I come out.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't expect myself to win, but I want to be in contention.  I believe that it's    if I come out here and I feel like I'm playing pretty good, I have a chance to do it, and therefore knowing that, the confidence is high and I trust myself.  The competition is getting tougher and tougher every year, so you can't just come here and play mediocre, you've got to play the best you can.  That's why I think scheduling is even more important, because if I'm a little tired, then I can't.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think I have better muscle control.  Actually my coach has mentioned that to me, when we work on something, it doesn't take as long for me to get to the right position as it used to.  I would understand what he was saying but I couldn't really feel it.  Now when he says something I can do it and I can change easier.  So I think that's very important.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I guess we'll never really know, but since then things have gone really well.  I think the combination of stepping up the practice, working with the guys, being under the microscope for that particular week, the pressure, that wherever I go, I feel like I've done that, I can handle that, and I did well at the Colonial, so nothing really scares me.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I travel with the same set of clubs and it really doesn't matter if the course is long or short.  I play with the same clubs.  The only difference where I might change out a club is if it's really windy conditions or if the course is playing very, very firm, I might take out my 7 wood and put in a 3 iron, but other than that, I hit the same clubs that I have for three years.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I've been mixing the irons a little bit this year.  I'm on my third set of irons.  But I'm very happy with these.  I'm going to stick to these now, no more changing.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I haven't even thought about it.  I look forward to it.  I mean, Rosie, obviously she loves it here, she's played really well here.  I haven't played with Christina in a long time, so I'm sure she will keep me entertained one way or another.  It's going to be a fun two days.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It really doesn't matter.  I want to play with somebody who's playing well.  I like to see some putts go in.  You want to have some good momentum.  It's tough to play with somebody who is struggling because it kind of drags the whole group down.  Having said that, I don't want to play bad, either, so I can keep up with the pace of the group.  I'm a fast player, but then out here you can't really play any faster than the rest of the field plays, so it doesn't really matter.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  There's certain records that mean a lot to me.  There's some records that I never really thought I could achieve, and to me it's like, well, if they don't come naturally, then I'm not going to make up stuff.  But right now there are certain things that motivate me, that keep me coming back out every week and keep me practicing and keep me wanting to get better.  Yeah, I would love to be part of the history book in one way or another.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, majors, I think I've said this the last how many years, but I'd like to win more majors.  I believe I can do that.  Obviously I want to shoot 54.  I shot 59, so that's one record.  I keep track of the history books.  I know what's out there, but there's certain things I just think it's going to be impossible to do.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, they all would be great.  I would settle with one.  I'm not going to be greedy.  Right now in my mind there's a Grand Slam.  I'd like to win majors.  I believe I can do it and that's really what's on my mind.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, if I can continue this pace, I'm not really sure I can.  Right now I just feel in a way kind of fortunate and lucky that I am winning these tournaments.  Who knows who will happen the next three years, but that's a record that I never really thought was possible.  I know I'm getting closer, but I still have 28 wins to tie, and that's a lot of wins.  Right now I just want to take one tournament at a time, major at a time, and we'll see.  If I'm one day at 87, then yeah, I will give it another shot.  But until then, it's a long ways to go.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think a lot of players care about the majors.  I mean, for me what makes them so special is because, first of all, you select four, and we always play on really tough golf courses.  The field is always tough, and the way they set up the course is just extreme, and I think that's a true challenge, and that's why I think the majors are so important.  I would love to see them get the status that the guys have, but having said that, every week we have a great tournament in one way or another.  A win is a win, and I think they're all special.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think the Kraft Nabisco is kind of our Masters.  I mean, we we've played in the same place for years, Dinah starting a great tradition.  I think they have a lot of similarities.  For me I would say that's kind of our Masters.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean, the reason why I came back last year is because I felt tremendous support from everyone when I was playing in the Colonial.  There was a lot of people that had comments that I shouldn't play in the Colonial, but people here at Corning seemed very supportive, and I appreciated that, and that was kind of my way of saying, hey, I'm coming back.  That's what I did last year.  I was welcomed when I came here.  I could feel that people were happy to see me and they treated me well, and then on top of that I played well, so now I'm back, and I'm here, and I feel the same way this year.  I mean, people have been very nice, very supportive, and that means a lot.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I mean, I think it's exciting, I think it's great.  It's a new generation that's coming.  It's the growth of women's golf or growth of the LPGA.  We have a lot of different players around.  I mean, I think it's exciting.  I was really happy to see Paula win.  I don't think I've played with her ever.  If I have, it's been a long time ago.  You know, she's very talented with a very promising career, and she played on a really tough golf course last week.  I heard the pins were tough.  I know because I played there in the past.  It's an old, traditional, challenging golf course, so I was very happy to see her win.  She's just paving the path for the young ones, so that's good for the Tour.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, every week we have a lot of players here that opens it up a lot for everyone.  Then again, when I was a rookie, I was looking up to players and said that's what I want to do one day.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it will be nice when the sun shines, it will be nice with a little heat.  It reminds me of Sweden growing up, not that that's a bad thing.  It's May and it's nice to have a little warmth, but we've all got to take it as it comes.  With two days of practice now, I'm pretty used to it.

I think it's going to make the course a little longer if it continues this way.  We're not going to get as much roll in the fairways.  That might play a little role.  Other than that, I think it's the same for everyone.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, we're both competitive, there's no doubt.  I think we've kind of toned down a little bit.  When we were younger we were very competitive.  I don't see her as much because she lives on the West Coast, I live on the East Coast, so just here and there in tournaments.  This particular week we happened to stay together, so it's nice to catch up and talk about some stuff.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We did that, yeah.  We did that.  I'm glad I asked her if she wanted to do it and she was happy to, so that was nice for me to share it with her.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Very little.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I just remember on that particular hole I hit, whatever, 6 iron, and that's where I played it.  It's a lot more fun when you've played the golf course.  You know what it's like.  You know, that was fun.  Kenny Perry won again.  He seems to like that place.
Q.  Talk about going for three in a row at McDonald's.  A couple other players have had a chance before.  What are your thoughts about having a chance to get three in a row at McDonald's?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I'm looking forward to the challenge.  It was too bad that they moved the golf course.  I finally figured the other one out.  But I hope to get a few practice rounds in, try and figure out the course, and I look forward to the challenge.  It's a very prestigious event and I want to do well.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think in certain ways I'm very similar to my mom.  She's kind of intense at certain times.  But my whole family is very athletic, and when I decide to do something, I do it.  I never give up, and I think that's where I get it from.  I mean, my mom loves to play golf.  She's probably an 11 handicap and she's a very good player.
JOEL LAMP:  All right, thanks a lot, Annika.  Good luck this week.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.
