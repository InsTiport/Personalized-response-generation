  Q. What's going on?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I don't know, I live in Florida, I should be used to this. I just have a terrible stomach ache, I don't know what it is, I've had it about nine holes and it's not going away, feel a bit nauseous, so going to go in and get some rest.   
  
  Q. Fitness is one of your advantages, so you're probably surprised by this, but you were able to play through it and get past it and you're in position to win this tournament.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, we'll see, we have a long way to go.   
 I just want to get some rest and get ready for tomorrow. This course is tough enough, I don't need a stomach ache on top of it. It's a challenge, so one thing at a time.   
  
  Q. Was it more mind over matter today?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, I've just been patient all day, hitting one shot at a time, and you know, I made a few putts which made a difference.   
  
  Q. When did it start?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Just from the back nine, the stomach pain.   
  
  Q. So everything's just right there?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm close. It's fun and I'm happy playing consistent, a few birdies and not too many mistakes. Yesterday I felt like I left a few shots out there.   
 I didn't hit the ball as well today but I finished better. I cleaned it up and made a few up-and-downs.  
  
  Q. It seems like the fairways are really soft and the greens are like bricks; is that an accurate assessment?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I would say, I got some mud on the ball and it's bouncing on the greens.   
  
  Q. That variety or contrast --  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: We've had that before, yeah.   
  
  Q. Your stomach pain started on the back nine?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah.
