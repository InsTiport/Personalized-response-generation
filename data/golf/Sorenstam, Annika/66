 Q. Beautiful par save at 17 coming off that and tough one to swallow at 18 to miss the short one at the last. You're still 2-under par and not out of it. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I am. I've been fighting and fighting. I've done everything I can. I just need a few putts to drop and it will be a different story. 
 Obviously I'm very, very disappointed. I can't do anymore. I'm hitting it beautifully, I need one or two to drop. It would mean the world for me.

 Q. The 9th hole has been good for you, beautiful curling birdie putt and today your heroics with your third there today. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was, it was a really cool shot. I could see the top of the pin and I knew if I hit it past the hole it's going to come back. 
 And when I got up to the hill I saw it tracking down and when it went in it was sweeter.

 Q. The fans got to see that at the opening portion of our telecast today. Thank you for kicking it off. Good luck tomorrow. You came from five back in 1995 your first U.S. Open win, it could happen tomorrow?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Thank you. I hope so.
