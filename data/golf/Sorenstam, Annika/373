ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Start with hole number 3. I birdied, holed a bunker shot.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: That was a long one.  It was about 40 feet green bunker on the left hand.  4, birdied 9-iron, 10 feet.  Then I had par all the way through number 12, the par 3; hit a 6-iron to about 30 feet.  Holed that putt for birdie.  Hole number 14, let us see, I hit sand wedge 15 feet, birdie.  And then I bogeyed No. 15.  I missed the putt.  Had a chip; 2-putt that was probably about 5 feet.  Then also bogeyed number 16, I 3-putted on that green.  I missed a 3-footer.  I parred -- no, I had birdie on 17.  I hit the green in 2 and 2-putted.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I had 3-wood into the green and I was -- 2-putt from 40 feet.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: On 18?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It wasn't at that point in.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Sure, I am very pleased with the way I played.  I started out very steady; hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  As I said, I only had tap-ins for par until I came on the back 9 which I mis-hit a few shots.  Other than that, it was very  steady golf.  A lot of patience out there.  Took it one shot at a time.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: The first thing I noticed is the wind was different compared to the two practice rounds.  I felt like the wind was totally opposite, so it made the course a little different.  In the end the wind died down so it was almost like playing --


Q.   One 3-putt green?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yes.


Q.   Talk a little bit about just before you bogeyed those two holes, didn't you have about a 10-foot birdie putt, did that have any bearing on the 2 bogeys that followed?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Oh, yeah, I had a putt there that was about 10 feet for birdie; it slipped away a bit.  I was going pretty comfortable out there. It was only-- I made bogey on that first shot that I really missed the green on, so, you know, playing so many holes without missing a green, it doesn't come as a surprise; you always miss a few.


Q.   How far was that putt on 18 that could have put you in the lead? 

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was very short.  It was less than 3 feet.  I knew it was going to break, but I didn't know it was going to break that much.  I thought I hardly touched it.  It just ran away.  The second putt was longer than the first.


Q.   You have played well all season; haven't you, Annika?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yes, thank you, been a good year so far.


Q.   Do you feel that you left some shots out there today, Annika?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Overall, no.  As I said with the bunker that I started out -- I think I have to be thankful for what I got overall.  I know I can go out there and do better, but today the way I was playing, I think I should be pleased.


Q.   On that shot on 15, I think you missed the green short there, right, did you misclub or the first bogey?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, it was a bad swing; a little lazy.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, I thought the greens would be a little firmer.  In the beginning I was short  all the time and I expected the ball to roll a little more than it did.  Took awhile for me to adjust to it. In the end, actually, I was long, but better that than being short.


Q.   How was the pace of play; was it kind of slow going out there today?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was extremely slow.  5 and a half hours, I think we went.


Q.   Were you waiting on a lot of shots?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: We waited on every single hole and as a matter of fact, the 3rd hole we were 3 groups on the tee.


Q.   Do you have any explanation for that?  Do you think maybe the pressure of The Open causes players to play a little slower?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I think probably you are right.  People take their time and I mean, there is not a lot of walking between the holes, so I don't understand.  It must be people are just taking their time.


Q.   I guess we see your name on the leaderboards a lot and the thing that comes to mind that you are probably the best player who doesn't have a Major  title.  Are you prepared to add one of those and is that a goal of yours?  You seem like you are just taking everything in stride, nothing too high; nothing too low?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Definitely a goal to get a big title.  I think the time comes when it is my turn. Be patient.  I haven't won here, so I have to win first and if it is a big win or a small win, I will take it.
