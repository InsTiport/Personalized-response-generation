JOEL LAMP:   Annika, 3 under par round today.  Let's go over your score card first.  You started out on No. 10 with a bogey
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I had a sand wedge short of the grown and three putted from probably 35 feet.

And then I bogeyed No. 13.  I hit 6 iron on the green and three putted there, as well.  My par putt was 5 feet.

I eagled 14.  I hit 4 wood onto the green and I made a putt from seven feet.

Birdied 15.  Pitching wedge to five feet.

Birdied16.  Sand wedge to six feet.

Birdied 17. Sand wedge to four feet.

Eagled 2.  9 iron to eight feet.

Bogeyed 5. Sand wedge short of the green, 3 putts.  The par put was three feet.

Bogeyed 7. I hit a 7 iron over the green, 3 putts and missed the par putt that was three feet.
JOEL LAMP:  Just talk a little bit about the general thoughts of the round.  Scores have been relatively around 69, 70 this morning.  Just talk a little bit about your round.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Obviously in the middle part of my round, I'm very happy with the way I played 6 of 7 holes.  I was like 7 under.  I'll take that.  But then I didn't start as well, and then I didn't finish as well as I'd like to.  I have a few things to work on.  Other than that, I thought I hit the ball pretty good.  I thought it was tricky out there with the wind swirling constantly.  It's tough to judge what club to hit, especially when the greens are so small.  It makes a big different if you don't take the right club.  That's what happened to me on the first hole.  If you don't hit the right club, you end up on the wrong side of the pin and you can have some really tricky putts.  And I had that, as well.  It was a little bit up and down today for sure, but I'm glad I had a good stretch in the middle.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Actually I putted well.  Some of these greens are    they're just tricky.  It's very undulated.  The wind made them difficult to putt on.  I did have four 3 putts.  I'm obviously not happy with that.  But again, I think I made some good putts when I needed to.  It's a little mix.  You have got to be aggressive here, and once you miss the putt or the hole, it just fires away on you.  So you have to find a nice balance with speed.  Then if you don't hit it firm enough, they bounce around a little bit so we have to be aggressive.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yes, especially when the wind is swirling like this.  It makes it quite tricky.  If the wind was one direction, then obviously you can have a game plan, you know what each hole plays.  But here, I'm standing    for example, my last hole, the 9th hole here, I thought it was totally downwind.  And by the time I was going hit it's into the wind, and by the time I get to the green it's left to right.  So having said that, it could be three different clubs.  I can go downwind from a sand wedge, left to right, a pitching wedge, which I hit, to a 9 iron.  You have to time it pretty well, and that makes it difficult.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I'm surprised the scores are not lower, because there are some Par 5s.  No. 2, I hit 5 iron in, and I reached three of them.  There are some chances out there.  But again, I realize it's difficult.  If you don't play aggressive off the tees, it's longer and the ball will be in the air longer and the wind will affect it a little bit more.  It makes it quite tricky.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I have no idea.  You know what, this is Thursday.  We are so far from Sunday.  This is just to get off to a decent, not to shoot yourself in the foot.  It doesn't matter where I am by the end of the day, I want to be in contention on Sunday.  I'm happy with the my game and I'm just going to continue to play like I have.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's mostly maintenance.  I mean, last week when I saw him, we worked on my setup.  We just worked on my shoulder turn going back.  A lot of those things make me come through the ball a little better.  The goal is to finish on my left side.  Sometimes I have a tendency to fall back a little bit.  It's mostly maintenance, checking the grip, setup, alignment, all those things to make sure you're on the right track.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, it seems I do three or four things in my swing all the time.  It just varies.  He will come one time and it will be my shoulder.  The next time it's something else.  Then he comes back again and it's my shoulder.  It's like I fall back into the same bad habits.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We kind of mind our own business.  I know Rosie since I've been out here.  She's had some great success here, no doubt about it.  She knows this course inside and out.  It was funny.  There was one tee shot, on the 6th hole, she said, I have never been here in 24 years.  I think she would know every area, that's for sure.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We take turns.  I probably do dinners and she'll make breakfast.  She is great to stay with.  She takes great care of me.  I go out to dinner with other friends too.  We kind of take turns, give her a little break once in a while.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Normally this is the course where you see a low score, but it is tricky out there.  I think that's what all the players are finding, making the right club selection.
JOEL LAMP:  Thanks a lot, Annika.
