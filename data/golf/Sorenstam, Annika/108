   ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, I'm disappointed.  I think I played well, just had a few bad shots that just really magnified the whole score today.  I don't know, I'm disappointed.  I played well.  Nothing else to say other than it's another day tomorrow. 

 Q.  You hit three balls in the water today.  Talk about how disappointing that was. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It just magnified some of the shots that I hit.  It was just one of those days, unfortunately. 

 Q.  (Question regarding on which holes balls were hit in the water.) 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Going backwards, 17, 15 and 7. 

 Q.  What is your mindset since you're one or two shots right above 16th going into tomorrow? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm just going to play well and avoid the water.  Take three less and I'm 1-under par.  It's just very, very close.  I mean, I love this place, I love the golf course.  It's just I've got to get on the other side of the marker tomorrow. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible.) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, it's a good hole either way.  I mean, I like the short tees, a better view.  Maybe a little further back.  I like the hole the way it was and I like the hole the way it is.  It's not a big deal.
