DANA GROSS RHODE:  We have Annika Sorenstam with us.  Annika, it was a tough round, you guys battled to the end.  Can you talk about it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean, what can I say other than Juli beat me today.  She played very good.  I got off to a really good start and she finished very strong.  So it was a great match, a lot of birdies, a lot of good shots.  You know, there's not much I could do.
Q.  Juli is known as one of the top match players in the game going back to her amateur days.  Did you get the sense she was still fighting?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think everyone knows Juli is a great competitor, great golfer and great athlete.  You know when you stand on the tee and play against Juli, you know it's going to be tough.

She played really well last week.  I mean, she was in the hunt until maybe the last two holes.  It seems like her game is continuing, the momentum is still there.  I didn't expect anything differently.  Like I said, it's tougher to find a bigger competitor than Juli out here.
Q.  A lot of golf this week for and you today was a long day, also.  Did fatigue at all catch up with you during the final round today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't know if it caught up with me but obviously I feel tired now especially knowing that I'm done.  I think that's when it hits you, and I'm just looking forward to a little break.  I guess I just get one day and I've got to get back, I have a sponsor day, etc.

You know, when you're in the middle of everything and you're playing, you really don't think about those things, at least I don't.  I was playing so well, I just felt excited about the way I'm hitting the ball and the way I was putting, I wasn't really thinking about if I was tired or not.  I was out there, I was trying to win the match.  I wanted to improve from last year and that's really that was on my mind all day.
Q.  Talk about the last putt, did you hit your line?  Did you feel that you read it right?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it's a tough pin placement, it's sitting right on the ridge and I aimed just inside the right edge and it seemed like it was enough, but it seemed like it rolled right over the edge.  It's an aggressive stroke.  Just wasn't the right line.
Q.  What was your reaction when she chipped in on 16?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say it's almost typical Juli.  She seems to do that once in awhile and she had not done it all day.  I was so pleased with the shot I hit in, I had six, seven feet, one of tougher holes out there.  It really made the match.  It was exciting until then but then it really made it exciting and I thought, you know what, I've got to get some breaks.  I want to hit them closer and make them.
Q.  I know you don't like to lose, but when you're in a match like this against that kind of competitor, is it really fun?  Did you have a good time today playing?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I loved it.  This is what it's all about.  To have a chance to play against Juli, I mentioned it earlier, a great competitor but she's also a great person, really a lot of fun.  It's nice; it was a good atmosphere.  I thought the golf was good.  I made six birdies.  I'm pretty happy about that.  For her to finish up with a birdie on 18, that's just a good match I think.
