Q.
First of all, rain delay, you played one hole.  How did that affect you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It didn't really affect me too much because it was just one hole.  It was a long delay so I had a chance to eat twice.  So I had a chance to warm up again and the conditions were obviously perfect this afternoon.  No wind, greens really receptive.

I played all right.  I hit some fairways, hit some greens, so you know, I took advantage of it with the scoring.  But still too many holes left for the round to say too much about it.
Q.  So going back out there you thought, let's try and get as many birdies as possible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, because the conditions were good.  I wanted to get the momentum again, try and hit fairways and greens.  It was pretty much starting over, because I only played one hole.  But actually, the conditions were really good.

So we'll see.
Q.  What do you do now?  10 holes to play tomorrow?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I just want to get some dinner, go to bed early, going to be a long day tomorrow.  Obviously want to get up early, kind of get loose.  I got to play nine and start with a tough hole and just start the faster, the better.
Q.  Conditions tomorrow in the morning?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, if the conditions are like this, you can fire at the pin still.  Normally there is no wind in the morning.  So I guess that's a good thing.
Q.  Did you look at tomorrow morning as maybe an opportunity to make up some ground?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I have some ground to make up, but also a long ways to go.  So I have to find a balance of still being patient and aggressive.
Q.  You kind of just talked about that, but going for the four peat, it's still obviously within your sights?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A long ways to go.  But I have to make a few more birdies.
