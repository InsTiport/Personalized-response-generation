Q. Yesterday you said it wasn't so much about Europe losing as it was America playing great.  Is that the ultimate story of this whole weekend?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I think so.  We just got outplayed, there's no doubt about it.  I'm so proud how hard they fought.  And it's not easy coming out here on a Sunday with the team so far behind.
But I'm proud of them.  They're out there fighting every single match, every single point.  What can I say?  Just congratulate the U.S.A. because they played some awesome golf.
Q. You've done amazing things in your career, made history so many times.  Where will this weekend rank among your career achievements?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Sometimes it's not always about the results.  I must say that this has been a lot about the journey.  I've learned a lot the last 18 months.  It's been a pleasure to represent the European Tour.  I'm so proud of these young girls, and to get to know them, new friendships, new memories.  That's what moves (indiscernible) on in life.
