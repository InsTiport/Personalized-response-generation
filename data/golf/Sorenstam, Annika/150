ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Very happy with the way I played.  I hit a lot of good shots.  I made some good putts.  Just played solid, I think that's more important than anything.
Q.  Are you happy with the way you played today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Very happy.  I played solid.  Didn't make any mistakes.  No bogeys.  Just down the middle, hit the green, make putts.
Q.  Are you ready for another 18?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I go out in another hour and then go out and try to continue the way I played today, this morning.
Q.  You're not tired yet?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm trying not to think about it.  I'm just going to go play, keep on going and doing the best I can and hit one shot at a time.

Just very solid overall, a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  Rolled in some good putts early on.  9, I had 75 yards to the pin, landed pin high and came forward right into the hole.
Q.  What club?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Lob wedge.
Q.  Any other birdies?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  First hole, ten feet.  Hit a sand wedge to ten feet.

Then there was another hole, No. 5, down the hill, I hit 9 iron to ten feet.

Birdied No. 12, 6 iron probably 16 feet.  I think that's it.
