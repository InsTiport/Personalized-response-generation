  Q.  General thoughts on the round?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was -- I hit the ball solid.  I had one 3-putt there but other than that, I think the greens are firming up and tougher pin placements.  I thought it was a little more difficult.   
 If you were on the edge you didn't know if it would take a big bounce or little bounce.  Sometimes coming out of the corner it was difficult, and the pins were tucked today.   
  
  Q.  Still, you're right there going into the final day.  You were further back last year.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I'm glad that, you know -- the round it still kept me in there and that's been the hardest part this year is putting together four solid rounds this year.  I've had a tough time and now I had a decent round.   
 I'm looking forward to tomorrow and hopefully posting a low round.   
  
  Q.  Still right there?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I would say so, today I played as solid but not as many birdies.  It was a decent round and I didn't give too much room to the leaders and I'm still right there for Sunday.   
 Sherri just playing very solid.  I would say, you know, she had some great pace at times, and when she hit it close she made birdies.  She had a good round today.   
  
  Q.  You had an extra long putt on 9, any other holes stand out?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I made two in a row, made the turn at 1-under and then other than that, I mean, I made a great save on 10 but it was a 5- or 6-footer.
