ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Tough day.  I don't know, I tried hard.  Couldn't get much going.  It's difficult with the wind.  The greens are really slick.  You know, they are drying out.  I think they are rolling very good.  It's almost like glass; the edges are so sharp.
Q.  You've played this course a few times with Smoltz or whoever it happened to be with that time, is the scoring about what you thought it would be this week or are you disappointed with where you are?

Q.  Set up for the recreational crowds?

Q.  Having fun doing the home crowd thing?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I did.
Q.  See anybody you know out there from the grocery stores or whatever?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I asked for a lot of tickets, put it that way.  It's fun.  Once a year, and in Sweden, so for me it's twice a year.
