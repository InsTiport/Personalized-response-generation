Q.  If you can describe what's going through your mind right now.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's tough, but it's awesome, really.  What a great week, what a great finish.  I mean, I want to thank Pat and congratulate her on great competition and good playing.  Wow, it's fantastic.
Q.  You said earlier in the week that you were coming in with a game plan that you were going to treat this as an ordinary week as much as possible.  Were you able to treat today as an ordinary day?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I've been trying so hard.  I think I've been talking to myself so many times, if somebody saw me, they might think I'm weird.  I just keep telling myself, just play your game, it's good enough, focus on what you've got to do, don't think too much about the surroundings, focus on what you want to do, here's your chance, and I kept saying that over and over.
Q.  It has been so long since you hoisted the U.S. Open trophy.  In terms of satisfaction, where does this victory rank for you?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's obviously way up there.  When I came out early and won my first tournament was a U.S. Open and I won back to back, and I thought, wow, I can do this.  Now it's been ten years.  Like you said, it's been a long wait, a long road, but along the way I've learned a lot, and this week obviously means a lot to me, to come back the way I did, and especially the way the season has been going, a little up and down.  To win the Open has been a little ironic.
