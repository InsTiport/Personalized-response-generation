  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was slow. 11 and 12, I just didn't know if I was going to make it. You know, after yesterday's round, I never really got better, had a hard time keeping the food down, and then this morning got some breakfast in and thought, "This will be all right," and then I come out here and the heat, and it was tougher than I thought it would be, so --  
  
  Q. I saw you with the umbrella.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, my umbrella broke, so then I gave up on that. Yeah, then I had a cool thing around the neck to feel better.  
  
  Q. The chair work?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: The chair once in a while. I am not really sure what it is.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I am glad I am finished. I told Karen, "I do not want to walk off the course. She goes, you know, "Don't do it for me, do it for you." And I said, "Well, I don't want to just walk off."   
 And then I got up there and I said, "I have a birdie putt." And she said, "You have an eagle putt." And I said, "Yeah, you are right." So that kind of got me going.  
  
  Q. One final question (inaudible.)   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I am not really sure. It's just my stomach. It almost feels swollen and kind of -- what do you call it? Churning around. And I felt sick all day, felt like the food was going to come up, and I haven't had much, other than drink, so --  
  
  Q. Does this give you a boost for tomorrow, coping with this?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, today, really, I just wanted to finish. I did not have a score in mind. I mean, I was 4 over after so many holes, but it really didn't matter, just get it done with and see if I can just finish, and then after 11 I didn't know if I could, but the birdies kept me going, but I am hoping that I will feel better tomorrow. I still have a little chance. If I feel good, then I have got a chance.
