Q.  Annika, it's difficult to start with that.  It was a fine match to win?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was an unbelievable match.  I thought started on the first hole, two birdies.  Birdie on the second.  A lot of birdies, a lot of great golf.  Like you saw it came down to the last hole. 


Q.  Tell me about that putt on 17?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The score was so close.  When she did.  I figured let's do it.  i didn't really see a lot to it.  Just get the right pace and it should be in.  It started and it was tracking along.  I said please go in and it did.  It's been a long day for me.  I'm glad that she made it.  I didn't know how much I had left in me.  Suzann did it when she needed it and that was perfect.


Q.  How big is a three point lead?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think it's huge.  Especially in this match.  We were playing so well.  We were up early on.  I think it's important to finish it up to win.  For the singles we want to have the good momentum and we'll see what happens.


Q.  That was wonderful to watch.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thanks.  It was exciting.  Thank you.
