Q.  Certainly not a round that you're overly excited about, Annika, but in reality, you're right in the thick of things.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I guess I am.  I'm actually quite pleased with my round today.  It was difficult out there.  I hit a lot of good shots.  It seemed like all day I was between clubs.  And it was one of those days that I made a great birdie on 17 and got into level par, I'll take it.

Q.  Did the course play exceedingly hard?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No.  I think it was the wind that made it difficult.  The course is in great shape.  The wind was swirling, sometimes it was down, sometimes it was in.  I didn't know what to hit.

Q.  Congratulations on a good opening round. Good luck the rest of the way.

ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Thank you very much.
