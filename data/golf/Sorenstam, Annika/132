  Q.  How do you come back from a long delay like you had today?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I had plenty of time to warm-up.  It was almost like I was starting a new round.  I had only played five holes.   
  
  Q.  Are you pleased with how you were playing once you got back out?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I bogeyed the first hole   
 The greens are hard, they're quick.  This is not an easy golf course, particularly around the greens, they're quick.   
  
  Q.  What will your game plan be for tomorrow morning?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's a long day, I'm going to get dinner quick and go to bed early and try to get as much rest as possible.  It's a long day so I really have to save energy as much as I can.  And go from there.   
 It's nice to have the momentum and go out early tomorrow and finish the round.
