 Q. 15 under par, that will work.
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: When, here? Oh, here. Oh, in the Master's. It really doesn't matter.

 Q. Good round in the window, right?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It was, yeah. It was good. I left a few out there. But, you know, it was solid. I think I had a lot of good shots. I was up there in the back nine. Front nine, my back 9, I thought greens are really firming up. You cannot find a pitch mark out there (inaudible).

 Q. Is the wind much of a problem? How much of a problem is the wind?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It plays a big factor, about two clubs at times. Oh, yeah. It's tough. Some of the pins, it's tough, for example, my 17, the pin was way left and it's howling left to right, makes it very difficult.

 Q. Annika, take us through the putt at 17, early on in your round. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, I hit a 5-iron in there and downhill putt, you really want to just get over the crest and then just kind of trickle down and hit the hole.

 Q. Is this the kind of round you would like to have for the first round of a Major? Get out there and still on the leaderboard, not shot yourself in the foot. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You had to be very patient, especially when the conditions are the way they are. It's a long ways to go. You just have to go out and battle it day by day, stroke by stroke, and take it as it comes. That's what Majors are about. I haven't done anything to ruin my chances, by any means. A few more would have been great, but there is definitely a long ways to go.

 Q. Annika, how good (inaudible)?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Very good. If I would have had three under, I would have been very, very pleased. 5 under, even better, so --

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I love it here. I think it's a great golf course. It's tough when the wind is the way it is. It's tough when the greens are so firm. But again, it's tough, it knows how to reward good shots.

 Q. At the same time, is this something you can blow off, this first round?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: My history? 

 Q. Yeah -- no, your round today. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Absolutely. I feel good about my game, I just got to finish a little stronger and clean it up a little bit.

 Q. Annika, as the weekend unfolds, how much does it help that you have so much experience?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Experience matters, feeling good about a place matters. When you have done it before, it's a little easier, even though you wanted it to matter, but you know what it's like to be in that situation.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I am not here to hunt, I am here to play.
