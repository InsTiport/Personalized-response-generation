 Q. Talk about finishing in the top 5 in your first Tour event. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I'm very pleased.  I had a good run today.  Made one or two mistakes coming down the stretch, but then I bounced back.  It wasn't enough, but it was fun to have a chance and do all that. 

 Q.  What were your thoughts as the leaders were drawing closer and closer today? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was exciting.  I liked having a chance. 

 Q.  What was the key for you? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, hitting better, hitting fairways, hitting greens.  You know, it's fun being consistent.
