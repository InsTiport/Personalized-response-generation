JOEL LAMP:  We have Annika Sorenstam here in the interview room, 3 under par 69, second place at 13 under par.  Let's start off with your score card.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I bogeyed the first hole.  I hit a 6 iron left in the green side bunker and 2 putted from 12 feet.

Birdied No. 2, 7 iron on the green and 2 putted from about 12 feet.

Birdied the 5th hole, 5 iron to the right, chipped it up to about two feet.

Bogeyed 7, 8 iron short of the green, chipped it up, 2 putted from nine feet.

Birdied No. 8, sand wedge to 10 feet.

Bogeyed 9, hit a 7 iron over the green, had to take an unplayable, and hit it up from three feet.

I birdied 12, 4 wood on the green, two putts.

16, sand wedge to eight feet.

17, sand wedge to 14 feet.
JOEL LAMP:  I know you have been battling the illness and everything and coming back and having a chance there late, talk about your thoughts after the tournament.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I did have a chance, but I think I made a few too many mistakes on the front nine.  Obviously I wish I would have felt a little better so I could have given it a little more, but I didn't have much more to give.  It's just one of those times where the timing wasn't right to get a cold.  It's unfortunate, but again, you have to congratulate the winner, who played excellent.
JOEL LAMP:  Questions?
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, when I heard she made a hole in one on 15, I just realized, wow, she was three shots up and I only had three to go.  That was quite a big    for me to catch up would be really hard.

But then again, I made birdie on 16.  I made birdie on 17.  That's a little bit of pressure, maybe, but I kept on trying.  I didn't give up.  I thought I could birdie 18 and still have a chance.  It was quite exciting.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hit driver, played a little more aggressive.  I only had 15 yards to the front.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's tough to say.  Obviously I wish I would have felt better.  I would have wanted to sleep a little better the last few days and be a little more rested.  I had to hit one club more because I don't have the energy to swing as hard, but that's just the way it goes sometimes.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  That's what makes it fun.  Down three, four holes to go and there are five or six players that can win.  That's exciting.  That's drama.  You have holes where you can play aggressive.  For example, me hitting driver on 16.  Hitting driver on 17.  People try to create birdie opportunities, and that's what I think is exciting.  That's what makes a tournament.  It's fun to be a part of it.  I felt my heart pumping a little extra.  You have a chance to win.  That's what it's all about.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I can brush it off pretty good.  I've done that before.  I've won tournaments that way.  It was no fun to start that way, but all of a sudden I have an eagle opportunity on 2.  And if I would have made that, things would have changed dramatically.  Anything can happen, especially on this golf course.  I just made too many mistakes on the front nine.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The second generation has changed a little bit.  A lot of players, they're stronger, they're longer.  They're younger, obviously.  It's fun to see.  The growth is right there and you see it from all around the world.  It's getting very competitive out here.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't know anything about her.  I have seen her, but I haven't played with her.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Right now I have no idea.  I need to look at the schedule, but I'm going to tell you I've been here two years in a row and I've felt very welcome both times and they've taken very good care of me, especially this week with the doctor showing up at the holes and helping me with all kind of stuff.  Those are little perks.  That's hospitality that you don't really see everywhere and that means a lot.  So having said that, I'm not going to guarantee anything, but I've felt very welcome here.
Q.  (No microphone.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, it's probably good for me, because I was walking a little slow, so I didn't really care.
JOEL LAMP:  Thanks a lot, Annika.
