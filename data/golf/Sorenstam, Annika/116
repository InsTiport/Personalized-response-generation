  Q. Annika, a little bit of a disappointing outcome today.  What did Morgan do well?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I thought she played really well.  I thought I played well.  I didn't miss really a fairway, not many greens and, you know, just a few more putts, but, you know, I'm really pleased the way I hit it.   
 It's been tough, it's been a long week and difficult conditions for everybody, but, you know, Morgan just played, you know, slightly better than I did today, so there's not much I could have done.   
  
  Q.  Is it a matter of like one putt or one shot in match play?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I would say that in any match and here in every situation, that's just the beauty of this game.  It can just turn around real easily.  You can't -- you got to keep on going and not think about that.  Hopefully make a putt and turn the match around.   
 Morgan just, you know, birdied, I would, say the hardest hole on the course, No. 16.  So you just got to congratulate her on good play.
