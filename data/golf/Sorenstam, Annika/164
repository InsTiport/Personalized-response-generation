ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  You just have to be patient.  The back nine is tough, especially with this wind and especially playing 36 holes in one day.  You cannot give up, and I just kept on grinding and grinding.  I'm very happy with the way I played.  It's a long day and a long golf course and I'm very happy.
Q.  You said you were going to pretend like this was just another tournament.  Do you still feel that way?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think I did pretty good.  I enjoyed myself a lot out there.  I was nervous early on but after that it kind of went away and it felt great.  I was enjoying the course, enjoying the crowd and trying to make some birdies, as well.
