 Q.  More of a struggle? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Not a struggle.  It's just not happening at all.  I'm very disappointed with the outcome, obviously.  I'm doing the best I can.  It's not happening.  That's all I can say.  I'm very disappointed, of course.  When you get hungry, what else can you do? 

 Q.  Is there any one thing you can point to? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I wish it was.  I don't have an idea.  I really don't.  I don't know.  (Indiscernible) nothing's happening.  I'm trying.  But it's not happening. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I set up the course and I just want to forget about the whole thing, I want to go get something to eat and keep my spirit up. 

 Q.  When was the last time you felt like this, not having it all together? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean it happens.  I was ready coming into here.  I had a great off season, I was ready to go.  I just can't get the spark to glow. 

 Q.  Do you worry about (indiscernible)? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I haven't thought about it. 

 Q.  You were really enthused about the way you were coming in with your swing and everything. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I know.  I felt the same way.  (Indiscernible) and everything, unfortunately.  And if I had any answers I would change it, I will let you know.  I really don't.  I'm as (indiscernible) as I can be.  Golf tournaments, I'm happy as I can be.  I'm as happy as I can be, and I have to move on. 

 Q.  You feel like (indiscernible)? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, yeah.  I shot 69 before.  I'll never forget that.  I have to stay positive.  Gotta go out there tomorrow and just keep on trying.  And the last thing I want to do on Sunday is say I didn't try.  I always give 100 percent.  I'll keep on rolling.  Things can change.  Things can go bad.  Things can go good too. 

 Q.  (Indiscernible) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I'm not. 

 Q.  (Off microphone) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm glad. 

 Q.  You're laughing, but you seem kind of serene.  Inwardly that may not be the case.  Is that accurate or no? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Meaning? 

 Q.  At peace. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm trying.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm trying.  I came in here prepared.  Like I said, I had a good off season.  I can't do any more than I'm doing.  I'm not going to beat myself down.  It's the game of golf.  I've done fantastic and I'm just going to ride on that.
