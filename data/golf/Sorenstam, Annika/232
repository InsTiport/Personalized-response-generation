Q. Got your momentum going now you feel?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Yeah.  I had a great back nine.  I am very happy with the way I played today.  Obviously a lot better than yesterday.  I hit some good drives, some good putts.  When I made the first birdie on 11, after that I just kind of had great momentum.  That is really what I was looking for and it came.  So it was good.

Maybe one or two more would have been even better, but 36 holes tomorrow, anything can happen.
Q.  What did you do on the par 5 that made you birdie coming in?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Which one?
Q.  What is it, 15?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Yeah, I hit a 4 wood on the green and two putted from about 35 feet.
Q.  When you play nine holes and haven't made a birdie, do you start to get worried?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Well, I was getting a little impatient.  Then my caddy Terry, said "Save your energy.  You can still do this.  You know, we are going to need it tomorrow."

I am just trying to stay optimistic and keep grinding.  Hopefully something will roll in, and it did.  I made a 15 footer on 11, and after that it was just going my way, so it was perfect.
Q.  Is that one of those things that can jump start you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Yeah.  You know, it seemed like that is what I need.  If you look at my stats in the past, once I make one birdie, it seems like I make a few in a row.  So I just needed a few to get me going.

Like I said, a few more would have been great to get on the leaderboard and tell them I am still here.
Q.  Does having yesterday off play to your advantage?  Was that an advantage for you, not to have to even come out here?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
I am not really sure.  I think I would have been fine playing in tough conditions.  I love that.  Having said that, it is a new day today with good conditions.  I think tomorrow is going to be good for 36 holes.  I have done well in the past with that, so I look forward to it.
Q.  After nine holes did it even slip through your mind, "Good grief, I may not make it"?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Not really.  You got to stay positive out there.  That is what I do when I play.  The way I look at it, if I have nine holes to play, then I have nine birdie opportunities.  You know, I never really walk around thinking, I have got nine bogey opportunities; that would be horrible.

You have to stay positive, and I think there is a chance you can turn it around and shoot a low score.
Q.  Were you having some trouble with the speed on the front nine?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Seems like it.  Today, to be honest, I really didn't read any putts.  My caddy read them all.  I can't read these greens.  Normally I am a good green reader, but I am leaving it to him this week.  He read some good putts today.
Q.  Annika, how does what you do off the course in terms of working out and playing through a 36 hole day tomorrow, hilly course, wet?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
We'll see.  It sounds pretty good to me.  I am in pretty good shape.  I don't think that is going to be something I have to worry about.  I just hope I play well, I've got to continue to hit a lot of good shots, get myself birdie opportunities.  Then tomorrow obviously I have to figure out the speed of the greens and have to make some putts.  I mean, I have got to go low.  It seems like Cristie is playing good golf.

Having said that, I am still optimistic but I need to shoot a really low score.
Q.  Did anything click with your shots, whether it is your driver or your approaches?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
It seems like on the front nine I couldn't really get it close.  It seemed like we were thinking a lot with the wind, either the ball released, or the ball stopped; I just didn't get close.  All of a sudden, I was dialed in and I didn't know what happened.  I felt really good.
Q.  You mentioned you might have to get on the leaderboard to let them know you are here.  Do you think they know you are here?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
I think they know I am here.  I just don't know how badly they know I am here.
Q.  Can you remember winning a tournament where your caddy had to read your putts for you?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Well, he helps me once in a while if I am not really certain what to do.  But yesterday I didn't read them well, and today he said, "Do you want me to read them?"  I said, "Yeah, please go ahead."  Then it seemed like he read them a lot better than I.  I said, "Why don't you just continue and I will save my energy."  So I just listened to him.

So it was a little bit unusual but it seemed like it worked.
Q.  What number did you have in mind for the round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
I was hoping to get to level par, so I was very close to what I wanted.
Q.  Thanks, Annika.
