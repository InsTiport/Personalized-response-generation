   PAM WARNER:  Thanks for coming in and joining us today.  You've won here at the Kraft Nabisco Championship three times.  Just talk about being back here at Kraft this year, the first major of the year. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, it is our first major, and I'm excited to be back.  This place has been good to me in the past, and you know, I'm looking forward to the week.  It's always fun when it's a major, and I always feel like a get a little bit more energy and it's fun.  It's obviously a great place.  Normally the weather is beautiful, maybe not today, but the course is in great shape and should be a good week. 
 PAM WARNER:  You had a great start to the season so far, two Top-10 finishes.  Just talk about your goals for the season. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The majors, I would love to do well in the majors.  You know, not to put too much pressure on myself, but I love to come into the big events.  Like I said I get a little bit more energy.  I get a little bit more pumped. 
 I'm excited about the season.  I feel like I've done some good work this winter.  I'm really happy about the way I'm swinging.  I feel like I'm coming into the ball a little better, more control.  I'm excited about that.  It's fun when you feel like you're hitting it where you want to hit it.  You know, it's going to be a good week and hopefully a good year. 

 Q.  Welcome back to the warm, sunny desert.  You talk about the majors, focusing on the majors, is that a mental thing, an emotional thing, a physical thing; what do you do differently getting ready for this than you would for a regular LPGA event? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I would say that I plan my schedule around the majors, just making sure that I play enough before so that I'm ready.  Just thinking about shots ahead of time. 
 You know, physically I don't really prepare anything special.  I continue to work out and continue to do the same thing, but I just think in a major, I get geared up for them.  I just feel like the adrenaline is pumping. 
 I get excited about playing the course.  I mean, that's really what I feel like I need now is that extra little pump to get me going.  I feel like I've come such a long ways with my career, and there's only a few things that get me excited, and that's one of them. 

 Q.  The stats show that they are narrowing the gap on you in the rankings.  Do you feel the same way? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say Lorena is playing very, very well.  Of course, I look at the rankings and the Money List and so far, and right now, she's playing some superb golf.  So I'm not surprised that the gap is smaller and smaller.  But that's not something that I think about when I'm out there. 
 I'm happy to be back this year with a better swing, and just feeling that I have the game again.  You know, I think if I just perform, things will fall into place, the right place, and there's nothing really I can control other than that.  I'm just happy about my game. 
 But if you look at the rankings and everything, I would say that everybody is getting better on our tour.  I think it's good for the game and it's exciting, and that's positive. 

 Q.  You had a year last year that most LPGA players would sell their souls for, a major and a couple of wins, and yet everybody kind of seemed to think, well, it was a down year or disappointing year for you.  Looking back on it as you begin the new season, do you feel -- how do you look at last year now?  Was it disappointing or was it a learning experience, even at this stage of your career? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say a little bit of both.  I would say I was disappointed in the way I played.  I mentioned it a little bit earlier, I was just not happy the way I was swinging.  I mean, I really struggled most of the year.  I mean, I really made it work.  I was trying to hit fairways.  My stats were not as solid, but I really tried very, very hard.  And there was a few events where it kind of went my way and I was able to win a few tournaments. 
 But the consistency wasn't there, and you know, I was disappointed about that, and that's why you know, early this year I said, hey, I'm determined to get my swing back.  I know what I can do and this is not the way I want to play. 
 For five straight weeks I just worked with Henri (Reis), my coach, just trying to set the club had the right place back here and get it for square at the top.  By doing that, I'm coming in a lot more consistent to the ball, and just that feeling is so much different that it's given me a little extra boost, but it's fun to be out and trying to play again and not feel like you're standing on the tee and you're really fighting something. 
 That's a big difference, and I just don't want to have that, what I had last year.  Six wins overall is a good year.  You know, golf-wise it wasn't the best, but I look at the whole picture, I achieved a lot of things last year.  I think it was a very, very productive year in many ways. 
 So I learned from the golf part, but then I also advanced in other areas.  You know, it was a good year. 

 Q.  (About golf swing feeling better now). 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, it's huge.  I feel it, it's a lot more solid.  The distance is back.  The accuracy is back.  I still have some work to do but it's definitely in the right direction. 

 Q.  Apart from talent, can you pick out some of the qualities that have kept you at the top for so long? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Determination I would say.  You know, when I decide to do something, I do it, and I don't -- you know, I don't give up.  I just keep on grinding until I reach my goals. 
 I would say the focus is probably one of my strengths.  You know, the dedication, all of them, put them together, that's helped me reach my goals and take me to where I am today. 

 Q.  Karrie's win last year was her first in a major since 2002.  Were you surprised she went four years without winning a major, and what did it do for you, as well as the LPGA, that she's back at her Hall of Fame standard? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think it's great that Karrie's back.  I mean, I have always enjoyed Karrie very much.  I've always respected her game very much.  When we were battling back and forth a few years ago, it was a lot of fun. 
 So I think the finish she had was really exciting and I was happy to see her be back.  She's a solid player in every area, and she's good for the Tour. 

 Q.  Last year we saw the dramatics on the 18th hole.  Can you talk about what makes that a good finishing hole and a challenge that is there for you guys when you are on the tee? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think this championship has been decided on this hole -- even though you might have a one-shot lead or two shots, anything can happen here.  Par 5s are always exciting in the sense that there's birdies, maybe even eagles.  When it's downwind, you see players playing aggressive, can reach the green in two.  I think that puts up a dramatic finish. 
 It's a good hole.  Even though if you lay up, it's kind of narrow with the bunker on the right and you might have a 100- or 120-yard shot in to a pin tucked on the right, undulated green.  It's a good finishing hole; with water around it, could be intimidating at times, especially if you're one of the leaders on Sunday.  It's a challenge and a test. 

 Q.  Would you go for it depending on what the circumstances are, the wind, or your position? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, if I had the right distance, I would love to do it.  I've done it in the past.  I remember one year, I don't know when it was, but I hit a 5-iron in.  I've had a 7-iron when I hit over the green and had to drop, I believe on the other side of the water. 
 I've had a number of different scores on that hole.  If you come down the stretch and you're one shot behind, I would definitely play aggressive.  That's what it's all about, having the chance and go for it. 

 Q.  Most of the second half of last year, people were talking about the outside things that you were doing.  Some of those things are coming to fruition, your academy opens next month; is that correct? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  April 16, yeah. 

 Q.  Everybody talks about, was that a distraction or was it not a distraction.  Do you feel like those things are falling in place and not being distractions for you now as you get closer? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's definitely falling into place.  And I would say I've spent a lot of time working on these projects, so it does take time. 
 But it's also something I enjoy doing.  If I didn't have all that, I would be standing on the putting green all long?  I'm not really sure.  There's more to life than just the practice, and I'm as happy as I can be.  I'm doing the things I enjoy.  It does take away time for practice, but once I come out here, I'm happy to be here; I want to practice. 
 I think it's good for me.  This is the next phase of my life.  You know, I'm happy I have these projects.  I'm energized about it and I'm excited and now things are coming -- it's happening. 
 The academy is a dream come true for me.  Five years ago I was writing down all these little thoughts and making drawings about this building I was visualizing, and here it is.  The opening is like I said in just a few weeks.  It's exciting, it really is.  It's a chance for me to get back to the game of golf.  It's a chance for me to expand my brand.  You know, share my passion for the game of golf and fitness together.  It's a lot of positive things. 
 Again, it's another phase of my life and I'm happy to begin it. 
 PAM WARNER:  Thank you, Annika.
