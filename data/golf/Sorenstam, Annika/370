ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes.  Hole No. 3, hit 4-iron to 13 feet.  Birdie there.  Birdied No. 5.  Let us see.  Sand wedge to four feet.  Birdie, No. 9, sand wedge to twelve feet.  Birdie No. 13, sandwedge to seven feet.  Birdie No. 14, hit 8-iron to two inches.  Birdied No. 18, hit 5-iron in.  2-putted from 30 feet. 
 

Q.  How close was the ace?  Did it go past the hole or just short of it?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It looked very close, if you will look at the spike mark; it must have rolled maybe on the edge. 
 

Q.  Short and then rolled up?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  Right to the edge.
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah. 
 

Q.  Did you start out the day thinking you had any chance or what were you --
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I didn't think I had a chance this morning.  I was 8 shots behind.  I figured all I am going to do is give it all I got.  And after 9, I looked at the leaderboard I said, "Oh, I might have a chance here today."  So I played a little bit more aggressive on the back 9.  Went for a few more putts.  But, overall, I think I have been hitting the ball really good - I think the best I have ever hit it this week. Just a matter of putts dropping here or there and today was -- they were more on my side and they just fell in. 
 

Q.  You didn't you look at the leaderboard until the turn; that is the first time you really paid any attention?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I look at the leaderboard every time I see it, but that is when I made my third birdie, I was at minus 9 at the time, so I figured there was a good chance. 
 

Q.  Did you come off the green 18 thinking you did everything you possibly could?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I think so.  I gave it all -- obviously, you like to make every single putt, but I didn't miss a short putt today.  I might have missed a putt that was eight feet, that was about it.  Other than that, I felt I gave it all.  And, this is all I got. 
 

Q.  Can you just sort of sum up your year up to this point?  This is very much in keeping with how well you have been playing.
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think so.  Like I said earlier, I  am striking the ball much better I have had the previous tournaments.  It is just matter of putting everything together.  Beginning of the year, I putted extremely well.  And I shot low scores.  And, then the past few weeks I have been hitting the ball.  I just haven't made any putts.  But, today, it all came together.  I guess it does finalize my year a little bit. 
 

Q.  Are you playing next week?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I got a week off. 
 

Q.  What are you going to do?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I am going to relax.  Just do nothing.  But, actually, I promised my husband I will putt an hour everyday.  So, maybe I will be ready for McDonald's. 
 

Q.  Were there any birdies on the front that you thought maybe that you could have had that didn't -- that you didn't have any good chances?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, on No. 1, I had a 15-footer for birdie.  No. 2, I had an another 15-footer.  Let us see here.  No. 6 I did have -- that was about 16 feet.  On the front 9. 
 

Q.  Were you ever in danger of making a bogey.
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I didn't feel like it, no.  I hit 16 greens.  I made an up-and-down on 17.  That was probably my longest putt for par was three feet. 
 

Q.  Were you up in the booth for most -- did you watch and see much of Tammie the last four, five holes?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I went up in the booth.  On the 18th I saw Tammie on 15, 16 and 17. 
 

Q.  Did you see that you were one shot back and do you go through your mind where bogeys could come into play and --
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I just sit there and watch. You can't determine golf.  It is not like, "Oh, 17 is such a difficult hole; she is going to bogey that one," or, "No, she might hit a good shot two feet from the hole."  I just sit and watch.  You can birdie any hole out here.  You can bogey any hole out here. 
 

Q.  You got to the 18th tee.  Did you think you needed eagle there?  Were you thinking eagle?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I tried to hit as close I could on my second shot.  I hit 5-iron in and I pushed it a little bit and I ended up, like I said, 30 feet away.  So, I mean, I tried to make it, but I still want to make sure I make birdie there because again Tammie had four holes left and they are not easy.  This wind is so strong. 
 

Q.  How far was the drive on 18?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't know how long it was.  But I think I had 195 left. 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.
