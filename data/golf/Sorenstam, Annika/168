Q.
Annika, how did the course play today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought it was playing pretty good.  We had no wind.  We had pretty good conditions.  The greens are very receptive to all kinds of shots.  The rough though is quite tough and I was in there, unfortunately, a few times, which made it tough.

But first round, you know, it is okay.
Q.  Bit of an up and down round with the birdies and the bogeys.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I think it kind of summarized my year a little bit, so I'm not surprised.
Q.  What do you think you need to do to get that consistency back?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, this particular week I got to hit some more fairways.  I hit a few, but not enough.

And then you, if you don't hit the fairways, it's tough to hit greens.  When you don't hit greens it's tougher to make birdies.  So I think it pretty much starts from the tee.

So I'm going to hit a few balls this afternoon, work on my driver.  It feels good.  I just got to take it out on the course as well.
Q.  Do you ever look at the leader board on Thursday and/or are you more focused on your own your game?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I look a little bit, yeah.  Especially when I'm waiting to play, I look somewhere.  So that's one place to look.
Q.  Given the conditions, Annika, are you disappointed that it was a 71 and not better?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No.  First day, hey, it's a Major.  You can really hurt yourself on the first day.  I didn't do that at all.  Right now I'm four shots behind.  Who knows where I'll be by the end of the day, but I would be happy to be four shots with nine to go.  But now I have a lot more than that, so I'm pretty happy.
Q.  How would you assess your first experience playing with Morgan?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I was trying to think.  I think I played with her maybe once before.  But I like her.  I think I said that yesterday.  I think she's got great attitude.  I love her competitiveness.  She's down the middle all day long.  She made a few mistakes the last three holes, but other than that she was very solid.
Q.  Does it help you when your group's playing well?  Or not playing well, does it tend to hurt?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think that if people are playing well then you have the momentum and you see good shots.  You see birdies.  I mean, Jimin was making quite a few birdies early on.  I think that helps.  We were quite a fast group.  I like that.  It was a good group.  They're both very nice, very friendly, happy we were talking quite a bit and laughing.
Q.  Apologize for asking this.  It's been a few weeks down the road.  But you have a match play event coming up in a couple weeks.  Do you like having that kind of event, a different style of play, maybe get off the old grind kind of thing instead of stroke play, match?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I like match play.  I don't think we play it enough.  So like you said, it's a little early to talk about it, but I like the format for sure.
Q.  Did you like that tournament last year?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I did, yeah.  It's a first class event for sure.
