Q.  Annika, the US team are part of your peers on the LPGA Tour.  You play and win against them quite often.  What are your lasting memories of the Solheim Cup?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a fabulous week.  I love the golf course and the format.  The crowds have been great.  We've got some wonderful memories when we leave here.

Obviously, a little disappointed about the outcome.  It was so so close, but the US team played some great golf.
Q.  What's it like for you when you normally have the lion's share of the gallery cheering you, and having them be so vocal for the other side?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We're playing on US soil, so I think we expected the people to be holding up the American flag and singing, and that's what makes the championship so great.

When we were in Sweden the fans were on our side.  That's what makes it so challenging.  I think the galleries were really fair.  It was great.
Q.  Thank you.
