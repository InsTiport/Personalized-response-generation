PAUL ROVNAK:  Thanks for coming in and speaking with us, 5 under 66 today, 8 under for the tournament, just a couple back off the lead now.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  We'll see what happens, a lot of holes out there left to be played and birdie opportunities obviously, but my round today, I thought today was a really good round for me and today I thought I hit some good iron shots.  I had a lot of opportunities and at least finished near the lead.   We'll see.  I'm happy with the position I'm in and we'll see tomorrow.
Q.  Inaudible?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, I definitely would say that.  Today the rhythm was there.  I thought the scoring was there, things were starting to come a little bit.  The greens had a nice pace, just a lot more steady.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us over the score card, please.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Okay.  I birdied the third hole.  I hit pitching wedge to 20 feet.

No. 9, I hit 5 iron to 18 feet.

No. 12, I hit 9 iron to five feet.

15, 8 iron to six feet.

17, I hit wedge short of the green on the right chipped up and made the putt.

18, left of the green long and I chipped and made a putt from eight feet.
Q.  Are the greens more receptive?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think so.  Like I said, I hit the ball pretty good.  On No. 2, I had a good chance.  I thought I had a good chance on 5.  8, I had a good chance.  11, I had a good chance.
Q.  Do you have a number you'd like to see Jang come back to, or do you think you can win it without?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  You know, I've come from behind before, so I think anything is possible, really.  This course is tough, if the wind picks up, if the rain keeps on coming, this course can be a monster.  I really don't have a number in mind.  I think tomorrow I'm just going to mind my own game, play the way I did today and see what happens.

She's in a new position, she has not won before, it's a major, I know what it's like.  You think a lot and it's hard.
Q.  Would you rather be in the last group?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I've love to be in the last group top definitely.
Q.  Why?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I like to see what the leaders are doing.  I'd like be able to post some birdies early to put some pressure.
Q.  A lot of players are saying they left a lot out there.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, you have perfect conditions, hardly any wind, the course is in good shape, it's a very fair golf course.  The playing is getting better out here, you can play a lot more aggressive.
