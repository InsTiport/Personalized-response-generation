Q. You hit driver, I believe, off the first hole today.  Was that an attempt to be a little more aggressive in this round in order to try to make up some ground?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, it was.  My game plan today was to be a little bit more aggressive, and I totally backfired, let's put it that way.
Q.  What will you take away from the experience of this week, if anything?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hopefully take out a lot of things.

I want to say the crowd has been spectacular this week, they have been very supportive.  I have had a good time this week.  My game didn't really turn out the way I wanted to, definitely not the score.  I am disappointed about that, but it was a tough week, tough championship, but you always learn something.  I am sure I will look back at this week and bring something good out of it.
Q.  When you started on the bogey did you kind of have a feeling that was it?  Were you still confident?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it wasn't the first hole that kind of -- I mean, I fought all the way.  When I missed a short putt on 15, I think kind of where the air got out of me.

I tried so hard all four days.  I had not given up.  I fought and fought and I have -- my caddie and I have, we talked about it, analyzed everything and it is just one of these weeks, I got nothing.

First hole I hit a tree in the creek.  Second hole, driver, get stuck in the rough, nothing really happened.  To win a championship like this, you need some good momentum and I just I tried to find it.  I have no idea where it is.
Q.  How hard is it to say goodbye to a chance to get the Grand Slam?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's just -- I tried.  I am disappointed, but I am going to leave here and I am going to know in my heart that I gave it all, it just did not happen.  Having said that, that just gives me something to work on.  That's not a bad thing.
Q.  Do you still think it's possible that one person can do that?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, I do think it is.
Q.  You mentioned the gallery, can you talk about the reception you got from them at the end?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The gallery has been spectacular all week.  I came here Tuesday I thought there was a lot of people in the practice round.  Wednesday was packed.  The support I have gotten all the last four days has been incredible.  They stuck with me through the end.  It is just really, really nice.  I felt a lot of love from the people over here.  I am very thankful for that.
Q.  How difficult were those last couple of three holes kind of knowing it was out of reach?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Just want to have a good time.  On 17, I thought I'd reach the green in two.  That would be fun.  It happens.  It's a golf tournament.  I have been here before.  I am disappointed, but you got to get away from it and learn something and you know, it's a tough field here, don't forget that there's some great players here and they are playing really good golf.  If you don't play your golf, it's going to be tough to be up there.
Q.  You said it backfired using the drivers.  Do you think had you stuck with your plan you might have been around 5 or 6?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's tough to speculate.  I had a game plan.  I am not going to second-guess myself.  Normally when I come up with a plan it works, so I am going to leave it at that.
Q.  Did you have a score in mind?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought plus-4 would be a winning score.  I thought I said that yesterday.  The way it's looking, it might still be.  That was my plan.  I wanted to get to plus-4.  Just didn't happen.
Q.  Is there anything negative possibly with so many young kids that are on this Tour, that a bunch of teenagers are beating players like yourself and some of the big names?  Is that good for the tournament?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It just shows there's a lot of great talent out there.  Doesn't really matter what age you are.  They are playing some great golf.  This golf course really is really tough.  They are handling the pressure.  They are playing solid down the stretch.  That's the new generation.  I think we should welcome them all and say, hey, that's good for golf.
Q.  Do you feel them pressuring you?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Today I was just minding my own game.  I knew what I had to do.  I wasn't really worrying about anybody else.  I had plenty on my mind and plenty to do.  I was just trying to focus on myself and what I had to do.
Q.  How was the course today?  People are struggling.
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It is a tough golf course.  I think what we're seeing is the greens are getting a little firmer, and you know, some of the pins are rough.  And then again it's Sunday in a major championship, nerves do play a role.
Q.  They were determined to make this a really tough course.  Where does this rank for you as far as difficulty?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Right now it feels like it's super difficult.  I mean, just look at the scores, I think they say it all.
Q.  Do you feel like you figured this place out after four rounds?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I haven't, not really figured it out.
Q.  What is your schedule next month?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I am playing in a tournament next week, so I am heading to New Jersey right away.
Q.  How frustrating is this particular championship?  This is a first championship you won, then you won it back-to-back, now it's been a decade, how frustrating has this one been for you?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  When you want something really badly it just means a lot.  It makes me appreciate that I have won two.  Not a lot of people get even a chance to win one, so I am thankful for those two.  Right now I'd like to take my mind off golf for a little bit.  Have some lunch, just, I gave it all.  That's really all I can say.  Disappointed but I gave it all.
