RHONDA GLENN:  Maybe you want to tell us about the birdie, what you hit into the hole, after you made the eagle.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hit a 9-iron from the left side of the rough and hit it to about 9 feet and made a putt.
Q.  What's your mindset going in, chasing, like you said, how does your mindset change, and what sort of thoughts do you have now, going into the last round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I don't think it's going to change very much.  I'm three shots behind, but we've got 18 holes to play tomorrow, and 18 on a tough golf course.  So my goal is to get off to a good start and making the turn we'll see how things are going.  If I'm still chasing, I'm going to start playing more aggressive.  I don't want to be too aggressive too early, right now I'm in good shape, I've been there before, and I've got to be smart tomorrow.  I've got to play very sensible, and maybe change on the back nine.
Q.  You've said in the past that this possibly could be your last season.  At this Open do you find yourself taking mental pictures at all, just trying to soak things in, just in case that it is?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's not going to be my last season, so no, I'm not taking mental pictures.  I love what I do.  And I'm going to play next year.  No, I don't have those thoughts.  Now I'm trying to win a golf tournament.  I don't try to walk around and try to memorize things.  It's fun to be here.  I love to be in this position.  This is what it's all about.  I'm absorbing the atmosphere and excited about what's happening.  I'm not trying to memorize things, because this won't be my last.
Q.  Jennifer, I don't think, has ever been in this position as a professional going into the final round, let alone a major.  What kind of emotions do you recall having, and what kind of emotions should she expect to have tomorrow going into the finals of a major?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  She can answer that better than I can.  I can tell you when I lead in a major it's exciting and you feel just the emotions go through you, you're obviously very happy and it's exciting to be there, you look forward to the next day and you hope you can stay there.  This is what we all practice for is to be there.  It's a moment you want to really enjoy.
Q.  When you're trying to make a run on the final day in an Open, the conditions obviously get tougher and tougher, is it difficult to try to be smart and lay back, when you know you're 3-down?  How much of a mental strategy thing do you go through?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think it's really going to be a lot of thinking.  It's going to be a lot of -- the mental will decide a lot of things tomorrow.  You have to play smart.  You have to hit some good shots and play it in the right place.  But I think in an Open there's a lot at stake, a lot of players are up there, and everybody is hungry to win.  You have to be smart as well.  And I'm happy that I have the experience that I have, because I'm going to need it tomorrow.
Q.  Do you think you are more of a birdie maker now than you were when you won your first two Opens.  You talked about forcing the strategy if necessary on the back nine.  What tees could you change strategy and what greens can you force the issue on the back 9?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's tough to say right now, I haven't seen the pin placements, and it depends on how I'm hitting the ball.  It's very tough to answer that question now.  I'm going to take it when I'm on the course.  There's certain place -- there might be some holes where I hit driver or 4-wood, depending on the wind, et cetera.  When it comes to birdies, I think I made more birdies today than I did when I came out as a rookie, actually that's for it sure.
Q.  Have you in your mind what score you need to shoot tomorrow to win?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I don't have a score this mind yet.  I just walked off the course.  Everything depends on the weather tomorrow.  It looks like the forecast is going to be very similar, which means the greens are going to dry out a little more.  It's going to make them a little tougher.  I saw some of the pin placements tomorrow, it's not going to be a course you can be too aggressive.  And it is the Open.  I think a lot of things can happen.  But I want to obviously shoot under par, and we'll see how low I can go.
Q.  Can you speak to the condition of the course after the rain we had a couple of nights ago?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's definitely dried out.  I think today is probably as good as I've seen it all week.  The greens are still receptive to iron shots, but the fairways are drying out, I don't have mud on the ball anymore.  It's very, very playable, and it seems like it's getting in better condition as well.
Q.  Just to follow up, you were very definitive in your desire to keep playing.  What's changed that it's not even a thought in your mind, you definitely want to continue playing beyond this year?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I never said this is my last year, so I think that answers the question.
Q.  I think you'd said it possibly could be your last year.  Has anything changed or nothing really, as far as desire or anything like that?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I can say it again, and I think I said it in the press conference Wednesday, as long as I enjoy what I do and if I feel motivated waking up in the mornings I'm going to continue playing this game.  I never set a time or date that I know for a fact.  I don't know why you got that information.  But I can tell you I love what I do.  And this will not be my last season.
Q.  How have the spectators been toward you, and what's your reaction to the ticket sales is a record for a U.S. Open, so what's your reaction to that?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  That's wonderful to hear that we sold so many tickets.  And I can tell you that I feel very welcome to be here.  The crowds have been fantastic.  Standing on the first tee, they're very vocal, they really build up this atmosphere.  It's fun to play in all front of all these people.  They say, "Go Annika," I hear it on every hole.  It's wonderful to feel so welcome and so much support.
