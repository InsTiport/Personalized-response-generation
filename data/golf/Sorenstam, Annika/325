 LAURA NEAL:  Congratulations.   
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, what a week.  Obviously, I feel great sitting here now.  I love this tournament.  To win another major, which I real really want badly, it feels great to sit here right now.  It was a great day out there.  I think I played some great golf, and the players just were right there.  I mean, it came down to the last hole, the last putt.  It was, I think, as exciting as it could be.  But the golf I thought was great, too.  So, really, really happy. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   In my dreams, I guess.  This is what I would like to see, but we all have different dreams.  I played so well all week, and today I had the lowest score all week, which I think I felt like I could do this.  I felt so good about my game all week.  The putts really didn't drop, but today they did when I needed it.  I think I played pretty flawless throughout the week.  A few putts could have gone in here or there, but that's part of the game.  So this is the way I like to plan things and the way they turned out.

Q.  What's your thought about playing the final day with Liselotte?  If I remember correctly, she had a lot to do with your interest in playing professional golf over here to begin with? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Oh, definitely.  Liselotte was  -- you know, when I grew up, she was the greatest Swedish player.  She was huge all home, and with her success, she won the U.S. Open in 1988, I remember I was watching it at home.  And I was just a little girl then playing and didn't really think too much about it.  But I realized, that I could come play and this is what I want to do some day.  So it's pretty neat to play with her today. 
You know, I think she played excellent, too, the whole week, really steady.  She kept pushing me, which is what I needed today.  She had a chance on last hole.  But I want to congratulate her on a great tournament and a great way to play.  It was fun for me to see her play so well, too. 

Q.  A little odd, it looked like, for the person with a one-stroke lead to clean up a 2-putt par putt, instead of marking; did you just want to get that done or put more pressure on Lotte? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Both.  I said, I wanted to finish, I want to knock it in.  I didn't want to mark it and look at it for ten minutes, because then I will have millions of thoughts in my mind.  I just wanted to finish.  That might be odd, but winning this championship means so much to me.  I didn't just want to look at it because then it would probably be four feet by the time I hit it, and that's not what I wanted. 

Q.  Is this was the best score of the week?  This is the way you played it last year.  Is it just getting more comfortable with the greens as the week goes by, or was there something particular that changed? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, today was the last day.  I was in perfect shape this morning.  I knew I'm tied for the lead, this is the day that matters.  This is what I worked so hard for; I want to win this championship and here is my chance.  With that little extra pressure, I go out and I played some great golf.  This is what it's all about, and then this is it.  You know, to come out and have to play the way I did, it's just awesome. 

Q.  Were you are surprised that Karrie did not come after you a little today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, I think Karrie played pretty good.  She just didn't make anything.  I thought she almost chipped in on 7; just hit the lip and just went out.  I mean, she hit every edge, and I'm sure that's the way she feels.  She tried really hard, I could tell.  Just no momentum.  No good breaks at all.  You could really tell.  And in the end, you could look at her and tell that she was a little upset about it. 
But, you know, Karrie is a great player and she always will be, and she will be in my situation very soon, probably.  It's just one of those days.  You need some good breaks, and that's what I had today.

Q.  Do you think people watching today were talking more about the shots that you hit or the shoes that you wore? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   (Laughs) Seems like the shoes.  But I hope it's the golf game.  That's what I came here to play. 
These shoes, I really don't know why I put them on, but I thought they looked pretty cool.  I think I got more comments on the shoes and my socks, and I was thinking about changing after the turn because I got quite distracted.  Every time I stood over a putt, I saw these red little toes and made me smile. 
I was kidding with my caddy, he had red shades and I had red shoes.  Fun day. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, if you like my taste. 

Q.  Will you wear them again?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Probably not these.  These are not waterproof.  I feel a little wet.  But they are very comfortable.  So hopefully I can get some more pairs but a different color.

Q.  Brand new, first time you wore them?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yes. 

Q.  Did you have them in your locker during the week and debating to put them on? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   That's right.  I got them Thursday.  A little scared of putting them on early in the week, but I figured today is the day, I've got to go low.  If I'm not afraid to wear these, then I'm not afraid to play.  (Laughter.)

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Maybe Tiger will send me a penny or two. 

Q.  Did you happen to bring any extra clothes? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, I did.  But I love this robe.  I'll wear it. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I just  -- it's an incredible feeling just to win this tournament, and I told my caddy last year, I would like to have my name on that wall, and now I will see it double.  This tournament means so much to me, so much history, so much tradition, the field, and this is a challenging golf course.  You have to play well this week to win, with all of the pressure and everything. 
Like I said, there is no better feeling knowing you work hard, and then come to this championship and play this golf course as well.  That's why I practice.  That's why I play this game. 

Q.  (Inaudible)?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   I haven't given that a thought yet.  This is  -- I just want to let this sink in and we'll see.  I mean, last time when I won here, I came to the U.S. Open, so much was built up -- that I could not play right now  -- I just want to enjoy this, and when the next major comes, I'll deal with that. 

Q.  I realize last year was last year and this year is this year; but what we are seeing the first month of the season pretty much a continuation of what you did last year.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yeah, obviously, I'm very happy with my start this year, also. 
Like I said earlier in the week, I set some different goals this year because I figured, you know, I don't want to compare this season to last season because it's going to be very difficult, and it might be a letdown if I don't win more than eight tournaments.  So I will set some different goals.  I'm still working hard and I'm still motivated to get better. 
So that's the way I look at it for this season, and then we'll see and you can compare them or not.  The majors, like I said, mean a lot to me.  And right now, one of my goals I have achieved.

Q.  Did you decide at some point in advance that if you won, you would not dive in or be pushed into that water, and was that an unpleasant experience last year?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   It wasn't unpleasant at all.  But, you know, if you look at it, it's not very deep, and when I watched the tape, I realized that it was a stupid move to dive in not knowing how deep it is.  So I wanted to be a little more cautious, but the water, it's still as nice, so that had nothing to do with it.  I just didn't want to make a silly mistake this time.
That was my caddy's daughter, Reilly.  She's four years old.  She's one of my biggest supporters.  She always brings me popcorn when we come home.  So I figure, "you go in the lake with me."

Q.  Given the fact that this was a major, and playing with Karrie in the last group, was this kind of a statement day? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Well, statement or no statement, I mean, Karrie and I, we've had our battles through the last few years, and I've always enjoyed playing with Karrie because she's such a good player and she always brings out the best in me.  And I knew that's what I needed to do today. 
Golf is a game where you are going to have your chance and have your breaks.  She just didn't have it today.  It doesn't mean, you know, that she won't be up there.  I know Karrie really well and I know she's going to keep working hard, and she's going to try and get paired with me, I'm sure, in the next major and then get her chance.  You know, I think she's a wonderful player.   Today was just my turn. 

Q.  (Inaudible.)
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   It's my turn a lot?  Oh, I don't mind. 

Q.  Have you ever had this kind of fight with another Swedish player? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Not in a major, I can't recall.  I don't think I've played with Liselotte at all.  I also thought that Karin played really well.  So, it was good for the whole Swedish team today. 
LAURA NEAL:  A little anticlimactic, but let's go through your card real quick.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Birdied No. 5.  8-iron to seven feet. 
Birdied 6.  8-iron to nine feet. 
Birdied 10, 7-iron to three feet. 
Birdied 13, pitching wedge to 18 feet. 

Q.  I wondered if anyone had any questions about whether you had had a letdown after such a sensational year  -- I know you won in Hawaii as well as Phoenix  -- but might this answer anyone's question about what your motivation is and what your drive is? 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:   Yes, definitely.  Like I said, I've got other goals, and I'm still motivating.  I'm still pushing myself.  Still working hard.  I want to see how good I can be and how good I can play.  That's what drives me every day, and I mean, I love this game.  You know, just because I had a great year last year doesn't mean I'm happy with that.  I'm very driven, and victories like this pushes me more and makes me want to see what else I can win. 
LAURA NEAL:  Annika, congratulations.  Thank you.
