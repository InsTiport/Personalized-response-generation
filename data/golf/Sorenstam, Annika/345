Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  By the 3rd, then we got time, then we were rushing a little bit.  I mean, I tried all day.  Not much happened today, unfortunately.  You know, I never felt like it was over until the last few holes.  I felt like I could birdie every hole in.  When I didn't birdie 15, which I thought I hit a good putt, I said, "Okay, the next three."  I kind of ran out of holes.  That's when I kind of felt it wasn't going to be enough.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I guess our group was out of position.  An official drives in the cart next to us, times our preparation time, our execution time.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't really know where it started.  I think it started on the par 5, 13.  Definitely two holes they did, 13, 14.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No.  I mean, I think I played some great golf in this wind.  I think I judged a lot of  -- I hit some good shots into the wind, downwind.  A lot of good club selections all day long.  I mean, I hit 11 greens.  I'm quite pleased with that.  A few where I actually didn't go for the green; more to try to get it as close to the pin as possible.  I think I judged the wind beautifully today.  That wasn't my problem.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I saw her.  She's such a great putter.  I was surprised what she did.  I knew it was down-grain.  I said, "Okay, I'm going to hit it a little softer."  I thought I did.  It just took off also.  Actually, I was up again.  It was a long putt coming back for it, 10 feet.  That was a bad judgment.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  After that, I said, "I'm just going to talk by myself."  That was probably what I said.  More, "Just let me do it on my own."  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm going to go home and putt and putt and putt.  I mean, I hit the ball so beautifully this week, I think.  I'm so happy about that.  I was driving it well.  I want it so badly.  I go out there, try to force it.  I just can't force it.  In the fairways, I go out and execute.  That's what I have to do on the greens.  It's more like I force it.  I do that more on the putting than on any other shot.  I don't really know why.  I'm so happy the way my technique has turned out.  
 
Q.  Will you play a lot early next year? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I haven't really put my schedule together, but I don't think I will start until February.  
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean, I'm pleased with my season.  To win five times, I'm very happy about that.  You know, I'm not happy being second on the Money List, but Karrie has had an extremely great year in that sense.  If somebody told me, "You will win five times," I would say, "I'll take it." The only thing, if I would have done better in the majors.  A little disappointed about that.  I'll take any win that I can.  It's tough to try to peak exactly at the majors sometimes.  I think this year, I've done a lot of good things.  I scheduled really well.  I practiced hard.  I really enjoyed this year.  I guess it's a little sad to end today with such a round that I had today.  Other than that, it's been a great year.  Like I said, I know what I'm going to work on.  I'm going to come out with full force next year.  We'll see how it goes. 
 
Q.  (Inaudible)? 
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think so, yeah.
