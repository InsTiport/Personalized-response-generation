  Q.  How did it feel out there today?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I felt somewhat normal but not really great.   
  
  Q.  How did you do on 13?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Birdie on 12, not sure what happened with that, with 13.  Felt good coming into here and got off to a terrible start.   
  
  Q.  (Question regarding what she did well.)   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say mostly putts around the greens; I made some tough ones.  There wasn't anything -- I made a few birdies, too, but I just didn't put it all together.  I'm not going to be this way the rest of the week.  I'm going to be positive the rest of the week.   
  
  Q.  How hard is the course?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It is a tough course.  I'm not sure if you know, but they've lengthened several holes, 4, 5 and 6.  The wind was gusting, and sometimes it was tough.  It was hard to figure out club selection.  The greens are firm as they can be.  You have to go from center green a lot of times, but it's a Major; that's to be expected.  I think that's something that's a positive for me.   
  
  Q.  The lengthening, how did it affect play?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Probably higher scores today; we won't have people at 10-under like last year.   
  
  Q.  What's the difference between last year and this year?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's going to be tougher, higher scores, most likely.   
  
  Q.  Did you feel like you were playing consistent out there?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  You know, on the 4th hole I missed the green, and there is no pattern to the way I played.   
 It was totally up and down.  The putting felt good at times.  I got a new wedge.  It's tough when you hit three-quarters, and you've got to hit the ball clean.  I can't -- you have to stick it.   
  
  Q.  Did you have trouble judging the speed?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Some I did, some I didn't.  Like I said, it was not consistent.
