Q.  You've won a lot all over the world, how does this one compare?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It rates up there for sure.  This crowd, I want to thank them all for coming, obviously for supporting us.  It's been so great this week.  First class tournament, first class venue.  We've had a great team this week.  Catrin having her bad back, and she's been so inspirational, it's been incredible.


Q.  On a personal level, how much did it help to finish like you did last night coming out and playing in your fifth match?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's obviously important to get the momentum and feel very good about your game.  Sometimes when you play several matches, you need good momentum.  We had that yesterday.  The matches I played were very, very close and anything can happen.  When you win on 18, you kind of get the extra kick.


Q.  Was there any other motivation, Angela wasn't too sure about you playing Colonial.  Did you use that?

ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I never thought about Colonial.  I played Colonial because I wanted to.  It was, like I said before, one of the best experiences I've ever had.  That was my decision.  Today was a new match.  I was playing good.  All I tried to do was get my point.  It's a long ways to go, but it sure is exciting.
