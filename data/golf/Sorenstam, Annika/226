Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
And opportunity.  It is a great golf course.  I was ready to play, it just didn't happen unfortunately.  So I am a little sad about that.  But I will dig deep and come back next week and play well.
Q.  Do you think the time off or the new irons, anything like that might have had anything to do with
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
No.  I am not going to look for excuses, other than myself.  I had a great opportunity to do something, I just didn't do it.
Q.  There are no low scores out there except for Cristie Kerr.  What makes this course such a challenge?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Well, It is just very windy.  I mean, I thought the conditions were very difficult this morning.  Even the first 14 holes were very, very tough.  The wind was swirling.  I find it extremely hard.  It's a tough golf course.
Q.  Annika, I know you love to win every time, but is there any sort of exhale, sense of relief that we will stop talking about win streaks and things like that?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
No.  No.  No.  I love to win.  No.  I am disappointed, there is no doubt about it.  I just have to start over and maybe I can do another streak.  We'll see what happens.
Q.  (Inaudible) had anything to do with it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
No, I'm not going to find any excuses for it.  It was totally me.  I just didn't putt very well.  I missed a few shots out there, a few mistakes.  Other than that, I think it was mostly on the greens.

Like I said, I couldn't read the greens and then Terry had a difficult time, also.  Put that together and you are not going to make a lot of putts unfortunately.  That is really I think what happened.
Q.  The third hole of the final round, double bogey, what happened there?  Can you take us through that.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Oh, it was just a lot of bad shots.  Then I was close    I was in the bunker on the left and had a very difficulty shot, and hit it up and just one putted.  I missed my tee shot.

There were a lot of bad shots on that hole.
Q.  What was the third shot?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
I had a 4 wood.  Just a bad shot.
Q.  I guess if the six victories in a row were pretty easy, it would happen more than it has, which is never.  It is just not that easy to put that streak together.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
No.  It is tough to win out here once.  You have got to be happy about that.  Here I won five times.  You cannot take anything for granted.

I was excited about the opportunity, especially the way I played this morning, you know.  Starting the fourth round I thought I was in great shape, and my wheels came off early, and I couldn't really recover unfortunately.  I would say I am disappointed, but again, it is a difficult thing to do.
Q.  Is it still nice even though you are disappointed?  (Inaudible)  winning five times, like Nancy?  Your name is up there with her.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Oh yeah.  No, just because I didn't win here, I am not going to take all that away from me.  I did win five times.  I won Nabisco, which is what I wanted to do, so here we go.

I mean, I am not complaining by any means.  Right now I just feel a little frustrated about the last few days.  But life goes on and it's a new tournament next week and hopefully I can read those greens.
Q.  You have got a stretch now where you are playing quite a bit, plus you have two majors in a three week span.  This is going to be kind of a distant memory at that point, I guess, isn't it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Definitely.  You know, now I am going to play and I am looking forward to it.

Like I said, there is a lot of good things out there.  It's just I couldn't really put it together.  I thought I drove it well at times.  I am hitting it further.  I am plays more aggressive.  It's gonna work.  I know it will.  It is just a matter of patience and hanging in there.
Q.  Will you take an advance trip to Bulle Rock just to see
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I won't.  No.
Q.  Any reason why?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
No.  Just my routine normally works, so I will stick with my normal routine.
Q.  Thank you, Annika.
