 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I birdied the third hole. Sand wedge to three feet. Birdied No. 6.
Hit a 4-wood on the green, 2-putt. Birdied No. 8. I hit a sand wedge to four feet. Birdied
No. 14. 9-iron to five feet. Bogeyed No. 16. Sand wedge on the green, 3-putt. 
 
Q. On the 3-putt, how far was your first putt, and your second putt for that matter? 
 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: My first putt was probably 28 feet, and then I putted to about four
feet and missed it.  
 
Q. Can just give some general observations about your round, how the course played and
so forth? 
 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Like I said yesterday, I love this golf course. So teeing it up this
morning, I was really looking forward to playing. And the conditions were a little breezy,
not too much, but we had a little breeze; it was probably half a club on a few holes. It
had dried out a little bit from yesterday, but not much, mostly on the greens, they were a
little firmer. So that counts for a little more roll. But other than that, it is still
really wet in the fairways. But overall, my round, I'm very pleased. I think I hit every
fairway, 16 fairways and 16 greens and I had 30 putts. It was very solid golf from the tee
to the green. I was really never in trouble. I left a putt on 16 and then I had probably a
6-, 5-footer on 17 for birdie. If I had made those two, I would be really smiling. But
it's a good first round, it's a good start. I'm just going to try and continue what I did
today. It's so nice to know that you're hitting the ball well and that's going to give you
a lot of chances for birdie. So that's my goal, just to be able to make them the next few
days. 
 
Q. I heard you say you wished it would dry out a little more. Does that make you think
that you can distance yourself from the field?
 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I just think if it dries out, it makes the course a lot trickier in
the sense that you will get some roll in the fairways. Now, on 17, I hooked my drive a
little bit, it rolled two feet. It didn't go in the rough. If it dried out, it would be in
the rough and make it a little more difficult. Therefore, I'd like to see it dry out, put
a little more premium on ball-striking. If the greens firm up a little bit, you've got to
plan your shots a little bit. And these greens are not flat; they are quite undulated, and
with some of the pin placements you've got to plan your shots more because you know it's
going to roll. So therefore, I'd like to see it dry out.
