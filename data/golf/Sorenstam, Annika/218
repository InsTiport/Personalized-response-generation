PAUL ROVNAK:  Annika, thanks for coming and speaking with us.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.
PAUL ROVNAK:  You didn't get off to the start you'd like as you said on TV, but you played through the conditions and played the back nine at 5 under; 4 under overall, what looked like a very difficult day.  Maybe just start by talking about that.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I agree with you 100%.  I really didn't get off to a good start, but then again it wasn't the nicest day of golf today.  I thought it was quite difficult, especially the second hole which I bogeyed, the par 4.  I couldn't reach it in two, and I hit a third shot and I 2 putted from about ten feet.

But then I came back with a birdie on 3.  I hit a 5 iron and chipped it up to about four feet.

Then, you know, it was tough on the front, it really was.  Then, I don't know really what happened, but I made a long putt on 10 and that kind of kick started my back side and I played really good.  Hit solid shots when I needed to, and then when I had an opportunity, I putted well.  Rolled in some about birdie putts on the back and that was it.

Obviously I'm happy to sit in here.  It's not very nice out there.  It's a little chilly and rainy, so I'm glad to be done.
PAUL ROVNAK:  Take us over the whole score card.  You said you 2 putted on 2.  What did you hit in?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I hit a 7 wood sand wedge just short of the green.  Hit it up and 2 putted from ten feet.

No. 3 I birdied.  I hit 5 iron short of the green, hit it up to four feet and made the putt.

Bogeyed 6.  I hit a 6 iron just short of the green, chipped it up and 2 putted from seven feet.

Then 10 I birdied.  I hit 5 iron and I made a putt from 35 feet.

13, I hit sand wedge to ten feet.

15, I birdied, sand wedge to six feet.

Then I eagled 16.  I hit a 4 iron to about five feet.
Q.  Is there a mind set to playing in weather like this?  I mean, how do you deal with it mentally?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I mean, first of all, I knew it was going to be rainy all day.  So my mind was pretty much set on, you know, go out there and try to stay as warm and dry as possible.  It's going to be a long day for everyone.

It's one of these days before the golf might not be pretty, but you have to get the business done.  And it's all about scrambling on certain holes, and if you get a chance, try to make a few birdies.  That's really what I think about it.  It's about playing from A to B and try not to make too many mistakes on a day like today.
Q.  Could you tell us more about the putt on 10 and how it got you, kick started you a little bit?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it came totally unexpected I would say.  You know, I've had some chances that were shorter than that and didn't make any.  And then all of a sudden I made that and then, you know, my frame of mind, now I'm positive and now I see the ball go in; and after that, I mean, like I said, I was 4 under after that.

So sometimes you just need a little putt like that to kind of get you going, especially on a day like today, it is tough out there.  To get a little bonus like that is important, and that's what happened.  So thankful for that.
Q.  You sounded like you were short with some approach shots today.  Was it hard of getting in the mind set of, "Hey, I've got to carry this to the hole, I can't bounce it in like I normally do here?"
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought the wind was quite strong as well.  Especially on 10, I can't remember exactly what yardage I had, but I thought I had plenty of club to the front and I hit 5 iron.  I couldn't even get to the front.  I realize playing into the bay with the wind and the rain, it's just, you know, the ball was not flying as far.  So I think that's why it took me a few holes to kind of get to grips with that and knowing that you had to add a club to get there.

I've been playing here for so many years, I thought I knew what kind of club to hit but today was very different.
Q.  Was your ball in play on 18, and did you have a wet grip or something that you lost control of it?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, it was just a poor swing.  The wind was left to right and I came out of it a little bit and hit a big fade.

No, I was glad that I had the shot.  I had a good lie and I was able to hit it out and play it in regulation.  So I was very happy about that and finish    you know, finish with par is maybe not the greatest because it really is a birdie hole, especially when the wind is helping like that.  But at least I didn't make a big number, and I can save my score at 4 under.
Q.  It was a great shot you hit into 16.  What was your mind set?  Did you hit that perfect?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was pretty good.  I had 190 to the front and I believe the pin was nine off; I had 199, and I was very happy with the shot.  I hit it a little bit to the right and the ball kicked a little to the left and the ball ended up five feet from the hole.  The result was perfect.  I'll take it.
Q.  Are you planning to get over to Hamilton Farm while you're in the area in preparation for The Match Play?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No.  No, I don't have any plan to do that.

You know, the tournament week, they are quite busy just to get ready for this week, and now the week has already started.  And today, I just want to get back and get some rest and get ready for a long weekend.  So I don't really have time to do that type of stuff.  I have to take a week off to have a chance to play other courses.

You know, right now, this week is what's on my mind and obviously we have the major next week.  So I have not even thought about The Match Play to be honest with you.  I know I'll get plenty of chances to go there and be ready and be prepared for that tournament.
Q.  How are you feeling?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  My throat is hurting a little, my nose is still a little stuffed, but I feel tons better.  It's been a week now, so I'm happy to be almost firing on all cylinders.
