   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: You went low and you're in second place, can you just talk about what you went through and what it meant to you to put on this kind of show? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, first of all, obviously I'm glad I finished. There was a time yesterday where I didn't know if I was going to finish, and now obviously I'm glad I did, and it's nice to leave with a solid round in the 60s. It's been a good round overall. 
 Of course I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't feeling too good and I feel like I have a little bit more in me to give but yesterday I didn't. Overall I'm pleased to come back and fight the way I did and I'm going to remember this round for many reasons. You know, try and take the positive out of this, and move on. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Can we go over your scorecard, starting with the birdie on 2.
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Sand wedge to 11 feet.
 8, 6-iron to 25 feet.
 11, 5-wood just a little bit to the right and chipped up to three feet.
 7-iron on No. 13 left of the green, 3-putted, my par putt was six feet and then birdied No. 16, 6-iron to six feet. 

 Q. Are you going to look at this as a week that maybe got away or a week that you're very proud of? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm very proud of this week. Like I said, there was a time yesterday I didn't know if I was going to finish and I'm glad I hung in there, and then come today and post a really solid score. 
 So I thought, well, I gave it all, I can tell you that. 

 Q. How was your form today?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Compared to yesterday I feel a lot better. I didn't feel great this morning but I think once I start walking and drinking some water and getting inside the ropes and into the moment, I felt better. 

 Q. Did you eat last night? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I had a little sushi -- what else did I have -- I had a little salmon. I don't know, that's what the doctor ordered. It sounded good and it went down; I was just happy about that.
 And then this morning I had some toast and that was about. It I'm going to head over to the hospitality tent and really makeup for the feels I didn't have. So, that will be nice.

 Q. Do you wish you had another round left -- not without playing at your normal level --
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Of course, but one more round, I'm not really SURE if that's enough. Lorena is really playing solid. She's moving just forward and forward every round and she's not giving any back. 
 So you know, I gave what I had, that's all I could have asked for, solid last round. I just have to make sure that I'm 100% in all four rounds next time. 

 Q. Lorena has been on a pretty good roll; can people fathom how difficult it is to stay at that level for such a long time given all of the extracurricular stuff that goes with it, and what is the hardest part about being where she is? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, I think the hardest part is to continue to work on your game and stay focused. You know, especially when you play well, there's, like you said, extra things to do and extra things that comes up and it just takes time and you really have to focus on what's important, and that's playing good golf. 
 You know, Lorena is obviously doing a great job of that. You know, she's coming in here with a great record, only one major, and you would think that, you know, that would put a little extra pressure on her performing here this week, and she has done very well. She has come out as the leader and is staying as the leader; that takes a lot of courage, takes a lot of guts, and it takes a good athlete. 
 So I'm just happy to see that because she's a nice person, and I think she's really doing well that way. 

 Q. You were the last player to win back-to-back major championships. Can you talk about how difficult it is to get your game to peak like that? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, it's a tough thing to do. It's tough to win majors in general, and then to add two on top of that; however, this is over six months ago, so I don't really think that she's thinking about that. 
 I could be wrong, but I think the goal for her is just take one tournament at a time and try to win each one of them, and it turns out to be the last two majors, and I'm sure it won't be the last, either. 

 Q. I hate to belabor this but could you give us a blow by blow of when you first got sick and do you have any idea what caused it and when did you first start to really feel bad?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm not really sure. I went to the hospital yesterday and they told me that I have a stomach virus and you know, probably a little bit of dehydration, so they gave me an IV. 
 I mean, all of my other numbers were great, so nothing really to worry about. I'm sure it was a combination of, you know, stress and eating something that wasn't appropriate and then just pushing myself to the limit. 
 You know, I've done it before and I'm sure it won't be the last, either. Good to get a little rest last night and come out today and play well.

 Q. You went to the hospital?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: After the round yesterday, yes.

 Q. Would yesterday's round rank as probably the toughest you've ever had to get through in tournament play?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I would say so. I mean, it's the worst I've felt, that's for sure. And I mean, it was just a matter of surviving and, come on, one more, one more, just try and finish this round. 
 You know, you work so hard to be here in the first place and you work so hard to even be in contention on the weekend, and I just didn't want to let that go. Like I said earlier, obviously I'm glad that I fought it through, but it was one of those rounds where you just counted the holes and you wished it was over. 

 Q. The shot 11 - (indiscernible). 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It's tough to tell. I did lay down a few times. I thought it was quite ironic. Yesterday we played in twosomes and I had a chance to lay down several times. Today, we were a threesome, I didn't have a chance, not that I needed to, and we were even timed. 
 So I think that's pretty funny. 

 Q. Is it realistic anybody could win all four majors? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I think it's possible. I've said it before and I really do think it is. Lorena is playing great golf, and you need obviously to peak at a certain time and you need a little luck, but I certainly do think it's possible. 
 Thanks, everybody.
