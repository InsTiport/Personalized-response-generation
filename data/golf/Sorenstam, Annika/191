Q.
When did you first see Lorena was 10 under?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, the first time I saw it was on my 6th hole when I saw she was 10 under.  I actually had to look twice.  What can I say, it was a fantastic round.  This golf course is not easy, and she made it look easy.  But I'm telling you, that's just an incredible round.  Impressive start.
Q.  What about the rest of the week?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's Thursday.  I have three more days.  I'm looking forward to it.  I feel good about my game.  Today it was almost.  It was very, very close, but not really it.  And right now I don't really know what I've got to do to make it a great one, maybe hit a few putts, maybe hit a few drives.  I'm not really sure, but I need to do something for the rest of the week.
Q.  Is there something in particular that didn't quite gel today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think I missed two drives and maybe two iron shots.  Other than that, fairway to green, I had a lot of 12 to 15 footers.  I've got to make those.  I guess that's one way of looking at it.  I had a lot of good shots.  I just couldn't get it closer than that.
Q.  When you see a score like that on the board, do you put pressure on yourself to make sure you don't get too far behind?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No. It's the majors.  Anything can happen.  We've all seen it.  I just have to focus on my own game.  I have to post some scores myself and we'll see what happens.
Q.  You've jumped in the lake three of the last five years, do you like it?  Is this what you look forward to?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I do.  I don't know if the other players look forward to it.  It's a tradition and it's something you don't want to miss.
