  Q.  How much pressure was on that putt?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  I think our legs were shaking on that putt.  It was only probably 3 feet, but it seemed a very long 3 feet.   
  
  Q.  With all your experience, Annika, 5-up, 6 to play and they will not go away.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was quite the match, I must say.  They started to play awesome golf.  They were making a lot of birdies and not pars.  It was a great match.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  You know, this is what it's all about.  We'll see.  We were happy to get a point in the end.   
  
  Q.  The order was changed today.  What was the thinking today?   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  Thought we would spice things up a bit.   
  
  Q.  You had a shift in momentum going on.  The board was all European, then American.  Did the Americans feed off the board?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm not sure what got them going in our group.  They hit some good approach shots, and Cristie made some really good putts, and Nicole hit some good shots.  They had some good putts.   
 CATRIONA MATTHEW:  They weren't even long.   
  
  Q.  How about a word for the Swedish crowds?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Their support has been tremendous.  We look forward to a great afternoon here.
