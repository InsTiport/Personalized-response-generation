ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it's making the greens putt firm and very, very fast, so you've really got to pay attention to the wind.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  He's a great worker and a great guy, very honest, hard working, very competitive.  He's a really good guy.
Q.  What's the best four words to describe him?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Competitive, nice.  He's a great guy.  Like I said, he works really hard and takes his job very seriously, very loyal.
Q.  Was today the toughest of the three conditions wise, windy wise?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, it's funny, the wind has been different all three days.  I think the course    all of a sudden the last three days has been really tough.  It's tough wind.  It swirls constantly.
Q.  You're guessing a lot?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's timing.  It's not about guessing.  I have the yardage, you just have to make your best guess as to what the wind is doing at the time.
Q.  Was 68, 69 a pretty good score today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say so, yeah, pretty good.  The greens are fast.  Today the wind was a little more difficult.
Q.  Would you have been a little bit more surprised if someone would have told you after three rounds that one of the shorter hitters would be on top of the leaderboard at this golf course, 5'1" and 5'2"?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, they get very accurate, and that's what you need on this golf course.  You have to give them credit for that.  It's not about distance.
Q.  How did you play today?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought I played great.  I didn't make the same mistakes as before.
Q.  Did the last hole kind of set the vibe?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The whole week, yeah.
