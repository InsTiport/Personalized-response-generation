 Q. May be temporary, but you're saying good-bye to the Canadian open on this day. I know the golf didn't work out the way you wanted it to after a great start, but memorable week given what unfolded for your foundation at the players' party the other night. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Oh, absolutely. It's been a wonderful week. I'm very happy I came. The fans have been so supported and CN with their generous donation to my foundation was amazing. I just couldn't believe it. So I have a lot to be thankful for this week. 
 You know, it's been great to be here. I'm going miss it, but it's time to move on.

 Q. What's next for you before you finally quote, unquote retire?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, I'm playing next week in Portland. It's on the other side of the country. To be honest, I'm tired. It's been a long few months. I have a few more events to play in, and I'm going to enjoy the last few months. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Oh, it's very, very nice. The crowds have been supportive all week. It's just been a fantastic week really. CN is a fantastic sponsor, and it's just been a first class event. I'm really happy that I came here and played.

 Q. (Question regarding the rain.) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I didn't play well the last three days, but, you know, I tried as good as I could. I've enjoyed the week. CN has been a huge supporter and they surprised me with a very generous donation the other day. It's just been a wonderful week.
