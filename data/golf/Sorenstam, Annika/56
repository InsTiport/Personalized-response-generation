 Q. Annika, rough start today?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, it wasn't the start I wanted. 

 Q. Anything particular? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I was up three hours before, and it's either I don't start well or mess up in the beginning. I just cannot play 18 holes it seems like. 
 The first hole, I hit my drive to the right. I was on the green and 2-putted for six. 
 And then I bogeyed No. 3. I hit a sand wedge just up to the green and chipped and 2-putted from about 20 feet. 
 Then No. 6, 6-iron left of the green and 3-putted from about 25 feet. 

 Q. And the second shot when you were in the middle of the fairway, with a very awkward downhill pitch?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No. 3, you mean. Yeah, it went to the left, just the wrong place to be. 
 I don't really know what to do. Like I said, I can't seem to play 18 holes. I mean, I played very, very good for many holes, and then I make bogeys every round, and you just cannot make bogeys. I have made so many bogeys in the last few months, and you just can't do that. 

 Q. Were there any special emotions in this round?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: No, at 7:30 in the morning, I just want to have good round. The course is perfect; the conditions are perfect and I'm playing well and looking forward to a wonderful day with some birdies and kind of get some momentum going. 
 You know, I'm just focusing on my game. That's really all I'm focusing on, and it's just so disappointing that I just can't seem to pull it together. 
 This has gone on for quite some time. I know for three weeks I've played some great golf, but every round has been very much the same, a lot of good shots, but just not 18 good ones.
