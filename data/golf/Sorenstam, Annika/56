  Q. Long day?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah. I mean, we've been here about 15 hours, so...  
  
  Q. That must have had some kind of impact on what you hoped to do this afternoon.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I don't know, I mean, I feel fine, I just didn't play well today. I actually hit a lot of good shots, I just never converted. Obviously I'm very disappointed much. Think I've played a lot better than this.   
 It's just tough. Doesn't seem to go my way the last two and a half months, so it's just very frustrating.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about some of the differences today between rounds on Thursday and Friday?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: You know, it's obviously nine shots. I mean, that's a lot of shots. I rolled some putts in the first day. Rolled it really well today and just didn't make anything.   
 The greens are very different in the afternoon after a long day. If you have a morning round they're very smooth. The rain here just makes the greens very tough.   
  
  Q. What do you have to do mentally to be prepared for tomorrow?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm not going to do much. Just enjoy the evening and come out with a fresh mind tomorrow and try to enjoy my last day out here and shoot a low score.  
  
  Q. Can you give us a quick comment on the donation CN made?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, that was amazing. I mean, that's what really keeps me going. CN is a tremendous sponsor of not just this event but women in general.   
 That's my surprise. It's amazing. It took me -- I mean, I was shocked, but also very, very thankful. My foundation is obviously something I'm very proud of, and talking to the some of the CN it seems that we have the same goals when it comes to the way they work, so it was very, very generous of them.
