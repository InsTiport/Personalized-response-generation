  Q.  (Indiscernible.)   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean, I had a good round today.  I thought yesterday I had a very good round as well.  Took advantage on the greens, and then today same thing happened on the front.   
 I mean, I hit 16 greens, so I had a lot of chances.  (Indiscernible.)   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  What is it different about the course today?

 I think that makes a difference.  Yesterday I think it was windier overall, too.  I think the more rounds on the course the better.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  And then for tomorrow, what score do you think is going to win tomorrow?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, you know, 12-under, the scores are low.  I don't want to be too far behind.  I mean, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.  Hopefully get off to a good start.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  (Indiscernible.)   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, we'll see.  Maybe a little wind tomorrow will help the conditions.  We'll see.
