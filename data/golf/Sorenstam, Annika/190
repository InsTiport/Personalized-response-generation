Q.
Scratch around, battle, grind?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes, I think I'm hitting the ball good enough and driving it well enough and having good opportunities, but today my putter let me down a few times.  I fought really hard out there.  I really tried.  When I finally make a birdie, a bogey comes in and it takes 10 holes to make another birdie.  It's a little tough at the moment.  I feel I'm playing better, but nothing happens.
Q.  (Inaudible)?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  (Inaudible) I don't have a club in between.  I just feel like I'm hitting it, but it's not turning out to get anywhere course.
Q.  Is it hard staying patient?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes.  But that's all I can do.  I can only play my game and I'm going to keep doing it.  I'm happy with the way I'm hitting and I have to keep on going.  That's all I can do.  I'm not going to change my course because of that, I'm just going to keep on fighting.
Q.  It doesn't really look like anybody is able to put much move on the leaderboard today.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I haven't really looked.  Today I felt like I'm just going to mind my own game.  We had good conditions, just a little wind in the middle.  The conditions are good.  It's a tough course, no doubt about it.
Q.  Were the pin placements tougher?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yes.  (Inaudible)  No. 8, which is my 17.  You just have to play smart.
Q.  Going into the day, your second round, was it a day where you had to go shoot 66 to get yourself back in it because you don't know what's going to happen.  Are you getting to that point now?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm done with my two rounds, and I have another two to go.  And like I said, I'm playing good enough.  It's going to happen.  I'm not    I'm just more concerned about putting up a good score because I'm playing good enough.  If it's good enough, I have no idea.  I want to have a score that reflects how I'm playing.
Q.  What do you think you can shoot if you get going?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  4 or 5 under, the way I'm playing, no doubt about it.
Q.  Did it feel good to finish with a birdie?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Especially after the bogeys on 16 or 17, I finished well.
