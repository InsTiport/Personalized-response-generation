  ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I'm pleased.  My tenth tournament of the year, just played solid golf.  There's a lot of positives take away from this week. 

 Q.  Can you just talk about the last two holes? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, Sherri, she chipped in on the last and putted in on the last.  And she birdied 16.  She had a very, very strong finish and she played well today. 
 I'm very happy with my game, hit a lot of good iron shots and putted well.  Like I said it was a good week and I have a lot of positives to take from here and hopefully I can continue this for the rest of the year. 

 Q.  How do you feel about your year so far? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's been a very different season.  Now I'm finally starting to feel like I'm playing some golf.  It's been a while and I'm really happy and I'm getting there.  I'm excited and looking forward to doing well in some tournaments here at the end. 

 Q.  Do you think you'll be back here next year? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I have no idea.  I just finished five weeks ago.  I'm happy with the week and take one thing at a time. 

 Q.  No wins on the golf course but a lot off the golf course. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a great year.  A lot of great things have happened outside of the ropes and it's been great.  The season is not over but it's coming along and hopefully things are good.
