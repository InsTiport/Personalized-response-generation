Q.  Talk about the closing stretch there on 7 and 8.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I bogeyed 7 with a 4 iron and I 3 putted on my 17.  I hit a driver in the rough and through the green, chipped and two putts.
Q.  To that point it was kind of    you made a bogey and birdie; it was kind of a flat round, would you say?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought I played well.  It's very difficult, very, very difficult.  I hit a lot of good shots.  It would have been nice if I converted.  I had a nice shot on 16.  I thought I played really, really good.  Just two bogeys in the end.
Q.  Are you refamiliarizing yourself with the course?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, they have done a lot of changes.  The course is a little bit different.  I like it.  It's a tough golf course.  You have to hit the ball well.  Today the wind was swirling quite a bit, so it made it quite difficult.  Like I said, I'm happy the way I played.
Q.  How were the greens?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  The greens, they get a little bumpy in the afternoon, but I think we all know that, with a lot of poa annua.  It's got sun wasn't out too much.
Q.  You're a veteran enough, are you able to get 16 and 17 out of your head a little bit and look more at what you did the rest of the round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, like I said I hit the ball beautifully.  I made some good par saves.  Tomorrow I'm off early, I'm going to have smooth greens.  I'm going to go low tomorrow.
Q.  Is that how you've been playing, playing well, but just not getting much out of your round?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I would say so.  Today I would say it's maybe two or three holes that got away.  It's turning, it's definitely turning.  I just want all 18 to go my way.
