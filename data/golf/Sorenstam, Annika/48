   MIKE SCANLAN: Can we do your card very quickly.  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Let's start with my card. Front nine I just had all pars, and then I birdied the 10th hole. I hit a 4-wood on to the green and 2-putted from 22 feet.   
 14, I birdied, hit a sand wedge and that putt was about 24 feet.   
 16, 8-iron, hit a bunker shot from the back and holed it, and so that was overall probably 21 feet.   
 And that's it.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you just tell us 18, how far was that last putt?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: 18, I would say nine feet, uphill left-to-right.  
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thanks for coming in. We're going to make this very quick for you.   
 If you would, just tell us a little about the day. Obviously that last putt was probably a heart-wrencher.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Yeah, I certainly had a chance today, but Angela played very well. As you know, she really didn't make too many mistakes and made a few birdies there both on 10 and what was it, 11. I was tracing her all day, but I never give up, kept on fighting, and I had a chance to force a playoff. You know, I hit a lot of good holes.  
 Obviously I was disappointed with that but overall I thought it was a great tournament and I really tried.  
  
  Q. How special was your shot on 16 in your career? Was it one of the best shots or the most special?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I had some really good shots coming in I thought. The bunker shot on 15 I thought was very good, a nice save, and then of course the hole out on 16 was a magical shot.   
 I always collect shots and I call them my library shots, and that's the shot I'm going to keep in my library for bunker shots, that was one of my all-times. And even the save on 17 I thought was good.  
 Like I said, I played well and I tried very hard and fought to the end, and that's all you can do.  
  
  Q. You were this close so making another magical shot on 18; did you realize how close was that shot?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I still don't know. I heard the crowd and I hit it exactly where I wanted it hit it a little to the right. I heard the crowd but I just didn't know how close or where it was and tried to look at the screen but that wasn't quick enough.   
  
  Q. Did you feel scared coming from the 18th hole to the media centre with the people?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Well, it's just a lot of people at the same time pushing very hard, and I think I was more worried for the children that were standing in the front and just didn't want to encourage the pushing. You know, we thought we could just scoot away under the ropes and just sign but it never eased up. I'll seen a few more up here but under a calmer situation.   
  
  Q. We think that this is going to be your last visit to MÃ©xico, so what do you take home with you after all of these years coming to MÃ©xico, and especially this tournament?  
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I have a lot of memories from MÃ©xico, and you know, I hope I will come back, obviously not for playing for some time. But I've always felt very welcome here, and the hospitality has always been great.   
 Memory-wise, golf-wise, it's been very good to me. So therefore, I hope it won't be the last.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: That's a good one to end on. Annika, thank you for coming in.   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Gracias.
