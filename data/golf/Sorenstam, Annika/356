ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Okay, let's see.  The front nine.  I would like to forget about that one.  I bogeyed the third hole, par 5.  I hit a sand wedge on the green, spun back, had to chip it up, 2-putt from 7 feet.  Bogeyed number 5, I hit a 7-iron short of the green, chipped 2-putt.  Bogeyed No. 7, 7-wood, right of the green, chipped it short, then chipped it up and made the putt from about 5 feet.  Birdied No. 15, 5-iron to -- on the green, 2-putt.  Then birdie on 17, 3-wood up the tee, 7-iron to 15 feet. 
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Don't ask me to hit it again.   I had 132 to the flag, and I had this big tree in front of me and the branches were hanging down a little bit and I was in the rough and I knew that the fairway was going to be a little wet.  So I had to hit something with a little power but still something low under the tree, so I decided on a 7-iron and was shooting for it to go under and then kind of roll up to the flag.   I mean I don't know how I hit it.  I can hit that shot.  But for it to roll exactly and get to pin-high is, you know, you need a little luck and I definitely had some there.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah.  I mean  --. 
  

Q. Everybody fell apart and you were hanging around.
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I was hanging around.  And today definitely paid off.  My goal or my plan today was to get off to a good start, trying to get some birdies early and put the pressure on.  You know, just kind of say,  "Hey, here I am, I'm going to play well today," and really get off to the opposite with three bogeys after seven.  And just  -- I was totally out of it.  I wasn't really swinging, you know, aggressive.  I wasn't executing well.  It just wasn't there.  But for some reason, I stepped to the 8th tee and I said, "I've had enough, let's just go for it." And Terry said, you know, there's a lot of golf left.  Just keep grinding.  You know, I know on this golf course a lot can happen.  If you make a birdie, it's such a course that it's easy to make bogeys and it could be a 2-shot swing just like that.  So I decided just to turn it around, I guess.  But I'm really overwhelmed.  I mean the front nine, the first two hours, there was, you know -- I felt like just going home.  It wasn't my day.  I don't know if I, you know, yesterday was  -- you know, I didn't really do anything.  Maybe that's why I started out this morning.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  In the back of my mind, I mean I know it.  It's just I couldn't get myself to get going.  I think that was the problem.  I know that a lot of things can happen on this course, but I was like  -- there was no energy in me.  But I felt fine coming here.  I don't really know what happened.  I was trying to stay calm, maybe I just got too calm that I just couldn't get it going.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think so a little bit.  I mean I went to the range over here - what is it called - Sherry Lawn, (phonetic spelling) and I hit some balls just to kind of loosen up.  It's not the same thing as playing and maybe, you know, working on your short game or anything like that.  I just hit a bucket of balls to stay loose.  I don't know, I saw a movie, worked out.  I didn't do too much.  I think when you're playing, you want to keep going.  And I mean I had the momentum coming in to Saturday; I wanted to play.  And so, you know, it was kind of a letdown that the weather was so bad.  Then I had to wait almost 48 hours almost to go out again.  So it gave me a lot of time to think about my position and, I don't know, sometimes that's not a very good thing.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, a little bit.  Not too many people bring their caddies to the Sherry Lawn or their Tour bags. (Laughter.) 
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's the driving range around the corner.  
  

Q. You went yesterday or today?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, yesterday.  Yeah, in the afternoon.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean I was  -- I saw a little break, but I think I pulled the putt a little bit.  I was focusing more on the speed than maybe the line.  I just kind of pulled it, and it broke much more than I thought.  So, therefore, it ended up three or four feet to the left.  But it was much quicker than I thought, too.  I was just trying to make a nice line almost.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It played very different.  The greens were much softer than I thought.  You know, you have no roll on the fairway, and the greens were slower.  I mean today I think I had a lot of putts in front that just had a good line but then just kind of died in the end.  I didn't have the speed figured out as much as I did in the beginning of the week.  After all the rain,  they were just slower.  Then the first time I putt was this morning.  It's tough to give yourself 15 minutes to adjust to a totally different state.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'm sorry? 
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No.  No, I saw the shot.  I pictured it from the beginning, it's just a matter of doing it.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible) You have two wins in a row before the Open.  Can you possibly raise your whole bar?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I think so.  I don't see a bar, you know.  I just got to keep playing.  I had my instructor in town and we worked on my swing a little bit, and I think it's getting better.  I still have a little work to do, but I think  -- give me three days of practice, I'll be as ready as I can be.  You know, the confidence is obviously still there, and I mean it's going to be fine.  With a victory like this on this particular golf course, this, to me, is almost like a US Open kind of course:  Fast greens, thick rough, long course, you name it.  It's great preparation for next week.  To come off a win like this, I cannot ask for anything more.  
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I just don't know  -- I can't time my peaks.  I take what I got.  I think the more confidence you have, if you're playing well, you can peak at any time. 
  

Q. ...(Inaudible)?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I mean I knew this could be a deciding cut.  I mean Rosie is one of the best putters on our Tour, and she has totally  -- you know, her putt was for 20 feet, mine was for 15.  If somebody was going to make it, I knew Rosie was.  When hers kind of just hit the edge on the right side, I said,  "Here's my chance." It's nice to have a one-shot lead coming into 18.  You don't want to feel like you have to make a putt on the last hole when the pressure is on.  So it was perfect.  
  

Q. What movie did you see yesterday?
 
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  "The Perfect Storm."  I could have just looked outside the window.
