Q.  Annika, you showed me, at least, more hanging in there, more fortitude than I've seen in a long time when you birdied 15 and 16.  Then what was your thought process on 17?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I mean, I was in between clubs a little bit and I had a 6 iron and I'm not really sure where it landed, but it took off and landed on the back of the green.  I had a chip, about seven  or eight footer for par.  I thought I had a good putt, but it didn't go in.  There was just one hole.  If I look at the whole day, 36 holes, I thought I gave it all.  I was patient out there, and it was a long day.  And it's definitely a true test.
Q.  Any mental weariness toward the end of the round at all?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  When you're in a championship like this, and there's so much at stake and you see yourself on the leaderboard, I didn't have time to think about if I was tired or the wind was blowing.  On the contrary, you're forgetting about it, you're playing the course the way it's been the last four days.  I was telling myself to keep on going.  I came here to play, I'll finish playing, I'll do what I can.
Q.  What are you going to do tomorrow?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Tomorrow another day, another chance to play this golf course.  It was funny, I was out there, and I said, "I won't play this hole anymore," but I guess I will play it again.

It's going to be a different mindset.  I've never been in a playoff like this before.  I'm happy with who I'm playing and I'm looking forward to it.
Q.  Is this more of a match play game?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Anything can happen on this golf course, but it is head to head.  But I've got to be patient and just play every hole the way it is.  Obviously I'll be keeping a close eye on Pat and see what she does.
Q.  How are you doing mentally, between the fog and the wind and you playing four days?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a long week, tough conditions, tough golf course.  Like I said earlier, this is a true test.  It tests everything.  It tests your long game, your short game, your mental part of it and obviously endurance, as well.  I guess a championship of this stature, that's to be expected.
Q.  What would you say was the toughest obstacle this weekend?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, the course and the wind, obviously.  It's really long.  I've never hit so many long irons into the par 4s.  I've never hit so many long irons or woods to par 3s, it just makes it really difficult.
