  Q.  Nice to be done?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a good week.  I'm happy I've been able to play.  I enjoyed myself very much.  The tournament has been a great success and I'm happy about that.   
  
  Q.  How hard was it for you to come back day three and day four; did it make it a lot tougher on your back?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Yeah, I'm trying not to think too much about it.   
 I'm trying to get into the swing of things and trying to stay very patient, and it's going to take me four or five tournaments to be ready.  I'm happy I made the cut and I got two more rounds after that.   
  
  Q.  Is this about what you expected?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I didn't really have any expectations.  Like I said, I was just happy to play.  My first 18 holes was Wednesday, so now I've got five rounds under my belt so hopefully it gets better than there.   
  
  Q.  How do you like being a hostess?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I love it.  It's been great.  This tournament has been fabulous.  The turnout has been wonderful.  You look at the players we have the Top-50 here and we have some incredible spectators to come and watch golf in these conditions.  It's been amazing.   
  
  Q.  What's been the feedback from the players?   
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Fantastic.  Players have been thanking me the whole week.  They just think it's been a fabulous tournament.  They like the golf course, the hospitality and the fans here have been really nice.
