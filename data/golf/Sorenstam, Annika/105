   THE MODERATOR:  Annika, good round there today.  You're now at the top of the leaderboard, a place that you are very comfortable with being but shows your determination today to really get to the round, get to where you would like to be in 2008. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I tried very hard today.  I was very patient.  I got off to a little so-so start.  I made a double on the par 3 and I felt I was playing well.  I didn't want to leave any shots out there. 
 I just kept hanging in there.  The wind picked up and it got a little tougher.  But it's just a thing where I hit some greens and putts on the back nine.  Very pleased with the strong finish.  And it's always fun to see and fun to do. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Go over the scorecard. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I birdied the third hole.  I hit a 4-wood in the greenside bunker, hit it and chipped in from 22 feet.  And then for the par 3 I hit 7-iron in the water, dropped it on the green, 2-putted. 
 THE MODERATOR:  From how far? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  20 feet. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Did you drop it in the green? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I sandwiched it.  Had a hundred yards left.  No. 9, hit it forward to the right of the green, chipped it up to about a foot, made a birdie.  No. 12 sandwiched to two feet.  13, 6-iron to 10 feet.  14, sandwich to 7 feet.  16, sandwich to eight feet.  And then the last hole also a sandwich to 11 feet. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Questions? 

 Q.  When you talked yesterday about knowing where the ball is going and that was concerning, how does that compare to what was happening last year? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's just different golf.  I mean I'm swinging a lot better.  I'm a lot more consistent because I'm setting the club at the top.  I'm coming in in impact.  So much more controlled. 
 I worked a lot on my swing.  One of the biggest things I worked on was I was moving laterally last year and I think a lot of it had to do with the injury being weaker.  I was trying to get some power by using the hips. 
 When you use the hips, it's tough to be consistent.  Sometimes they move a lot; the next time they wouldn't move.  Therefore, I didn't hit a lot of fairways, didn't hit a lot of greens.  It wasn't consistent.  It's tough to hold up under the pressure, when you're playing well, some days were good and some were not.  I'm just working on turning back, setting the club.  From there I can release the club and not have to worry, try to time it.  If it's going to happen, it will happen by itself. 
 So now it's just a matter for me to play and under competition circumstances.  And it's a lot of fun when you stand over a shot and you know you can do it rather than worrying where is it going this time. 

 Q.  Last year, was there ever a point where you felt like you might not get that feeling back? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, I never doubt myself.  I just kept trying, and I figured when the time is right, when I'm getting stronger, when I can work with my coach properly again, I'm determined to do that. 
 That's why I'm excited about this season, because that's my goal, to start swinging well again and play some good golf.  I know I can do that.  And these last two days, I'm very pleased.  It's a long ways to go.  But get off to a good start and see that the preparation I've had the last month or maybe two months, you know I'm on the right track.  Gives me a little confidence and boost and energy. 

 Q.  (Question about the last seven holes and the last time she felt in that groove.) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's been a while.  I did have a few good rounds last year.  If you look at the stats, I did finish top 10, I believe, in every tournament after the British Open.  So I don't want to say that I didn't play well.  But it wasn't as consistent as I would like it to be. 
 But today I'm in control of my game.  I feel like I'm the boss out there and I'm hitting it where I wanted to hit it.  That's been a while.  It's tough to say how many months, but I've had stretches where I felt that.  But now it's consistent 18 holes and another round and another round and that's really what I'm looking for. 

 Q.  (Off microphone)? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Of course, a long ways to go.  The goal tomorrow is to stand over the ball and feel comfortable and swing and go up and hit it and do the same thing.  I mean I want to post a low round tomorrow and we'll see where that takes me. 
 But the key for me is to start playing some good golf.  That's really my goal. 

 Q.  Last year did you realize how difficult winning actually is?  You make it seem so easy.  But last year, did you realize that? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I appreciated the wins, that's for sure.  I think when you step away a little bit you realize, wow, it is not easy and appreciate when it does happen.  And I think last year was good for me in many ways, and that was one of the ways where we just appreciated what I've done and the memories of winning tournaments, whether it's leaving going into the last round or chasing somebody.  I had the chance so many times and I did it.  But last year was just so different. 
 So it puts things in perspective, and I think that's another reason why I'm excited about 2008 because I haven't really been in that situation.  To be honest with you, I love it. 

 Q.  Talking about 2008, with the LPGA approving where you had to play in a tournament every four years, were you going to play here despite that, or did you come here because you had that thing facing you? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It was already on my schedule.  I was planning on coming here.  The reason I haven't been here in the past is because it's all about scheduling.  I finished in December, and then I need a little break and I've got -- I want to practice and I haven't been ready until March. 
 But last year, playing 13 events or so, I felt like I kind of had an off season a little bit and I didn't need a long break during the winter.  So therefore I started practice in middle of January.  I had four weeks to get ready and that was perfect.  That's really what I needed. 
 So to answer your question, yes, it was on my schedule and then I got an e-mail from the LPGA and it turned out to be one of them. 

 Q.  The last couple of years you've been away skiing, golf challenge, skiing, people on the course say anything about seeing you back here? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Oh, yes.  I feel very welcome.  A lot of the volunteers, a lot of the fans and I would say the tournament staff as well said welcome and good to see you here.  And it makes you feel good.  It does.  Makes you feel welcome.  The hospitality here in Hawaii has always been fabulous.  That's not the reason we've been here, it's only been because of scheduling.  I like it here. 
 I've played well here before.  Both in college and the first years as a professional.  So it's nice to be back. 

 Q.  (Question whether she likes the rule) 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I don't like it, no. 

 Q.  The rookie is one shot behind you.  How difficult is it to win as a rookie? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I think it varies really who you are.  There have been several big players out here, rookies, majors as a rookie.  I think the key when you come out as a rookie, you have a lot to learn.  You have to be patient.  If you can be patient and play your own game you have big chances of winning out here.  But obviously the depth of the field here you've got to play some good golf.  So I wouldn't put the pressure on her by any means.  She should come and enjoy and take one day at a time.  There's a lot of hungry players out here. 
 THE MODERATOR:  Thank you.
