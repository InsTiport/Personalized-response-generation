Q.  Talk about 9.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, what can I say?  I hit a lot of good shots.  I really did.  It's a tough green.  I hit a 9 iron in the first time and I thought it was a great shot.  I actually took one more club to hit it soft to make sure it wouldn't spin.  And then I hit a sand wedge.  I don't know what to say other than that.  I made seven good shots.
Q.  Have you had an experience like that at other golf courses?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM: If I have, I've totally forgot about it.
Q.  Has that ever happened to you on the 9th green before?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's happened a few times on this golf course.  I can't remember No. 9.  It happened once, but not three times, for sure.
Q.  How deflating, if it was, at the point when you were three shots behind and all a sudden you're back to even?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's very deflating.  I played well today.  It's tough out there.  I played good golf today.  It's one hole, and that's where I'm going to leave it at.
Q.  Talk a little bit about the conditions.  Did that make it harder to play catch up?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, it's played tough all week.  We have had a lot of wind.  It's been gusting at times.  The greens have been difficult.  We've had some really tough pin placements.
Q.  Would you be sad if they decided not to come back here next year?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Right now I don't even know what I'm going to do next year.  I don't know what the plans are.  I've always had great success at this tournament.  I guess it would be sad.
Q.  What do you think about the run that Lorena is on?  Six straight events, second place or leader?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  It's incredible.  She's playing some great golf.  A lot of people who have played with her before know she's capable of that, and she's definitely proving it.  Lorena is great.  I like her a lot, so I'm very happy for her.
