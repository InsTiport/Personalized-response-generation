Q.
That was heck of a way to finish today.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thank you.  The finish was good.
Q.  
Can you explain what happened the rest of the day?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
You know what, I really can't.  I thought I played pretty good today.  It just didn't go my way at all.  I felt I had some good shots.  I think I drove it well.  I could tell you I didn't make any putts.  It was just one of those days.  It was obviously very unfortunate.  It was not the start I had in mind.  Just in the end, it was just    you just can't get too upset about it; you have just to hit it and go from there.
Q.  
How did the course play differently with the new design?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
It played a little different.  I think it's good.  I like the changes, the greens are good.  Today I think the wind was more of a factor than the golf course.  So it was swirling quite a lot of time.
Q.  
Of all the weeks to open with a 75, this might not hurt you so much, because there's a lot of other higher scores out there.  The low in house right now is only a 69.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
We'll see.  Like I said, it was not the start I had in mind.  I will have to shoot very low the next three days.  It is just another challenge.  You know, I felt good about my game, I really do.  I think I am hitting good putts.  It's got to turn it around for me to have a chance.
Q.  
Was the wind a factor on the green as well?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Just a little faster.  I don't know that the winds had a lot to do with it.  I just think they are mowing the greens a little tighter later in the week.
Q.  
Do you think at all about six in a row after a day like this?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I thought about it this morning, but after my first bogey I had more things to think about than that.
Q.  
Could you sense a bigger crowd today at this particular tournament?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
I would say so, yes.
Q.  
When was the last time you remember shooting a 75?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
It was actually 76.

I can't remember if I did.  I don't want remember.  I just want to move forward.  Three more days, I have got to go low.  I play well enough to do it.
Q.  
Can you just describe what happened on 7 in the rough.  You were on the swell, with the trees.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
Yeah, There were some rocks.  I thought I had a good lie, I was just going to bump it up to the green, it just hit a rock and bounced     I mean, it came at me.  So I kind of had to move around, and I almost lost my balance and fell down the hill.  Luckily I didn't.

It was just one of those days.  It just didn't go my way at all.
Q.  
Can you talk about this tournament, how popular it has been with the players and fans.  It's only in its third year.  The popularity of it thus far.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  
It is a very popular tournament.  It is probably one of the highlights of the year, to come here.  Good golf course, good crowds, good sponsor.  It's just a great support.  We all love to come here.  It feels kind of like a major, so we are happy to be here.
