DANA VON LOUDA:  Annika, very good opening round, 68.
DANA VON LOUDA:  You are currently tied with Catriona Matthew at 4 under.  If you would like to open up with some general comments.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I'm very happy to start out with a 68.  It's a good start.  It's one of the better starts I believe in a championship for me here.

But if you look at the whole round, it was a little bit of an up and down type of day.  I made seven birdies and three bogeys.  But, you know, it was pretty steady most of the day.  I thought I made some good putts out there.  Just a really good start, I thought.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Let's go ahead and do your score card.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I birdied the 2nd hole.  I hit a 6 iron, hit it in the left side bunker, hit it up, made it from about three feet.

No. 3, sand wedge to 9 feet.

Bogeyed No. 4.  Hit a 6 iron on the green, 3 putted.

No. 6, I hit a 6 iron on the green, 3 putted.

No. 7, I birdied.  I hit 7 iron to eight feet.

No. 9, I birdied.  I hit driver just left side of the green, chipped it up to about four feet.

No. 10, I birdied.  I hit 6 iron on the green, 2 putt.

13, I birdied.  7 iron to six feet.

Then 17, I hit sand wedge to about six feet.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Questions.
Q.  You say it was one of your better opening rounds.  You mean to the British Open or just any tournament?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Probably both.  Here, yeah.
Q.  What is your lowest opening round here?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I'd have to look that up.  I know I've always had a tough start here for some reason.
Q.  How far did you have in on the last couple holes?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  17 I had 111, and on 18 I had 139.
Q.  You really didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t hit those last two driver very well, did you (laugher)?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  No, just a little bit on the toe.  I hit them pretty good.  I mean, it really paid off there on 17 to hit driver.  That is quite a difficult hole.  Place it in good lane for a sand wedge, especially the pin was sitting there.  Same thing on 18.  Especially downwind when the greens are firming up, it's obviously nice to have a short iron in.
Q.  Did the conditions get better throughout the day?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  I thought so, yeah.  The wind picked up.  It started a little bit on the 7th and 8th hole, even though we're surrounded by a lot of trees there.  But you can still feel it.

Then when we came    you know, the last few holes when it's a little bit more open, you can really feel it.  I don't know if it's (inaudible), but compared to this morning when there was nothing, it was quite a big difference.
Q.  When you wake up in the morning what do you feel?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I wanted to take advantage of my tee time.  I mean, once you're up, it's nice to be up that early in the morning.  It's just a matter of getting loose and finding your swing early on.

But, I mean, the conditions were great.  Like I said no breath of air.  Greens are pure.  You name it, it's just really good scoring conditions.  So I wanted to get off to a good start.

I did in a way, but then I was able to hold through the last few holes, which I'm happy about.
Q.  The distance you were hitting today is that usual?
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, you would be thinking of 17 and 18.
Q.  Well, the last 6 holes.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Well, I mean, the last two holes, I think that's more than usual.  I mean, I must have    I hit them really good.  Normally I'm up there.  Juli and I very similar.  Maybe I'm a little longer than her, but not by much.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Thank you, Annika.
ANNIKA SORENSTAM:  Thanks.
