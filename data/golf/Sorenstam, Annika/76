 Q. Talk about your day. 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I was disappointed with my day. I was hoping for a little better. Of course, I'm bummed out about that. Nothing I can do, but disappointing.

 Q. A lot of the golfers talk about the greens being kind of hard to read. Do you feel that yourself? 
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: Maybe a little bit. I think I would say the wind was a little tougher with the greens, and totally different conditions today. 

 Q. What's your focus heading into tomorrow?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I'm just going to try and play the best I can. 

 Q. Can you just take a step away, and as a host, how do you feel things are going right now?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: I think it's going great. Great support, the course is good. I'm very proud of this tournament. It's been a lot of fun. I just wish I would have played a little better. 

 Q. How important is it to have a good round tomorrow to get some momentum going into the McDonald's LPGA Championship?
 ANNIKA SORENSTAM: It would be nice, and I'm playing good enough, I'm not worried so much about the momentum. I just want to post a good score. I mean, yesterday I played excellent. Actually, I played very good today. Just nothing, nothing went in. 
 So I'm just going to try and forget about this day and move on.
