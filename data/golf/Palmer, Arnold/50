Q.
How is the golf course?
 ARNOLD PALMER:  The golf course is great.  I think it's -- well, it's wonderful.  If you can drive it in the fairway, and the fairways are very generous, all you need to do is hit a few irons, but it's long and it is difficult, but it wouldn't be an Open venue if it wasn't all of those things.

It's supposed to be tough, and you should be required to play some pretty good golf.
Q.  Bruce Lietzke said that you had almost a Sunday pin placement on a Thursday.  Do you agree with that?
 ARNOLD PALMER:  No, I don't agree with that.  I think on the back nine, the pins were probably a little more difficult, and I would agree that they were probably Sunday positions, but the front nine, they were fairly generous with one or two exceptions.  I won't say they were easy, but I think there is a lot of pin placements that could have been a lot more difficult.
Q.  With the banks in front of the greens, a lot of false fronts, it's really difficult to run the ball on the greens, isn't it?
 ARNOLD PALMER:  Of course.  The way these guys are hitting the ball now, they don't need to run it into the greens.  The greens are fairly generous and they're fairly soft.

If you're hitting the ball the way you should be hitting it, long and carrying your irons up into the greens, they'll stay on the greens.  They're not getting away, and as I said earlier, the greens are fairly generous, and the fairways couldn't be prettier.  They are really beautiful.
Q.  Is it Musial you shook hands with on 10?
ARNOLD PALMER:  Stan Musial, yes.  I had dinner with him the other night so we were talking about it.  Thank you, guys.
