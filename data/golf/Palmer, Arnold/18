  Q. What was better, the putt yesterday in the Par 3 Contest or the drive on the first tee?  
 ARNOLD PALMER: Well, I was happy to make contact with the drive and the putt made my week.  
  
  Q. What was it like sharing the tee box with Jack Nicklaus?  
 ARNOLD PALMER: Great. What can you say? No one has played Augusta and done any better than he has.  
  
  Q. How do you feel about the reception you get walking from the clubhouse all the way to the tee box and the fans just adore you?   
 ARNOLD PALMER: Well, that's wonderful and it's a great feeling and just typifies Augusta and what happens here, the politeness of the crowds, it's just overwhelming.   
  
  Q. What does it feel like?  
 ARNOLD PALMER: Well, I look forward to it. I think about it before I get here, I get nervous, even now, and I'm not playing anymore. So you know what it was like when I was playing.   
  
  Q. After that drive, do you think you ought to tee it up again?
