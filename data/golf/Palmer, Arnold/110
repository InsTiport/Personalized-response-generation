Q. Could you just tell us what you are feeling right now and
what it has been like the past couple of days, past week?

ARNOLD PALMER: I think you all know pretty much how I feel. Most
of you I have talked to quite a bit over the years and -- I suppose
the sun got me a little bit. I got a little tired, I guess and
a little emotional coming up 18 and I think it is -- you know,
can't get it going. I mean, it is, you know, it is 40 years of
fun, work, enjoyment.

Q. You are the king. You not only affected golf, but all of
sports throughout the world. Your impact is every place. Can you
think of one thing you have done, the thing that you feel that
you have had the most fun with?

ARNOLD PALMER: Oh, I think, as I said, many times recently the
whole experience, you know, it has been -- I haven't won all that
much. I have won a few tournaments. I have won some majors, but
the, I suppose, the most important thing is the fact that it has
been as good as it has been to me. I think I am a little bit sun
whipped and tired, ready to take a little rest. Hopefully, a few
more golf tournaments along the way. I think that is about all
I have to say. Thank you very much.

(APPLAUSE.)
