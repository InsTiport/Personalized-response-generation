Q.  (Inaudible.)

ARNOLD PALMER:  I am not going to continue to play the way I have been.  I have a few commitments that I will keep tournament-wise and a couple of exhibitions here and there, but it is getting to the end of the line.


Q.  (Inaudible).

ARNOLD PALMER:  Well, certainly there is a lot of emotion, and there is a lot of feeling about the tournament, the week.  And the way I played sort of took the edge off of everything.  My game is just not shaping up at all to any kind of expectation that I might have.  So that is going to have a very definite influence on my future and as far as playing is concerned.  I will still play at the club and enjoy the guys there, but I think my tournament play is going to really start cutting back.


Q.  What about some few final words for Arnie's Army at the last Senior Open?

ARNOLD PALMER:  I don't know whether it is the last, but it certainly -- the people couldn't have been more supportive than they have been here.  I have felt like walking away a few times, but there was no way I could even think about it out here, the way the people reacted, and that is a big part of the whole thing.  You're supposed to have fun playing golf, and lately it hasn't been a lot of fun for me.
