 Q.  We heard from your formidable opponents that you guys made a lot of putts today.  Kept them on their heels a little bit.  How did you feel the match went for you?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: I think we got off to a hot start with our putters.  I think I made a putt right in the beginning that was a little bit longer than a normal putt would be to make.  So it went in, and kind of jumped us and we just kept rolling from there.   
 Q.  Which hole that was?  
AVERY FRENCH: It was our second birdie, the par-5.   
 Q.  6?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: Sorry, I don't know.  I think it was before 6.   
AVERY FRENCH: I was about 50 feet.   
 Q.  Oh, my.  
AVERY FRENCH: Yeah, 50 feet and it bent around the top and fell in the front.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: We knew going in these girls are good players, very good.  So we know that we just had to stay consistent and we had to let them -- if they were going to beat us, we had to make sure we at least par'd or stayed on the greens, because these greens are so difficult.   
Avery was putting lights out.  She played really well, and it was fun to watch you.  I just watched for most of it.   
AVERY FRENCH: That's not true.   
 Q.  How many birdies do you think you made?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: So I only made one.   
AVERY FRENCH: I think I made three.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: I made the first one.   
AVERY FRENCH: Yeah.  Good job.  She started us off.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: Avery was putting so good today.   
AVERY FRENCH: She was hitting them really close and I was making the putt, and she would be, Ah, I could have made mine.   
 Q.  So there was a stretch of the tournament where we saw Aneka make (indiscernible) and that gave them two straight hole wins.  Comes down to two, I think at the time.  
AVERY FRENCH: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  Any kind of let's just kind of refocus?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: Like I said, we knew they were good.  They were very good players.  So going into it, as long as we didn't make any big mistakes, we could hang in there.  Yeah.   
AVERY FRENCH: We knew they were going win a few holes.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: Yeah, we knew it was inevitable they were going to win a hole here and there.  Just had to stay consistent and make sure we at least had one putting for birdie every time.   
That was kind of our goal today.   
 Q.  So who made the birdie on 10 and got it back to three?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: I only birdied once.  Oh, we won with par.   
 Q.  So that restored the 3-up lead?  
WHITNEY FRENCH: Yes.   
 Q.  How important is par out here when you get to match play?  
AVERY FRENCH: Very important.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: This course especially because of the greens...   
AVERY FRENCH: And the greens surrounds.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: If you're putting for birdie you're going to have a good chance of winning and there is going to be a lot of the par saves out here.  So if you can just kind of not blow up.   
AVERY FRENCH: Yeah.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: You're going to stay consistent and it'll be good.   
 Q.  This is your third time in fourball?  
AVERY FRENCH: Third.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: Third time playing together.   
 Q.  So which did you play together in, starting with the Dunes Club.  
AVERY FRENCH: Myrtle Beach, L-Cab, and then this one.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: This is the first time making past the first round.   
AVERY FRENCH: Yes.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: We made the cut both times but finally made it past the first round.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  
WHITNEY FRENCH: Yeah.   
 Q.  You're in the sweet 16 now.  Does this golf course suit you?  
AVERY FRENCH: I don't know, I think just our mentality is a little different.  We kind of just -- it's like really one shot at a time, see where it is.  The greens are firm and green surrounds are difficult.  If you can get it on the green.  If not, see how to get hot.  That was the goal.  See how we can make a par from wherever you are.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: Worst case, par.   
 Q.  Does the comfort level rise every day playing the course?  
AVERY FRENCH: For me it has.  Getting familiar with how much they bounce into the greens is going to take and how much it's going to roll out is just knowledge and knowledge on top.   
WHITNEY FRENCH: Uh-huh.
