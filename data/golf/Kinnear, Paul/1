Q. Paul, what's the experience been like?PAUL KINNEAR: Yeah, it's been fantastic, really.  Obviously, like I said all week playing against the best players and being around the best players in the world, it's good to learn a lot from them, really, and great to play with two top players, as well.  I enjoyed the experience.Q. What were the emotions like today?PAUL KINNEAR: Yeah, I felt good, felt confident, and yeah, just can't play that 17th hole.  I just can't.  I don't know what it is.  It's just -- I hit an all right tee shot and then a great shot into the green, and any straight bounce and I've got a barely chance and it kicked left into the bunker and then I've got no shot.  So yeah, just a bit devastated now, really.  But at the end of the day, it's a great experience, and hopefully I'll play in many of these.Q. How proud are you of what you done?PAUL KINNEAR: Yeah, really proud, especially the way I battled, and to have thought I was slipping to still battle like that at the end of the day and after waiting all day in the clubhouse, sitting down and stiffening up and then coming out onto the course and the wind is ridiculous, and yeah, really proud of myself the way I handled myself and the way I obviously played under the pressure.Q. Did you have great support?PAUL KINNEAR: Yeah, it was great.  Just got to thank them all now afterwards and have a great night tonight and just celebrate me obviously getting here.  I'm really excited to get going next week in the English Amateur.
