  Q. Talk about your day if you would.   
 MATT SEITZ: Same as yesterday, same as all week, actually. Really didn't hit it good. I'm looking for band-aids. I ground it out the first two days to make the cut and then I just I got worn out playing 72 holes. I got worn out. I just got flat beat and lost my concentration quite few times, especially around the greens. I wasn't hitting it very good and hopefully this will help me figure out what to work on to hopefully play better in the future. It was a great week, but it would have been fun to hit it decent and play well.
