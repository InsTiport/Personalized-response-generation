  Q. Talk about your day if you would.   
 MATT SEITZ: Well, I don't know, it was fun, actually. I felt fairly confident out there. I hit it kind of like I did all week and not that great, just kind of struggling around and getting it around.   
 And I hit a couple decent shots and had a couple that weren't really good and just couldn't seem to get a streak going or get any confidence going.   
 I also seemed a little more tired. Maybe that had to do with the first two rounds from grinding it out all week long. But that was the main thing, I kind of lost my focus out there sometimes, I think.  
  
  Q. How is the course playing today?  
 MATT SEITZ: Good. It's fine. We played the ball down, I thought it was, I thought it was fine. I didn't have any mud, any problems. The course played to me about like it did really the first couple rounds, really. It was good. Everything was fine.   
 I just wish that -- I mean there wasn't that much between the scores, just a break here or there, unfortunately, but hopefully I'm going to go straight home and get some rest and be fresh for tomorrow.
