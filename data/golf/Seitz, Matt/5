  Q. If you could just tell us a little bit about your round, I saw you shot a 76, which is not a bad score today?  
 MATT SEITZ: Yeah, the wind's blowing pretty hard. The greens were hard and fast. Started out a little shaky and then wound up hitting the ball pretty decent. Midway through the round.   
 I had two putting bounces, like you're going to get out here. But all in all I guess I'm happy with it.  
  
  Q. Were you able to drive the ball with the wind? Did you have to adjust anything off the tee?  
 MATT SEITZ: Oh, yeah, definitely. You had to play for the wind. Because it was blowing pretty good. Couple times I drove it through some fairways that I didn't think I could because of the way the wind was blowing. Just the whole round was just a grind because of the wind.   
  
  Q. You hit it in into the rough, if you do that is it almost an automatic bogey?  
 MATT SEITZ: No, it's a, it's almost an automatic up-and-down for par though. But that's the only way you're going to make par. Because you get in that stuff, you just work hard to try and get it between the bunkers up there somewhere short and then get it up-and-down. And then get your par. But that's not an easy task.   
  
  Q. So you haven't played here before?  
 MATT SEITZ: No, this is my first time here.   
  
  Q. What were the greens like? I know that some of the pin placements were pretty tough, you have to be below the hole almost all the time probably?  
 MATT SEITZ: Yeah, but they were fair. I think once you get above the pins on these greens you know what you're going to have.   
 They weren't out of control. I was above 13 and was able to lag it down there and close enough to get my par. So they weren't, I thought they were very fair.
