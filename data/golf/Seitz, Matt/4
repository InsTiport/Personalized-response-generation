 Q. Just give an overview of your play today. 
 MATT SEITZ: Pretty much like I would say grind it out. I'm not hitting it that good. I'm rolling the ball, I see my line, I'm not hitting the driver that good, the irons so so, but it played -- I had kind of a fun round for as bad as I hit it. 

 Q. So you were, give us a few thoughts on the course. The conditions. 
 MATT SEITZ: The course is great. Even with all the rain they have had, it's playing very fair, I think. We do have to play it up, we did play it up, but we couldn't, otherwise would he wouldn't be able to play it's so wet out there. And it's just lengthened the course out considerably. It helps to have it in the fairways quite a bit. 

 Q. Was it playing different than yesterday?
 MATT SEITZ: About the same as yesterday I think. Yesterday the wind might have blown a little harder. Yesterday seems so long ago, because we played 27 today and got in late last night. I'm having a hard time remembering that. But I think that it's a little cooler today. So I think it played pretty much about the same. For me anyway. 

 Q. So are you happy with the what you've done so far?
 MATT SEITZ: Oh, I would have to say yes, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I got to get the driver, I got to feel more comfortable over the ball, that's all. I think I found a few things in my swing and we'll find out.
