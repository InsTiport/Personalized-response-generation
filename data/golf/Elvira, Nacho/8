Q. How are you feeling?
NACHO ELVIRA: Good honestly.  I played solid golf.  I was 5-under through 12 holes with a lot of options honestly.  I played pretty solid.  I gave myself some chances.  I just didn't make some putts.
Q. How was the week as a whole?
NACHO ELVIRA: Good honestly.  I'm happy with the week.  Especially after the last two weeks, I didn't play very good.  I struggled with my swing, and this week, the swing was on point.  I mean, everything was on point.  I just didn't make as many putts as I wanted.
Q. Lots of positives to take out of this week?
NACHO ELVIRA: It's a positive week.  I cannot take it any other way.  I learned a lot and honestly everything I'm working on, it looks like when I do them, they work honestly, so I try to stick to it and finish the year on a good note.
