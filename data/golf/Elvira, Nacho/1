Q. How pleased are you with that round?
NACHO ELVIRA: I'm very happy, honestly.  I mean, this is a tough course.  It's nothing like what we played last week.  It's tight off the tee.  The modification of the greens make it tough to hit any approaches close to the hole, so I'm very happy with 2-under.
I think I played solid off the tee.  I was pretty much always in play and I mean, hopefully I can keep it up like this for the rest of the week.
Q. Obviously third place last week at your home event.  How much confidence has that given you going into this week?
NACHO ELVIRA: It's golf.  You can never really say that you are confident.  I mean, I think it's a great result, the one I had last week.  Obviously playing at home with all the home crowd, it was fantastic and it made me really happy that I finished third.  But I mean, this week is a new week.  I think I'm hitting the ball fairly decent honestly.  I'm very happy with the way I hit it today and hopefully I can keep it up.
Q. What's your plan of action for tomorrow?  Go out and do anything differently?
NACHO ELVIRA: Talking to my caddie, I heard there was going to be a little more of wind than today.  Today was absolutely fantastic.  Today was probably one of the best days of golf that I've ever seen:  It was 23, 24 degrees, into wind, conditions perfect.  Tomorrow I think is going to be a little more of wind.
I don't know, I'll probably hit a few balls, hit a few putts and relax.
