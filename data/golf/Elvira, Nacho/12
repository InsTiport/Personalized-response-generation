 Q.   How good of a round is that out here?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I'm pretty happy with the round today.   I didn't strike the ball quite as good as I wanted to but chipped and putted very well.   Overall it was a great round.   Good stuff.   
   
 Q.   How familiar are you with the track?   
NACHO ELVIRA:   I mean, I played last year at the beginning of the year.   It was my third tournament on Tour.   I like the place.   I like the weather and obviously I like the course and the environment so happy playing here.  
   
 Q.   Some times it takes awhile to learn the nuances of this one.   Where do you stand on that?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I can see the tricky part of this course, obviously especially the grass being bermuda is not as easy as the grass we play in Europe.   You've got to get used to it quickly.  
   
 Q.   What's your state of mind approaching a tournament this season?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   Actually to be honest, I'm playing good golf and I'm confident the way I'm doing things and see how it falls out.   Only takes one week.   Like last year, I was like this at the end of the year on The Challenge Tour and it worked out for me.   Hopefully we can do the same this year.  
   
 Q.   Does that help that you've been in the position before in a sense?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I don't recommend anybody to be in this position obviously but to be there and know it only takes one good week to make anything work, I'm relaxed and happen see and see what happens, it happens.
