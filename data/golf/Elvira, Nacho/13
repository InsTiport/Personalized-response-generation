 Q.   Super start, and we've seen you get better week‑by‑week this season, but that's a really big leap today to get that score in?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I know, yeah.   Today was a wonderful day.   All of a sudden, everything clicked. I was hitting every fairway pretty much.   I missed one green.   I hit 17 greens today, and hitting them pretty close, and you know, when everything clicks, everything seems to be a little easy, but it's a great round, very happy.  
   
 Q.   Your first full season, do you find yourself assessing yourself week‑by‑week to see where you're going in the game?   
NACHO ELVIRA:   I mean, this is my fifth tournament on The European Tour.   I still have too much to learn.   I see the guys that have been here for years, and they are a little bit ahead still of me, and I mean, I'm happy to learn week‑by‑week, and let's see how this weekend up and learning every week.  
   
 Q.   We can hear a Spanish‑American accent, where does that come from?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I come from Texas.   I lived there 5 1/2 years.   I went to college to Texas A&M and I guess that's where it comes from.  
   
 Q.   And you feel right at home on the Tour, especially after that score; how are you going to keep things under control the next three rounds?  
NACHO ELVIRA:   I think it's a clichÃ© but stay in the moment, go shot by shot and stick to my routine on every shot, and, you know, stay in the present.   That's pretty much what I try to do.
