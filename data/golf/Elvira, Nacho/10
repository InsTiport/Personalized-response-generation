 Q.  How was it?  
NACHO ELVIRA: Good actually.  I feel like I hit the ball pretty solid.  I didn't make many mistakes, only one bogey today.  So I'm pretty happy.   
 Q.  How is the course playing out there?  
NACHO ELVIRA: It was playing not too tough honestly.  I mean, like I say yesterday, there's no rough, hardly any winds and a little breeze this afternoon.  The pins were overall tougher yesterday but it's still playing easy.   
 Q.  Some rain coming tonight and tomorrow morning, so that means the greens will be softer and you can go at them a bit more on the weekend?  
NACHO ELVIRA: They just told us that we are going to start a little later because of the rain, so the greens will be softer.  Hopefully they don't roll back.  Hopefully they can prepare for the round and let's hope.   
 Q.  Are you positive with your position going into the weekend?  
NACHO ELVIRA: Yeah, I'm playing solid.  I've had a good year so far and trying to finish on a good note.  Let's focus for tomorrow.
