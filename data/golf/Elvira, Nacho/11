Q. Pleased with your start?
NACHO ELVIRA: It was good.  The weather is great.  The golf course is playing maybe a little easier because the rough is not as tall as some of the years, but overall it's a good day, a good start.
Q. How are you feeling towards the rest of the week?  Is that going to give you a lot of confidence?
NACHO ELVIRA: It's the first round.  We cannot get too caught up about it.  It's a good start.  I'll keep try to do as good as I'm doing and stick to the process.
Q. Is it a course that suits your eye?
NACHO ELVIRA: I don't know if it suits me but it fits my eye very well.  I like it.  I like it off the tee.  I've played here a few times as an amateur, and I played this tournament, this is my third time.  So I know the course pretty well and I like it.
Q. Obviously the weather being what it is, it makes it even better, doesn't it?
NACHO ELVIRA: Exactly.  The weather has been great.  The sun is shining.  There's not much wind.  I don't know about this afternoon but we had a beautiful morning and obviously we can have three more days like this.
Q. How perfect was it out there to play?
NACHO ELVIRA: It was perfect.  Honestly in the morning, it was the perfect temperature.  Didn't get too hot at all.  Hopefully it sticks like this the next few days.
