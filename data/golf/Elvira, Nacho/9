NACHO ELVIRA: My iron play was on point today.  I didn't hole as many putts as I wanted but overall it was a good round.
Q. How were conditions?  A bit windy today, wasn't it?
NACHO ELVIRA: It was windier than the last couple days but nothing too serious.  Maybe a couple holes were more tough today than they were the last couple days but overall the course is still playing -- I mean, the scores, people are still shooting 8-under, 7-under, so the course is out there to shoot some good scores.
Q. Do you feel positive to shoot a low number tomorrow?
NACHO ELVIRA: I've been trying.  I've been playing good. I just need to hole a few more putts.  But I try to enjoy Sunday and I try to enjoy the last tournaments of the season and see what happens.
Q. Are you going to work on putting later?
NACHO ELVIRA: I might work a little bit.  Not too long.  It's been a long day.  I'm happy with the way I played.  It's not something that I need to change or anything.  Just maybe get a little bit more luck tomorrow.
