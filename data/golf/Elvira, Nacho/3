Q. How was that 66?
NACHO ELVIRA: It was great.  It was tough at the beginning.  It was a lot of rain and tough conditions at the beginning.  I managed to start with a great birdie on No. 2, and once the rain stopped, everything got a little easier and the greens were more receptive and it was a little easier to score.  I'm very happy with the 66.
Q. Doesn't make a difference compared to the rest of the week?
NACHO ELVIRA: The weather, I guess the course is a little bit more receptive.  With the rain that has been going on for the first three hours in the morning, the greens are softer and the fairways are softer, which is making it easier and wider to hit to the pin.
Q. Great run of tournaments with the Rolex Series, you must be feeling very good?
NACHO ELVIRA: Yeah, obviously I'm very happy with this week.  I have been struggling a little bit with the past few weeks with a couple of swing changes and a couple of equipment changes, but I think everything is working on the right direction now, so I'm pretty happy.
