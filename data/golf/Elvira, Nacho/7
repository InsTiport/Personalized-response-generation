 Q.  Thoughts on the final day?  
NACHO ELVIRA: I'm very happy.  It's been a nice week.  The weather's been perfect.  The course has been in great condition, and finishing off with a 67, I'm very happy.   
 Q.  Looked like it could have been even better?  
NACHO ELVIRA: It could honestly.  I've been playing great throughout the week.  The putter, don't get me wrong, I've been putting great but I just didn't hole many putts.  At the end of the day, I finished 11-under which is good.   
 Q.  When you started today, I'm sure it was just play as well as you could, but did you have a kind of target in mind?  
NACHO ELVIRA: Not really.  I was way too far away from ThorbjÃ¸rn.  So I just thought to myself that, you know, play as good as you can, shoot as low as you can, but just enjoy yourself; and great course, great weather, and I did very well.   
 Q.  Second was potentially there for the taking.  
NACHO ELVIRA: It was there.  Honestly I was only four shots away from second, so I mean, it was a little bit of a target, but I mean, I never thought of finishing second.  I just thought that I needed to do, you know, the same thing that I've been doing all week and it's stay in the moment and try and shoot as good as I could.   
 Q.  Given this is The Final Series, there's a lot of points and prize money; so have you looked at that?  
NACHO ELVIRA: No, not yet.  Maybe when I get to the players' lounge and have a little lunch, I'll look at it.   
 Q.  But it's going to be good, isn't it?  
NACHO ELVIRA: Hopefully.  I think so.
