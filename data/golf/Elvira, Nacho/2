 Q.  Nacho, that's a great opening round for you.  Just got to ask you about your final hole, the ninth.  I think the TV commentators have said it was the break of the century, your approach to the green.  How did you see it from where you were?  
NACHO ELVIRA: It looked good, good backspin.  Obviously it was hard to judge.  190 to the pin.  The wind was gusting a lot.  I hit a lob-wedge 125 and I was lucky that it bounced, hit the rock and come back.  It's good to get lucky every once in a while.   
 Q.  Overall you must be pretty pleased.  There won't be that much low scoring around here and under par is a good start.  
NACHO ELVIRA: Yeah, it's a tough course, definitely.  You have some narrow fairways, thick rough.  I mean, the rough this year is not as long, but it's tough to hit it close to the hole with the wind gusting.   
 Q.  I'm sure at the back of your mind, a good performance here, you get into Dubai next week and you're 71 currently.  Not far away from the Top 60.  
NACHO ELVIRA: Yeah, it's a tournament that I like.  We'll see what happens.  I have a few days left.  Under par is good but I still have a lot of ground to cover.
