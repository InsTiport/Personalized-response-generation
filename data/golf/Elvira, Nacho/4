Q. Your thoughts on today?
NACHO ELVIRA: Today has been an interesting day.  I found my swing today.  I was feeling a little bit out of tempo for some reason.  I couldn't hit the driver.  I could hit some irons, but I managed to fight back and make some birdies coming in and nice eagle on the last.
Q. It was getting pretty dark out there.  What was it like to play in those conditions at the end?
NACHO ELVIRA: After 16, 16 green was getting dark.  You know, we obviously wanted to finish so we don't have to start early tomorrow.  So we kind of rushed into things a little bit; I rushed into things a little bit.  I 3-putt 16 and I 3-putt 17; that was my mistake.
Overall, I think it was difficult to play in the dark, but at the same time it was nice to finish in the dark.
Q. An up-and-down day but in general your form has been super solid.  You must be pleased with how you're performing week-to-week?
NACHO ELVIRA: I am very happy.  Today has been a crazy day honestly, but I think I'm doing the things right and I'm moving in the right direction and hopefully I can finish good tomorrow.
