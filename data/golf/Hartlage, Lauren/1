Q. You realize that the last hole you had a chance to maybe tie for medalist?
LAUREN HARTLAGE: Yeah, I kind of in the back of my mind knew 6-under was probably the score to beat, but unfortunately I hit my tee shot just a little right in that thick Bermuda, and there was no way I was going to be able to go for the green.
Q. Disappointed you didn't get medalist, or sometimes it's a blessing not having that bull's-eye going into match play?
LAUREN HARTLAGE: I mean, I definitely wanted to make par on the last hole.  It's always not a good feeling getting a bogey.  But I feel good about my game, so I'm excited about the next few days.
Q. You had kind of a U.S. Open round going today, lots of pars.
LAUREN HARTLAGE: Yeah, so many pars, but the only bogeyed was on the last hole, but I couldn't get any putts to fall in.  I'm hitting the ball well and they're rolling good, they're just going right over the edge.
Q. Obviously in match play everybody starts over tomorrow.  Doesn't matter what you shot the last two days.
LAUREN HARTLAGE: Yes.
Q. Do you have much match play experience, and how do you feel about playing match play?
LAUREN HARTLAGE: Yeah, I've played a couple match play tournaments already this summer, and I've played in this event and made match play the last two years, so definitely used to playing match play, and it's a lot of fun because you can do a lot of things differently than stroke play.
Q. Do you take any different strategy on any of the particular holes?  Will you take some more aggressive lines or stick to what you've been doing the last couple days?
LAUREN HARTLAGE: Well, I've been playing pretty aggressive for me these last two days, so I'll probably stick to that, but we'll probably talk it over tonight and see what the game plan is, but probably not much different.
