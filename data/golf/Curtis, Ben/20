 Q. ...told me yesterday, if he gets this golf course 56 he can birdie every hole. You had a look at birdie on every hole today. Great iron play today.
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah. You know, it's just one of those, I feel comfortable here, and you know, this is the type of course you just want to give yourself a chance. 
 I mean if you hit the greens, most likely you're not going to be too far away and you'll have a good look at it and a crazy rough taking it flat and rolling good. So you got all those things that makes iron play a little bit easier.

 Q. Are you actually a little disappointed that you don't make --
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, you know, I left it a little short on 18 and 11. So those two that was about it. I mean I hit a couple of putts that weren't the best out there, but you know, 95 percent of the round was good.

 Q. It's Major season. We had the Open last week and the Open Championship coming up. This is the time when you really get cranked up.
 BEN CURTIS: We were talking about that the other day. It's just funny how I go into the three-month stretch where I play my best golf. 
 I don't know what it is. I think next year I'm just going to take off and start up at Memorial or something. Take seven months off. I don't know.

 Q. You play hard courses so well. This isn't. I mean you can make birdies here. Why do you like it?
 BEN CURTIS: I don't know. I think it just sets up good for the eye. I mean it's not overly tight so you're not trying to force the ball on the fairway. The greens aren't overly small, and they're soft. My first year here we were talking about today, the greens were really rolling fast. 

 Q. You've had a couple of Top 5s here, and good luck to you the rest of the week. Looks like you got a good one going.
 BEN CURTIS: All right. Appreciate it.
