 Q. How difficult is it to try to come out tomorrow and try to do 36 holes in a Major Championship?
 BEN CURTIS: Well it's going to be more exhausting than anything. I think that every one of us can play, we can play 36 holes. 
 It's just going to be a long day and whoever keeps their composure and keeps their, obviously the guys that finished today that played well will have a nice relaxing morning while we're out there grinding. It's going to be tough for us, but it can be done. 

 Q. I heard a lot of people saying that they needed to water the greens more and more, is this kind of like a godsend getting all this rain?
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, but I imagine it hasn't rained enough to where it's going to be -- it's still going to be firm out there, it's not like it's going to be soft and wet. 
 I'm sure by morning it will obviously be a little bit softer in the morning, but by afternoon it will be firm again.

 Q. Is it kind of easy to bring the momentum from yesterday, but now you don't get to carry it over to today, but to tomorrow?
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, it can be done. I'm a believer in big momentum in one day, not necessarily for three or four days at a time.
