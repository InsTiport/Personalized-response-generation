 Q. Talk about the day?
 BEN CURTIS: It was a good day. Obviously to shoot under par on this golf course, you have to feel pretty good. It was tightly bunched, and was able to get it to 8-under at one point, and just didn't finish the way I wanted to. 
 I hit a great second shot and thought it would release a little bit more and obviously wanted to hit one less club and take a little something off that 8-iron there and tried to chip it and run it up there through the green. Yeah, I was looking for a little magic there. Would have been nice to make the putt there, but it's a tough hole. So any time you make par on that hole, you should be happy. 

 Q. The back nine, I don't know how much you were paying attention, but when you see all of the guys within a shot or two, what's that like for you?
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, it's fun. It's fun to know, 6-under through the turn, you shoot a couple under, you never know what's going to happen, and especially as difficult as it's playing with the wind picking up a little bit and the firmness and quickness of these greens. 
 I mean, you've just got to take advantage of the opportunities you're given. I was driving it straight so I gave myself a lot of good chances to make birdies. 

 Q. Now you have to just sit around and keep yourself warm?
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, see what -- I think Sutherland is on 17, so if he makes birdie, he'll get to 9. It's not looking good right now, but you never know.
