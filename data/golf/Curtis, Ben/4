Q.   I was sitting near the 11th tee and I saw Carl Pettersson go, hey, look at that ball rolling right there and it was your ball rolling at 11.   Do you want to take us through it? 
BEN CURTIS:   Yeah, I hit it 25, 30 feet left of the pin and we were walking halfway down and my caddie said, hey, your ball is moving, and it rolled about another five feet. 
We get over, Mark hits his putt and I get over mine, my hat was going to blow off and I turned it around backwards and still going to blow off.   
             So gave it to Mark's caddie and I get over it for the third time and this time I see it's going to move and it started to move a foot, two feet, three feet and just started picking up pace and off the green it went, 25 feet or so. 
Then we called the officials over, just to let them know, nothing more so than, hey, what are we doing out here, the ball is moving this far.   Then chipped up 15 feet past the hole and 4‑putt for the second time in two holes (laughing).

Q.   Hit both greens in regulation. 
BEN CURTIS:   Both greens in regulation and I'm 5‑over par.   The only thing you can do is laugh.   We had to at least try because you never know. 

Q.   That's the point I want to make.   9 worst of it happened to you and you're the one that's like, hey, we are trying to get this done for the sponsors and for the PGA TOUR. 
BEN CURTIS:   Exactly.   We all want to play.   It's not like we all want to sit around and watch the sun bake the course out and have a good laugh.   We want to be out here playing and try to get a tournament in and try to get a champion.
