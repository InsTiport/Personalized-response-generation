BEN CURTIS:  I didn't hit the ball very good yesterday and got away with it.  Today I didn't get away with it.  It's just one of the those rounds, you know, you wish you don't have when you have them.  You've just got to look forward to tomorrow.  You can't dwell on it.  You have to go out there and try to shoot a good number tomorrow.
Q.   Is it really different playing in the final group on the weekend?
BEN CURTIS:  It felt really good.  It's just one of those things with the wind.  You still have to go out there and hit good shots and I didn't do that.  I had a couple of 3 putts that maybe if I'd made par on those it would have been a different story.
Q.   That was another chip in at 11, wasn't it?
BEN CURTIS:  Yeah, for par.  You can do all kinds of stuff to make par, but I was looking at 6, 7 and 8    I doubled 17.
Q.   Did you hit it in the marsh?
BEN CURTIS:  No, actually, I hit it to the right of the green.
Q.   You said basically you holed three shots yesterday, you only holed one today.  Were you further up the score board than maybe you should have been going into today?
BEN CURTIS:  Well, I did a lot of good things, too.  I hit a lot of good putts.  Every shot that I made, it wasn't just luck, it was good, too.  If you were lucky and it hit a tree and it bounced funny and it went in the hole.  But they were all good shots.  So I felt like those were deserved.
Q.   (Inaudible)
BEN CURTIS:  I was just trying to go out there and trying to play solid golf.  I thought if I could get a couple of birdies and get a couple under I'd be more comfortable, but I didn't hit the ball very good off the tee.
