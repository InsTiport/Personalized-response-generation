BEN CURTIS:  For nine holes, it wasn't too bad.  Then it started picking up on the Back 9.  Yeah, it was good to get off to a good start, take a little pressure off myself.

When I made the turn, I was only 1 under.  Just felt good about the game.  I just started making the putts.
Q.  Do you think this could hold up as the best round of the day?
BEN CURTIS:  You know, someone will probably do well.  Someone will probably shoot a good number.  It's still soft out there.  You can still fly it right at the pins and take advantage of it.

You know, I played really well, so hopefully it will continue over the weekend.
Q.  Puts you into contention.
BEN CURTIS:  Yeah, tomorrow got to go out there and play well again.  You know, probably have to keep making birdies.  Someone's going to play well.  Guys out here are so good, you've got to expect that.  Hopefully I can keep it up.
