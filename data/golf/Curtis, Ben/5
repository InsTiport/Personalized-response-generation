Q.   67 today, how do you feel, pretty good? 
BEN CURTIS:   Yeah, I didn't play good on the last nine holes really but made a couple good saves.   You know, it's starting to get a little windy and tough out there.   But yeah, just played extremely well and putted well. 

Q.   You went out in 32 and birdied two of the first three holes, what sort of momentum did that give you going out?
BEN CURTIS:   Obviously it gave me some confidence.   It's playing‑‑ that back nine is a tough nine.   So you just feel like you get through there 1‑under, you can post a score on the front.   But obviously played extremely well on the back and made some good birdies and made some good putts and just had a good tempo on the swing all day.

Q.   Overall impression of Kiawah and the PGA Championship and the whole tournament?
BEN CURTIS:   It was a bit weird today finishing on the front and finishing Top‑20 in a major and having zero people out there watching you.   On the front nine, we were following the lead group.   (Laughing).
But yeah, it's a great course.   It's extremely tough and you have to be really precise, especially on a day like Friday when the wind was blowing really hard, it played extremely tough.   The first round and yesterday and today, the course played like it should. 

Q.   Some low scores out there today?
BEN CURTIS:   Yeah, I think so.   The wind is blowing in a favorable way, and some of the pins, even though they are tough, you can get down to them pretty easily.
