BEN CURTIS:  There are only a few guys with a chance to win so it could be a big thing.
Q.
Does this make it easier or harder when you have to come back and try to win?
BEN CURTIS:  Well, it depends. If you're playing well, you'd rather keep on playing.  If you're playing bad like I was, it's probably a good thing to get a night to rest.  If you're sitting on the lead it would be tough, but if you're a couple back, it could be good.

Q.
So it's a good thing for you?
BEN CURTIS:  Oh, it is.  I'm just trying to get a solid finish in tomorrow and get a respectable tournament.

Q.
How much did the course change overnight?  Did you see the change over the days with the weather and now the rain?
BEN CURTIS:  Yeah, the rain tonight, if it gets soft on the last couple of holes, it plays really long.  You know, it's just toward it was real windy and tough to judge everything.  It was pretty tough.  I mean, when you hit it something like that, it's going to make it even tougher, and the scores guys are shooting, it's tough.
