  Q. Solid playing. 68 out there today, especially after the double bogey at 6.   
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, I know. I got probably too aggressive there. I was trying to aim left of it, and maybe the last minute tried to go at it. But I played extremely well. Been playing well all week and hitting irons really good.  
  
  Q. After the excitement of last week you seem to be holding up pretty good.   
 BEN CURTIS: Yeah, I'm doing well. I think just getting a lot of rest and sleep at the hotel. We don't have to get up early, so that's nice. That makes it easy.  
  
  Q. The leaders really aren't running away from you. Right now five shots out of the lead. Any game plan for tomorrow?  
 BEN CURTIS: No, just keep doing what I've been doing. If it's good enough to win that would be great, but I'm not going to try to push it to 5-under tomorrow. It's an extremely tough course, and the next thing you know you'll be shooting 75.
