 Q. Can you tell us about what you saw with Henrik yesterday. 
 BEN CURTIS: Well, hit it over on the right-hand side and Henrik obviously hit it way left. We were watching him and he was out there by the water and next thing you know, I said, well, we'll just go because they will be a while. 
 I went ahead and hit and we were standing there talking because he was going to wait on him, I saw him go about a hundred yards in front of us figuring out where he was going to lay up. 
 So he's getting ready to go and he's flicking up the wind and I said, hey, you might want to stop because he's taking off his clothes over here. He had his shirt off and he stood there for a minute or two, and he finally just pulled his pants off. I was like, wow, I've never seen that before. 
 Obviously a lot of people are cheering for him that he took his clothes off, and then next thing you know, he hit it and just took about -- well, he's in his underwear for a good five minutes, I would say. So it was a long time -- if it was me, I would have been off and on real quick. It's just something you don't see every day, and he was brave enough to do it. I don't know if most guys would be able to do that. 

 Q. If you would have taken your pants off? 
 BEN CURTIS: The crowd? They would probably laugh.
