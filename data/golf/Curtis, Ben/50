  Q. What was the key to the round today?  
 BEN CURTIS: I drove it pretty straight. I don't know how many fairways I hit, but even if I missed the fairway it was just in the first cut or in the bunker. But I had a good shot to the green.   
 Didn't have any 3-putts today. Yesterday I had three 3-putts and that's what's been killing me lately. To be able to go out there and not have any on this golf course is a good feeling.  
  
  Q. When you're able to handle it like you have been, and so many people are struggling, when you're out there, does that help you when you're going so well?  
 BEN CURTIS: Not really. As a player you expect to do well. I have high expectations for myself. And I don't like to do -- I hate 3-putting, that's the worst feeling in the world. So to get rid of those out here on this course, and you hit the ball fairly decent, you can shoot a good number.   
  
  Q. What's the deal with you and Majors; we always see you on the Major leaderboard?  
 BEN CURTIS: I love Majors. I think that I try to suit my game around that. Obviously it's the four toughest tests we're going to have all year. And I just feel that I'm fairly straight driver of the golf ball, so if I can keep it in play, then it all comes down to putting.
