Q.
Ben, what was the day like at the start of the day when you teed off?

BEN CURTIS:  I felt pretty good actually.  I was relaxed and just out there having fun.  You know, I'm just excited for tonight and tomorrow, so I'm just -- I wasn't really trying to worry about it, just go out there and have fun and try to play golf and now I can worry about it.


Q.  Is it on your mind at all?

BEN CURTIS:  Yeah, of course, but not as much as I thought it would be, but once you get out there -- this morning it was on my mind a lot more than than it was when I was out there.


Q.  Did you hear those kids singing?

BEN CURTIS:  Yeah.


Q.  You were standing over there making the putt thinking this is my last putt as a single man?

BEN CURTIS:  No, I'm not worried about that at all.  Life won't change, it'll just be a certificate, that's about it.


Q.  What's it like listening to all those fans telling you good luck?  They're not necessarily talking about your game. 

BEN CURTIS:  You just pretty much ignore them and go about my business and not really worry about it.  You're going to have those comments.  I'm just out there having fun and just doing my business.


Q.  Do you have your tux here?

BEN CURTIS:  No.


Q.  (Inaudible). 

BEN CURTIS:  A little bit.  Once you get in a groove you forget about everyday life when you're out there.
