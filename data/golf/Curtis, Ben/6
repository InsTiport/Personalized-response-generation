Q.   Can you talk about your day, 3‑under out there?
BEN CURTIS:   Well, I played solid.   Didn't get myself in any trouble.   I think I only missed two or three greens, and even those were not two terribly tough up‑and‑downs.   I just played a lot of solid golf, and you know, putted decent, as well.   Had some opportunities where I missed, but overall, I played well. 

Q.   The three birdies and a lot of pars out there today?
BEN CURTIS:   It was.   It's a tough course even though it's calm and receptive, you've still got to be careful and still hit good shots.   The thing is around here, just give yourself chances to make birdies and that's all you can do. 

Q.   The wind seemed to pick up after finishing your round; how did that affect you? 
BEN CURTIS:   You've just got to be more careful than anything.   Just got to keep focusing on that target and make good swings and that's what I was trying to do.
