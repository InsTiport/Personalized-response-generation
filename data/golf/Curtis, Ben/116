BEN CURTIS:  John Merrick and Justin Bolli.

BEN CURTIS:  Yeah, the first match, I was up pretty much the whole time.  And then we just stayed pretty steady all day.  We jumped up and down.  He won a hole; I won a hole.  It went back and forth.  But I mainly stayed 3 to 2-up.  The second match, I was 2-up early, and then we were all square after 11 holes.  And it pretty much stayed right there until the end.  And I parred 17 to go 1-up, to go on the last hole, which was a big relief, knowing that you can afford a slight mistake.  But not really, because all --

BEN CURTIS:  In the Western Amateur two weeks ago, I finished 4th in qualifying, and lost first round.  But nothing to this caliber.  I've been playing pretty well all summer.  I played really well this week so far.

BEN CURTIS:  I'm hitting the ball actually better this week.  I started off with just a hot putter and that was it.  But now it's basically hitting it pretty well.


Q.  Both rounds 2-1?

BEN CURTIS:  Well, the first one was 2-1, and the second one was 2-up.
