TODD BUDNICK:  Since the British Open you played four times and your best finish was at Deutche Bank.  Has it been perhaps the change, the pressure?  Have you had enough time to continue to work on your golf game?  Do you feel it's where it was a couple of weeks ago, a couple months ago?

BEN CURTIS:   Not really.  I think there was a lot of time demand.  It was hard to get out there and practice, especially with the wedding and stuff.  That was a big part of it.  The last couple of weeks I've had some time.  It's slowly coming around.  Hopefully the next few weeks it will get better.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   Well, I think just, you know, coming from where I came from, all of a sudden to be put in that position was very dramatic.  You went from pretty much a no-name to where everybody knew who you were now.  It's been a lot of fun and I enjoy it, and I look forward to the future, to go out there and play golf and not really worry about anything.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   It was very good.  France is a little different than England, but the fans were great, so I had a good time over there.  It was very nice.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   There just wasn't as many there, as in England.  They were very receptive and very warming.  It was a good time.  It's obviously different than here, but they're great.  The course was just like every other course here in America, maybe not as long as most of our courses, but it was a good course.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   Well, I just try not to worry about which events you win and which events you don't win.  I just try to go out there and play golf.  I'm not a real high goal-setter.  I just try to go out there and improve each week.  That's my goal, to obviously win each week, but to go out and improve my game.  When I get a chance to win again, I'll feel like I'm better prepared.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   I just think the more chances you get in that position, the better off you'll be.  Obviously I look back on it, I'm very critical on myself.  I wish I didn't make bogeys, but at the same time I knew everybody else was.  I just try to go out there, so maybe next time when I get in that position, I won't make those mistakes, I'll make pars and birdies.  It's the British Open, it doesn't matter what you make, you can always be in it, as long as your close.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   I've never been the one to shoot real low.  There are occasional weeks when I shoot 15 to 20 under par.  For the most part, I'm a grinder, so I just try to shoot the best I can, but a lot of times it's even par.  That's just the way it goes.  I'm trying to get better where I shoot those lower numbers, but obviously it doesn't change overnight.  You've got to work on some things.  In a couple of years, it will get better.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   It depends on the event.  Some weeks, it's 10 under par to win and I could easily shoot 10 under par, but sometimes you get to 20 under par.  Even on the easy golf courses, it's not easy to do.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   There's been some out there, but I've been loyal to the people, Titleist.  I'm going to stay loyal with them for now.  Next year and the years after that, we'll see what happens.


Q.  (Inaudible.)

BEN CURTIS:   Quite a bit.  Obviously it's very important to me, talking a lot about the game.  Out there you're travelling with your buddies and you're playing 36 holes a day.  It's a lot different than it is here, where you're playing one day at a time 18 holes.  You travel by yourself or with your family.  It's a lot different.  But I'm saying college, the competition is very good, especially at the level we play.  That had a big part in where I'm at. 


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   It's close to home and it fit in with my schedule.  Any time you can play within driving distance of your home, it's a good feeling.  You can be home in three or four hours.  It's comforting for me.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   I can see that, but it looks like it's in good shape from just walking up here.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Every Tour event they've got good courses.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   Obviously those are great, but I think knowing you can pretty much choose when you want to play.  I think it's easier for me because you know where you're going to be playing next.  You don't have to sit around and say when can I play next.  Going into the Open, that's what it was like.  Obviously that's a big perk.  And obviously to travel and see the world, that's great, too.


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   Hopefully by the end of the year it won't be.  A few more good finishes and maybe a win.  We'll see.  Right now I look -- other than the British Open, my game has been so-so, but there's been times where it's good. 


Q.  (Inaudible)

BEN CURTIS:   Just my mom and dad and my brother might come, and then my wife's parents.  That's about all we need.
