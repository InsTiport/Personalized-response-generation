Q. How do you feel about your round today?FRED FUNK: I played good today.  I hit the ball really good and gave myself a lot of chances.  Unfortunately, I didn't make many of them.  No bogeys was good.  I'm real pleased with that.  So good.Q. What was the key to the no bogeys today for you?FRED FUNK: I didn't get in trouble very often.  The only time, 16,  I was over the green there, and I hit a couple putts where I had to worry about the second putt a little bit.  But I never really had too many issues with being scared of making a bogey.Q. Greens playing a little differently?FRED FUNK: They're getting a lot firmer, and they're a lot quicker than they were in the practice rounds.  They're getting a little crusty.  But it's funny, they still make a pretty good ball mark, but they still release a lot.Q. How else is the course playing differently?FRED FUNK: Fairways are firmer, and they're running out a little bit.  So it's getting a little faster.  Setup is really good.  You just got to stay out of the rough. I've been struggling with a bad elbow, and I hit it in the rough on 4, the par 5, and I just gouged, tried to hit a hybrid out, and the club just stopped, and everything went right through me, my elbow.  The rest of the day, it was really sore. So I've got to get that remedy tomorrow.  It's really hurt.  It's a transition.  So I got through that.  Overall, I hit the ball really good.  I wish I made a couple more opportunities.  I could have had an easy 66 out of it.  68 was good, though.Q. Feeling good going into the weekend?FRED FUNK: Yeah, I found something in Boston the last two days there.  And I've really been struggling with my game, and in Boston, I was finally seeing something happen, and I got here, and it was still here.  Or at home, it was good.  I got here, and it's just getting better every day.  So I'm pleased with that.
