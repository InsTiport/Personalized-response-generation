  Q. You're a popular guy. You came down with the flat-bellies this week.   
 FRED FUNK: Yeah, I still like playing out here. I'm playing in the next four out of five out here, and then I'll finish mostly on the Champions Tour. You're talking to a guy that's pretty confused on where to play, but this week I love this golf course and that's why I'm here.  
  
  Q. You can't be confused with a 66 on the golf course, though. You do have that figured out. What was working today?   
 FRED FUNK: I just played real steady and didn't make any mistakes until the last hole, actually had about an eight-footer to go to 64 and I three-putted. It was a little disappointing on the last hole, but other than that, I played real solid. I didn't make any -- the whole goal was not to make any mistakes, and I didn't until the last hole. I just hit my first putt a little hard and it lipped out and went down and I missed a short one coming back.   
 I'm pretty pleased. I'm real disappointed with the way I finished on the last hole, but that happens.   
  
  Q. Any different mindset out here on the PGA TOUR instead of the Champions Tour?  
 FRED FUNK: No, competition is competition. You've just got to go out and play your best and you've got to play good on both tours.   
 The biggest difference out on the Champions Tour, most of the events are three rounds and they start on Friday and no cut, and you've just got to go hard right out of the gate. You really can't afford a bad round out there, not that you can afford one here. But you can come back in four rounds. You can have a stretch of a few bad holes and still have time to come back.
