Q.   Fred, we were just watching your birdie putts at 17 and 18.   After the double at 10, how important was it for you to regroup quickly and get this round back in gear? 
FRED FUNK:   It was pretty important.   I was actually feeling a lot of heat.   I left my tee shot way short on 11.   Right after that, then I left the putt like seven feet short going up the hill. 
I was stewing over that one because I knew I needed to get something back, and I didn't want to go double bogey, bogey like that.   That kind of straightened me out. 
I just was relaxed, and I was playing good.   To make that putt on 18 was bonus.   Having that good finish was great.   I made a great par putt on 15 after a bad wedge up there and getting up and down. 
But it felt really good to do that.   At least it kept me in the game.

Q.   You know what it's like to win a championship like this.   You're going to enter the final round two shots back.   You were just asking, am I going to be in the final group or Kenny Perry?   It will be Kenny.   You'll be in the penultimate group.   Does it matter which group you're in even though you're two shots back along with Kenny? 
FRED FUNK:   No, I think it's computer matched.   You got Mikey and Kenny.

Q.   Does it matter to you? 
FRED FUNK:   It doesn't matter to me.   I love playing with Corey.   Corey and I can hit the little pea shooters, and they hit the long bombs.   The problem is we have to walk 50 or 60 yards before they can hit.   It was a great round that Corey had today, great round that Kenny had. 
The fact that Mike didn't take off, he just gave everybody a chance. 

Q.   Certainly have a chance tomorrow. 
FRED FUNK:   Thanks.
