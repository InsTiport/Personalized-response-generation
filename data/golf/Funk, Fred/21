 Q.   Talk about your round.   I know you had birdies on 2 and 8 coming in.   
FRED FUNK:   Yeah.   Yeah.   2 and 8.   I was struggling today.   I had ‑‑ I got vertigo when I got here and I'm really spinning and not feeling good and I just gutted it out.   So I was pretty sloppy today.   
   
 Q.   Big difference in the way the course played today versus yesterday?  
FRED FUNK:   Yeah, it's a lot dryer.   It's playing great.   Really good.   Had a couple really good pins out there and considering it all I played really well.   I missed a lot of putts and I hit a couple sloppy shots here and there, but overall I guess I was lucky to play, the way I felt.   So this is twice this year I've had vertigo and I don't know what the deal is.   It's hard to play when you're dizzy.   It's hard to play when you're healthy.   
   
 Q.   How about last thoughts for tomorrow?  
FRED FUNK:   I just, if can I start feeling better, I'm playing good, I'm just, I have to shoot a couple of those 5‑under rounds or better each round to get back in there, like Kenny and Russ did.   I think they're calling for pretty good weather.   So today was perfect, so.   I just got to go low.
