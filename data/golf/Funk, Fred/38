  Q. What did you do to improve your game on the back nine to do so well?  
 FRED FUNK: I just didn't hit -- I hit a good shot on 3 and turned that into a bogey. I just misjudged the wind and the shot.   
 And then 5 I hit a really bad second shot. It went into the bushes. And I made double there. So I'm behind the eight ball right there.   
 And I'm playing good, I'm hitting the ball good, I'm just trying to just not think behind, think ahead and think of the shot at hand. And I did it two days in a row, I've been really good with my mental game and that's what I'm trying to be focused on right now.   
  
  Q. How does it feel to play in such a competitive group?  
 FRED FUNK: Oh, it's great. You got to love that. I love playing with Tiger when I get out there. Freddie's atmosphere, when I got paired with Mickelson, back in the day Arnold Palmer, it was always a great atmosphere to be in when we were lucky enough to be paired with them.
