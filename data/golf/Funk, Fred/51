   THE MODERATOR: Well, how about your day.
 FRED FUNK: I'm here.

 Q. Can you sum up the round?
 FRED FUNK: I played extremely good today. I hit the ball really good. And really felt like I could have shot a lot better today, but I'm pleased overall. I'm really pleased with my ball striking. I wish I had that all last week, especially Saturday. 
 But drove the ball extremely well, didn't miss a fairway. That's always good. Made a couple nice up and downs but I gave a couple away. I made some poor bogies on a couple holes. But overall it was a real solid round.

 Q. When you saw the 66s posted, did you think you needed something under par?
 FRED FUNK: Definitely. Yeah. I saw that the course was apparently giving up some good scores, so it changed my opinion how the course might play. Got out there and there were a lot of opportunities. Same thing as if you hit the -- you know what I was thinking yesterday: Keep it out of the rough, you set up a lot of opportunities.

 Q. How about the reception from the crowds out there, what did you think about the size?
 FRED FUNK: The crowds are fantastic. That's really great to see. Last year at Broadmoor it was fantastic. We played at -- Prairie Dunes was my debut and that was fantastic. All this week, even in the practice rounds, the crowds have been a lot more than I expected, or anyone expected, I think. It's great thing. Come see the old guys.
