  =FRED FUNK:   It was good and fun to play as solid as I did.   Especially early on I played really good that front stretch and hit some empty shots and wind came up the last four or five holes, and you know, we turned into it on 15.   Played pretty tough on 15, 17, 18‑‑ well, 15 is a par 5, but 17, 18 were pretty tough holes. 
So you know, it feels good, yeah. 

Q.   And it looked like on 18, it looked like that putt was going to fall?
FRED FUNK:   I didn't know which way it was going, so we just ended up playing it straight.   Looked left‑to‑right on one ride and right‑to‑left on the other, so just said, hit it straight and at the very end it lost speed and broke left. 

Q.   Good playing and no bogeys?
FRED FUNK:   Yeah, hit the ball really good the last two days.   Technically only missed one green in two days.   Yesterday only missed one.   I played really good.   I'm hitting the irons good and I'm driving it okay.   Give myself a lot of chances and really happy where I am with my game.   I like the golf course.   I've always played it good but I like coming here because it's a pretty difficult golf course and I like hard golf courses.   So when you're playing well, you try to get a little separation, although we are not too separated on the board right now.
