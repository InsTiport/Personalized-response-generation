Q.   Talk about your round today.  I know obviously you would have liked to have won, but you had 9 under at the end of the day, just right there.
FRED FUNK:  Yeah, I gave it away.  On 12 I thought I had a shot, but on 13 and 14     I got kind of lucky on 15 and then 16.  There was just a stretch of holes there that just kind of gave the tournament away and it's pretty disappointing, but oh, well, that's why they make you play 72, in this case 73.
