Q.
It must feel good to come back?
FRED FUNK:  Yeah, it was great.  I put a lot of pressure on myself because I wanted to play well, and the golf course played extremely hard on the weekend.  Disappointing scores on the weekend.  But I think a lot of guys had disappointing scores on the weekend.  It just shows how tough it is out here, and if you're a little bit off, it's really tough to score.
Q.  (Inaudible).
FRED FUNK:  I don't know if you're right at the 15th, I don't know if it will hold up it was a little disappointing.  I had an unusual day today.  My putter went south really the middle of the second round and all day yesterday.  Today my putter was lightning hot and I couldn't hit a ball solid to save my life.  Ridiculously good putting today and I just couldn't hit any good shots.  It was really    I guess you never know what you're going to get out here.
Q.  Has anybody ever had more fun defending a tournament championship than you?
FRED FUNK:  I don't know, I never asked anybody.  Well, being a local guy and this big a tournament I think it's pretty neat.  The only tournaments that would be bigger than these    bigger than this one is the majors, and usually they're not home events for anybody.  They move them every year.  Unless you're winning Augusta, I guess.  Larry Mize winning there had to be pretty special.
Q.  What do you think about what Ames is doing out here, he's 9 under?
FRED FUNK:  I saw him double 10, and he was walking in the park there if he doesn't make that double.  Now it's wide open because there's really some tough pins.  I putted off the green from the wrong side of the hole on 12 and 13 is treacherous, and 14 and 15 aren't easy.  And who knows on 17 and 18.  There's a lot of golf to be played and you never know.
