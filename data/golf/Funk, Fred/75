  Q. How did the rain delay affect you?   
 FRED FUNK: I played good when I came back out, so it was good.   
 I had this function; I'm going to the White House to President Bush's birthday and Fourth of July, and we did it last year and I don't want to miss it.   
 So we didn't want to have that, but we're going to get out of here right away and go.   
  
  Q. How did you play today compared to yesterday?  
 FRED FUNK: I'm playing good. The further and deeper I'm getting into the tournament, the better I'm hitting.  
 I didn't hit the irons quite as good as yesterday but I hit the driver a little better today and I putted a little better, so I'm pleased, overall, with where my game is coming and where my head is. The biggest thing is where my head is right now. I've got to get it out of and back up above the ground and it's doing real well right now.   
  
  Q. Do you expect the President to give you any tips for the weekend?   
 FRED FUNK: No. When he's done his term, he said he's ready to go play some golf. He said he won't play golf right now, last year, as long as he has troops in harms way. So he doesn't play at all right now but he loves to play golf, and he said when he's done, he's going to play a lot.
