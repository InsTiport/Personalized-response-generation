Q.   Compare and contrast the front nine, back nine today. 
FRED FUNK:   Oh, I just had a bad finish, bogeyed the last three holes.   It doesn't feel very good.   I was grinding all day trying to hold the round together and just let it go at the end.   So it was disappointing.

Q.   Adjustments for tomorrow or were there just some factors that you can't control?
FRED FUNK:   Well I hit a really good shot on 8 and got in a bad spot and hit it as good as I can hit it. 
And was in a bad spot on 9, I hit a drive, missed the fairway by a yard and it buried.   So I didn't have a shot there. 
So I was a little off here and there, but it's easy to be a little off.
