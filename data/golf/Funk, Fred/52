  Q. A couple thoughts about the day?   
 FRED FUNK: Well, I played a lot better today. I had a lot of opportunities all day that I didn't really capitalise on, and then I didn't make my birdie after a good drive on 14, which you almost have to, and then I hit it close on 16. Anyway, it just wasn't enough.   
 It's disappointing because I played good. Yesterday, I don't know what was wrong with me. Everything was wrong yesterday.   
 Today I'm proud of the way I played overall. Just disappointed, to be so close and wanting to have my qualifier for the St. Andrews next year, so I missed out.   
  
  Q. Your putt at 18 in the playoff looked like it was going.   
 FRED FUNK: Yeah, a little too hard. A tough putt, the pin is on a ridge there, big breaker. I hit a good putt, I was far away and hit it hard and didn't want to leave it short.  
  
  Q. How far was the putt?  
 FRED FUNK: Probably 25, 30 feet.  
  
  Q. Your putt at 16 in regulation?   
 FRED FUNK: Probably only about eight, ten feet.
