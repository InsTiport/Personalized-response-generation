Q. 1-under today, played very well.FRED FUNK: I played really sloppy on the front.  I played pretty good on the back.  The back nine I played better, and still made a couple good up-and-downs and missed a couple good opportunities.  I'm not bitchin'.  Especially first three holes on even par, missed all three greens. Made bogey on 1 with a fried egg on the greens side and chipped in on 2, which was a hard chip in coming up over the slope.  3 I got up and down.  Okay.  Here we go.  Pleased overall.Q. What do you think the rain this morning did to slow the greens down or anything like that?FRED FUNK: Well, the greens -- it's been soft all week.  With this heat I think they're going to keep the greens pretty -- I'm sure they can get them a little firmer.  They don't want to lose them, at the same time.  Hopefully won't get as hard as this floor.  Otherwise they will be unplayable out there.  It will be a joke. It's a diabolical golf course.  It's really, really hard if you're a little off.  You don't have to be very far off to be considered way off.  It's a penal golf course.  You have to control your golfing.  I hope the greens stay a little soft.
