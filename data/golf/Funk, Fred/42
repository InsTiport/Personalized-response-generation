  Q. How conscious were you of the cut line?  
 FRED FUNK: Oh, very, the whole day. Yeah, I played pretty good on the front, and I went to the claw today to try to remedy my putting or fix it, and I putted pretty good the first seven holes and I missed a little one on 8 and 9, and it put me behind the 8-ball going down the back nine and then I made some great putts on the back nine. Just a scratch-and-claw round.   
 I'm real pleased. I thought it would be 2. I'm not sure, it's probably going to be 1, but a lot of people. But it felt really good to make -- I made a really clutch putt on 13 -- well, sheesh, on 11, 13 and 15 for par and then a long one on 16 and a nice two-putt on 18. So it was good.   
  
  Q. As a past winner and a home course guy, hometown, more special for you to make the cut here?  
 FRED FUNK: Well, this could be my last PLAYERS Championship, so I didn't want to go down the weekend without playing. Yeah, it meant a lot to me. You never want to miss the cut, especially at home. Last year I scratched and clawed and birdied three of the last four and made it on the number and then missed the Saturday cut. I don't want to do that tomorrow. I want to play good tomorrow and be around on Sunday.   
  
  Q. Who was the Mickelson autograph for?  
 FRED FUNK: It's the Funk's Punks party tonight at Bogey Grill for J.T. We raise money for him, so had to get it.
