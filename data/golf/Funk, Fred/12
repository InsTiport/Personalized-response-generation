Q.   Funk, in the Championship, you won four years ago.   Tell us about your thoughts on your performance this week and Kenny Perry's. 
FRED FUNK:   Well, he's‑‑ I do it all the time.

Q.   Here with 2009 U.S. Senior Open Champion, Fred Funk, runner‑up again in this Championship.   Are you satisfied with the week? 
FRED FUNK:   I'm very satisfied.   I was happier than   a ‑‑ whatever, a clam, whatever the saying is.   It just felt good to be able to play golf again.   I was able to swing, and I've been saying it all week, my body felt better, and all of a sudden, my swing came back, and it's just fun to be in the hunt again. 
This was just a great week.   Obviously, with my sponsorship with Mutual, it's like family.   I just had a great time.

Q.   You set the record margin of victory in this Championship four years ago.   Can you talk about Kenny Perry's win. 
FRED FUNK:   He put it to us.   6 under yesterday and 6, 7, whatever he was today.   Back‑to‑back, it's kind of what he did two weeks ago at Fox Chapel.   He just smoked the field on the weekend.   That's what you got to do.   He just lapped us.
He's driving the ball so good.   He's driving it monster long, but straight.   He hits that draw, and it's consistent play every time.   It's a chip and putt for him.

Q.   Good playing in this Championship, and good luck in the British Open.
