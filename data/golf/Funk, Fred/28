Q.   You're at 2 under for the Championship, still just a few back.   Talk about your position heading into the weekend. 
FRED FUNK:   Pitiful.   I had a 7 under and just self‑destructed coming in.   So it was just the worst stretch of golf I had in the last seven holes.   So it is what it is. 
I hit a 3 iron out of bounds on the worst shot I think I've ever hit in competition on 9.   Just kept going one shot after another.   Just was terrible.   Nothing really good to say.   Played great and then played awful.

Q.   Will you be able to take the great play early and channel that into your weekend play?   
FRED FUNK:   I don't know.   I really don't know.   I've been screwing up the weekend the last two tournaments, and I can't figure out why my swing is really good and then all of a sudden it just self‑destructs for a while.   That's just not like me.   All of a sudden, I can't hit a quality shot. 
I did it for seven holes coming in here, and I did it for nine holes at Pittsburgh, and there's a little spell I'm in right now is not very good.   So just was comfortable as could be at 7 under and rockin'.   Oh, well.

Q.   Thank you, appreciate it.
