 Q. Real quick about the day, pretty good, except you made a nice bogey at the last hole, I guess. 
 FRED FUNK: No. I made a double. Nothing nice about that.

 Q. No. 
 FRED FUNK: No, I played good. Just finished bad. That's all I can say.

 Q. What happened? Driver was pretty good. Just a little far back?
 FRED FUNK: No. I just batted the 5-iron in there and caught that tree. Kind of fat-pulled it. 
 I don't know. Just an uncomfortable hole for me, second shot.

 Q. You played pretty well up to that point, hadn't you?
 FRED FUNK: I played really well. Had some nice saves early, and played real solid. Didn't play as good as yesterday tee to green, but played really good.

 Q. Why is it an uncomfortable?
 FRED FUNK: I don't know. Just visually I don't like that second shot very much.

 Q. Okay. Thanks, Fred.
