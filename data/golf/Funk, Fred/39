  Q. What are some highlights of your round today?  
 FRED FUNK: I played pretty solid in spots. Probably the highlight was slamming it into the hole on 18, my ninth hole. And getting a couple birdies coming in was good to get my round back to even anyway. I kind of let it go there on about my 11 and 12, but it was 2 and 3. And it was a battle there, because you had some tough holes coming in with 4 and 5. I'm pleased with the way I finished the last six holes. I could have turned in a bad one.  
  
  Q. Can you describe some of those birdies?  
 FRED FUNK: I just said that I hit a -- I hit a 4-iron rescue or a hybrid into 18 and it was going right at it and I guess it one hopped into the flag and dropped about three feet away. So that was good.   
 1 I hit a really nice putt from about 15, 18 feet for birdie and made that.   
 And then I 2-putted on 7.   
 Hit a nice chip on 8, made a three, 4-footer there.   
 So, no, I made four birdies, could have made quite a few more on that one stretch where the course is really for the taking there, 13, 14, 15, 16, you got to get it in that stretch, I didn't get it there. But overall it was okay.   
  
  Q. Talk about the wind. What type of impact did that have on you?  
 FRED FUNK: It was great early and then probably about four holes into the round it started blowing pretty hard like it does every day here, seems like. And it's supposed to blow all week. But the later in the day the more it blows, until real late in the day and then it drops back down again. We'll actually have that tomorrow. We'll actually have a lot when we tee off and then late in the round it will be perfect. So I'm looking forward to it.
