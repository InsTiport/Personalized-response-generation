 Q. It wasn't the storybook finish you probably dreamed about, but sum up your emotions. 
 FRED FUNK: It was a fantastic two days. Unfortunately it was only two days. The crowd support was great. I just couldn't -- it went way beyond my expectations, playing here and coming back and just getting the support I had was fantastic. Every hole I felt like we were playing a practice round with Ernie and Jack at Augusta and both of them getting standing ovations on every hole, and I'm sitting back just watching. I kind of felt like that here today. It was really special. 
 You know, I really wanted to make the cut, but life goes on, and golf goes on. I'm pleased with the way I handled myself. I had a great time with my son. It was a very special week, and it would be better if I was walking the fairways on the weekends, but these two days were fantastic. All week was great, but these two days of competition was fun.
