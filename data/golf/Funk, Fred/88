  Q.  Low scores today.   
 FRED FUNK:  Yeah, we actually can't see a board until 14 or is a and realized he was 16-under and I thought so much for that.  I was just treading water.  I just couldn't get my putter to cooperate today.  I hit a lot of good putts that couldn't go in.  Overall I played real well and I'm real pleased with the way I'm playing.   
  
  Q.  The crowd loved you here.   
 FRED FUNK:  Yeah, I really enjoy here.  It's a great, great golf course and a great town.  They have always supported the tournament really well and I'm really happy.  Travelers is doing a really good job.  I know the players really enjoy it.  The players always enjoy the golf course.  I just hope this tournament keeps going, and it's great that it's back on the schedule that it's secure for a while.   
  
  Q.  It seems walking up 18 this time, for the last couple of years it hasn't been like that, but this time there was quite a crowd there?   
 FRED FUNK:  Yeah, we had great weather and great tournament, and Jay is playing well out there today and hopefully he'll pull it off.  Hopefully he didn't miss a shot but who knows what happened.   
 It's been a good week and I think the tournament is just going to get better and better as the years go on.
