FRED FUNK:  I can do it any time, I've just got to remember to do it.
Q.  Are you happy with that number today?
FRED FUNK:  I feel real good with that number.  Obviously I played real solid.  Any time you get off to that good of a start in this big a tournament, it's good.
Q.  A lot of guys were saying there's mud on the fairways.  Is the course playing okay?
FRED FUNK:  It's surprisingly dry for the amount of rain we had on Tuesday night and even yesterday it was.  I did have some mud and some of the guys in the early rounds probably had more.  I had about four balls that had a little bit of mud on it, one of them a lot of mud on it, and we weren't sure where it was going, but overall it's drained a lot better than I thought it would.
Q.  That number, and then you play in the morning tomorrow.  You've got to feel pretty confident.
FRED FUNK:  It's always good to get it going.  Obviously it's just a start.  It is a long week and a lot can happen out here.  Everybody knows that.  You're one shot away from birdie or a big number, so you never know.

But it's good to get off to a good start.  Hopefully I can keep it going.
Q.  You told me the other day that 17 makes your heart beat but today you stuck it.
FRED FUNK:  I stuck it good.  Last year I had the same pin on the first day and I made 7, so I had a five-shot swing on that one shot.  That was about the difference in the two rounds from last year and this year.
