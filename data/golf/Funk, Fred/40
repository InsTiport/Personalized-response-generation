   FRED FUNK: It was a great week, a disappointing day. I didn't want to have my last round at THE PLAYERS Championship be like this, but that's golf. So just nothing really went right.   
I hit the irons really poorly, and I putted really poorly today. So golf course was a different animal today, too. And I just never adjusted to it.  
  
  Q. Everyone's been saying it's been different. What did you find the difference to be out there?   
 FRED FUNK: The greens were just night and day different. They were four times harder and faster and drier. They were just so fast and firm that almost like frictionless greens. They didn't have any friction on them. Everything was so dry and toasty. So just totally different.   
 If you didn't have total control of your golf ball, you weren't going to play well today unless you were scrambling your butt off, which I wasn't doing. So I kind of got what I deserved today.  
  
  Q. Are you kind of sad this may be your last time playing here?   
 FRED FUNK: Yeah, it's a sad way to go out. Shoot 78, but I'm going to try to fight my way back. Maybe I'll win the Senior Players or something to get back in. But you never know, got to beat some guys. It's been a fun run. Got to come to an end at some time, so hopefully this isn't it, but we'll see.
