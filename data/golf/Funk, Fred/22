Q.   Can you give us a few of your initial comments about your round today?
FRED FUNK:   I played really good.   I actually got off to a start where, ball striking wise I gave myself a lot of chances the first four or five holes I was right there.   Well four holes.   I didn't make any of them. 
Then I made two really good up‑and‑down saves or par saves. 
That kind of got me spurred on a little bit. 
And then I didn't birdie 8 and then I birdied 9.   So of all the holes on the front nine I birdied the hardest one. 
10 was playing hard. 
So overall I really feel like I'm, I hate to use the term close, because a lot of people use that, but I really am.   I'm almost to the point where I can just let the swing go and not be thinking about it too much and play more reactive golf instead of conscious golf. 
If I can get to that stage, I just need to get the putter a little hot.   I gave myself a lot of opportunities and I didn't make some of them but at the same time I made some good par saves.   So overall I'm pretty pleased.
