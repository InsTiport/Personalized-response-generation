Q. Did it feel like a survival test out there today?
DANIELLE KANG:   Kind of.  I think it was a lot of rushing for us.  We were on the clock I think for over ten holes.  I haven't played on the clock for a long time.
And then there is rain, wind, grips are wet, and I'm trying to hit under 45 seconds.  I think it was a bit rough.
Golf course conditions are completely different than yesterday.  Yesterday I was hitting a 7-iron from 180; today I had to hit a 5 or a 4 and I couldn't really trust it.
I think that's the case with everybody in the afternoon today.
Q. What did you tell yourself after the three consecutive bogeys?
DANIELLE KANG:   I got three holes and I can get three shots back.  I knew that I was getting a little bit hasty, so I started walking a bit slower and just kind of calmed down a bit.  I knew that just I would have to give myself a birdie opportunity.
On 17 I had the exact same number I had on 15, and 15 I came up short and I got kind of scared so I kind of laid off on it.  I wanted to hit a club shorter as well.
Then on that hole I just ripped at it and gave myself a chance and made it.
Q. You're one of the lucky few to be able to be coached by Coach Harmon, arguably the best coach in the world, although you'd have a hard time trying to find somebody to argue that with you.  What will he tell you heading into tomorrow, do you think?
DANIELLE KANG:   He always tells me stay positive, stay aggressive, and trust my game.  We've worked on a lot of good things.  That's actually what I did the last few holes.  I knew that I did the best I could.  I'm not trying to make bogeys, but it happens.
If I keep hitting it the way I want to, I know opportunities will come.  So that's what I'm going to do tomorrow.
