 Q.  A 66 yesterday and even par round of 72 today.  What was the difference between the second round and the first for you?  
DANIELLE KANG: To be honest, today was a rough 72.  I don't know, nothing really felt like yesterday.   
Obviously yesterday was an easy 66, but I gave myself a lot of opportunities, yet everything was a little bit inconsistent.  I tried to play a draw and then I would pull-draw it, or if I tried to play a cut, it would push-cut or pull-cut.  I didn't know how to gauge it because it wasn't just quite tuned.   
A lot of my putts, I pulled it.  I pulled a lot of them for some reason and I'm trying not to pull them, which makes them pull more.   
 Q.  What are your strength, do you feel like, heading into the weekend and maybe some concerns you'd like to clean up?  
COACH KIRBY SMART: Well, it's golf, right.  Four days is a lot of golf to play.  I guess today was one of those off-days and yesterday was the day that everything comes together.  But I know what I'm capable of even if I'm playing bad, I know I can give myself opportunities.   
Sometimes you have to capitalise on them, and today I did on some I didn't and ended up being level.  So I'm just excited for the weekend.  I'm still right at the top of the leaderboard and it's exciting to be in the hunt playing for the British Women's Open.
