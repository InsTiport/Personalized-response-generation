Q. Just talk a little bit about your round today and what you were feeling out there on the course.
DANIELLE KANG: I played great today.  My ball striking felt amazing.  Golf course is playing really, really tough.  To shoot 3-under par in this condition, I'm very proud it of.  It was very tricky out there today.
Q. Did you have to adjust a little bit from some of the whether conditions possibly from yesterday?
DANIELLE KANG: Well, yeah.  It was a little bit windier, breezier, in the morning yesterday as, well but today was definitely gustier.  There was more wind than yesterday, and this morning was -- I don't know how windy it was this morning.
The scores, I haven't really looked at the scores, but I'm sure it was pretty high.  It was tough.  But I love the golf course conditions right now.  I love how great of a shape it's in, and playing like a major golf course.  The rough is really thick and long, so hard tee shots, tough second shots, and tough to putt.
Q. And if the whether continues like this for tomorrow, what's your mindset and how are you going to adjust for the weekend?
DANIELLE KANG: To be honest, I love the wind.  I don't know why I play really, really well -- actually, I do know.  Never mind.  Scratch that.  I love the wind.  I actually love the wind, so whenever there is a lot of wind blowing and it gets gustier, I feel like I could be a little more focused.
It helps me to plan out my game plan a little bit more.
