 Q.  Looked like a pretty steady 4-under round today.  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  How do you feel?  
DANIELLE KANG: Feel pretty good.  It's pretty hot outside.  I started off kind of slow.  Went over par until the 9th hole.  Then I was -- I just couldn't get the speed and read to marry each other.  Took me a little bit, but I had a really good -- I just wanted to have like a good momentum going on.  And then birdie on the 18th, which was my 9, got the ball rolling.   
After I saw some putts roll and then the first hole and second hole and then birdieing in, and I kept telling myself to give opportunities and, that's what I did on the back nine.   
 Q.  How do you deal with the heat and humidity?  I mean, it's part of the game, but how do you deal with it?  
DANIELLE KANG: I actually play well in heat.  I hate the heat.  I would live in Alaska if I could, to be honest with you.  I love the rain.   
I just have to keep drinking water.  I go to the bathroom every time I see one just so that -- you know, when you break the seal, quote/unquote, you have to keeping drink it.   
Make sure to eat, stay focused.  Make sure when you feel a little tired you have to catch yourself and then get back into your own zone.   
 Q.  Have to be really cognizant of what is going on in your own body, I would think.  
DANIELLE KANG: You have to be very aware of like what your mental and physical state is.  Usually during the adrenaline rushes you don't really feel any physical fatigue.  You feel it when you go, Oh, I'm tired.  You have to like kick yourself and go, Okay, wake up.
