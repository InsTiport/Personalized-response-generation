Q. Tell us about your round today.  Very positive moments.  You seem to be scrambling really well the last two days as well.
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, it's been kind of rough for two days.  Nothing has been really going my way.  I don't know.  I hit the ball well and then hit close and miss the putt, or I'm saving par from ridiculous places.
Definitely -- I don't know.  You just got to keep yourself in play.  It's very hot outside, so just trying to get myself just near the leaders.
Q. What do you do differently?  Talk us through the nutritional side of things, trying to hydrate properly in this heat.  Drink more water?  What do you do?
DANIELLE KANG: I have Airborne Vitamin C that I drink.  I eat way more than normal.  I make sure to hit every bathroom we see.  If I don't have to go to the bathroom I pretend I'm dehydrated and drink a lot during the round.
Just got to keep your energy up, definitely get rest, and know that it's a really long week.  Just keep yourself in play and give yourself a shot.
Q. Is it harder to stay patient in the heat?  Do you find yourself getting more aggravated at all or does it chill you out?
DANIELLE KANG: I like playing in the heat.  It chills me out.  I'm pretty not chill.  I'm really hyperactive.  I'm all over the place.  When it's this hot I have to calm down and take it step by step and breathe.  I'm just over on the side of the greens just breathing.
Q. You've logged some serious miles recently with UNICEF.  Talk us through that process.
DANIELLE KANG: I mean, if I'm going to brief UNICEF and my trip to Dominican Republic we are going to be here for an hour.  I had such an amazing time out there.  Definitely took me -- I left Friday night and I got here Monday afternoon.  It was a long trip.  I had a lot of layovers, but it was totally worth it.
I learned some things I could never learn by not going.  People at UNICEF are so welcoming.  I met a bunch of amazing people.  At the end of the day, just be happy, do the best you can, and whatever happens happens.
Q. Were you helping kids specifically down there?
DANIELLE KANG: I mean, we visited hospitals, visited care centers, visited childhood development centers.  We could go on.  See, he wants you to wrap it up.
Q. Good job.  You're in contention, and good job with the work off the course as well.
DANIELLE KANG: Cool.  Thank you so much.
