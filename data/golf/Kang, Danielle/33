  Q. Danielle, everywhere just seemed really dry out there today, making if difficult for some players to get underneath their ball for a lob shot or something.  How do you think today's course conditions changed your game, if it did at all?
 DANIELLE KANG:   The golf course was very firm today.  Definitely a different release on the greens.  I couldn't really get adjusted as easily as normal.  The wedges were either rolling out 18 yards some holes, and some holes it was only rolling out 2.  I couldn't really get the consistency of it.
 So I think that was the trouble.  When the greens dry up it's a little bit crispier and around the greens it didn't check as much.  So the golf course definitely changed from yesterday, or from Thursday to today.
 Q. And speaking of changes in the course conditions, how about your game?  Do you think any particular part of your game has changed since maybe round one on Thursday or even last week at Inverness?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I wouldn't say changed.  I don't think I played as clean today.  Still shot in the red; red numbers is always good.
 But, yeah, it just wasn't as clean.  The game was a bit sloppy today.
 Q. And then you still have 18 holes tomorrow.  Looks like you might be paired with friend, Lydia Ko.  Does that change your mentality at all or when you're out there are you just focused on you, yourself, and your game?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Well, we're out here playing a golf tournament, so it's going to be a really fun Sunday tomorrow and I'm excited.  Just got to chase her down a little bit because I think she's going to have a four-shot lead.
 Good start to the round will be helpful.
 Q. Does your mentality change at all or your approach to tomorrow's round change knowing you are four shots down?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Not really.  I'm a pretty aggressive player, and I think that keeping my foot on the gas and charging at pins is what I do.  I'm just going to have to keep that up -- especially that I'm a little bit behind and need to make up some ground.
 Q. Do you feel comfortable in the position that you're in, second place and being four shots back?  Are you happy with that?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Comparative to?
 Q. I don't know.  Compared to, I don't know.  Do you feel like you're in a good position to where you feel like you can still win tomorrow?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Well, we got 18 holes left tomorrow, so...
 Q. A very similar situation from last Saturday into Sunday, that top group, final group.  What are you going to draw on?  Anything from last Sunday to help you tomorrow?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Well, I think it's just kind of a different week.  Just having another opportunity to win this week is pretty cool.  I'm just really excited to play a Sunday round.
 It's a different golf course; different weather condition.  It's just different.  I am where I'm at, so I just got to play that last 18 holes and see where we end up.
 Q. With each round being so different, they be can be so different --
 DANIELLE KANG:   Uh-huh.
 Q. -- how exciting is it that tomorrow could be your round?  You just don't know.  It really could be your round.
 DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah, hopefully.  Every day is just -- just got to ride that momentum, and some days your game is all there and some days you just kind of have to make it work and you have new challenges every day.
 Today my challenge was to get it on the golf course and somehow shoot under par.  I think that was my goal, and I think walking away without as big of a damage as I thought I could have made today as a win for me today.
 Q. Do you talk at all with Lydia when you're out there on the course with her, or are you pretty just locked into your own game?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I haven't played with her this week.
 Q. I'm sorry.  I thought you were playing with her today.  My fault.
 DANIELLE KANG:   No.  I played with Maria Fassi today.
 Q. Will you talk with Lydia, I guess golfers, do you talk to your playing partner, or are you pretty locked into what you do?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I think every golfer is different.  I can't really speak for everybody, but, I mean, it really depends.  It's a twosome.  We kind of have to keep it moving.  The golf course pace gets a bit faster when it's a twosome.
 I always think to myself, I have a job to do, and it's hit the next shot.  Just got to go find that ball.
 Q. My final question is on round one, seemed that you chased a lot of birdies, and tomorrow what are you most looking forward to in terms of the course and the pin positions and all those birdie opportunities?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I'm really looking forward to some birdies tomorrow.  Hopefully they'll drop tomorrow.  Today was a little bit of a dry day, so I'm excited for that.  It'll be a good Sunday regardless how it is.  It's going to be a fun Sunday, and hope people tune in.
