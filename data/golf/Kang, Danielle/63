Q. How was your round today?
DANIELLE KANG: 7-under, bogey-free 7-under, I mean got to be happy with that any time, any given day.
Q. Yeah.
DANIELLE KANG: I don't know, just been working really hard on my game.  Putts dropped and I was striking the ball really well.  Didn't capitalize very well on the par-5s, but I felt that I kept sticking to my plan.
I'm just playing good.
Q. Are you thriving in the heat, do you feel like?
DANIELLE KANG: I love playing in the heat, but it's just will bit -- it's pretty hot right now.  I think mostly I play well it's because I'm trying to focus more on other the other things, like drinking water, going to the bathroom, keeping myself cool, eating.  All of that is just very crucial to play well in the heat.
Q. Yeah, day by day and also over the long run, too.
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, plus, I mean, you got to pace yourself.  I got to play Singapore too.  We're going to be in the heat for a long time.  It's snowing in the Vegas at the moment.
Q. How are you going to prepare for tomorrow?
DANIELLE KANG: Like I do every day.  You know, what my coach and I work on normally is that I'm not only preparing for this event, but for the year and the next events.  I still got to work on certain things.
Just do the same thing.  I don't want to say the same thing, but just go tune up the game and feel the rhythm.  Yeah, just warm up.  Actually I'm just going to go get a foot massage probably.
My caddie goes, Hey, you want to go to the range right now?  I go, Dude, I need to sit down first; 20 minutes.
Q. What are your 2019 goals?
DANIELLE KANG: One of my main goals this year was the fact that I wasn't going to base myself on results.  Sometimes like, how many top 10s do you have?  How many wins?
At the end of the day, I kind of just want to play good golf, and no matter what I do, I just want to be able to prepare and tee off every tournament the way I want to.  I think that's my goal, is to just not judge myself based on results.
Q. Yeah.  And stay healthy.
DANIELLE KANG: Exactly.  Be healthy and happy and you're good.
