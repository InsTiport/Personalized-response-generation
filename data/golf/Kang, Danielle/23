Q. Tough day for everyone.  Leaderboard going up-and-down, were you taking a look?
DANIELLE KANG:   Definitely.  I was definitely taking a look.  I even took my phone out to check where I was at on No. 12 after a bogey on 11.  A lot of leaders are moving backwards.  Unfortunately I finished one behind a finished score but I definitely made a good run.  Made some putts.  Finally some putts dropped coming in which I needed them.
Q. How well do you think you did on the greens today?
DANIELLE KANG:   I mean, a couple dropped in the back nine, but I'm having over 30 putts average this week.  So that's not very great.  But it's okay, it happens.  But I definitely finished well.  I mean, it was a good week, over, under.  Hit some great shot out there and I think I got a little bit of good feel for links for next week and it's going to be a good week next week.
Q. You've been playing some spectacular golf over the last three weeks.  What does it say going into the first major next week?
DANIELLE KANG:   Win, win and this tournament has got me, not just these last couple tournaments, I definitely played well in the last, even beginning of the year, I'm really excited to play finally the first major of the year.  Been looking forward to it and my caddie and Butch Harmon have been telling me I have to come here just to get used to links golf.  Hopefully this is a good little practice for next week.
Q. Was it kind of what you expected or was it some new challenges looking forward to next week?
DANIELLE KANG:   To be honest I'm really proud of how I handled the links-style golf, the way I hit the ball from tee-to-green was great.
I don't think it has to do much with links on the putting green, so -- in my opinion.  So I think next week, as much as getting used to the speed again, it's going to be a completely different green and different conditions.  But you're right.  I definitely was better at tee-to-green than I ever was at links, so really proud of how I'm playing.
