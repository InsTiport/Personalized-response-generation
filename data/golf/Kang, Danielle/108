Q.   You're 1‑under today; right?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yes.

Q.   What was the difference between this round and the other rounds?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yesterday? 

Q.   Yeah. 
DANIELLE KANG:   Today I was really in good pace.   It was a two some.   We were moving quickly, but my back hasn't been feeling it at all, so I've been just trying to hit shots so that ‑‑ how do I explain it?   I'm hitting it so it's like soft, and like I'm trying not to force it, and I was just ‑‑ every time I hit it, I'd just get a pain just shoot all my right side, so it was ridiculous.   That's all I thought about today was my pain.

Q.   How was the course with this type of weather, because you played in seemed like it was swirling winds the last few hours. 
DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah.   When you're playing in windy conditions and it's the U. S. Open people tend to kind of slow down a little bit, but we were ahead of time, and I don't know. 
You try to keep it under the wind kind of thing, but the greens are firm.   So I just tried to adjust to how much green I could work with or how much fringe I could work with.   I had a time at one point, though.

Q.   Are you satisfied with today's round?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah.   Except one hole I rushed really quickly because they said I was out of position.   I made a bogey, and it was just a very ‑‑ I made a bogey from 80 yards.   I don't even know what I did on that hole.   I just kept trying to not get a penalty, but I guess that was the penalty, trying to rush.
