 Q.  How does it feel to be a Major Champion winner?  
DANIELLE KANG: I feel fantastic, absolutely fantastic.   
 Q.  What do you think this does for your career?  
DANIELLE KANG: Having that Major Champion in my resumÃ©, I don't know what it will do.  But I do know that having the U.S. Amateur as majors, and having a major win, it's amazing.   
 Q.  You talked about how much this stressed you out this entire time.  
DANIELLE KANG: Of course it was stressful.  Every single shot was stressful.  Every putt was stressful.  I just kept trusting in my own game and trusting in my putting.  It's all about believing in what you can do.   
 Q.  How does it sound to say that "Danielle Kang is a Major Champion?"  
DANIELLE KANG: It feels pretty awesome.   
 Q.  Have you gotten in touch with your brother?  What did he say?  
DANIELLE KANG: He said, "You played good."  He was telling me, "Your putting was really great today and you were really solid."  He was just really proud.   
I was like, "Thank you for your help."  Alex is the one that I called to map out the golf course.  He's one of the people that I lean on for everything.   
 Q.  What do you think you will do to celebrate this win?  
DANIELLE KANG: He wants me to go to Vegas, and I am going to Vegas anyway because I live there.  But we'll see.  We'll have everyone get together.  We have the U.S. Open coming up in two weeks, and maybe after the U.S. Open we'll celebrate.  I'm sure Michelle wants to celebrate.
