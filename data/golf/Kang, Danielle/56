Q. Danielle, what did you think of your round today?
DANIELLE KANG: I had a really hot start.  I was actually really, really rushed this morning so I was running all over the place.  I got to the tee probably two minutes, three minutes before, two minutes before and started off with bogey but my game feels really good this week and today I just stayed very aggressive and went at pins you shouldn't go at and my putter was hot and then three-putted on 9 and kind of died down a little bit.
You kind of don't want to ruin the momentum running over but, I don't know.  I made a lot of mistakes but then I saved a lot, too.  So, 4-under is a good round anytime of the day at Hazeltine.
Q. Was it playing a little bit easier?
DANIELLE KANG: I guess there's a little bit more birdie opportunities, like No. 16 is reachable, No. 15 is also reachable for the long hitters.  Wind is downwind off the right.  So, things like that do help out just a tad.
Couple of the other days it was a little bit colder, less wind or if it was gusty, I couldn't reach it.  The tees were a little bit more forward.  Things like that do help out for birdie opportunities.
Q. What did you think of them moving up 16, someone driving it?
DANIELLE KANG: I almost hit it in the water.  I was saved by an inch.  It worked out for me.  I was safe.  I hit it to four feet and missed it.  It's definitely a risk/reward hole.  Somebody like me I'm going to go for it.  I don't like laying up.
I went for it and I actually risked it but the reward was the ball didn't go in the water which was good.  I like it.  Gives you a lot of different types of tests.
I sliced it way right, down off the left and kicks right.  I had -- wanted to be really greedy, I'm a greedy player.  I tried to crush it, slicing it and better slice it in the left to right wind and it went.  But it was safe, thank God.
