 Q.  How are you feeling?  We saw you doubled over in pain.  
DANIELLE KANG: Well, yeah, I tried to keep it really under wraps the whole day, but I had a really bad stomachache before I even teed off.  I don't know what caused it.  But I'm thinking it was the waffles.  But I threw up after 9.  I just kept trying to like not feel it, but I just -- just stayed as steady as possible.  But it was okay.  I'm hitting the ball great, so I hope I feel better for the next three days.   
 Q.  You said you're hitting the golf ball well.  What do you take from today to help you tomorrow?  
DANIELLE KANG: I mean, I'm definitely striking it really well.  My putting speed is great, so there's nothing about my game at the end of the day to be disappointed about.  I played solid golf.  I mean, who knows, even if I felt great, I don't know what I would have shot.  But yeah, it's just funny, you practice and you're ready for the week and you come and you like get a stomachache.  I'm like, come on, what is it?  But I hung in there, so it's okay.   
 Q.  You're feeling poorly?  
DANIELLE KANG: Before I even teed off.  But then I teed off and I didn't really have time to like -- because we had the camera following us all day.  I didn't want to throw up on camera.  I went to the Port-a-Potty a couple times to do it, but Port-a-Potties are so gross.  I mean, what are you going to do?  But it's just constant, that like contraction, your stomach contracting.  So I'm putting, and if I contract too much -- I smashed one on 10.  I go, whoops.  But I should feel better by tomorrow.  I think it's just some crap that I ate this morning.   
 Q.  Does this sort of thing happen to you often?  
DANIELLE KANG: No, I watch what I eat really well, but this morning I ate -- I was hesitant about it, and then I still went for it.  I shouldn't have done it, but chocolate chip and all that looked really good.  I mean, it was good when I ate it.  I hate half of it, and I was like, stop after half, and I ate the whole thing, and I go, okay.  Then you have an hour -- it's okay, what are you going to do.   
 Q.  So you overindulged?  
DANIELLE KANG: It's not the food, it's me.  Like I'm just really sensitive.  I don't eat eggs, I don't eat sausages, stuff like that, because I've gotten food poisoning off of those, and I just don't feel good.  I was telling my caddie, hey, I'm hitting it great.  Then on 18, I just couldn't contract, and I just kind of mis-hit it.  But stuff like that.  At the end of the day -- I played really good, though.  I'll take 1-over.  I mean, I hit it good, played good, and the golf course is playing hard, so I just wasn't able to capitalize today is all.   
 Q.  What are you going to eat tomorrow morning?  
DANIELLE KANG: I'm going to stick with oatmeal and cereal.   
I can handle any pain.  I cannot handle stomach pain.  Like stomachaches are like my worst enemies, man.   
 Q.  Were you still feeling it on 16?  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah.  Like it comes and goes.  So I tried to like just stand there and just take my time.  I don't want to take forever, but I'm just kind of standing there hoping it goes away and just watching a bug or something, and then I back off and everyone is probably wondering why is she not hitting.  But when it comes starts, this feeling, and I go, oh, and I back off and I'm standing there, like please go away.   
Yeah, 16 I was feeling it over it, and I tried to just hit through it and I hit it way too hard.  I hit my rescue like 190.  I thought that was really far.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  That was a good double, I guess.  If it went in the water and it dropped, who knows, it could have been a triple.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your position, though?  
DANIELLE KANG: I mean, it's a major.  No one is really taking it that low.  If you look at the scoreboard -- I watched the scoreboard all day.  There are a couple low scores here and there, but everyone is consistently 2-, 3-under par, but no one is going to take it that low, and I feel really good about my position because we have 72 holes, and we've got 54 holes left.  That's a lot of golf left.  I think I made the best out of what I could have made today, so I was really happy about that.  I know I made some mistakes here and there, but I made some good putts, and yeah, set myself up there.
