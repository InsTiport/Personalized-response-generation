Q. Bogey-free, and it was crazy out there for awhile. How did you do it?
DANIELLE KANG: I stayed really patient today. I knew there were a lot of birdie opportunities but a lot of mistakes that could happen. I didn't attack a lot of pins -- not like me, but I just tried to hit the fairways, the greens, and try to keep draw.
Q. You had great crowds playing with Hye-Jin Choi and Jin Young. What was it like seeing the fans outside the ropes watching every move you're making?
DANIELLE KANG: It was pretty crazy to be honest, because they have a lot of fan clubs out here. It's a bit different than the states or other places that we go to. Hye-Jin has her entire fan club come out and also I think Jin Young today -- I said, "this tournament happened because of you. Korea loves you and thank you for giving us the opportunity."
It's pretty cool seeing Korea being so supportive of women's golf and coming out to watch us. It was a huge crowd, despite the weather.
Q. Lots of noise, cheers. Any moments for you that really stood out as strong points in your game today, or was it just a steady round for you?
DANIELLE KANG: To be honest today was a very steady round. I felt quite comfortable. Nothing crazy happened. I tried to keep pace. I don't really know the leaderboard at the moment. I haven't seen anything. I know that hey gin and Jin Young played pretty well. They were making birdies, as well and hitting good shots. Just trusted my game and kept playing.
Q. You're right at the top of the leaderboard, second week in a row, still riding a high from last week maybe?
DANIELLE KANG: I did a restart this week. My brother, Alex, told me to pretend that it's a new week, and last week never happened; so get ready to play again and that's what we're doing.
Q. Any putts or anything particularly good?
DANIELLE KANG: It was a solid day on the golf course, chill. Literally and figuratively, chill. Some putts fell and definitely made a couple up-and-downs that I needed to make. Made some good saves. Made some good putts.
