 Q.  Obviously you're very disappointed but you had a great battle all the way through to the end?  You stayed in it, and you stayed fighting.  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, definitely.  My short game really wasn't there for me the last couple days.  You know, keep making pars from 20 yards is tough.  But I stayed in there.  Just wish I could have been in the playoff.  But it's all good.  I mean, I played pretty well.   
 Q.  Great way to be playing at the start of the year obviously.  Nelly was saying it was a struggle holing putts on the back nine for you all.  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, her and I were having a dry spell and none of us were just making anything.  Yeah, but it is what it is.  I think at the end of the day, if you're going to win, you're going to have to have your whole game, and it just wasn't quite all there.  But we scrambled.   
 Q.  You must be proud that you hung in there right till the end and gave yourself a chance right up until 18.  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah.   
 Q.  It was a real battle out there the first nine, wasn't it.  Did you feel like you just couldn't get ahead?  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, the par 5s would have helped, but like I said, previously, if you're going to win, you're going to have to have -- you're going to have to have your whole game and my whole game wasn't there really today and yesterday.  Making pars from just 15, 20 yards is tough.   
I couldn't capitalize on those holes, which was kind of disappointing.  But other than that, struck the ball well and I hung in there.  So she dropped the bomb on the last.  I heard it from a hole back.   
 Q.  Is this going to give you a lot of confidence going back to the States for the main season?  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, it's definitely a good start to the season.  What is it, T-2?  I like being in contention.  So I like playing like that.   
 Q.  Did you see Michelle's putt?  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, I heard it and watched -- I didn't know who won it.   
 Q.  On 18 tee box?  
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah.
