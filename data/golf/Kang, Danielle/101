Q. We're here with Danielle Kang.  Danielle, nice round today, 3-under par.  You are 4-under for the tournament, on the first page of the leaderboard.  How do you feel about this position heading into the weekend?
DANIELLE KANG: I feel really great being in contention.  That was my goal for the first two days and keeping it in the red number.  Being patient and just taking it shot by shot.
Q. You played early today.  How has the course changed over the course of this week so far?
DANIELLE KANG: It's completely different.  There was drastic change from Wednesday to Thursday.  I was hitting rescues into certain par-4s.  Yesterday I had pitching wedge.  But from yesterday to today, it wasn't that much different, but the wind was a little calmer, which was nice.
Q. Which holes out there are playing the most different?
DANIELLE KANG: 13.
Q. How so?
DANIELLE KANG: 13 and 15, I would think.  13, because I had driver, 4 rescues into the second shots.  And I was prepared to hit the rescues coming in, and then today I had pitching wedge.  They moved up the tee.
Q. What?
DANIELLE KANG: I had 3-wood off the tee.  15, there was no chance I could reach it in two.  And then today and yesterday were just -- wind just switched around for you and now it's straight downwind and I'm reaching it with rescues.
Q. They're keeping you on your toes.  That's what USGA events do.
DANIELLE KANG: That's what the U.S. Open is for.
Q. You have won a U.S. Amateur twice.  How do you take it to the next level here at the U.S. Women's Open?
DANIELLE KANG: I spoke with someone previously saying USGA events just gives you like a comfort, for me because I've played it since I was 14.  I don't know, it reverts me back to times when I just played it just fearlessly, just going at everything.  It's fun.  You have to be patient, and you have to keep it consistent.  And it's a U.S. Open, so just keep yourself in contention and see what happens..
