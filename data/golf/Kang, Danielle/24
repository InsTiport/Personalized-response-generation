  Q. 65 today.  That's a pretty good round.  Whole lot birdies out there, just the one bogey.  How are you feeling right now?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Feel pretty solid.  I putted way better than at ANA, so I'm really happy about my short game, to be honest.  My ball striking wasn't really there this week, but my putting average has improved tremendously.
 Q. Were you working that specifically or is it just something that came together for you?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I worked on it.  A lot.  It came together.  It just hasn't been performing very well, but like I'm really happy on how I felt with my short game this week more than anything.
 Q. I guess I should say that more as were you focusing on that, on improving that?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah, more so than anything.
 Q. Okay.  Any particular birdies out there that were nice ones for you?
 DANIELLE KANG:   To be honest, there was no gimme birdies, so I'm kind of happy about shooting a 7-under with no gimme birdies.  They were all kind of 10 to 15 feet, just those putts that go in and you feel really, really good about it.
 I just kind of saw the lines, saw the speed, and felt really good.  Yeah, I putted well the last two days as well.  I was only 2-under going into Sunday, but really happy that the tournament was held, everything cleared out.  Yeah, the air cleared out and it's been a solid week.
 Q. It was a crazy week early in the week with the smoke and everything.  How did you deal with all the upheaval?
 DANIELLE KANG:   To be honest, it is what it is.  My boyfriend, Maverick, was here with me, so we had a positive attitude.  Just kept working on things that I needed to work on whether it was working out in the room or work on putting in the room and things like that.
 I knew that LPGA was going to do whatever they can to keep us safe and I know that the practice wasn't as normal as normal weeks would've been, it wasn't the usual, but it is what it is.  I think everyone got the minimum practice that everyone else did.
 After playing nine holes, kind of got the feel of the golf course and just went and tried it.
 Q. Actually heard some people say after the craze of a major week, kind of having that forced downtime was actually kind of welcome.  Did you think about that at all?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I was in Las Vegas.  I drove home and then the flights were canceled so I got in late.  But yes and no.  I think it's just depends on week by week; every tournament is different.
 It's all good.  Yeah, it's always good to end on a 65 on a Sunday.
 Q. Last question.  How do you plan to spend the off week, and then are you going to ShopRite?  All right, so you've got two weeks now before you head into the next major, KPMG, where you're a past champ.  How are you getting ready for that week at Aronimink?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I think I just need a couple weeks at home to tune up my game and body as well.  I'm excited to play Aronimink.  It's something that we've been looking forward to since last year.  Really glad it got rescheduled and KPMG, Women's PGA Championship have done everything they can to keep the tournament on.
 So I'm really happy about that, and I'm sure the golf course is going to be in its own challenging shape.  So excited to see how it's going to play as well.
 So yeah, I'm excited for just the rest of the year just because you don't know what's going to happen, but randomly tournaments pop up, like Georgia, Drive On, so just go day by day and week by week.
 Q. It's 2020, the year you got to roll.
 DANIELLE KANG:   Uh-huh.
 Q. Any last tune ups with Butch other the next two weeks?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Just here and there.  I think my game has gotten a little bit loose, so just need to tidy it up.
