Q. The birdie start for you, can you tell me what momentum that gave you and a little about your round today?
DANIELLE KANG: Well, today was kind of up-and-down.  My putting's been feeling really great.  Hitting it good, and birdie starts, it's just exciting, the ball dropping.  I just keep sticking to my speed and the lines I see.  It was fine.
There was a little bit of weird few holes where I just couldn't get the speed down, all of a sudden everything slowed up on me, so I just kept 3-putting.  I go, okay.  Then I looked at my caddie and said, "I don't know what's going on."
He goes, "Well, all year round, your speed is it on point.  It's amazing.  It happens just once in a while.  Maybe it's just being moody."
And the next hole I made a really great 2-putt and after that I was just over it.  It's that simple in golf.  If you're over it, you're over it.
Q. The conditions are quite different than yesterday.  Did that kind of help you or --
DANIELLE KANG: It was still a little bit windy in the morning.  I mean, in the beginning, yeah, and it started to warm up.  After that little bit of an upset run; I was getting so heated up that I started taking off my jacket.  I was just too warm.
But the weather is really nice and I think it's supposed to be nicer the next couple days.  It's really exciting and there are a lot of fans coming out here.  With the weather being great, I think we're going to see a lot of fans.
Q. You're one to feed off that energy?
DANIELLE KANG: I love it.  My friend came out today, and he loved CL.
Q. Especially your tied for the lead going into the weekend.  Are just like pumped up that?
DANIELLE KANG: I really wanted to birdie the last hole but at the end of the golf, we're just greedy people, right.  Golfers are so greedy.
But I'm really excited to be tied for the lead and being on top of the leaderboard, and been working hard the last few months and for a while now, where my game is starting to see some consistency, and I'm just more happy about that and I'm just happy to be here.  I've prepared, so we'll see what happens.
