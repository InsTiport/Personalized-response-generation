Q. Butch told me you were ready for this.  Did you feel ready starting the day?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah, I did.  I worked really hard for the last seven months, and we did a lot of great work.  Butch, thank God Butch had seven months off and got to spend a lot of his time with me.  I'm really excited.
Q. How much of a grind is this golf course, and why do you think you excel on the tough courses?
DANIELLE KANG:   I think I do really well -- hold on a sec.  I'm just so excited.  Okay.  I think just keeping patience and trusting all aspects of your golf game really brings it out on this golf course.
I knew that -- I knew where I was standing three holes left.  I checked the phone and wanted to know when where I was standing in just the final hole stretch.
Yeah, you can't just -- got to respect the golf course.  I think that's how I tried to do.  And even little putts I didn't take it for granted and kept focused.
Q. Lastly, how much will you be glued to the TV this afternoon watching Maverick and his attempt to win his first?
DANIELLE KANG:   I know.  I'm really excited to watch.  It will be really cool if we both get to hoist the trophy today.
