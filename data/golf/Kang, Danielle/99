Q. Final round of 68.  You must be very happy with your week.
DANIELLE KANG: I'm very satisfied with how I played.  I putted really great and I kept steady.  In this heat, trying to drink water and just play every hole.  Was a survival, honestly.
Q. In light of the fact you're going to play in Singapore next week, what's the trick behind preserving yourself in these kind of weather conditions?
DANIELLE KANG: I try to drink a lot of water.  I am drinking a lot of energy drink throughout the round.  I mean, even if your not thirsty you have to drink.  So I make myself so that I have to go to the bathroom, I have to pee.
I didn't have the umbrella that everyone uses, so I'm just pouring water down my head.  Whatever works.
Q. You've had a few health issues in 2016 with wrist, back, eye.  How are you feeling now?
DANIELLE KANG: I'm feeling great, fantastic.  Nothing crazy is going on, and I haven't felt this great in a while.  I'm so happy to be just myself.  That's where am at.
Q. And seeing that you're in 100% condition right now, any different goals from last year?
DANIELLE KANG: No.  You play to win some trophies, right?  That's the goal.  That's all the goal.
Q. All the best.  Hope you get many.
DANIELLE KANG: Thanks.  Thank you.
