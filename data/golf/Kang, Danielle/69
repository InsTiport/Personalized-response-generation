Q. What was key for you out there on the golf course?
DANIELLE KANG: Well, this is a new golf course so it was definitely getting to know the golf course today.  I only played it once.  So I don't know, I just kept very patient.  Playing good, hitting good.  Good momentum off last week, and my caddie and I been working really well.  Just hit fairways, greens, and keep giving myself chances.
Q. You mentioned your results.  Kind of been fantastic results and less fantastic results.  What's the difference for you with your game between those two weeks?
DANIELLE KANG: Where?
Q. Between two kind of styles play.
DANIELLE KANG: Two weeks or just two types of...  I'm so confused.
Q. Two top fives in your last five events, and then a couple of less-great results.
DANIELLE KANG: Really?
Q. You've been playing really well.
DANIELLE KANG: I mean, the last ten tournaments I've missed seven cuts and three of them were top five.  I'm pretty sure that's what -- right?  Well, I've been working with a new coach named Butch and it's been great.
We just kind of simplify the game a lot and a lot of the things going on in my head and the swing and all that.  Just trying to calm it down and get back to how I used to play just more feel golf.  Thinking less mechanics and going with the flow.
Q. Speaking of the flow, birthday coming up this weekend.  Is there a better city in the world than Shanghai to celebrate it?  Got any plans?
DANIELLE KANG: So my birthday is in a couple days.  I don't really have birthday plans so far.  We'll see.  Every year my birthday is in Asia somewhere, so I've celebrates in so many different countries.
I'm just excited.  Got my LPGA family here.  My mom is with me, so I'm excited.
Q. Opening rounds 67 today.  In the lead early here in the Buick LPGA Shanghai.  Tell us how today's round went for you.
DANIELLE KANG: Today's rounds went very smooth.  Coming off a very good momentum after last week and I've been hitting the ball really well, playing great.  Just been trusting my game and just kept giving myself birdie chances.  They kept rolling in.  Excited for this week.
Q. What do you think has been the biggest difference for you the past two weeks?
DANIELLE KANG: I've been working with my new golf coach, Butch Harmon.  I'm pretty sure you've heard of him.
It's just been getting back to my golf game the way I used to play and thinking less of mechanics and golf swing and golf game.  Just been working a lot with me on just playing with feel and simplifying everything.  I think that's the most important thing about me, is to just not worry about things that I can't control.
So, I mean, after working with him it's been a good debut so far.  I feel very confident.  I think that's the big difference.
Q. When you talk about playing free and not thinking too about your golf swing, do you have any tricks that you do?
DANIELLE KANG: Not really.  Well, I've had -- I mean, he'll even tell you a lot of the swing things that I'm working on.  It's best to just ask him if you ever come across him.  It's (indiscernible) the full swing at one point and I was hitting so many OBs.  I still have the anxiety and panic attacks on the tee boxes where I just hesitate.  I think I'm just getting better at just breathing through it, just trusting my golf game.
I think that's the most important, trusting the work that I've done and trusting the swing will come naturally.  Fairways really, really big.
Q. (Regarding hair color.)
DANIELLE KANG: My hair has been blonde since March.  No one has noticed me since March.  Maybe I'll go blue next week.  I'll let you know.  I'm thinking about it.
Q. If you change every week then they'll notice.
DANIELLE KANG: I know.  Maybe.
Q. (About birthday plans.)  Any plans?
DANIELLE KANG: I actually don't have any plans yet.  I haven't got that far.  My plan was just to make my tee time today.  I was super sleepy.
No, I haven't celebrated my birthday in Shanghai, so if you have any suggestions let me know.  Restaurants.
