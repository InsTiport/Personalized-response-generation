  Q. Danielle, can you talk us through your round a little bit.
 DANIELLE KANG:   It was pretty difficult.  I think for the first 12, 13 holes it was a lot of double cross shots and I was in between clubs all day, and then I tried to give myself the best birdie opportunity possible but couldn't make a putt today.
 But in fairness, I made a lot of good par saves.
 Q. Playing a different course tomorrow.  What's the strategy?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I'm not sure.  I think the wind is supposed to pick up tomorrow.  Jackrabbit as a golf course is a bit shorter.  Hopefully have more birdie opportunities with wedges.
 But really depends.  I think I'm hoping that the pin positions just kind of favor me a little bit.
 Q. How do you feel about your position right now?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I feel okay.  I don't really mind the position.  I'm just kind of a little bit irritated about the round since it was birdie-less round.  Kind of annoying.  That's all.
 Q. With the threat of inclement weather tomorrow, how does that change how you might play the Jackrabbit course?  Any strategy you take into that?
 DANIELLE KANG:   Honestly, I don't think so, because the greens are so small there, fairways are tight.  It's a narrow golf course.  So the winds are going to pick up tomorrow.  I think it's going to be just tough in general to keep it in the fairway and on the greens.
 Like No. 2 the width of a -- I don't know what the pin is, but width in the front is maybe seven yards from left to right.  It just all depends.  I think just going to have to leave yourself good numbers and give yourself good opportunities.
