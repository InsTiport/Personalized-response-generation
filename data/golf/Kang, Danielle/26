Q. 5-down is standing on the 13th green.  What were you thinking at that point?  What were you telling yourself?
DANIELLE KANG:   To be honest, when I was 5-down, three-putt didn't really bother me.  My caddie looked at me ans said, You're still right in it.  I said, I'm 5-down, 5 back.  He said, six holes to go, 5-down.  Kind of liked that mentality.  Went into match play mentality.
Definitely made some good birdies coming in and kept it together.
Q. Butch says you're a fighter.  Everybody knows you're a fighter.  He says part of the things he has been working on with you is to get you to believe you're as good as you are and everyone else thinks you are.  Back-to-back wins out here make that set in a little bit?
DANIELLE KANG:   I mean, it's pretty cool to win back to back.  Ohio has been really good to me and this week has been kind of a tester for a lot of different parts of my game.
Golf course is a very cut golf course and I don't usually play left-to-right shots, so that was a bit difficult.  Definitely, yeah, to come out on top after last week, it's kind of exciting.
