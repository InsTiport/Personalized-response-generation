  Q. ...trophy for the best scoring average in 2020.  How would you put your season in perspective?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I think the season was lots of up and downs, lots of positives, and I think I have some good things to take on to next year.
 Q. We saw earlier in the week you struggling, stretching a little bit with your back.  Morgan Pressel said you had an MRI.  What is the state of your physical status right now?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I'm okay.  I'm not that great.  But I was trending in the right direction.  I took about seven weeks off after Georgia for this specific reason.  I'm hitting my driver probably about 220.  Now I'm hitting it way further and getting good contact.  That's a good step towards next year.
 I know it's the off-season, but we have a tournament in, what, three weeks, Diamond Resorts, so I'm excited for that.
 Q. January is not that far away.  What's the No. 1 thing you have to do during the off-season to have the 2021 that you want to have?
 DANIELLE KANG:   I think right now I have some idea on what I want to work on specifically on how to make my game a little less sloppy, like up and down, and just to make it a little more consistent than I wanted it this year.
 But I believe that I've done a good job last year to get it to this year and had the opportunity to do a lot of things, and I want to set that opportunity again for next year.
 Q. Congrats on the Vare and a great season.
 DANIELLE KANG:   Thank you.
