Q. How beautiful was this course this week?
DANIELLE KANG:   Just like really beautiful.  Played awesome.  I think it was really cool to have all the fans come out by their boats.
That just made it a little bit more exciting.
Q. You and Ally and Bianca offered such a great last round, that last hole.  What was your mind like when that ball almost rolled into the hole?
DANIELLE KANG:   Well, that was the play, to be honest.  I didn't -- I thought I hit a good drive but looked up and it just kind of veered right.  Then I saw it kick right and then I took a little while over that shot because I had to make a decision whether to go for it.
My wedges are really good, so I said I can't guarantee on-the-green shot, even if I'm long enough to try and chip in.  Let's just lay it up to a number I like.  Laid up to a number I like and I tried to hole-out.
Q. Lastly, we have got three weeks of break.  What do you plan to do both golf-wise but also relax-wise?
DANIELLE KANG:   I think I just need to take a few days off right now.  My back has went into a spasm few days ago.  I call it wifi.  It's on strong right and left.  So it was a little difficult this week to play with it.
I think I'm very proud of how I played despite not having my full game, but Ally played wonderfully and it's been a really great week.
