Q. Danielle, what a great round three here at Four Seasons.  We can only imagine watching you play how well of a round that was, but how do you feel about that round today?
DANIELLE KANG:   It was pretty fun.  I had a blast with Aaron Hicks and Mardy Fish.  They're such good golfers, and Aaron kept outdriving by me about 150 yards, and Mardy a solid 80.  Tried to just stay in my own game and make good shots.
Q. Speaking of Aaron hitting it really well today, how as that eagle putt when he made it on 10, and I heard you guys talking about how -- you asked if it was like five points or something.
DANIELLE KANG:   No, I just said that was awesome.  It was a good eagle.
Q. Just curious, with the celebs playing a bit of a different scoring game, do you think that would be something fun for LPGA players, to have a different kind of tournament with a different kind of scoring?
DANIELLE KANG:   Maybe.  I know that PGA Tour has Stableford scoring as well, right?  But I like -- I don't know.  It really depends on the player.
I don't think it really matters to me either way, but I think it'll be fun to play different games.  I like match play, and I really think one day if we have team games it'll be really fun for this too.  Same thing with Dow and things like that.
Q. Was it just really fun starting from hole 1, or was there a really memorable hole today?
DANIELLE KANG:   No.  I'm just having a lot of fun this week.  Like I said at the beginning of the week, I wasn't really trying to stress on how well I wanted to play and how well I don't want to play and things like that.
Just try and focus on my game and not let things bother me and trust in my game and execute the shots that I have.
Q. There was some emotion when you poured in that putt at 17.  Can you take us into that a little bit?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah.  Well, that was the second time I chunked it today, and it was a little downhill lie.  I chunked it again on 7.  I just got a little greedy trying to hit a high shot on a downhill lie, and that's not the right thing to do.  Hit the big ball before the little ball.  What are you going to do?
I just kind of brushed it off.  I wanted to give myself the best par opportunity, and it was really cool to make that par.
Q. And, I mean, on a day when you're making a ton of birdies, how big is that to make that par?
DANIELLE KANG:   I didn't think about the rest of the 16 holes.  I just really wanted to make that putt.  Came down to it.  I gave myself a really good opportunity, and that's all I really give myself credit for, to give myself a chance.  I did it.
Q. Looking head to tomorrow and playing with the Korda sisters, sets up as a great shootout I would think for the season opener here.
DANIELLE KANG:   Yeah, it'll be really fun for a lot of fans at home.  They've been playing really good, and I saw that Jessica played really well today.  It'll be different not playing with the celebrities.  I been trying to get in certain people's group.  I guess that's not happening tomorrow.
Yeah.
Q. With so many players going low today, do you just focus on your game?  Were you seeing what Nelly was doing early and Jessica was doing late?
DANIELLE KANG:   I do watch the leaderboard the whole time, but like I said, I just try and play my own game.  I still have to hit the shot in front of me and execute and make putts.
I'm just trying to have fun, and I really enjoyed playing with Aaron and Mardy today.  Yesterday I played with John and Cole again.  I'm just really enjoying the time out here and thankful they have this tournament.  It's a great season kickoff event, and, yeah.
Q. Anything that they did in particular today that kept you loose and going on that?
DANIELLE KANG:   Yes and no, I guess.  Golf is golf, right?  I think one of the things I'm working on is just to stay in my own bubble and play what I need to do and execute the shot in front of me.
That's the goal and routine and what I've been doing.  Really happy with the work that I've done on that.
Q. What would you say is the best strengths of your game this week?
DANIELLE KANG:   Overall I think my game is pretty solid.  I think my mental game is pretty strong this week.  Just kind of chugging along.  I know I'm being really repetitive, but that's what I'm doing, is just focusing on what I need to hit and what I need to execute.  That's pretty much it.
I don't think ahead or behind.  I just try and stay in the present and have fun with it.  I'm having a lot of fun with my caddie.  I haven't seen him in a while, so we're just trying to enjoy it.  We have four weeks off after this, so it'll be good.
