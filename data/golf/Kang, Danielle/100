Q. Kind of crazy out there with the wind.  Tell us about that.
DANIELLE KANG: It was a little bit crazy.  It was howling once in a while and it made a little more difficult than usual.  I hit so many greens today, it didn't quite phase me, but none of the putts dropped.
Q. This one doesn't really hurt so much or not today?
DANIELLE KANG: It kind of hurts when you have 16 holes in a row two putts, yeah, it kinds of hurts.  That just means I'm striking it well and putts will fall tomorrow.
Q. That gives you the opportunity to have some confidence that the two putts will become one putts?
DANIELLE KANG: Yeah, I didn't putt bad, they just wouldn't drop.  They kept hanging on the edge or they would lip out.  It just wasn't the day for the putter to go in.  On the last hole, I hit it close enough.  Me and my caddie were talk about to hit it super close and it will kick in and I did.
Q. You are heading towards your best possible result.  How do you stay in the moment and not think about that?
DANIELLE KANG: I'm not really worried about the results right now.  I'm trying to think about hole by hole and deal with the golf course that's in front of me, since it's playing pretty tough and try and make a putt.
Q. At the same time, you look at that leaderboard?
DANIELLE KANG: I'm watching it 100 percent, seeing where everyone is at, but it is playing tough today.  Not many low numbers.  I just wish a couple more fell, so a better position.  It's all right.
Q. With the course getting tough, does that give you a boost going into tomorrow?
DANIELLE KANG: Yes, I feel comfortable playing the golf course.  I've been striking the ball really well.  Hitting a lot of fairways a lot of greens, giving myself a lot of chances, missing them on the right positions.  Capitalizing on certain holes that I needed to capitalize on.  I don't mind the wind.
Q. Are you comfortable with the coming from behind that you might have to do?  Do you like that?
DANIELLE KANG: I guess, yeah.  I mean, the crowd is still big out here, so it will be fun.  Coming from behind, you have to worry about your game and just play aggressive.
Q. This isn't the easiest course to play aggressive on, though?
DANIELLE KANG: No.  But you can play aggressive to your new targets.  That's what I've been doing and giving myself birdie opportunities every single hole and that's what I did all day and that's what I could ask for.  You make mistakes here and there, but mistakes happen.
