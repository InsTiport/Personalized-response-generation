Q. Was the deciding factor when Great Britain and Ireland won holes 8, 9 and 10?
DENNY McCARTHY: You could look at that way. Those are probably their two best players so we played their strongest team. I thought we played pretty well. They made a good run there in that middle stretch. It was hard to come back from that, they played a lot of good golf.
Q. Why are they able to complement each other so well as a team?
DENNY McCARTHY: Beau (Hossler) and I did that for the most part. I thought our camaraderie was just as good as theirs. They just seem to have a real good feel for the course. They are both hitting it extremely straight and keeping it out of bunkers. When you are hitting it on every fairway and on every green and giving yourself a look on almost every hole it?s hard to beat
