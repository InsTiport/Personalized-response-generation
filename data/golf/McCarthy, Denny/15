 Q.  You won the only point of the morning for the USA. What is your general assessment of the match?  
DENNY MCCARTHY: We saw we were the only red match on the board. We knew in our head that our match was going to be pretty important. We played really steady golf today and we were under par today alternate shot in the wind, which is really good out here. It was a grind and Paul and Gary gave us a good fight. But we hit some really quality shots coming in to get the point.
