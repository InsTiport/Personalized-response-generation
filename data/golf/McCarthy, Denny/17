 Q.  So Denny, today 1-over, 5-over for the championship.  Just summarize basically your round today.  DENNY McCARTHY: Yeah, I came out of the gate really well.  Started off strong and parred the first three holes and hit it in the right spots on the first three holes.  It was hard because I played absolutely perfect hole on 4.  It's one of the hardest holes on the course and walked away with bogey.  Then 4 and 5, I bogey on the last two days and it's a hard stretch 4 through 7.  So after I bogeyed 4 and 5, I knew I would need a strong push to keep it together at that point in the round. I made good pars on 6 and 7, and bounced back with a birdie on 8, and parred 9 to shoot 1-over on the front.  I was pretty pleased with that. Then starting off on the back, I piped a drive on 10 from the back tee into the wind.  Hit a great second shot and walked way with double bogey.  I was looking to go maybe back to even or maybe stay at 1-over and went to 3-over.  That was a tough point in the round for me. The place where the round changed the most was 11.  I was looking at another bogey to go to 4 over on the day.  I hit a good driver and second shot that rolled down the hill on the left and really tough up-and-down and end up making a 40-footer for par. Then birdied 12 right after that bounce back.  I think that point really saved my round. Finished really strong, birdied 17 and 18 to shoot 1-over.  All in all, pretty pleased with the way I finished.   Q.  You have got to love caring that momentum into Sunday, just coming off of birdie-birdie finish and then under par round on the back side?  DENNY McCARTHY: Absolutely.  Looking forward to good round tomorrow.  Same game plan.  Started really strong on the first three days physically and mentally, hitting the right shots, putting the ball in the right spots, giving myself looks.  I haven't converted on those looks, but I've started off solid and gave myself chances.  If I keep doing that, giving myself chances, I think a few more will drop for me.   Q.  What was your perspective coming into the championship?  Were you thinking low amateur?  DENNY McCARTHY: No, I don't really have any expectations.  I'm just here to enjoy the week.  It's been a hell of an experience so far.  I haven't had too much time to enjoy it.  Maybe after the rounds I had a time to enjoy it, but I'm playing the rounds.  I'm in full tournament mode and I'm really focused.  It's been a great week so far.  I'm going to go out there and enjoy the last round.
