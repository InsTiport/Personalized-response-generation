Q. Denny, can you talk about the emotions of just getting the news about your test?
DENNY McCARTHY:   Yeah, it was good, especially since the doctor thought it could go on for a little while.  Obviously it was pretty odd today going out as a onesome.  It's been a weird couple weeks, but obviously glad to hear the news.  Glad to get back to a somewhat normal atmosphere in this crazy time.
Q. How un-normal was it today being a onesome in the middle of a whole bunch of twosomes?
DENNY McCARTHY:   You know, it wasn't that different.  Harris and I played as a twosome behind threesomes the last few days, so if anything I'd say just gives us a little more time to slow down, relax, worry about my game a little more.  I can spend extra minute or two here and there on the green, and I can just go about my business.
Q. Did you change your routine at all today or did you have a plan for being by yourself?
DENNY McCARTHY:   No.  I mean, just a plan for the golf course.  You know, a little deflated right now.  I worked really hard to be 1-under through 13 holes and just stumbled coming in and a little deflating right now, but it was fine playing as a onesome.  Like I said, it just gave us -- the wind kind of switches out there, even though it's really not blowing that much, it just makes a huge difference on some shots if it just switches slightly.  If anything it was just nice to have an extra 30 seconds to a minute to maybe figure out what was going on.
Q. Have you ever played as a onesome on TOUR?
DENNY McCARTHY:   Maybe.  I don't know if I have.  Maybe going off first if there's an odd number that make the cut, but I don't think so.
Q. You talked about how rough the last couple of weeks have been; what exactly have you felt the last few weeks?
DENNY McCARTHY:   It's been tough.  Obviously guys not really wanting to be around me, not being able to be in the locker room, dining area, not being able to sit with guys, just kind of being by myself, making sure I'm doing everything right, not really going anywhere in public, getting a lot of takeout, getting food from here and bringing it back to my hotel, so it's been a little lonely, but it is what it is.  I felt like I've dealt with it just fine and I've done a good job of putting that aside and focusing on my golf game.
