Q. Do you just tip your cap to a player who totaled four points over the last two days?
DENNY McCARTHY: He played great all week. I knew I was going to have to play well to beat him this afternoon. I just came out of the gates kind of flat. I think I got a little fatigued both mentally and physically.
Q. You were in the bunkers quite a bit today?
DENNY McCARTHY: Every time I got in a greenside bunker I was on the downslope with a foot out of it. Every time he was in a greenside bunker he was on the upslope with a good lie. I got some pretty bad breaks today. But that?s the way it?s been going for them, it?s their week.
Q. Could you talk about Jimmy Mullen?s play over the last two days?
DENNY McCARTHY: He just put it in the fairway. He drove the ball extremely straight and hit on a lot of greens. When you hit a lot of fairways and greens out here, that is going to do pretty well in most matches.
