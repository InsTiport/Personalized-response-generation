 Q.  Denny, another solid round of golf; 8-under par; just one bogey, and that's really the only green you missed today. Golf course out there pretty scorable today?  
DENNY McCARTHY: Yeah, I think I had two bogeys. I had bogey on the front; I think I made ten birdies today.   
Course definitely gettable for sure. Not much wind. Just small puffs here and there. I've been hitting it really well and putting it really well, so I knew if I came out and did some of the same of what I've been doing the last couple days there was a low round out there, and sure enough I found it.   
 Q.  Shot 61 a few weeks ago a the Greenbrier; had it low going again. Once you've been there, does it seem to be easier to take it low?  
DENNY McCARTHY: It's never easy. I would say it's hard to keep it going at times. When you get hot, it's hard to keep it going. Sometimes it does feel easy, yes, but it's not that easy all the time.   
Today we had a lot fun. Russell Knox was playing well and we were kind of feeding off each other a little bit. I think the conditions, not much wind, we had some good numbers today, Derek and I, and we did a really good job of executing some shots.   
 Q.  I know you were putting really well last year. Seems to be continuing into this season. Is that what's allowing you to get off to some slow starts and bounce back?  
DENNY McCARTHY: Yeah, I think so, and I think also just maybe realizing that I don't quite need to force the issue with shots coming into the green.   
You know, if I can give myself a couple more quality looks around, which I'm trying to do. My ball-striking is really good right now, so I don't really need to force the issue. If I can just get myself a couple more 15, 20-footers around, I feel like if I got on the green I have a really good chance of making it.   
That mindset has really helped me out.   
 Q.  If I'm not mistaken, I think this was your first sponsor's exemption on the PGA TOUR; tied for 15th last year. Obviously this place means a lot to you. Has to mean a lot to play well, too.  
DENNY McCARTHY: Yeah, for sure. I mean, fourth time around playing this place. I've played multiple tournament rounds here. I think that's a big help. First time I played here was actually an eye opener. This place kind of ate my lunch. After coming here for the first time I realized I needed to get a whole lot better, and I think I've done that over the last couple years.   
I always enjoy coming here. I think the course suits my game, and just got to keep doing what I'm doing. Tomorrow will be fun. It'll be a challenge for sure. These guys will probably get a couple ahead of me, maybe even a few more than that, but just go out and do what I've been doing and I'll be fine tomorrow.   
 Q.  I know last year at the end of the year it got a little stressful trying to make sure you got into the top 125. Obviously goal this year is to off to a good start. You've done that with some great play. Play well tomorrow. Get it done.  
DENNY McCARTHY: Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.
