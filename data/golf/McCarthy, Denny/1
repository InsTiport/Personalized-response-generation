  Q. Is that a satisfying way to finish four tough rounds?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   Four sure.  It's a nice way to go into an off week too.  It's been a stressful couple three weeks playing Bay Hill, PLAYERS and here, three grinds of golf courses and I played really, really some really good golf over the last three weeks and haven't quite got the results I've wanted, and I got a good result this week, I played really, really solid.  It was tough after the past few weeks to kind of pick myself up and come out to this grinder of a golf course and but managed to put four good rounds together, really just one little stretch yesterday away from being right in the thick of the golf tournament.  But picked myself up nicely and came out today and played a good round.
 Q. Must be so nice also to finish off here just down the street from where you live, right?  I mean how special is that to be in Jupiter, you go home now?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   It's awesome, it great feeling, I don't have to hop on a flight to go anywhere, I'll just drive 20 minutes and be home.  So it will be a different -- like I said it's nice going into an off week.  I'm home, I don't need to go anywhere, and made a sweet putt at the last, so that might make the drinks taste a little bit better tonight.
 Q. How much has moving here overall improved your life, your game, sort of the whole concept of what you're trying to achieve?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   Yeah, it's been great.  I didn't grow up playing on much Bermuda grass and when I first moved down here I was really uncomfortable on Bermuda grass and now I would say it's the most comfortable grass that we play on.  I feel the most comfortable on it.  And as playing in the wind as well, I'm used to playing in 20-mile-an-hour winds down here and I like it, because it forces you to be creative.  So I haven't played well here in the past three years, so it's kind of nice to get the monkey off the back and have a nice tournament here this week.
 Q. How long ago did you move here?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   I moved here about six years ago, five, six years ago.
 Q. Did you come down here because you wanted to, you thought -- why did you come down?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   Basically I knew there was a lot of professional golfers down here, obviously the weather is great, kind of just started my first year renting with a few buddies to see how I liked it down here and really liked it and so did it again for a few more years and then finally bought a place.  So I can see this being my home for quite awhile and it's a great place to live.
 Q. In your off weeks do you play with some of the other guys and how has that helped you?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   For sure.  We get a lot of really good competition.  I play you up at Medalist, obviously there's some big names there, but it's pretty easy, you go up there, you either coordinate a game or even if you're not planning on playing any you can go up there and you can get a game with some guys.  If you're playing with guys that are at the same level as you it's only going to make you better.  So I think that having a place like Medalist and some of the top tier players in the world, it's, it can only make you better.
 Q. You seem to have a real rapport with the fans, you stopped on the bridge and threw them balls, you get a kick out of that, don't you?
 DENNY McCARTHY:   Yeah, it's good, I went to a lot of U.S. Opens when I was a kid and I know what it was like.  I was always wanting the autographs and the balls from players when I was little, so when I see little kids, it's me 15, 20 years ago, so I love seeing the kids out here and giving them whatever I can give them.
