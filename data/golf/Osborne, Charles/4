Q. Real good start in this one.  The eagle on 3, was that conceded?
CHARLES OSBORNE:   It was conceded.
Q. Tell me how you --
CHARLES OSBORNE:   Hit a good drive, had about 239 in, and I hit a 3-iron up there to about 20 feet that was conceded.
Q. And then you birdied 5 and 8 to take a 3-up lead?
CHARLES OSBORNE:   Yes, sir, yeah.
Q. Tell me how you did that.
CHARLES OSBORNE:   No. 5, I actually hit a kind of poor second shot, and it just got lucky and stayed out of the bunker and I kind of rolled in that putt and it was just on the fringe, so I was lucky to do that.  And No. 8 I actually just had about a 20-yard chip to the hole, so I just chipped that up close and made that putt for birdie, too.
Q. Even though you were still in the lead he was still hanging around.  I assume the birdie at 13 was pretty --
CHARLES OSBORNE:   Yeah, a big moment.  That kind of turned it around on the back nine.  I was kind of losing a little momentum for sure because the eagle on 9 and then the birdie on 10 kind of switched it a little bit for me.
Q. And then how did you birdie 13?
CHARLES OSBORNE:   I had about a 9-iron in, and I hit it just past the pin and just like a 25-footer, just kind of putted it up close, and an easy one.
Q. I know the winds probably picked up towards the end of your match.  How difficult was it?
CHARLES OSBORNE:   It actually felt pretty good compared to the stroke play rounds.  It started on 11 for sure.  The front nine was a ton easier than the back nine.  But it was all right.
Q. How exciting is this for you?
CHARLES OSBORNE:   Oh, I love it.  This is really cool.
Q. How different is this than any other tournament you've been in, let's say?  They're all pretty prestigious --
CHARLES OSBORNE:   Yeah, it's a lot different.  It's kind of special to be here, kind of going through -- I grew up playing with Noah in NOR-CAL, and I love that kid, and it was kind of cool to play him.  I've always looked up to him as a great player, and he was always one of the guys that I kind of wanted to strive to beat.
