 Q.  2-under today, how was that?  
THOMAS DETRY: I was playing well, making pars.  I made a small little bogey there on hole No. 7, and backed it up with a birdie right after and then I was rolling from there.  I made a great putt on 10.  I made some good par saves there towards the end, and then a good birdie on 17.  Didn't make birdie on 18 but very pleased.   
 Q.  You talked about how much the fairways are running, and your tee shot on 16 just went into the hazard there, didn't it.  
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, that was off the tee.  It seems like an easy tee shot, even with the tee forward but you have to stay focused on every single shot here.  You hit it in the left and you're in the rough, and your shot becomes very hard.  And then you hit it right, the wind takes it and it goes in the water.  It was just a little lack of focus.  I made a great four there.  Fortunate that the ball just stayed up there.  I got a good up-and-down for four and yeah, that was good.  Got to stay focused on every single shot out there.   
 Q.  What are you thinking going into tomorrow's round?  
THOMAS DETRY: Just the same.  I've been playing some very good golf, just hitting a lot of fairways, putting well, keep doing my thing.  It's all going to be fine.
