 Q.  71 today, always quite difficult to come back from a round after you had yesterday.  How did you find it today?  
THOMAS DETRY: Very good.  Very positive.  I missed a few birdie chances at the start.  I stayed patient, made a bogey and I was 1-over.  Got some good up-and-downs for par and I just stayed patient at the end and I dropped a few putts.  It was not easy out there, windy.  The greens got pretty firm and fast, so very happy.   
 Q.  What was going for you really well today?  
THOMAS DETRY: I've got some good momentum on the greens.  I missed a few but I've made some good ones, as well, for birdie.  I'm just going to come out really focusing on hitting fairways.  The course is really firming up a lot, so I can even hit 3-iron off the tee and just bust a 3-iron 250 meters.  So really, hitting fairways.   
 Q.  Obviously looking forward to a good weekend and well up there, as well.  
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, a lot of fun.  Very exciting to be out there for the weekend.  It's been a while since I've been up there, so very excited and looking forward to that.
