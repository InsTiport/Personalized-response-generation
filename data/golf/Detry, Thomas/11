 Q.  Fantastic run of five in a row on the back nine,  
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, couldn't ask for anything else.  Got off to a good start.  Birdied the first, and a bit slow.  Did a little bogey there on the 10th, but for me it's one of the toughest holes on the course.  I managed those holes like 10, 11, pretty well, and then got it going.  Took advantage of the par 5 and sneak in a few extra in between.  That was really good.   
 Q.  Game looks in good shape heading into the end of the year.  You've dropped five shots which week, which is pretty impressive, even on a course that you can score low on.  
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, and it shows how important the rest is.  I wasn't playing that bad of golf a few weeks ago, but I just needed two weeks of rest to have fresh mind and fresh swing and I got here with a fresh mind and fresh body and that's what happens, top three, pretty happy.   
 Q.  And a Rolex Series Event, as well, lots of World Ranking points on offer and a chance to climb even further up The Race to Dubai?  
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, I'm trying to reach the top 30 now.  I think we're getting closer, so very good, very happy.
