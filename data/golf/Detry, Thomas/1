Q Thomas, a 67, leading by one going into the weekend.  Sum up your first two days for us?
THOMAS DETRY:   First thing that comes to my mind is bogey-free, on this course, that's a pretty good achievement.  Let's keep it that way.
I've been playing some really good golf, keeping it on the fairway and hitting every single green and getting up-and-down a couple good times.  So I'm very pleased.
Q Watching the broadcast, you seemed very much in control of the golf ball.  Is that a fair assessment?
THOMAS DETRY:   Yeah, exactly right.  The course, it can bite you at any time.  There's some thick rough around the green and hazards on tee shots, as well.  Yeah, the key is knowing when to hitting a conservative shot and hitting aggressive shots.
Q How are you going to attack this weekend?
THOMAS DETRY:   Attack this weekend, it's a good question.  I'm just going to take the exact same approach.  It's been working really well.  Maybe on the back nine -- I know the front nine can be a bit tricky, but the nine, plenty of birdie opportunities.  So if I can keep it that way and take advantage of those par 5s, it will be pretty special.
Q You've come close on a couple of occasions to win on The European Tour.  How special would it be to do it here?
THOMAS DETRY:   Can would be extra special.  I'm moving here in a couple weeks, as well, so this is my new residence.  So winning at home would be amazing.
