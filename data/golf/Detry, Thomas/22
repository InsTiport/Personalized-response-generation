Q. What are your thoughts on today's rounds?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, it was way different than the last few days.  Not a lot of wind, almost pretty much nothing this morning early at 7.00am.  Greens were perfect.  I made a good putt on my second hole for birdie and from there on I just had it going and I kept making some good putts.  A bogey-free round, very pleased with that.  It was a good day.
Q. As you say, the wind has been really calm this morning.  Do you think that's going to be important for getting a good score?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, it's a way different game when the wind starts to get up.  The greens even for short putts, it's way different.  We'll see, if the wind stays down, I think we can expect some good scores this afternoon.
Q. And you hit three birdies in a row.  How much does that give you confidence?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, I hit it very close on the par 3, 17, my eighth hole, and the two par 5s, I knew could I do something on those par 5s.  That was good to get me three birdies in a row to get me to 5-under.  Unfortunately couldn't make any birdies after that but still very pleased with a bogey-free round.
Q. Yesterday you seemed to be quite confident; did you see that in your round?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, starting off the season strong in South Africa a couple weeks ago, it makes a big difference.  So I'm confident in my game.  I think if I keep doing what I'm doing, I'll be fine for the week and the rest of the season.
