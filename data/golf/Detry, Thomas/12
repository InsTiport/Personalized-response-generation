Q. Thomas, that's a great start, a 66.  Is there a feeling with conditions being this good, you've got to go out and shoot low?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, you've got to shoot low, definitely.  The course is gettable, the rough is not that high and the greens are just perfect.  No wind this morning.  It definitely feels good to shoot low on a supposedly easy golf course, but you've still got to play some good golf.
Q. You got off to a good start, which is always a nice basis to build a good score?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, definitely.  I was well rested.  The last two weeks, I just worked out, took it easy at home, and yeah, I felt well rested today.  It feels great to get off to a good start, 2-under after three and from there on, you can just build up on that and manage the par 5s pretty well and that's what I did.
Q. Psychologically, you know on a course like this, you have to shoot well four days in a row to be in contention.  Does that put extra pressure on the game?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, definitely.  I think if you think about it, it puts a little bit of pressure but you think you have to play your own game and see what happens.  You know there are plenty of birdie opportunities out here, so if you are a few over after a few holes, just take it easy and you know you'll make some birdies.
