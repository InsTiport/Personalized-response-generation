Q. Round of 69 today in what seemed to be tough scoring conditions for everyone. How pleased are you with your round?
THOMAS DETRY: Very, very happy. I made -- pretty much missed only one shot today. I hit a cart path and went into the trees and made double-bogey, but other than that, played some really good golf. Made a little bogey on 18. It's a tough hole, 18. I hit a good drive, just a trickle in the bunker. Didn't get up-and-down. Very happy with the way I'm playing. I think it's going to be a fun battle tomorrow definitely.
Q. You came alive over the back nine, what did you find that helped push up the leaderboard?
THOMAS DETRY: I've always been mad at myself every time I made a mistake and this course is really demanding and I only made one mistake and it cost me a lot. I was just trying to stay focused and tell myself, it's okay, I paid the price. There's no reason you can't make birdies to make up for it on the next few holes, and that's what I did. I'm very happy with that.
Q. Playing again with Zander and Louis tomorrow. Crowds are going to be bigger and rooting for the home guys. How much do you feel flying under the radar can be a benefit and how much are you looking forward to it?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, definitely, I hit a few shots today where I was like, that deserves a little bit more clapping. But overall, it's fantastic to play with these two guys. Louis is great and Zander, as well. The atmosphere is fantastic out there and I'm very much looking forward to tomorrow.
