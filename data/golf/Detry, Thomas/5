Q. Lovely 66 out there today. How was that?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, great. Got off to a great start. Birdie, birdie. We start off the round with a par 5, it's always good when you get that birdie on the first hole, get it going a little bit. It felt really good. There was no wind out there. The greens were really good. Just played some really good golf. Very happy with 6-under.
Q. Is there anything specific in the game that you think you did well today?
THOMAS DETRY: The rough is quite thick in some parts, and I've been driving the ball pretty well, so I've been able to take advantage of the par 5s. I think I made birdie on every par 5 out there, and there are five out there. If you can make five birdies on the par 5s, you only have a few par 4s to make birdie on, and you're 5-, 6-, 7-under for the day.
Q. A few bogeys but you got back straightaway. That must be pleasing?
THOMAS DETRY: Yeah, I misjudged my iron on the 8th and followed up with three birdies. That was really, really good. Trying to work on the mental aspect of the game, as well, and it's been working.
