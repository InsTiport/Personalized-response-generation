Q. 1-under par, seemed like quite a battle?
THOMAS DETRY: Like I said earlier, it's a tough course. Anything can happen. Played some really good golf. I was 4-under. Made a bogey on 15. Brought it back with a birdie on 16 and on 17, it could have been a high number there. Limit the damage with a double-bogey and a bit unlucky on 18. Hit a great drive, 300 metres down the middle. But it's golf and just move on and see tomorrow.
Made a good bogey with a lost ball on one of the tough holes out there. It's not easy. You have to stay patient. If you start making bogeys and high numbers, you can quickly get going with the high numbers. Sometimes you have to take your medicine, hit fairways, and hope for the best.
Q. Nice to know that if you can limit the mistakes, you can still get a good score out there for yourself?
THOMAS DETRY: The putter seems to be working. Whole swing seems to be working, as well. Anything can happen on the weekend. A few guys ahead of me, a few guys behind me. I think it's going to be a fun battle.
Q. Third at the moment. What is the plan for tomorrow?
THOMAS DETRY: Just take it the same way I took it. Hit some fairways, hit some greens and make some putts. That simple.
