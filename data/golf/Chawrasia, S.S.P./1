 Q.  How would you sum up your week in Shanghai?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: It's good, very good, nice weather.  Good golf course.  Good tournament.  Yeah, I'm quite enjoying this week.   
 Q.  The last few weeks you've played in two really big events, one in Malaysia, one in Shanghai, playing against these big boys, the top guys here.  Must be a good experience.  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Oh, yeah, definitely it's a good experience.  I played Malaysia and this week, and really, it's the top players.  I learned many things.  I have to improve myself.  I learned so many things, yeah.   
 Q.  Maybe you could just describe one of the things you learned about yourself.  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: To be honest, they know how to make a score and I'm thinking, the same way, so basically, they are really very good.  Like if they hit a bad shot or whatever, a different attitude.   
For me, to be honest, sometimes it's a little bit angry or sometimes it's frustrating.  But they don't care.  They just forget and thinking the next shot.  A couple of more things, so that's a good attitude; I have to learn, yeah.
