  Q. Your thoughts on the day? What was working for you?  
 SSP CHOWRASIA: I'm playing very well today because I holed a few chips and a few putts, which is good. Actually these greens, actually line reading is very easy compared to the old greens. That's why I'm playing well.   
  
  Q. So you like this course compared to the old course?  
 SSP CHOWRASIA: Yeah, I like before, also. Same course but just changed greens. Old greens is very tough to read the line. This one I think is easier to read.  
  
  Q. I know the last two years have not been the best here at Wentworth, have they, so do you approve of the changes?   
 SSP CHOWRASIA: I play a few times this course, so yeah, actually now I'm a little bit used to the course. So that's why it's playing easier for me.   
  
  Q. Tell me the highlight today, best thing out there?  
 SSP CHOWRASIA: Actually the third hole, I chipped in for birdie, and made birdie on 4 and birdie on 5. So my turning point is 3, 4, 5. That's why I'm playing very well because my concentration is good.
