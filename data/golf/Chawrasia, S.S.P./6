  S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   It was very good, I change a little bit my game planning because the last few weeks‑‑ after change, we change my irons, so it's much better, this week also putting very good.  
   
 Q.   What was it you changed?   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   Changes, I just spoke to Thongchai and Jeev, and I said, how you guys play, and they say, look, just hit straight ball and green, 2‑putt, 2‑putt.   So this week, actually.   
   
 Q.   Thongchai and Jeev play well every week, Jeev played well at Royal Portrush and he's playing well here.   Did they give you good advice?   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   Yeah, both guys say that you just hit‑‑ you always hit straight and hit green and 2‑putt, 2‑putt, you see the birdie automatically coming.   
   
 Q.   Easy game.   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   If you play good, it looks easy.  
   
 Q.   How often have you played links golf?   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   Normally I'm not playing links courses but I like links course, because I chip and roll, and really, really like‑‑ I play normally free.   
   
 Q.   Do you like the challenge around the greens with all of the undulations?   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   Yeah, I really like it.   We play actually‑‑ we never play links course, maybe one a year, play one or two course.   But I like it, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Must be lovely to be up on a leaderboard, because it hasn't happened a lot for a while, has it.   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   This week I'm playing very, very good, so let's see.   
   
 Q.   Have you been frustrated working hard and not seeing results?   
S.S.P. CHOWRASIA:   A little bit frustrated but still, it's okay.
