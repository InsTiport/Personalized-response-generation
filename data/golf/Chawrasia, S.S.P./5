Q.   Pleased with the way you finished on the back nine?
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA:   My back nine is really very well.   I just make a few putts, except last hole. 

Q.   Did you sense that you had a chance? 
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA:   Oh, yeah, I saw the leaderboard after 16, so I'm twoâ€‘thirds behind.   So 17, I make a birdie and one shot behind.   So obviously I press a little bit, so I'm trying to play the same routine but the last hole tee shot I hit left.
Anyway, I make a bogey but it's a good chance to win.

Q.   We spoke early on in the week; it's a course where nobody runs away and you always have that opportunity. 
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA:   This course is really a very tricky course honestly.   It's not for long hitter advantage and not for short hitter.   It's a very tricky course.   Every player, it's the same. 

Q.   Do you take a lot of confidence about the way you've played and the finish? 
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA:   I got really many, many confidence.   So I play next week in Macou, so hopefully same confidence I play there.
