 Q.  Talk about your round?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: I played really well, started five birdies in a row, one bogey.  So I'm happy with 4-under.   
 Q.  That was pretty special, wasn't it, when it was red figure after red figure; when are you chuckling to yourself when that happens?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Honestly I was hitting very well the front nine, and the back nine, I'm a little bit struggling, but still, I had a couple.  It's good.   
 Q.  Is that down to you or is that the nature of this golf course?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: You can say the both, me and the golf course, also, because I like this course.  I've played many times here.   
 Q.  I thought you would like this.  This is nice, old style, isn't it?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Yeah, where I live, Kolkata, it's a very similar golf course to Calcutta Golf Club.  So it's a good advantage for me.   
 Q.  You know what I've got to ask:  You're right on the bubble in terms of European Tour this year.  So what are your thoughts this week?  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: I just cross fingers and play.  I just keep my confidence and play because I know I'm borderline.  So it's a very important week this week.   
 Q.  In a sense, you don't have to do too much, do you?  You just have to treat it like a normal week.  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Yeah, that's my plan, actually.  I don't take much pressure.  I'm just playing my game.   
 Q.  Have you had a lot of people coming up to you and talking about this?  Because as an affiliate member, you have sort of a bearing on what other people do, as well.  
S.S.P. CHAWRASIA: Yeah, most of the people are coming and asking the same question all the time.  I say, boss, I just cross and just focus my game.
