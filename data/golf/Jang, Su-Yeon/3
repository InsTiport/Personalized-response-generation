Q. Ten feet on 18?
SU YEON JANG: Yep.  17, 15 feet.
Q. How much of what happened today was inspired by what happened yesterday with no birdies?  Did that have an impact on what you did today?
SU YEON JANG: (Through translation.)  Same situation yesterday, but on 17 I couldn't make on the green on second shot.  On 17.
Q. I'm just talking about the whole round.  When she didn't have any birdies yesterday after such a good start the first two days, wondering if that inspired her to play better today.
THE INTERPRETER: I'm not quite sure what your question is.
Q. She shot ten shots lower today than yesterday, so I am wondering if her frustration yesterday made her play better today.
THE INTERPRETER: She played better yesterday, yeah.  Not today.  What did she learn from yesterday?
Q. Yeah.  Yeah.
SU YEON JANG: (Through translation.)  I was very nervous yesterday.  Like I wasn't really sure.  I wasn't ready.  This is my first time to play LPGA, so I was in the champion's group and I was very nervous.
Q. What would you do different next time?
SU YEON JANG: I like to enjoy next time, to play better.
Q. Enjoy it more?
SU YEON JANG: Yeah, enjoy it more.
THE INTERPRETER: She thinks LPGA player like enjoying to play.  That's what she feels about it.  Different than Korea and here.  So she would like to enjoy next time she has chance.
