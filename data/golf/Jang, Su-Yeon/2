Q. How does it feel to be back here after playing so well last year?
SU-YEON JANG: (Through translation.)  It's good to come back to a place that I know.  Although I only played 18 holes this year in practice, as I'm playing the golf course the memories are coming back to me.  And I have a lot of good memories of the golf course.
Q. What did you think about your round today?
SU-YEON JANG: (Through translation.)  I think overall I didn't have the best feel for my shots all around, but I had a pretty good feel for my putts.
I think that was why I was able to have a pretty good round today.
