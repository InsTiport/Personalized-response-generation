THE MODERATOR: Happy to be joined in the media center by Su-Yeon Jang.
Another solid round out there today.  What's been the key this week for you?
SU-YEON JANG: I came and practiced some rounds here at the Ko Olina and I learned how to play with the wind.  It's really a great honor for me to be invited to play in this tournament.
Just trying to take every moment to enjoy and think of it as a learning opportunity.  I have not put too much pressure.  It's been a great learning experience for me.
THE MODERATOR: You'll be in the final group with In Gee Chun.  Having her in that group make it a little bit more comfortable for you?
SU-YEON JANG: We came up together in the amateur ranks.  We are good friends since amateur and we played tour together.  I think tomorrow being paired up with her I'm going to be able to enjoy my round.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. Having won last week, having that recent experience, how much is that going to help you going into tomorrow?
SU-YEON JANG: To answer your question, winning the in the last week I think I gained some of the confidence I may have lost in the past.
If it was another week before winning the tournament I may have been a little bit more nervous.
Going into tomorrow I'm confident and comfortable playing in the champion's group.
Q. Talk about Katie Burnett's game today.
SU-YEON JANG: I think she is very cute and very well mannered, so we really enjoy playing together today.
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  Appreciate the time.  Best of luck tomorrow.
SU-YEON JANG: Thank you.
