Q.   Talk about your day. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It has to be the best iron play I've ever had in my life.   So, yeah, it was pretty special out there.

Q.   What's it like playing in the position you're in for the first time.   You played this game a long time, what's it like?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Apart from nerve wracking, anxious.   No, it was good fun.   It was great.   First time I played with Hale today.   I played with John a few times on the Champions Tour last year. 
But, yeah, it was very relaxed, felt good out there.   I felt in the right place mentally, so long may it continue.

Q.   Same routine going on tonight?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah.   Supposed to go out with Bobby Clampett and David Frost around to their place, but I'm going to cancel, I'm going to go back to the restaurant I've been eating at every night.

Q.   Have they thought about giving you a commercial?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   They gave me a mug to remember them by.   But I still have to pay the bill though.   All the publicity I'm getting them.

Q.   Just talk about keeping that routine, not wanting to mess that up. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, go back to the same place, same, nearly the same table, same book.   Just chill, really.   Just taking my mind off the game tomorrow.   I'll try and sleep tonight and come out fighting tomorrow.

Q.   How neat has this week been for you?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It's been fantastic.   I was fortunate to get a sponsors invite to this tournament four years ago at Canterbury, I had a hole‑in‑one there, so it's a pretty special tournament for me. 

Q.   For tomorrow, just how do you feel?   You played so well, do you have a lot of confidence heading into tomorrow?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I do, yeah.   As I said earlier, I'm just in a great place with the mindset.   I don't know what's gone wrong.
(Laughter.)

Q.   What book are you reading?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   The Phantom, by, I can't remember his name now.   It's a series of books about a detective in Sweden.   It's good.   I'm just getting into it now.
