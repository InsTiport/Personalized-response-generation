  MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Chapman, 68, 6 under par for the Championship.  
   
 Q.   A good round, but seems like all the activity was on the back nine.   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, it was one of those days where it just didn't quite play as well as I wasthe last two days.   I struggled, but I kept it making pars on the first sort of eight holes and birdied 9 and 10.   And I thought here we go.   But had a poor tee shot on 11, pulled it left, made bogey there.  
Hit reasonable tee shot down 12, but it just rolled off the fairway onto a sort of hanging lie, and I took 5 there.   And then on 13, I just tried to hit a high 4 iron in there because I thought it was in between clubs.   I just came out of it a bit and didn't get there and chipped and two‑putted.  
And then sort of ‑‑ just sort of ground out a birdie at 15, good birdie at 16 from about ten feet, and then birdied the last.   So never gave up, really.  
   
 Q.   Three straight 68s.   In order to catch Mr. Langer, you've got to go deeper than that.   Is that in your bag for tomorrow, you believe?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Not the way I played today.   The way I played yesterday, yes, it's there.   I'll probably need 63, 64, something like that, depending on the conditions, weather conditions tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Factor into the fact that a lot of guys have said that Bernhard is a great frontrunner.   He's not a guywho's going to go back ‑‑  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   He's not going to back off, no.   He's going to be tough to beat.   What has he got, a five‑shot lead at the moment?   
Yeah, if you're going to beat him tomorrow, you're going to have to play really, really well.  
   
 Q.   But you're one of the guys in contention.   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Well, thank you.  
   
 Q.   Well played.
