 Q.   Some days everything goes right and other days nothing goes right?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I just had two bad shots on 5, just pushed my tee shot on 5, it hit a tree and then went down into the water on 6.   I took a 7 there.   
Then pushed my tee shot on 6 went in the same water.   So I dropped five shots there.   And that was ‑‑ and then you try and force it and you make other mistakes, you go for birdies and miss putts back and, but it's one of those days.   
   
 Q.   Summarize the experience of defending?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, the year's been fantastic.   The PGA of America looked after me, unbelievably.   Julius Mason and the media team have done anything that I've wanted or asked for.   They have been brilliant.   And whoever wins today will have the time of their life.   It's just a wonderful experience.   
   
 Q.   How would you describe the experience?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It's brilliant.   All the crowds were great.   Everybody was so friendly.   The course for me was a bit obviously ‑‑ the way I was playing it was a bit tough, but it's been a wonderful experience.   
Everybody at Bellerive has been fabulous.   We had the Champion's Dinner on Tuesday night and the chef, Kevin, cooked a fantastic meal.   I have no complaints, apart from the way I played.   So that's it.
