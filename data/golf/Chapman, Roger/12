Q.   Talk about your round today as defending champion. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   A little bit nervous on the first.   When they called your name and you think, well that's okay.   And then 2012 U.S. PGA defending champion, I thought, wow, hang on. 
So, yeah, I was a bit nervous.   I got off to a shaky start.   Although I birdied or parred the first three.   Didn't birdie the fourth hole, the par‑5. 
But I just sort of stuck in there, hung around, and I didn't play great, sort of up‑and‑down a few times for pars.   So overall 72, in the breeze today, wasn't too bad. 

Q.   How did the course play today?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Played okay.   They put the tees up a couple of holes, which was good. 
The wind was into, it was a totally different wind than we sort of practiced with, so practice rounds go out the window. 
But it was playing tough.   Sometimes the wind got up and then it died down and you were, couple of times I was over the green because the wind died and then I would come up short so it was a frustrating day.

Q.   How about the greens?   Talk a little bit about the greens.   I know they're big. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   They're big and they tucked the pins away today, so you had to just sort of not so easy to get close to them, but they're putting well.   Just missed the putt on the last.   Just hit a spike mark and just jumped to the right.   So 71 would have tasted better.
