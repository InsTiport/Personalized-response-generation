Q.   First off, we have been hearing that you hit the ball pretty good today, you just couldn't get the scoring down.   What happened out there?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Just the putting again was just woeful.   How many putts I missed from inside four feet, I do not know. 
Then you start to get jittery about it and then you think, well, am I reading it right or am I pulling it or ‑‑ every one was left, so I must have been just moving my head and just anxious to see it go in and then just pulling them left.   So something to work on. 
But as tee to green, it wasn't too bad.   Quite happy.   I made some adjustments last week, just got that right hand on top of the club a bit more and it made the back swing better.   I was hitting good quality shots, but just the putting let me down this week. 

Q.   What's the difference between this tournament this year and two years ago when you took home the trophy?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Well, I was hitting the greens and I was hitting in the right areas.   I was also hitting a lot of iron shots close.   So I was having lots of chances. 
But not quite the quality of two years ago this year.   So we'll be back here in a couple years time and we'll see if we can rectify it.
