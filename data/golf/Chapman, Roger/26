 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It's a bit surprising because we only had one tournament in Europe this year.   So very happy.  
   
 Q.   Talk about what's been going right for you.   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Well I've been driving the ball well.   I think I missed maybe two fairways or one fairway all week, so far and I've hit I think 16 greens yesterday and 16 today.   So you got to have chances when you hit the greens.  
   
 Q.   How is it having a guy like Hale Irwin with a resume like that chasing you?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It's a bit daunting.   But we'll see what goes tomorrow.   I mean, I just, obviously the old cliche, concentrate on your own game, one shot at a time, and everything.   
So it's the first time I've been in this situation, leading in a Major, so, yeah, I might have to take an Advil PM tonight to get some sleep.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever shot a course record and then bettered your score the next day?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   In a word, no.   I think my lowest is 61 in Europe.   So I think that will be difficult to beat that the next day.  
   
 Q.   Talk about how the course played today at least in your mind.   Most of your peers seem to think it was quite a bit easier today.   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, it was.   The wind had changed 180 degrees, so I mean it was nowhere near as strong as it was yesterday.   We got the best of the end of the draw yesterday morning and this afternoon, because I think it died down a bit this afternoon as well.   
So, yeah, it was a lot easier and you could control your shots a bit more today.
