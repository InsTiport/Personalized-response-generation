Q.   How did it go out there today?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   If I could putt, I would be within a shot of it over the two days. 
I left a lot of putts short, on line, just can't get the pace of them this year, they're quite slow. 
I suppose, realistically, I should be 3‑ or 4‑ under.   So playing okay, just got to get the putts in.

Q.   What do you look forward to changing anything over the weekend other than your putting?
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I might change the putter.   No, just keep doing what I'm doing.   I'm giving myself chances, so it would be nice to convert them.   That's all there is, really, just try and convert the putts.
