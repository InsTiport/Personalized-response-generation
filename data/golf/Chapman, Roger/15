  ROGER CHAPMAN:   So much riding on it.   At least I had a shot at doing something.   It's just too bad.   Just had a painkiller and an injection about an hour ago and that really hasn't kicked in much.   Still restricted on the swing and everything.   
I just literally woke up on Wednesday morning, went to the event Wednesday night, fine.   Woke up Thursday morning very stiff.   Sort of was five minutes from pulling out yesterday but sort of gave it a go and sort of managed to get it around.   
And then this morning it was just even worse.   When I lie on my back, I couldn't even lift myself up.   I had to go on my side and then push myself up.   
I was absolutely shattered on Wednesday night, slept fantastic and just woke up and the pillows must have been‑‑ they were quite firm, anyway.   It's a crook neck, and just one of those things, very, very disappointed.  
Haven't had much luck at this tournament.   But yeah, would loved to have joined Gary Player, but yeah, there we go.   One of those things.   I've pulled out of Minnesota next week so just got to try to get it fixed.   
   
 Q.   Still a lot to play for?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, I still want to win the Order of Merit over here, and wouldn't mind winning the Order of Merit over there.  
   
 Q.   A couple of weeks off?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   No, US PGA at Kiawah.   Then Dick's Sporting Goods and then back for Speedy and Travis Perkins.   I don't know whether it's a combination of going over the Atlantic quite a few times in the past six or seven weeks.   
   
 Q.   What about the girls in the physio truck, what have they said?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I saw them yesterday.   Saw Patrick in the morning.   Eased a little bit.   I saw the girls in the afternoon, went home, and just trying to chill as much as I could.   And it's just like a crook neck, like a spasm or something.   
   
 Q.   Hopefully just a temporary thing?   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, I woke up last night and I was actually worried that it might be sort of vertebrae, because it felt as though it was right on the bone.   Got quite worried.   Then fingers and toes, they were moving.   
   
 Q.   Playing with Greg and Tom‑‑  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   It was great.   They were chatting down the fairway.   Just a Sunday morning three ball.   
   
 Q.   Would have been nice to have done it again?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, I've just seen Tom upstairs and just sort of wished him all the best.  
   
 Q.   Have you spoke to them both?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   No, I believe Greg is having a back spasm in the physio unit.   Tom could be playing on his own.  
I m just so disappointed because history beckoned and I would love to have equalled Gary Player s record and I felt like I could have done well round here.
