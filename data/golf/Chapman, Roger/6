Q.   What happened out there today? 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Just played rubbish, that was it.   Drove the ball terrible.   Had one birdie.   That's it.

Q.   You said that you had to try to find a driver before the weekend started.   Obviously, that wasn't in the cards, I guess. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I hit it okay on the practice ground, and just it's a mental block now.   Just can't hit a fairway.   If you can't hit a fairway out here, you can't score.   Simple as that.

Q.   Disappointed in the fact of defending champion and you can't play on the weekend? 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yes, very.   It's not what I wanted.   I had a great 12 months in the USGA.   I've been brilliant.   Omaha Country Club has been fantastic too. 
Disappointing, but I played with Fred today.   He's starting to play nicely.   So he won't be far away.

Q.   Is he putting better today, do you think, than he was yesterday? 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Yeah, he got the ball up to the hole today, and I think we probably got the best of the greens again this morning.   Breeze is up again, but I think they'll dry out and get tricky this afternoon.

Q.   What quality is it going to take most for somebody to win this tournament? 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   As I said, keep it on the fairway.   I hit a shot down on the 9th today, and you think, well, it's on the fairway, and then it just rolls off into the rough, into a thick lie, and what are you going to do? 
So just drive the ball well and putt well and hit your irons well, you should be all right.

Q.   Okay.   Thanks, Roger. 
ROGER CHAPMAN:   Thanks.
