  Q. You had a great round out there. How did it feel?  
 ROGER CHAPMAN: I enjoyed it. Yesterday I got off to a very, very nervous start. I hit quite a good tee shot, but it was in a really bad lie and I called for a ruling and didn't get it and took six and 3-putted the next. So I was 3-over after two. So things weren't looking too good.   
 But I hung in there yesterday, shot 74 in tough conditions yesterday afternoon.   
 And then today just felt much more comfortable today. I got off to a nice start, birdied the 10th and just kept going from there.  
  
  Q. You had four birdies.   
 ROGER CHAPMAN: Yeah.   
  
  Q. What did you have for breakfast?  
 ROGER CHAPMAN: Oh, whatever it was I'm going to have it again. But, no, as I say, it was a lot fairer today, the greens were more receptive, you could almost fire at the flags today. Whereas yesterday it was hitting the greens and see if they could stay on.   
 But, no, I played lovely. The first nine of my back nine, the front side, back side, whatever you call it, I played lovely and just sort of hung on the last few.
