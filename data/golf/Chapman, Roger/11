 Q.   Talk about your round.   It looks like you're going to make the cut on the number.   Your thoughts on your round.   
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I haven't played very well this week.   So yeah, if I make the cut it's a bonus, but it's just one of those things.   Never got it going at all today.   Missed a couple of short putts on the No. 1 and number 3.   One for par, one for birdie, which is my back nine.   And then I made a stupid mistake on 5 to double bogey that there.   
And then sort of just tried to hang in there, but I birdied ‑‑ good up‑and‑down on 8 for birdie.   
And then just dropped one at the last.   Which sort of summed the day up.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts then on moving day tomorrow?   What are you going to have to do?  
ROGER CHAPMAN:   I'm going to have to get into red figures, if I make the cut.   The cut was 68 or something.   That would go down well.   But the way I'm playing, that would be a miracle.
