Q.  You've got to be excited about this round, can you talk about how everything set up for you, your feelings throughout the day as you kept going lower and lower?
YU PING LIN:  Oh, I don't know about lower and lower, but you know I'm happy to have 3 under every day here.  This year I've struggled a little bit so maybe I can just make the cut.  I'm happy I finally got some confidence in myself, especially the red score.
Q.  What brought you down to 3 under, was it your driving, your irons, putting?
YU PING LIN:  Today just    I played this course a couple of times already and it's really firm, especially I'm not a high ball striker, so just take advantage and just played very smart and put it in the right positions on the greens and then take a 2 putt and go to the next hole.  That's my trend for the day.
Q.  You said you're not a high ball striker, did it not affect you as much?
YU PING LIN:  The wind didn't pick up until the back nine, yeah.

Probably the wind, but especially the downwind and side wind, did not really affect my ball that much.
