 Q.  Alongside Yealimi Noh, part of the final group of the day at 7-under par, and you were 3-under on the par-3s, including chipping in on your next-to-last hole of the day. What kind of momentum did that give you at the end to push through and finish strong?  
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, before that chip-in I actually missed like a two-footer for par on a hole that I was trying to birdie, so I was kind of mad, and I was like, I need a birdie to get it back. I was trying to hit the green, but it was like way short, but ended up chipping in, so it was nice.   
 Q.  You're killing it off Monday qualifying; you shot a 63 in the first round at Thornberry Creek after Monday qualifying, a 65 today. What kind of focus does Monday qualifying bring to your game?  
YEALIMI NOH: I think just having one day to get in or go home basically, so just -- I was just like, if I just get in, it would be really great to play. I played well on the Monday, so I was like, I just hope to keep doing that all week.   
 Q.  What did you learn from the 4-under effort in your Monday qualifier about the course?  
YEALIMI NOH: About the course, definitely you want to hit a lot of fairways and greens. The greens are pretty -- they're rolling really nice, but it was a little wet today, so it was nice it held the ball a little better.   
 Q.  What adjustments do you make with the green holding?  
YEALIMI NOH: Just kind of going at the pin a lot. I was just hitting the yardages and not really thinking about the roll-outs, so just trying to hit the pin, and I got pretty close.
