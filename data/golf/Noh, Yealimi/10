Q. 4-under.
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah.
Q. What's it like just to be here? You've built up all year for this moment. What's it like competing and kind of the feel out there? It's kind of cutthroat I would imagine.
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, and like especially I think I was really lucky with the tee times, like playing pretty late, last tee time both days. Yesterday playing in sunny weather from the start was nice; today I heard it was pretty cold in the morning, too. So playing in the afternoon, nice weather, really grateful for that.
And just being here, I mean, field is pretty small. Just scrolling I don't have to scroll like last week. So many scrolling.
But, yeah, it's nice to be here. The course is in good condition. Yeah, nice weather and I'm playing pretty solid.
Q. Have you ever played here, any Pinehurst course?
YEALIMI NOH: No, first time. Oh, no. Just kidding. U.S. Kids. I don't know if it was here.
Q. Pine Needles?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, somewhere around there, yeah.
Q. Compared to the experiences you've had on the LPGA, how much does it compare to really getting you really ready for that level?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, I definitely -- especially last week, getting through last week was really tough for me because I was super jet lagged and really tired. Just getting through the week was so much stress. Like just getting through that week I'm playing a lot more comfortable this week. Like I'm super relaxed. Not super, but like I'm very much more comfortable.
Last week I was so tense and put so much pressure on myself, but this week I'm just playing my game and then see where it goes. Yeah.
