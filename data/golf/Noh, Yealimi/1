  Q. The question is:  It's a big deal make it to this event.  How does it feel as a rookie?
 YEALIMI NOH:   It feels really good.  I definitely made CME one of my biggest goals beginning of the year to make it with the full schedule, but with half the schedule I was still trying get into CME.
 And just being here in nice warm weather is really nice.
 Q. Do you know anything about the golf course it is it your first time?
 YEALIMI NOH:   It's my first time, but I did watch some of the Shark -- what is it -- the Shootout on TV.  So, yeah.
 Q. Had you watched this event before?
 YEALIMI NOH:   Yes, I have watched it before, but like watching it and being on the course is totally different.  Kind of like Florida golf course feel, so...
