Q. 11-under through 36 holes, you had a bogey at six and then six birdies in a row. What did you tell yourself after the 6th that got you going?
YEALIMI NOH: After the 6th, the par 3 was next and I was in the bunker and I had a par putt for like 25 feet. I was like, oh, I don't want to end this streak on a bogey. Thankfully I made it on a par. I think that's the longest I've ever gone for birdies in a row.
Q. What does that feel like?
YEALIMI NOH: I just kept hitting everything close, like after the first birdie, like once I got to two, three, I kept sticking it and making putts.
Q. Did the first birdie give you confidence to go after the pins more aggressively?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, especially after the bogey, that was really not what I was hoping for, and then birdieing that par 5 really helped go off after.
Q. Going to 18, you had an eight-footer for par that you converted yesterday at the end of the round, and at 9 you had an 8-footer at the end that you converted. What does that give you momentum-wise going into the next day?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, definitely, because every stroke counts. I was looking at the leaderboard on some holes and it was like one stroke was like seven or eight places, so I was like, every stroke counts. Just making par putts -- birdies are important but the pars are even more.
