Q. Just your quick overall thoughts of making it to the championship match after a great -- you played really well in stroke play, obviously, and then you've won now five matches to get to the final.
YEALIMI NOH: I'm really excited.  I'm feeling good with my game right now.  I think I made four birdies and no bogeys.  It was a tough match, though.  Every time I was up like 2 -- I didn't get past 2-up until the last hole because she made birdies, like long putts, and it was back and forth, so it was a really good match.
Q. Was there a particular putt that really stands out from the match today?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, there were two.  Towards the end on 14, the par-4, I hit my first shot in the bunker on the left, and then I shanked it out into the other bunker next to the green, and then I got out, had about nine feet, and I made that for par.  And then just now on 16, I was in the bunker again, got out, and I had about nine feet, ten feet for par.
Q. Your thoughts about playing Alexa Pano.  I know you guys were battling last week at the Girls' Junior.
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, I actually played the practice round with her at the Girls' Junior last week, so yeah, it'll fun playing with her.
Q. How do you feel about where your game is at?  Do you feel like you're at the right spot with your game going into a 36-hole final?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, I feel like -- I just need to hit a couple drives because I mis-hit a couple of them at the end, but yeah, I'm feeling good with my putting and my short game.
Q. Obviously you're about to play for a big prize, obviously Girls' Junior and then a spot in the Women's Open next year?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, I'm excited.
Q. You've tried, obviously, for the Women's Open I would assume?
YEALIMI NOH: Yeah, I did.
Q. Have you ever come close?
YEALIMI NOH: I was close this year but just a few short.
