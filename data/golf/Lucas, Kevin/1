 Q.   Well, the experience continues, your firstâ€‘ever PGA tournament.   You make it to the weekend.   What was it like to finish with an eagle on 18 there?   
KEVIN LUCAS:     It was pretty cool.   I've never had a crowd go that crazy before.   I've never played in front of a crowd like that.   So it was awesome.  
   
 Q.   What does it mean to you to have that type of support playing at Nevada, come and playing in Reno?  
KEVIN LUCAS:     It's crazy all the support I've gotten.   Everybody that's come out here.   
I've met so many people that have come up to me that I've never met before that are completely behind me.   I couldn't ask for a better experience.  
   
 Q.   Is this kind of beyond your wildest dreams?   It's your first tournament and right now you're at 16 points after that eagle.   Did you expect to do this well?  
KEVIN LUCAS:     I wanted to play well.   I mean, I've been playing well leading up to this.   
But to get the turnout from everybody, from family and friends and get all the support from the University of Nevada, it's a dream come true, no doubt.
