 Q.   Tell us about your round today.   67, 5‑under, right?   
MARCO DAWSON:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How did you hit it?   
MARCO DAWSON:   I drove it well and I putted well.   Couple of the really tougher holes out here I played really well, and I played the par‑5s actually poorly.   I played them 1‑over.   
I just for some reason I can't‑‑ I'm struggling on the par‑5s.  
   
 Q.   How's the course shape?   
MARCO DAWSON:   The course is in good shape.   I don't know that I hit it in the rough.   I was either in the fairway trap or in the fairway.   I was in the rough once, I think.   
So it looked like it was pretty thick, but because it's been growing the last couple days with that sun.   I've been driving it good for about a year and a half now, really good.   So I haven't spent a whole lot of time in the rough here in the last year and a half.  
Well, driving is key around here.   So I hit quite a few greens and I made some good putts.   So that usually makes for good scoring.
