 Q.  So you had a quick start, with 4 under through nine.  What was going right for you in the beginning?  
MARCO DAWSON: Well, I was comfortable starting out.  Hit a good shot, good tee shot on the first hole.  Good iron shot, made the putt, so I had a good feeling after that.  Let's see, I just missed a putt on the par 3.  14 or -- yeah, 13.  I had a good chip in on 14, yeah.  And then birdied, I guess it was 15, 16, 17.   
 Q.  Yep.  Yes.  
MARCO DAWSON: Then hit a couple good shots on 18, and then I hit a poor drive on 1.  It just kind of went the other way.  Then just started hitting poor iron shots out there on that second nine holes.  So it was kind of a Jekyll and Hyde day today, you know, front nine/back nine type of thing.  So I'm going to have to work on my irons.  Because I hit a lot of good tee shots, but hit some really terrible iron shots.  Putted pretty good today, though.   
 Q.  You are still feeling relatively confident?  
MARCO DAWSON: Well, I've got to work on those irons because I finished poorly with the irons, you know, I got to go see what the problem is.
