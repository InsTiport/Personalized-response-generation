Q. Your thoughts on the third round so far?MARCO DAWSON: I'm sorry.Q. What are your thoughts on the third round so far?MARCO DAWSON: Just trying to stay energised, so to speak.  It was a long day.  And now it's going to be even longer because we are going to have to go quick dinner and then better going to have to get up early, finish our second nine and go back out and play another 18. This is just a survival test now.  It's been fun.Q. I take it it's good to finish on that positive, though.MARCO DAWSON: Yeah, that was a nice finish on the birdie there, so that makes you feel a lot better going into the next nine holes, so the strategy may be a little bit different.
