Q. Tough round out there obviously for you today.  Just take me through what happened.  Course playing a little harder?MARCO DAWSON: Obviously, yeah.  Yesterday I didn't quite -- I hit the ball pretty good yesterday and shot 5-under.  Today I hit it really good, I shot 5-over. I saw it with the other guys I was playing with.  A lot of good shots did not get rewarded.  As a matter of fact they got the opposite.  They actually got in more trouble than they got rewarded for. I have a bitter taste in my mouth.Q. Sure.  Credit that to playing in the afternoon, course drying out a bit or getting tough breaks?MARCO DAWSON: Yeah, it was just awful.  Just you land the ball in the fairway, goes in the rough.  Yesterday I hit balls that landed in the rough that ended up in the fairway. So today I was hitting it more where I was looking, but they didn't end up in the right spot.  I'm not sure exactly how to play now.  Maybe tomorrow I won't hit quite as good and I will have another good day.  That's the only thing I can say about it.
