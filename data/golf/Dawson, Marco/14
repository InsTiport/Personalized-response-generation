Q.   Marco Dawson, 4‑under par 68.   What was working for you out there today?
MARCO DAWSON:   I drove the ball well, and I putted well.   I made some putts on the Front 9, made a few on the Back 9, but I missed a few.   So I left a couple out there.   But I drove it well.

Q.   Were the blustery conditions much of a factor?
MARCO DAWSON:   It can be if you're not hitting the driver good.   You know, when you're hitting out of the rough and you got a flier with the wind direction.   So I was in the fairway most of the day so I could control the ball a lot better.
So you know, I hit some good iron shots when I needed to.   The longer iron shots, some of the par‑3s played long and the 18th hole played long, and I hit good iron shots when I needed to.   So it all came together pretty well, and like I said, I made some putts on the Front 9 and then I made a few, missed a few on the back.

Q.   Are the greens holding?   Are they very receptive here?
MARCO DAWSON:   Oh, yeah.   They were downwind.   They would bounce a little bit and roll out, but for the most part, yeah, they would stop.   Stop pretty much any shot.
