 Q.  You got a little bit of a lead this morning, and that was a little helpful probably  
DAVE RYAN: Yeah, I was leaking oil on 16 and 17.  Fortunately, I pulled it out.  But he made a good birdie on 15.  I mean, that kind of changed the momentum of the match a little bit, and then I hit a bad drive, and I just made a mess of the -- was it the 16th hole?  Yeah.  But I was fortunate to win.  I've had all four matches like that.   
 Q.  You mentioned last evening that you were fighting your swing a little bit.  Did you feel like you worked that out at all?  
DAVE RYAN: Yeah, I did.  I went down to the range this morning and worked it out, and then I just hit some more balls, and I think it feels better.   
 Q.  Anything in particular that you were working on?  
DAVE RYAN: Just a little rhythm and tempo and timing, yeah.   
 Q.  This is an exacting course, right?  
DAVE RYAN: Yes exactly.  It's a hard golf course.   
 Q.  What's the premium on do you feel?  
DAVE RYAN: Well, like any USGA course, you've got to drive it in the fairway and you've got to hit greens.  They identify the best ball striker this week.  They basically do.   
 Q.  What about this afternoon, what do you think?  
DAVE RYAN: Just go out and do the best I can, and whatever happens happens.   
 Q.  And you know your opponent?  
DAVE RYAN: I met him on the range a while ago.  I've never played with him before.  He's younger than I am, obviously.  Paul and I are the two old guys in this thing.   
 Q.  You two are the elder statesmen if you will?  
DAVE RYAN: That's right, the old dogs.
