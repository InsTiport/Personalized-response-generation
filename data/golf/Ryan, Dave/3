Q. After yesterday, the hole-in-one on the par-4 and then coming back to beat Paul Simpson extra holes, how do you come back out here and refocus the next day?
DAVE RYAN: Oh, he's tough.  I was very fortunate to beat him yesterday.  Match play, 18 holes, you might beat anybody.  That's the nature of the beast.
Q. Talk about the birdie on 3 to go 1-up in this match.  What happened on that hole?
DAVE RYAN: I hit a 4-iron in there about, oh, it was like three feet, something like that.
But then the next hole I bogeyed and we were even.
Q. And then you had a three hole stretch, 5 to 7, you won three holes in a row to take control.  What happened in that stretch there?
DAVE RYAN: Just played solid golf.  Fairways and greens.  And you do that on this golf course, usually it takes care of itself.
Q. And then 11, 12 to kind of, really you won two in a row there again to go to 4-up and really get some breathing room.
DAVE RYAN: Yeah, Mike hit a bad drive on 11 and in that rough over there, it's tough.  And I had 9-iron, all I had to do was 2-putt.
And then the next hole I went for it in two and had a good eagle putt, so that's kind of that.
But the next hole we both screwed up and made bogeys.  Match play is a nerve wracking experience.
Q. As far as I can tell this is the farthest you have gone in a USGA championship so far.  What's going through your head right now?
DAVE RYAN: I'm enjoying it.  Enjoying the moment.
Q. Now what do you do in the break here?
DAVE RYAN: I'm going to go get some in your nourishment.
