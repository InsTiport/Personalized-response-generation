 Q.  Congratulations.  
DAVE RYAN: I don't know what to say.  Thank you.  I'm at a loss for word.   
 Q.  An ace on a par-4, beat a two-time champ and now you just beat two-time Mid-Am champ Tim Jackson.  What's going through your head?  
DAVE RYAN: To be honest with you, I'm a little shocked.  I was fortunate to beat him and Paul Simpson.  Those are two tough guys to take down.   
 Q.  But you don't do that by accident.  You don't beat guys by accident.  You can say you're fortunate, but it takes some really good play to do that.  
DAVE RYAN: I know, I know, but it's tough.  It is.  They didn't have their best stuff.  So, that happens in match play.  In match play anybody can beat anybody.   
 Q.  That last putt, it looked like you took an aggressive line.  Were you thinking, let's just win it here, I don't want to go extra holes with Tim Jackson?  
DAVE RYAN: Yes, sir.  Fortunately, it was uphill and I just had to hit it and fortunately it went in.  That's a tough hole.   
 Q.  How much have you played here much?  I know you come in and play in qualifiers occasionally.  
DAVE RYAN: 30 years ago I qualified for my first U.S. Amateur out here, 1986.  I'm dating myself.  So, I walked and carried my own bag.   
 Q.  Shoal Creek, that amateur?  
DAVE RYAN: Yeah, Birmingham.   
 Q.  And is that -- but not often?  You haven't played this golf course often?  
DAVE RYAN: I did some U.S. Open sectional qualifiers down here over the years.   
 Q.  So when you get, I mean, this is rarified air for you.  
DAVE RYAN: Just a little bit, yeah.  Just slightly.   
 Q.  What is it like?  As the week goes on, do you get more comfortable or do you get more nervous?  
DAVE RYAN: To be honest, you get a little more comfortable as the week goes on.  I don't know what it is.  But if I got beat, I got beat.  I'm just going to go out and do the best I can and whatever happens, happens.   
 Q.  It's such a physical grind.  
DAVE RYAN: It helps having these buggies, yeah.   
 Q.  But to play two rounds, I mean.  
DAVE RYAN: For guys this age to play 36 holes in two days in a row, that's a lot of golf.   
 Q.  You played quite a few holes.  
DAVE RYAN: And I just got through playing my state Senior Amateur last week, last Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.   
 Q.  What did you do in that?  
DAVE RYAN: I won it.  But that's a lot of golf.  Illinois State Senior Amateur.   
 Q.  So you were playing well coming in?  
DAVE RYAN: I was.  I won that by nine shots.  So I played really good.  Wilmington Country Club.   
 Q.  As you look forward to tomorrow?  
DAVE RYAN: Who do I have to play?   
 Q.  Don't know yet.  There's a chance that could come here.  
DAVE RYAN: Oh, really?   
 Q.  Will you be able to sleep tonight?  
DAVE RYAN: Probably not, no.   
 Q.  Where is Taylorville from here?  An hour and a half?  
DAVE RYAN: Um-hum.   
 Q.  Will you have family here tomorrow?  
DAVE RYAN: My wife's going to come down.   
 Q.  It's only 18 holes tomorrow, that's the good thing.  
DAVE RYAN: Thank God.  Get some nourishment and maybe eat a bowl of ice cream, which I did at lunch today, that helped me.   
 Q.  What have you done well this week?  
DAVE RYAN: I probably drove the ball pretty well.  That's the key around here.  You got to drive it in the fairway.  But the last hole, I hit a good drive off the fairway by five or six yards.   
 Q.  It's very rolly polly.  
DAVE RYAN: That stuff's like a bird's nest.  I tried to hit a 6-iron to the middle of the green and it shot dead right on me out of there.   
 Q.  You often have, you rarely have an even lie here.  
DAVE RYAN: Right.   
 Q.  Do you even allow yourself to think about what it would be like to win it?  
DAVE RYAN: No, the old cliche, play it one shot at a time and whatever happens, happens.   
 Q.  You have the Del Paso hat.  Do you realize you're exempt into the Senior Open now?  
DAVE RYAN: I didn't know that.   
 Q.  You're exempt into the Am, the Mid-Am, and the Senior Open next year and you have a three-year exemption into this.  
DAVE RYAN: I made the cut in that thing when I played in it.   
 Q.  You'll be going there next year.  
DAVE RYAN: Oh, I didn't know that.   
 Q.  You're in the Mid-Am, the Am, and the Senior Open next year?  
DAVE RYAN: You got to be kidding me?  Really?  Thanks for telling me that.  I knew I was exempt for this one, but I didn't know the other two.   
 Q.  You're exempt for three years for this one.  
DAVE RYAN: Oh, wow.  That's cool.
