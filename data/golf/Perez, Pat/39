 Q.   It was a rough start out there today, but all's well that ends well.   How were you able to hang in there?  
PAT PEREZ:   You know, I've tried to have a better attitude all year.   Those were just‑‑ that was just a mishap, the three‑putts.   I don't know where those came from.   But that's not what's been going the last six weeks.   I knew I was hitting it great, if I could just give myself a couple looks, that would be‑‑ I was excited to get it back to 1‑under after bogey‑double there.   But I had some good looks.   I hit it great.   I'm excited about just being one back for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   That's the thing is the lead really hasn't moved since day one.   How tough is it out there and what kind of expectations do you have for tomorrow for the winning score?  
PAT PEREZ:   If I can putt like I did yesterday, I'll be‑‑ I think I'll be right there.   But it's hard to get the ball close.   The greens are firm.   It's a tricky course.   It's a hard course.   You've got to manage your game well around there, and you've got to make a lot of six‑, seven‑footers.   That's the way it is.  
   
 Q.   What was the atmosphere like out there in the final group today?   
PAT PEREZ:   It was awesome.   I didn't hear one person yell for me, which was great.   I didn't have any pressure on myself.   It was fun.   I love it.   Phil was great out there with everybody, and he's so fun to play with.   You know, I was hoping to birdie the last to get with him tomorrow.   But oh, well.
