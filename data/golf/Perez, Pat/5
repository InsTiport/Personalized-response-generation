PAT PEREZ: I didn't really have too much expectation playing.  The course is real long, wet.  Funny enough, I didn't make a lot of putts.  I missed a lot of putts.  Really could have been a low round.  I had a lot of good looks.  It was just kind of a nice, peaceful morning.  It was just kind of -- just one of those days where it was going right, and I got my swing kind of organized the last three days.  So if I'd have made some putts, it would have been really low.   
 Q.  Were you able to get much practice with the weather this week?  
PAT PEREZ: Yeah.  This kind of course, you don't need a whole lot of practice.  When it's that wet and that long, it's simple.  You hit the fairway.  And the greens are so big, you find a way, it's going to be good.  You make some putts, you're going to play well.  I'm not saying there's no strategy.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying it's -- you know, it's not -- it's a big course, and there's only really one way to play it.  Try to hit as far as you can and hit the fairway and try to attack the pins when the greens are soft.  That's kind of what it is.   
 Q.  (No microphone)?  
PAT PEREZ: No, he got hurt last week.  I'm just glad to see him back.  It's one of those courses where, if you had to play blind, you could.   
 Q.  Do you have higher expectations with how you've been playing?  
PAT PEREZ: No, I actually come with less because I don't play well in them.  So I don't really have any expectations in any of them.   
 Q.  So what went so well today?  
PAT PEREZ: I've been hitting -- I've been getting better hitting-wise.  I'm obviously excited to play in a Major.  I hit it well.  I just didn't make enough putts.  The fairways are wide enough you can hit them.  I feel like I can play anywhere.
