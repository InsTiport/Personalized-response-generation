 Q.   No one played this course better than you did.   What was working for you so well?  
PAT PEREZ:   I don't know.   I wasn't really all that comfortable out there.   I woke up this morning, didn't really feel that good, and I told my caddie on the range, I can't really feel my body.   My body feels weird, I don't know what's going on.   I don't know if it was breakfast or what, but I don't feel that great.   We'll see what happens.   
I birdied 1 and hit some pretty good shots, didn't hit it great, I just putted pretty well.   That was about it.  
   
 Q.   I'm thinking it's the smog or something in LA.   
PAT PEREZ:   Could be.  
   
 Q.   Do you have it figured out?  
PAT PEREZ:   I don't know.   We'll see.   I feel good now, but I didn't really‑‑ I hit some good shots and recovered well, which was the main thing.   I just made the putts I had to.   
   
 Q.   Talk about 18.   Not too many people birdie that hole.   
PAT PEREZ:   Yeah, I wasn't very happy.   I didn't really hit the driver that good today at all, and I hit it right where I didn't want to and I drew kind of a decent lie and it was actually a perfect number just to cut 6‑iron and I was trying to get it anywhere up near the green and it came out perfect, nice and high and went right around the tree, 12 feet or whatever it was, and I had a good feeling about that.   I had two of those I missed on 16 and 17, the same distance, and I said I'm going to make this one.   It was good.   
   
 Q.   Are you surprised at the number you shot?  
PAT PEREZ:   Uh‑huh.   
   
 Q.   How did you do it?   
PAT PEREZ:   I have no idea.   I just made enough putts.   I scored well.
