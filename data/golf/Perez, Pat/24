  PAT PEREZ:   When you get a morning like that with perfect conditions, you got to go after it and I was 63, go out there, you know, so I'm a little farther back than I wanted to be, but what are you going to do.

Q.   When you're playing are you keeping an eye on the leaderboard, are you keeping an eye on what's going on or playing your own game?
PAT PEREZ:   I don't need to, I know what the score's going to be at the end.   So I know that ‑‑ I know you got to make birdies and you can't make bogey and all that stuff.   I didn't birdie the holes I needed to today.

Q.   Would that be the par‑5's?   You look at every par‑5 as a birdie hole necessity?
PAT PEREZ:   I played those 3‑under.   I just didn't really ‑‑ I hit it close on a couple par‑3's and par‑4's, the short ones, I just didn't make them.   I just didn't make them. 
So, you know, it happens.   It happens.   It's hard to be disappointed with 68, but I am, because I know the leader is going to be 16 or 17 tonight.

Q.   Talking about a lot of wind possibly tomorrow, does that factor into any of your thinking about what you might do tomorrow?
PAT PEREZ:   No, I won that tournament when it was blowing 30 on that course, so I know all about it.   It will be a good test. 
I don't mind a little wind out here.   You got to hit some better shots and it tightens up a little bit for everybody.   So I'll look forward to the challenge.
