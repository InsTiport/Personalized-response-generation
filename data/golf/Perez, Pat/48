  Q. 5-under par today, great start to the tournament.   
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, it was nice. I wasn't really comfortable this morning. I wasn't really comfortable all day. I didn't hit it as good as the score would say. I made some putts. I really putted well. But you know, I hit some good shots, and it was just kind of a weird day, actually.  
  
  Q. Pretty cold out there early, too, so it wasn't easy.   
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, it was freezing. We were just trying to hit some solid shots. I started off birdie-birdie, which got me off to a nice start, then 12 was tough. I made a good 5 there. I played the holes I guess you're supposed to birdie, I birdied those, and I bogeyed the holes -- if you were going to say you'd bogey them, I bogeyed those. So it was overall pretty good, though.  
  
  Q. Take us through those first two holes.   
 PAT PEREZ: It was freezing. On 10 I hit driver out to the right and laid it up down there about 95 yards and hit a bad wedge shot, and I made about a 30-footer. And then on 11 I hit a great drive, a little wedge, and it was about two feet.   
  
  Q. And your season up to this point?   
 PAT PEREZ: You know, it hasn't been great. I had two good weeks two weeks ago in a row, and just trying to build on that. I'm working on some new stuff, and it's finally starting to come around.
