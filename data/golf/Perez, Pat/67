  Q.  Big hole-in-one on No. 2 what club did you use?   
 PAT PEREZ:  5-iron.  It was perfect.   
  
  Q.  Have you had any other hole-in-ones?   
 PAT PEREZ:  Yeah, Reno on the 7th hole -- 6th hole, 6-iron.   
  
  Q.  When was that?   
 PAT PEREZ:  Just flew right in.  That was six years ago.   
  
  Q.  Is that the only one?   
 IAN POULTER:  He's so lucky.  He mossed the green, hit the post, kicked on, some bird was scurrying across the green kicking it in.   
  
  Q.  Overall, great round.  Is there anything that you did differently today than yesterday's round?   
 PAT PEREZ:  I kept away from Ian Poulter a little more today.  I needed to come back, and I did.  It was nice, I played well.
