 Q.   Second round of 3‑under par.   Tell me how comfortable you're feeling.   It's nearly two home games in a row for you over here.   
PAT PEREZ:   Pretty good.   I have a lot of fan support out there, so it's keeping my adrenaline up.   16, that will get your attention, no matter what, anyway.   
But, yeah, I feel good.   I feel like I'm hitting some good shots.   I'm hitting them when I want to.   Putter feels pretty good.  
Just kind of feel comfortable overall.  
   
 Q.   I notice you just sort of tweaking on your right hip on the par‑3 on your back nine.   Everything okay with the hip?  
PAT PEREZ:   I don't know.   It comes and goes.   When I bend down, when I stand up, it's a little painful.   Let's see if I can get Joey to work that out tonight.   
I've had it for a little bit.   I don't know what it is.   Doesn't affect my swing or anything.  
   
 Q.   I must ask you, Super Bowl Sunday, do you have a pick?  
PAT PEREZ:   God, I wish.   I actually can't pick.   
You know, my buddy that I went to ASU here, Brock Osweiler, he's on the team.   And I want Peyton to win and John Elway is a good friend of mine.   I'd like to see him get another one.   
I don't know.   I'm pulling for the AFC West.   I'm a Chargers fan.   We don't look very good, but I'm pulling for them, Broncos.
