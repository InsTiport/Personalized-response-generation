  Q. Pat, 1-under par, great week out here at a very difficult golf course. I know you're disappointed with bogey at 18, but tell me about the stretch coming in.   
 PAT PEREZ: It was tough. We didn't really have a lot of wind, but it was tough. The pins are in hard positions, and this course is just unbelievable. I don't remember it being this hard before, but this week it was just incredible.  
  
  Q. The wind was out of a different direction, wasn't it?  
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I don't remember playing -- it was actually out of the south all week. Just brutal. It was absolutely brutal. If it weren't for the rain I don't know what the scores would have been like. The greens were like concrete. You couldn't play them. They would have been unbelievable.  
  
  Q. How long did it take to make an adjustment? Did you think to yourself before you teed off, okay, I can't play for that big first hop now?  
 PAT PEREZ: They still take a little bit of a bounce, but I didn't really fire at any pins all week anyway. You can't get close to them. It was a little bit of adjustment.  
  
  Q. What part of your game are you happiest with? I know Augusta is coming up soon.   
 PAT PEREZ: Actually my putter is coming around pretty well, so try and keep that going and do some practice around home next week and should be ready to go.
