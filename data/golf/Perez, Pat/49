 Q. On the backside, three birdies and an eagle. The putter got hot. It was fun following you out there.
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say hot, but I made a couple. They weren't really that long, and I left a bunch short.
 Front nine should have been the same as the back nine. It was good. I played like that all week. I just take a bunch out of the last two days.

 Q. Can you just describe the week you had? For really all the players, it's kind of a different place here.
 PAT PEREZ: Really different from what I'm used to. You got to wear a jacket and stuff everywhere. The guys did an unbelievable job for the first year. It's nice to have a guy that wants to be that involved and put that much money into an event. He does an incredible job.

 Q. Great playing. Keep it going for the next couple weeks.
 PAT PEREZ: Thanks. I'll try. I'm not doing anything, but...
