 Q.   What was going well in today's round?  
PAT PEREZ:   You know, I don't really know.   I didn't really do anything spectacular.   I hit some really good iron shots.   I drove it okay.   I didn't really putt that great.   
   
 Q.   Just turned out a good score?  
PAT PEREZ:   Wasn't anything spectacular.  
   
 Q.   If you look back, was there a shot a stood out?  
PAT PEREZ:   There was a lot of really good iron shots, but other than that there was nothing really‑‑ it was fast and firm.   The pins are hard; the course is hard in general.   There were a lot of good shots that weren't that close to the hole.   But the greens are so fast, you can't really be aggressive on the greens.   
So I don't really know what‑‑ I got off to a good start.   I birdied 11.   I should have birdied 12.   Hit a great shot on 12.   Might have birdied 13, 14, 15.   Three‑putted 16, hit it past.   
But overall it was really nice.   Wasn't anything really exciting.  
   
 Q.   So at this tournament specifically, is a day like this important, having patience and just coming out with a score?  
PAT PEREZ:   Yeah, I'm not going to have a lot of short irons in, so I can't fire at a whole lot of pins.   But when I get a mid‑iron in my hands that's when I can get a little more aggressive.   That doesn't happen that often out here.   The greens are so fast that you've just got to play a lot of defensive shots out here.
