 Q.  Came close, but I know you can't be any happier than you are right now carrying your daughter, Piper, with you.  
PAT PEREZ: Yeah.   
 Q.  Tough day out there, wasn't it?  
PAT PEREZ: It was. They had the pins in a lot of hard spots. I didn't really go at a lot of pins because I knew it was going to be tough. There are about five holes you have to take advantage of, and I only got a couple of them.   
After playing so poorly last week and put a lot work in the last seven weeks, this is what I was hoping for, just have a nice week. Those guys are playing well. I knew it was going to be tough to catch them. Overall I'm happy. I like where things are going. I'm looking forward to the rest of the year.   
 Q.  Did you have any sense of what was going on behind you at all?  
PAT PEREZ: No. They're so far back there couldn't really tell. I could tell by the scoreboard these guys are going to make birdies out there. I just couldn't get enough close. Seemed like every putt I had went four feet. It was tough to get it just in the hole really.   
 Q.  You're here with your wife Ashley, Piper. When will we see you again?  
PAT PEREZ: Next week, Houston.
