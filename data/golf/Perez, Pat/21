Q.   6-under today including four on the back nine.   How does it feel to close the tournament on such a hot streak?
    PAT PEREZ:   It was nice.   We had a good three-week stretch there and it was just kind of a nice exclamation mark on it.

Q.   How were the conditions out there yesterday?
    PAT PEREZ:   It sucked, beyond sucked.   It's not even fun when you look at it.   Ruined my pants, shoes, the whole deal.   But ball in hand was smart, we had to do it all the way through the course and they were smart doing it but it sucked.

Q.   Will you stick around and watch, see if you can get into a playoff?
    PAT PEREZ:   No.   I've got a flight in a few hours, so I'm gone.
