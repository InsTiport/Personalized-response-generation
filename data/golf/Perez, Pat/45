  Q. Obviously not the outcome you wanted, but overall it was a good week. You have to feel good about the good elements of your game this week.   
 PAT PEREZ: Well, it just proves that I can't close, so I'm pretty confident on that.   
  
  Q. What was the biggest demise to today?   
 PAT PEREZ: I just hit too many bad shots. Too many bad shots. You're never going to win if you're hitting it like that. You're never going to win if you play like I did today. That's just terrible. Embarrassing.  
  
  Q. How do you move forward from it, take time to regroup, stuff to work on, or do you just mentally decompress?  
 PAT PEREZ: No, just I've got to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm playing great. Hopefully I can have a better Sunday next time.
