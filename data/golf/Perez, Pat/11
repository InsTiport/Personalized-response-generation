 Q.  You made quite a come back there, to halve the match.  What did you do well down the stretch there?  
PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I just played more like I had been playing all year.  The first 7 holes I just really didn't play well at all.  I gave some opportunities back.  And he made some birdies.  And I screwed up the short driver one, then I should have got up and down on par 5, so should halve.  We were back and forth.  He made some good holes.  I made some bad holes.   
And, you know, it's match play.  You just never know, you can't threaten.  You hope to have a chance and I took advantage of a couple of holes out there and then when he birdied 15, which was a killer, I was really in a hole.  But to halve the match is pretty cool.  It was pretty lucky for me.   
 Q.  You had that putt to win it at the end, did you think you had a chance to make it and win?  
PAT PEREZ: I did think I'd make it.  I just hit that -- I was in between clubs up there, and I wanted to hit the sand wedge, but I didn't want to spin it back to where I ended being anyway.  I didn't hit the wedge hard enough.   
To have a putt in the end and now to look at it I could have won, that would have been unbelievable.  But to halve the match is just amazing to me.
