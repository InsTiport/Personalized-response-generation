 Q.   Pat, well done out there, maybe highlighted by that bomb at 17, but bogey free!   Is the golf course playing that easy? 
  PAT PEREZ:   I don't think so.   I didn't realize it until, you know, about 15 when I made birdie, I got to 5‑under or something and I didn't think it was that easy.   I hit it pretty good.   Me and Mark were feeding off each other, we had some good shots, and I don't know, I guess it was out there.   The wind was down a little bit.   We took advantage of opportunities that came our way and just a nice day.  
 Q.   How is it out there?   Both you guys as a group you shot it 12‑under par.   Pretty easy to play out there when everybody is making birdies? 
  PAT PEREZ:   I guess.   I've had it the other way, we didn't talk about it.   It was nice to get shots, the play was great, and I like fast anyway, so we played fast and it was just kind of nice to keep rolling.  
 Q.   What was the key to your round today? 
  PAT PEREZ:   Well, you know, my shoulder has been killing me this whole week.   I didn't know if I was going to tee it up on Thursday.   So to get that kind ofworked on and feeling a little better, I was able to get some feeling back in my swing and start hitting some good shots and I just rolled with that. 
  THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Pat.
