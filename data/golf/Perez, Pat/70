  Q.  Pat, talk a little bit about the round today even par score is pretty good especially in these conditions?   
 PAT PEREZ: I didn't even think about the score.  I'm just trying to stay alive out there.  It's so hot I can't even think straight.  I try not to think about anything.  Just stay cool and drink water and just kind of get around.  I really didn't think about it today.  Just kind of got around.   
 I hit some good shots.  Made some good par saves, and I made it around.   
  
  Q.  How pleased are you with your game considering the conditions, with how well -- like you said, you may not have even thought about even par, but are you pretty pleased with that score?   
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I guess.  I made a couple good saves.  I also chipped one in the water, which doesn't help.  Made six there.  Made triple.  Triple and a 3-putt and shot even.  I'm pretty happy with it.   
  
  Q.  Your thoughts on the course, some of the guys have talked about the rough and a little bit about the wind, just what do you think about Southern Hills?   
 PAT PEREZ: It's tough.  It's a major course.  The rough is not long, but it's very penalizing, because it goes straight to the bottom.  Fairways are perfect.  Greens are great, a little spiked up.  It's the heat more than anything.  It's brutal.   
  
  Q.  The way the heat is what do you do over the next couple of days to combat that?   
 PAT PEREZ: I have no idea.  I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow.  Tee off at 2:20.  It's going to be hot.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I must have had ten water bottles today.  So we'll see.
