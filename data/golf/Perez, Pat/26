 Q.   5‑under par.   You had a streak of four in a row there on the back nine.   How did the golf course play this morning?  
PAT PEREZ:   You know, it's playing easier.   You're going to see a lot of low scores.   There's not much wind out here for CancÃºn.   It's kind of surprising.   But the course is in great shape.   You know, some pins are accessible and some you've got to make pars, but the course is playing nice.  
   
 Q.   What's the key to playing this golf course?   
PAT PEREZ:   Definitely got to be in the fairway.   You know, not definitely, but you get some good lies in the rough, but you've got to putt well around here.   The greens are kind of tricky where you have some of the pins, but you've got to putt well out here.   
   
 Q.   What's been the key early in the season?   You've made some changes on things.   What are you working on right now?   
PAT PEREZ:   Right now I'm trying to get rid of everything I did the last five months.   I've had a horrendous five‑month stretch, worst of my career for sure.   I started off really good and then got things way too complicated, and basically forgot how to play golf.   Just got in my own way.   It was actually miserable for me to play because I couldn't break 75, and I didn't know why I couldn't do it, either.   I had some poor information, and I started working with my buddy Drew here who works with Jason Gore, and I've basically done the opposite of what I've done.   It was nice out of the gate today, and then I kind of got a little suspect and I started making some birdies.   I haven't been 5‑under since the last round of Hilton Head.   The trust hitting kind of a power draw as opposed to a weak fade, especially pins that are right and wind is off the left, it was really nice to finally see some shots again.   
You know, just trying to get something going this week, and then going into December, trying to get it really good.   
   
 Q.   Understandably in a good mood with a nice first round at Mayakoba.   Take me through 11 through 14.   
PAT PEREZ:   Yeah, I hit a great putt on 10 that didn't go in, and that's a hard par‑3 any day, but 11, I hit a nice little wedge in there about eight feet, made that one, and 12, hit a great drive down there, hit 9‑iron to about 25 feet.   That putt was dead straight, and I made that.   
13, you know, made about a good little six‑footer on there after hitting on the fringe in two for birdie.   14, I got lucky.   I hit it right and I thought it was in the hazard and it wound up being in the rough there, and I hit a perfect cut 5‑iron up to about six feet straight up the hill and basically stole one there.   And then I made a bad bogey on 15, the par‑3.   I tried to hit kind of a power draw in there and overdid it and made bogey.   
You know, it was a nice day.   It was a nice way to start.  
   
 Q.   I know you got off to a quick start beginning of last season, then struggled a bit in the summer.   What have you been working on to get back to this point?   
PAT PEREZ:   Everything opposite of what I've done the last five months, which was face too open, hands lifting too much.   Now I'm trying to take it dead shot and inside and across at the top, and when I do that, it actually sits perfect.   Feelings and what actually happens is totally entirely different, but I'm finally starting to see some good ball‑striking, finally hitting it in the center again and I'm getting some distance back.   You know, I'm just going to try and build some confidence from this week, and whatever happens, happens, but it's nice to have a nice round, and then I'll go into December and really work hard and get ready for this West Coast Swing again.
