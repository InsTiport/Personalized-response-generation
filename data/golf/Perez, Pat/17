Q. Good performance over Marc Leishman today.
PAT PEREZ: He's a world class player.  He just won last week.  Obviously he's hot.  He's tough.  He's tough.  I knew I was going to have to play really well to beat him and I did.  It's a great feeling.
Q. Given what has happened to Jason Day, obviously your match turned into the marquee match for the week.  How are you feeling about the position you are in now?
PAT PEREZ: Lee is obviously a great player.  He's been on multiple Ryder Cups.  He's got great match play experience.  I'm going to need another great day again tomorrow to advance.  With Jason pulling out, unfortunately it screwed up the entire flight.  I knew I had to win today, if not Leish could go drink all night and get ready for Saturday.  Massive performance, I think, on my part today to get that done.  I've got one more day to try to get through.  I'm just happy about the opportunity.
