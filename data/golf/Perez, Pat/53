 Q. Maybe just start out with a couple of comments about the first couple of days. Good start for you?
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I didn't know what to expect. I came over here last tournament, check it out. 

 Q. It's going well. 
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, I'm not really hitting it -- I'm hitting it all right. Putting pretty decent. It's really not all that pretty but somehow it's getting close to done. 

 Q. How are you getting adjusted? 
 PAT PEREZ: That was fine when I got here. We left Chicago at 10.30 and got here at two in the afternoon and I felt asleep at 7.00. I've been pretty lucky with that. 
 I think because a half a day is easier than like Sergio, he's like seven hours and he's having trouble. I think the full half-day, it's ten hours, but it's not that bad. 

 Q. And have you gotten to see much of Shanghai?
 PAT PEREZ: Yeah, we did a tour on Monday. My wife did a Tour on Tuesday, as well. She went today, as well. Yeah, we saw a lot of downtown. Unbelievable. It's different, that's for sure.
