  Q. Pat, how did it feel?  
 PAT PEREZ: It felt good. You know, he's unbelievable. He made a lot of putts today and made a lot of shots that you don't count on people hitting, and he pulls them off. He's phenomenal.  
  
  Q. Do you think you could have pulled this off if you had not won at the Hope and gave you that extra confidence to come in here and tackle a guy like Padraig?  
 PAT PEREZ: Probably not, I don't know. My game is in such a different place this year than it was last year. Obviously winning is a huge confidence, but once you start beating guys like him, the confidence just keeps going up. Match play is tough; you expect a guy to hit it two feet on the second hole. He holed it from off the green. On the next hole I went from 2-up to even so quick. We had such a great match. He hit some great shots, I hit some great shots. He's just an unbelievable competitor.  
  
  Q. Any big key shots today for you?   
 PAT PEREZ: The one he missed on the last hole.  
  
  Q. You hit it to like 11 inches. What did you hit in there?  
 PAT PEREZ: The 2nd hole, yeah, I hit 4-iron in there. Yeah, that was good. I felt like I played good today. I wasn't as nervous as I was last year.  
 We were kind of back and forth like that. He holed one on me on 2 and then I caught him on 5, and he missed a putt there. He made a lot of good putts coming in. It was a good battle, and he's a wonderful player.   
  
  Q. You must have been thinking PGA Championship the way he played coming down the stretch.   
 PAT PEREZ: Well, I told him, "You're going to make a shot," because that's what he does. You can't win two majors and do what he's done lately without making putts. You have to. You count on him making them. You need to play your game. You need to play for birdie and par on every hole and beat him.
