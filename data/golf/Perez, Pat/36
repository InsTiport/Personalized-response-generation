 Q.   You've got to be happy with a 3‑under.   
PAT PEREZ:   That's the worst I've ever felt going to the tee box, ever, in my professional career, and I don't know‑‑ I don't know, somehow I just got it around.   I was just going to try to get it around today.   My putting was good, but I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.   I was pretty much done when I got to the tee box, and I just tried to fight and just get around the course somehow.  
   
 Q.   You got around pretty good with five birdies on the day.   
PAT PEREZ:   Yeah, I got about 1,000 percent of my game today.   It's been a long time since I've gotten pretty much everything out of my round.   I hit some really bad shots today, and they ended up somehow where I could play them.  
   
 Q.   How was the course playing overall?  
PAT PEREZ:   This morning there was no wind.   On the windiest course in the world you'd expect a little more wind than this.   But I guess fortunately for me, it wasn't blowing hard enough to where I could try to find something out there and make something happen.   The course is just phenomenal.   The greens are good.   If you get a good putt, you know if it's in or not.   I guess it'll be a little windy this afternoon, but hopefully we can have another good day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   The wind did pick up a little bit as you were finishing off.   How did that affect things?  
PAT PEREZ:   Yeah, it did for me because I was hitting a slice anyway.
