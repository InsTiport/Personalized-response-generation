 Q.   2‑under, 69, second day in a row.   How were the conditions compared to yesterday?   
PAT PEREZ:   A little firmer, more like U.S. Open style.   It's going to be hard this weekend.   The weather, it's so hot out there, it's incredible.   You just kind of stay hydrated and try to keep cool as much as you can.   But the course is in phenomenal condition.   Just every shot is very hard.  
   
 Q.   What was working for you out there?   
PAT PEREZ:   I hit it in play.   It was short grass, and if I missed it, I was able to get it near the green to get it up‑and‑down.   That's really what you've got to do.   And I putted pretty well.  
   
 Q.   Now, it's much warmer and much more humid than it was yesterday.   Did that affect your ball flight at all?  
PAT PEREZ:   The ball is going a mile right now.   It's really hot.   The ball is going a mile.   The guys will be hitting it far this afternoon.   But the greens are really firm and hard, and it's hard to get it close to the hole.  
   
 Q.   Do you think the guys this afternoon are at more of an advantage or disadvantage?   
PAT PEREZ:   I'd say disadvantage just because it's going to be so hot.   I mean, there's a score to be had out there obviously.   The scores from the afternoon yesterday were low.   It's just going to be really hot.   
   
 Q.   What do you think about the greens?   Are they holding up good?   
PAT PEREZ:   They're firm.   They're really if you've got a wedge you can stop it, but if you have a 7‑ or 6‑iron it's not going to stop.
