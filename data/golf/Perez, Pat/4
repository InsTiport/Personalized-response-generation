 Q.  What was the challenge of having to complete this round?  
PAT PEREZ: Nothing.  I've done this so many times.  I think the reason, even though they wouldn't come out and say it, is the fact we had to play the ball down, but we couldn't finish last night it was so wet.  They made the right call.  We're going to get it done today, so we'll be back on schedule tomorrow.   
 Q.  How much has the course changed with the actual rain?  
PAT PEREZ: Not much.  This kind of grass really takes water.  We didn't have one mud ball.  It was fine.  It played a little bit longer probably than it would have yesterday afternoon, but it was pretty nice.
