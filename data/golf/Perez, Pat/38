Q.   Pat, nicely done.   67 with six birdies, wind didn't bother you much? 
PAT PEREZ:   During a couple of shots.   The course is getting tougher, a lot tougher than yesterday afternoon.   Supposed to blow even more tomorrow. 
I made some good putts, had some good saves and hit some good shots. 

Q.   You have things going pretty well.   You haven't had any break‑out weeks, but you have three top‑15s, playing well lately. 
PAT PEREZ:   I haven't done much on the weekend yet, so I've got to change that, trying to change that this weekend. 

Q.   Are you changing anything with your game?
PAT PEREZ:   No, just trying to make less mistakes.   I've made some mistakes at the wrong time that take me from playing good to placing 25th.
