 Q.  Was it a complete surprise when you found out you had won?  
THOMAS FRANK: Totally.  I know I heard awhile back something, but everybody says everything and I just -- I got there and I saw the cameras and I thought it was for Ai because she has an entourage every week.  It's pretty normal, because I caddied in Japan, to see the photographers with the Japanese players.   
They said, oh, yeah, the award for you.  I'm like, what did I do.   
 Q.  So it's your encourage?  
THOMAS FRANK: I guess.   
 Q.  Who did you vote for?  What did you think was going to win?  
THOMAS FRANK: I thought it was going to be Bradley, actually.  It was his player that won all the majors.  She won I don't know how many tournaments last year.  For me to be in competition, I'm just stoked.  It's just overwhelming.   
 Q.  And how did you feel, like wearing the different caddie bib today?  
THOMAS FRANK: I felt nervous, I did.  I got comfortable after a couple holes, but I felt a little more pressure just to perform better.   
 Q.  I heard Harriet took your glasses with her?  
THOMAS FRANK: I walked off without my glasses.  Good thing I had an extra pin sheet because my pin sheet was in there.  I still had the pin locations from yesterday and I know them from walking the pins, but yeah, I'm overwhelmed still.  I'm thankful I have a job out here and it's a great honor.  Big thank you to HSBC, it's awesome.  It's very unexpected.
