   MICHELE REDMAN: I knocked a 9-iron about three feet and made it for birdie.   
 No.4, I hit a 7-wood about 20 feet for birdie.   
 On No. 5 I hit an 8-iron about 12 feet for birdie.   
 11 I hit -- chipped it up to about three feet for birdie.   
 And then 13, just 3-putted for probably about 20 feet for bogey.   
 Then No. 14 I hit a 6-iron in about a foot for birdie.   
 15, I hit a sand wedge in to about 12 feet for birdie.   
 18, I hit a 7-iron in to about 15 feet, 15, 20 foot for birdie.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for coming in. You got to be happy with how did you today. Talk a little bit about your round.  
 MICHELE REDMAN: I hit it great today. I mean, I really only had to chip one time on No. 8, was it? I hit every green. Actually, I think I hit every fairway, come to think of it. I did.   
 I'm just hitting it really good right now, and have been.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: I missed No. 8. I forgot that. I was in the fringe so I had to chip. I slipped, you know.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Questions.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Exactly, yep. Hit some good putts, too.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: You know, I just think you have to hit good shots here, in the afternoon especially, because the greens firm up. It was nice this morning because the greens were a little more receptive than they are in the afternoon.   
 But it played a little longer. Just kind of a catch 22.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Yep. Yeah, I think so. It looks like it's supposed to get really bad I guess, so...  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Right. Right. Yeah. Well, the wind is kind of shifting, you know, a little bit right now. I think because the front is coming in, I think from the southeast to the northeast or something like that.   
 That makes it a little bit more difficult. Like when we were an 16, you know, at one point it was left to right into and then it turned right to left. It's just really hard to pick clubs, especially with the elevation changes out there.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Yeah, uh-huh, I was, and I'll tell you why, because I had an 11 on the third hole. My caddie and I that I had had for five years split up after this tournament, so we're kind of have a little redemption going on here. I mean, we were both looking forward to getting back out there and kind of making up a little bit.   
 It was so funny, because like yesterday in the Pro-Am -- our card had No. 11. Now we can laugh about it, but we did split up. That was kind of the end of the end for us.   
 We split up for about a year and a half. We needed a little break, but that was kind of it, yes.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Uh-huh, the last time I was here, yeah.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: We hit the wrong ball and then lost my original ball is what happened. We hit the wrong ball. We both looked down and we had a dime on it right where we put it.  
 Same color, so we hit it out and got on the green and it wasn't my ball. We went back and never found my original ball, we I had to go all the way back up. It was just a mess.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: No. 3. It was iffy. He wasn't happy and I wasn't happy. That's not an easy thing.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Yes, yep.   
  
  Q. What's his name?  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Joe Connolly. We just took a break and it -- if we take another break it won't be me. It'll be his decision the next time, I tell him. I missed having him around.  
 Actually, I think I needed a break from golf in general. It didn't have anything to do with him, it was me. I just needed a break from golf in general.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Right. Actually, the last few events I played pretty good. Yeah, and Montgomery I was only four shots out and Portland I played really well. The last part of season I've actually played really well.   
 I think I'm a little bit more committed to playing better now and I'm enjoying playing more than I was a couple years ago.   
 I've been playing a little bit less and I've had a little time off. It's hard traveling and grinding it out every week. I think getting away, even in the middle of summer, was probably pretty good for me.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Exactly. Yep, yep. Yeah, so it's working out -- my schedule is working out pretty good for me right now, so I like it.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: I think I just needed to cut back. I thought -- you know, I had gone back and forth a little bit on it, but I knew I was still playing well enough.   
 I think actually, to be honest with you, once Joe started working for me again that really changed my mind on what I wanted to do. We get along really good, yeah.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Rochester, New York, this year.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Actually, I didn't have anything to do with that. Yeah, so...  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Birdie. (Laughter). I looked over at Joe and I said, Well, we're seven shots better than where were last time we played here.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Yeah, I did birdie it the second time. No, uh-uh. I did birdie it the second time around. I'm still not caught up yet, just to let you know.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MICHELE REDMAN: I said, We're seven shots better than we were last time we played this hole the first round.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Anything else? All right.
