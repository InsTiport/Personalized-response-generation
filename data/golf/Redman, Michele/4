  Q. So 5-under 67 today. What course were you playing and what course was Brittany Lincicome playing?  
 MICHELE REDMAN: Good question. I don't know. I'll tell you, the greens are rolling really nice out there. I think, you know, you can make a lot of putts out there.  
  
  Q. Yeah. 5-under 67, normally you would probably feel pretty good about the day and be a little bit closer to the lead. Do you still feel, you know, I'm certainly not out of it by any means; Brittany hasn't won the tournament; it's the first day?  
 MICHELE REDMAN: I really haven't been -- until the last week and a half -- last week and then the middle half of my last round in Arkansas, I really haven't been playing that good.   
 So I'm just trying to take care of me right now. I'm happy with that, because I've been really struggling with my putting, and I feel like it's starting to come around.  
 So that's kind of how I'm looking at it right now.  
  
  Q. I know you said the greens were good, but did you see a score that low out there today?   
 MICHELE REDMAN: Well, you know Brittany obviously hits it a really long way, so that's making some of the par-5s reachable for her, and possibly 17. So that could be a difference.  
 I mean, it's out there. I left some out there, too. It's out there. (Laughter.)
