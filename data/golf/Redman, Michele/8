Q.  Just want to talk about Patty passing away.
MICHELE REDMAN:  I know, that's sad.  I was surprised.  I didn't know that she wasn't well.  She's been great for women's golf and she's going to be dearly missed, that's for sure.
Q.  Do you have any fond memories, any stories, anything?
MICHELE REDMAN:  Yeah, when I think of Patty Berg I think of Patty Sheehan imitating her and that makes me laugh a little bit because she does a Patty Berg perfect.  She came and talked to us at the Solheim Cup in Minneapolis, and she's just a great lady.  We'll definitely miss her.
Q.  Talk about how important she was.
MICHELE REDMAN:  She's probably    she's definitely one of the reasons we are where we are today.  You know, a lot of the old founders of the LPGA, we wouldn't be where we are without them this year.
Q.  Were you raised in Minneapolis?
MICHELE REDMAN:  No, I just live there now.
