MICHELE REDMAN:  That's what cost us is making the birdie.  We didn't birdie 16.
Q.  How close were you?
MICHELE REDMAN:  Well, we were about 20 yards short of the green, and we chipped it up for about 30 feet.
Q.  Are you optimistic about the afternoon?
MICHELE REDMAN:  Yeah, best ball is what we do well, although we have been practicing the alternate shot.
