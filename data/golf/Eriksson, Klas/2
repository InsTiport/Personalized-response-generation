Q. Thoughts on the day?
KLAS ERIKSSON: I played okay, really played okay. But I like this kind of golf and that helps. I really do enjoy the links courses, it is a completely different game to the one we usually play. This is always a week I look forward to on the schedule. It is a bit of a test because it is completely different. I really love it. I am looking forward to Carnoustie as well tomorrow. I must have played there about 100 times because we had the national team camp there in Sweden when I was an amateur so I am very used to the course. I know where to go, and where not to go Ã ­ that is probably more important!.
