 Q.  How did your round go out there today?  
WYNDHAM CLARK: It was an up and down round.  Made a lot of mistakes, but I was pretty resilient, and I'm happy with how I bounced back after a few bogeys I made.   
All in all, it was a good round.  Would've been a lot better if I had some putts fall.   
 Q.  Never been in this position on the PGA TOUR before.  What's your mentality going into the weekend?  
WYNDHAM CLARK: You know, it's the same as it was in college.  I've played a lot of big amateur and college events and been in this situation in those multiple times.   
Golf is golf, so I don't really think it's that much different.  Obviously more people and higher stakes, but in reality it's the same thing.   
 Q.  Is Q-School next week?  
WYNDHAM CLARK: Yes.   
 Q.  Do you think about that at all, that if you do well enough this weekend the plan changes and you can continue on the tour?  
WYNDHAM CLARK: I try not to think about that.  That's still two days away to even be worrying about that.   
Yeah, that would be awesome, but my plan is to go to Q-School, and I'm going to play as if that's what's going on.   
If I play great and something else happens, that's great.  But I'm still sticking with my schedule and plan that I've had for the last few weeks?   
 Q.  What's been working well for you the last couple days?  
WYNDHAM CLARK: You know, I think I've really managed my golf ball.  More often than not I've left it in a good spot; good angles into greens.   
Then yesterday I putted pretty solid; today I didn't really make any putts, but I didn't make any mistakes with my putter.  I've been putting well; I've been scrambling well.   
It's really been a good week, but I do need to tidy some things up this weekend.
