Q. A lot of low numbers out there today, 5-under 67.  I'm impressed, through two rounds, only one bogey.  How have you been able to neutralize mistakes?
WYNDHAM CLARK: We just played -- we played pretty smart.  I hit a lot of good shots.  And then -- I've had chances to make bogeys, I made my six to eight footers a couple times where I had a chance to make bogey, so it's really been the putting that's done it.
Q. It is your rookie season, you're now in your 7th start, you made four out of six cuts so far.  What's the learning curve been like now that we're getting into the start of the grind in 2019?
WYNDHAM CLARK: Well part of it is making cuts, building momentum.  And that's one thing I've really want to applaud myself for is that I've made cuts.  The more rounds you play, the more you get comfortable out here, and so that's been one learning curve.  The other part is now getting in contention and having a chance to win or having top finishes.
