 Q.   1â€‘under par, 71 in Round 2.   To say it was an up and down round, want to talk about it?  
    CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yesterday we had some tough conditions, everyone did.   But it was very difficult to actually make birdies, I found, especially if you get going the wrong way in the beginning.   It felt like I was back footed most of the day yesterday.   And obviously with a few delays, I managed to get one back there yesterday in between that one delay.   That at least gave me something to come back this morning.   I thought if I could somehow get one back and get my round back to even, I'd be very happy and managed to make 2, coming up 17 and 18.   I'm very pleased with the way it turned out.  
   
 Q.   The way your Round 2 started out, you progressively got easier conditions to the time you teed off to after the weather delay to this morning?  
    CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Yesterday afternoon was really difficult, so anything was going to be easier than that.   I thought this morning we would actually get luckier than we did.   But the winds are really up.   
   
 Q.   You've been playing very well, very steady the last few weeks.   Talk about the final two rounds here?  
    CHARL SCHWARTZEL:   Well, you know, I've been playing well.   I've been working on the putting.   Yesterday I felt it was definitely moving in the right direction.   If I can just keep playing the way I am, giving myself chances and the putter kicks in like it did the first day or even half of that, it would be great.   It's nice to be out there and competing.
