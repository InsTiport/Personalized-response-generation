Q. What a day. It's finally the end here at Q-Series. A lot of awesome emotions, happy emotions?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah. I could start feeling it on the back nine. I'm like, It's the last stretch. I started missing a couple drives and I'm like, You know what? Just dig deep, play your own game, make your pars, and just get out of here.
You know, I'm really happy I made it through. It's been a really long three weeks. I still feel like I'm going to play tomorrow at this point. I just keep playing.
But, yeah, emotions are pretty surreal right now. It's a dream come true getting my full LPGA card. Yeah, could not have asked for a better way to do this.
Q. Three weeks of playing on and on and on. What are some of the things that you are reflecting about or most proud of yourself after qualifying stage two and now Q-Series?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, I played some really good golf. I only had two rounds over par, 1- and 2-over, and then the rest were par or better. So I was very consistent; I didn't make any doubles.
So, you know, I think it just showed that I was very steady and patient. I'm just happy that my game was good for three weeks. I've never played actually three weeks in a row, so this was really a first.
So just feels great to pull the it out at the right time.
Q. I know you said that there is one round left yesterday.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah.
Q. But as Bethan asked you as well, what are some of your plans or are you still deciding?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You know, I'm going back to school tomorrow. I'm getting my degree, and that's a no-brainer for me. I'm a Stanford student. It's probably one of the coolest things that ever happened to me, so I'm really excited to graduated and walk down and get my diploma. So that's also next step.
And then I am also looking at the Olympics. That's been at the back of my mind, and there is not putt I don't putt just saying like try to get there.
So that's a big goal of mine. A lot of ifs, but I think I've just always taken it step by step and just playing my game and we'll see where it takes me.
Q. Before any decisions are made, any celebration plans after today?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Sleep. I think I'm just going to just sleep like a baby. Or maybe not because my emotions are really high right now.
Yeah, just being with my family, I think it's the best celebration I could have.
