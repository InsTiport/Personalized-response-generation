 Q.  I know the round probably wasn't what you were expecting.  What happened out there?  
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I mean, played good.  I just had two doubles.  Just kind of dumb mistakes, if that's the right word.  Otherwise I just saved lot of pars.  Played pretty solid overall this week.  Hit some good shots, made some good up-and-downs.  It's a U.S. Women's Open.  If you make one mistake, the course doesn't for give you.   
 Q.  How did the course play today as opposed to yesterday?  
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Pins were really tough and just a little bit windier and the course has been wet the entire week, so you get mud balls here and there.  Otherwise, I mean, it means so much to play the last round of the U.S. Women's Open.   
 Q.  How is your overall tournament experience?  
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Great experience.  Obviously the second round was a little bit hectic.  I have never experienced that before.  So I think there's lot to take from this week.   
Definitely yesterday was very long day.  I played 30 holes, a lot of golf.  Kind of a marathon.  It's a great experience.  It's amazing to play in majors and I'm grateful to have this opportunity as an amateur.
