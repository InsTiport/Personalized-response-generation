  ALBANE VALENZUELA:   I was out for a very long time struggling with injuries and couple health issues, including COVID, so just feels great to be back and happy with the way my game is trending and just excited to be out here this week.
 Q. What in particular about your game are you really excited about seeing that it works really well?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   I'm really happy with my long game.  I think I really struggled last year with it just kind of getting the transition of professional golf.  I think right now I'm really getting back to very simple thoughts and so just going back to how I normally played the game, just creative, instinctive, and go after it.  Just very easy and try to do the best he can.
 Q. What was your goal coming into the week?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   You know, really stick to go my game plan, try to do the best shots and committing to them.  I obviously missed some putts here and there, but just happy with the way my game is trending.  It's pretty consistent and I'll try to just post good scores on the weekend.
 Q. How are the course conditions?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   The course is great.  Definitely the greens were a little bumpier in the afternoon.  But it's great.  It's so nice to be no Florida.  Usually you always get good conditions early in the season, so really excited about the weekend.
