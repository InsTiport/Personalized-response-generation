 Q.  You two are a duo that so many people admire.  What did you tell yourself being down the entire day?  
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You just have to keep fighting, just keep smiling, enjoying your round.  It's great.  It's the final day of the U.S. Amateur.  You just have to enjoy and embrace the moment.  It wasn't my day, but it happens, that's all.   
 Q.  Are you going to convince big sister to let you caddie in the United States Women's Open next year?  
ALEXIS VALENZUELA: She already told me that I will caddie for her next year for the U.S. Women's Open, so that's going to be really amazing for me.   
 Q.  In a week like this, what is it exactly that you take away because you did a lot of great stuff.  
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, I played some great golf.  It didn't go my way today, but other than that, I played steady golf, had a lot of putts.  Hit some great putts and great drives.  A lot of good things to take out of it.  I mean, it's great to win five matches and get that far for my first time, so I'm really excited.
