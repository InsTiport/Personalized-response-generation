Q. Talk a little bit about your round.  Obviously you come in this year off the disappointment losing in the finals.  Is there a little extra special motivation?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You know, it was just another tournament.  Match play, anything can happen, and I think I just come in this week having fun.  I think last year I made a good run at this tournament.  Runner-up, it's something everyone would like to take, so now I have nothing to lose.  I just come here, play every round one at a time.  Hopefully if I get into --
Q. It looks like you're off to a pretty good start to get to match play.  Do you think that experience will benefit you from last year?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, it's definitely a grind to get all the way there.  I've played a lot of match play and have been really lucky to have the experience, at least to be exposed to match play for a long time.  But I also know how it works.  You can play against any player and lose or win.  I don't know, it's just you have to play your game, stay focused, and we'll see how it goes.
Q. Did you play a lot this summer?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I've only played Palmer Cup.
Q. That's it?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah.
Q. Just decided to take a little break from the game?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, I moved from Switzerland to the Bahamas, so I guess that was --
Q. Now you're on the beach all the time?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: No, it was just a big move of the family, so I just took time to do all that stuff.
Q. Was that a job change for your dad?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Just got moved.
Q. Just wanted to get out of Switzerland?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: There you go.
Q. Do you like the Bahamas?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I love it.  I love it.
Q. What's the best part about it?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You know, there's so many great players that go there.  I was very fortunate the other day to have seen Justin Rose chipping right in front of me.  Molinari was there, as well.  It's just a very special place where you get to practice in some very good conditions and see amazing players.
Q. The Palmer Cup obviously didn't go to well for the international side, huh?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You know what, I think we've had the most fun, so even if we lost, I think we won the inside because we really had a blast and we all really enjoyed the week.
Q. Well, it was a course you were quite familiar with; you've played the Evian.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, I know the course pretty well.
Q. Are you going back to the Evian?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yes, I'm going back.
Q. So they gave you an exemption?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Mm-hmm.
Q. And then you're going to play the World Am, correct?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yes, so that will be late August.
