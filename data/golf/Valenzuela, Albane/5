Q. Obviously disappointed again, but this one was a little different than it was two years ago with the 6 & 5.  This was down to the last hole.  Just talk about your emotions right now as you --
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, I mean, it's tough, and it will be even tougher tonight, but I fought really hard.
Q. Talk about the shot in there on 18, on the second 18 here.  She hits it great and then you obviously know you have to hit a great shot.  I don't know what your distance was, but you stuffed it.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, you know, I'm really proud of myself for doing that.  I think that shows that I can play golf.  You know, under pressure I was able to hit the shot I wanted, and gave myself an opportunity, and she hit a wonderful putt and she had a great birdie on 17, so kudos to her.
Q. What did you hit from the fairway?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: 9-iron.
Q. From?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: 126 meters.
Q. And then obviously on 17 she hit a great shot, and then you had like about 40 feet.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, and I hit a great putt.  It could have gone in, but I tried my best, and she hit a great putt.
Q. You came back from the morning.  You were down three and you brought it back to tie.  What did you say to yourself after lunch when it was a whole new ballgame?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, you know, I was 3-down in my second match in the round of 32, so I knew what it felt like to be down.  I just tried to stay patient and win a couple holes here and there.
Q. Obviously you're going to go through Q-school this fall.  Your senior season at Stanford.  What's next for you?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: You know, next for me will be just going back to school, kind of grinding it out, and then yeah, going to Q-school, and we'll see how that goes.
Q. You're in the Women's Open next year.  Will you have to go through qualifying or will you take the exemption and play as an amateur next year?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: We'll see.
Q. You have tough decisions.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, we'll see.
Q. Do you think you'll play Augusta this year or do you think you'll --
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Hopefully they'll change dates.
Q. No, they haven't changed them.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I was very grateful to be invited three years by the ANA.  I don't know if they're going to invite me a fourth time.  If I do, it'll be a good problem to have.
Q. Obviously it looked like your former assistant flew in today, Lauren?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Yeah, that was amazing of her.  I have an amazing coach staff at Stanford, and they both flew in two years ago to support me, and when she told me she booked her flight, that was amazing, yeah.
Q. On the last putt when you were watching that, it looked like it just fell over the lip.  Talk about your emotions as you see that putt fall in.
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I mean, you lose, you lose.  That's it.
