Q. I know not the finish that you wanted on this final day, but still the experience.  What was this week like for you?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: It was an amazing week.  Obviously, today wasn't great, but it's wonderful to be here in a major.  I had a lot of fun with my brother caddying for me, and just a lot of positives to take.  Yeah, just a bad round of golf today.
Q. Who enjoyed it more, you or your brother?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I think both equally.
Q. As you watch some of these ladies and I'm sure you watch week in and week out on TV, you played at a very high level in college at Stanford.  What do you take away and learn the most that you try to make yourself better?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: It's a lot of patience, a lot of perseverance, and just consistency.  So I still have to work a lot on my short game and try to get ups and downs a little bit more.  It's not that far off.  I know I can still compete with them.  It's just about learning and taking the experience.
