Q. What's been the highlight of the week so far for you? 
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Highlight was Opening Ceremony for sure. That was a great moment. You get in the Maracana Stadium with the Swiss team and you hear all the crowd, kind of getting crazy and the music, it was a pretty special moment. Also just being in the village. This has been a great experience, bumping into Usain Bolts, Michael Phelps, Djokovic running next to me at the gym. It has been really, really fun. 

Q. And tell me the story of that photo with you and Bolt. 
ALBANE VALENZUELA: I was with Victoria. We were coming out of the cafeteria and we hear everyone saying like, "Bolt! Bolt! Bolt!" We see him and then we're like, "Oh, can we just take a picture with you." 
He was really cool. He was like, "Yeah, I need to go to my room but walk with my room and we'll take pictures."

Q. How excited are you for the tournament to get going?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Really excited. I've been here for almost two weeks. Went to Sao Paulo to practice, but I think now it has to start.

Q. Has this been the highlight of your career?
ALBANE VALENZUELA: For sure.

Q. How does it rate? 
ALBANE VALENZUELA: Right now, it's ten out of ten.
