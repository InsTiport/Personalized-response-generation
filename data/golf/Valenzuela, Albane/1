  Q. We talked to you the other day about what a year you had last year, what an up and down year for you, how crazy.  But how good is it to be out here competing in the final group on a Sunday?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   It's awesome.
 Q. Got to be good to be back.
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   Yeah, I'm just so happy and I'm -- I look back and I'm pretty proud of the way I handled last couple months.  It's definitely been hell just not being able to play.  I considered taking a medical for a year at some point.
 So just going through a lot of injuries and just illnesses, it feels great to be back and feels great to be back in great competition shape, so excited about the rest of the season.
 Q. 1-over today.  Danielle said Austin is playing a different course than the rest of us it seemed like.  The course, I mean, the greens were obviously challenging all week.  The wind was challenging, especially over the weekend.  How did it play for you?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   It's definitely tricky.  I mean, you look at 13, yesterday I had a 9-iron and today was a 4-iron.  The wind was definitely really tricky and was hard to really get how the greens were going to bounce and react.
 Sometimes you had 9-irons that would roll for like 15, 20 meters, so definitely challenging.  And the greens definitely a little bumpy and sometimes not easy to read.
 So it's great test of golf.  Overall happy with the way I managed it.
 Q. What did you learn today from playing with the champion here and then Jennifer?  She probably didn't have the round she wanted, but this course seems very difficult if you're behind and wanting to climb the leaderboard like she needed to do.
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   It was a really fun experience.  I mean, it's kind of I guess something I can put a check mark, to play in the last group on a Sunday.  I think that's where all golfers want to be ultimately.  I'm glad I got this experience.  It will help me I think the future when hopefully I'll in Austin's shoes one day.
 She was an awesome.  Not only is she a great player but what a great person.  We had a blast on the course.  Really a fun group, Jen as well.  We're good friends, so it was a really fun experience and a great Sunday.
 Q. Obviously a couple weeks off here before Kia and then a ANA, first major of the year.  What are your plans for the time off?  Rest, relaxation?
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   Yeah, I'm flying back tomorrow to the Bahamas to go back with my family, and so we'll just get some practice and try to get ready again.
 So mini off-season, but will get to work on some stuff.  Just keep doing the same preparation.  I feel like I was really prepared.  Despite everything that happened I still managed to really have quality practice before coming in, so just do the same thing.
 Q. Bahamas lifestyle can't be bad.
 ALBANE VALENZUELA:   Can't be bad, can't be bad.
