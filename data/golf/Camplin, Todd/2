 Q. First, I guess, as a club pro what's it mean to come out here and play this tournament? 
 TODD CAMPLIN: It means everything. I mean, it's a great reward for us, something that I had set my eyes on before I even gained membership in the PGA. It's a huge honor to be here and to be representing all the PGA professionals, and it's a great experience overall. 

 Q. Kind of a tough day today, but how is the course playing and what do you do to get ready for tomorrow?
 TODD CAMPLIN: The course is playing great. I mean, it's very difficult but fair. If you drive the ball in the fairway, you can do some work. If you don't drive the ball in the fairway, it's going to penalize you. 
 I played pretty good in my first nine, and I made double on 18 and hit two really good shots. It hit the wall and came back in and just lost my swing a little bit on the front. Hit it in the rough and hit it in a lot of bunkers, and you're not going to do any good out here if you're doing that.

 Q. What do you do to get ready for tomorrow?
 TODD CAMPLIN: I just need to drive the ball better. It's typically a strength of mine and today it kind of let me down on the front, my second nine, and then just need to have a little bit more faith in my putting stroke. The greens are a little bit quicker than what I'm used to playing, and just need to trust it a little bit more.
