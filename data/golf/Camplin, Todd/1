  Q. Thanks for joining us after today's round. How was the experience overall?  
 TODD CAMPLIN: It was awesome. You know, it's admirable to just be out here and tee it up with these guys. Yeah, I mean, my game wasn't there the last couple days, but it was a great experience.  
  
  Q. How is the course playing today as compared to yesterday?   
 TODD CAMPLIN: About the same. I mean, again, if you're driving the ball well, you can get some things done. If you're hitting it out of the rough or out of the fairway bunkers, you're going to make a lot of bogeys and higher numbers. The greens are still receptive coming out of the fairway, and they're obviously putting real good, so you can make putts if you get on the right side of the hole.  
  
  Q. What do you take away from this week going forward?  
 TODD CAMPLIN: Just take a lot of things, more experience playing under this type of pressure, and I'm sure the next section event I play in I'll be looking around for the grandstands. You know, just that and Kevin and Scott are real good, and we talked a lot, even just about different shots, how you play different shots and how you read greens that have a lot of grain in them and stuff like that. You just try to be as big a sponge as you can.
