 Q. Front nine's been pretty good to you. 
 TOM PURTZER: Yeah, I played good the front side. And then I 3-putted 10. And then not bad, not bad, and I think I just got tired. I bogeyed four out of the last five holes. Just from dumb stuff. 
 So I think that more than anything I just lost a little energy. So I've got to get some good rest and try and come out tomorrow. 

 Q. Having said that, even with the rough finish, you are still only two shots out of the lead and you're in one of the final three groups. What's your mindset now going into tomorrow and the next two rounds?
 TOM PURTZER: Same thing. Just try and get back to hitting fairways and greens and try and get them in the right spot and I think that more than anything for me it's just I got to get my energy level back somehow. I just lost, I just got tired. So that was pretty much it.
