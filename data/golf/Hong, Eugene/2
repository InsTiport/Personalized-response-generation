Q. He had a 3-up lead on you and you really made him earn it; you didn't give up.  Does it help you knowing that, that you fought until the end?
EUGENE HONG: Yeah, Min Woo played really good.  Like he made like chip-in on two and he was making 30-foot putts.  He was just playing really good golf and he really deserved to win.  I tried my best, but I was a little short.
There was nothing I could do.  Min Woo played really good.  He did a really good shot in the semifinal.
Q. And he hit some really great shots on a couple holes there.  Those are things out of your control, and you seemed to handle that well and just kept grinding.
EUGENE HONG: Yeah.  Yeah, I just tried to keep on trying my best, because like I can't control what he does.  Like if he plays good and beats me, there is nothing I can do.
I just tried, but in the end I was a little short.  It's okay, because like making the semifinals two years in a row was a big accomplishment for me.  I didn't expect to make it this far, but I'm really thankful to finish again in the semifinals for the second year in a row.
Q. Does this take your confidence to another level having reached this two years in a row?
EUGENE HONG: Yes.  I learned a lot this week.  I had a lot of fun out here.  It was really tough and the course was a good challenge, so I had a lot of fun out here this week and learned a lot.  I hope that it helps my game.
