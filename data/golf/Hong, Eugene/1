 Q.  Just tell me about the stretch on 15 and 16.  You were 1-down and then you came back to get all square and took the lead on 16.  Just tell me about those holes.  
EUGENE HONG: On 15 I hit like a 5-iron from 190 to about like six feet.  Wei Wei hit it in the water, so that hole was conceded.   
But it was a tough shot because like the pin was left, and I don't want to like give away the hole.  But I kind of took a risky line just right of the pin and it worked out.   
On 16, pin was like tucked away on the right side, so I hit 8-iron to about 13 feet and lagged it about one foot short.  Wei Wei already passed the hole by about six feet and lipped out for par, so I ended up winning that hole.   
 Q.  He got off to a good start against you.  How do you keep calm and not overdo it, do too much to get everything back at once?  
EUGENE HONG: Because my match with Davis like really helped me today, because like when I was coming down the stretch with Davis I was really nervous.  I kind of learned like how to stay patient and keep calm and not really get any pressure.   
So coming down the stretch I wasn't as nervous as I was before.  That really helped me calm my nerves and hit the right shots at the right time.
