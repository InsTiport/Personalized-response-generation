John played really excellent and I tried my best, but I just kept in the moment and got lucky. But it was a good match.  Really thankful for getting to the semifinals.Q. What were your expectations coming to this Championship?EUGENE HONG: Just being here was a big accomplishment, but I just took it match by match. Didn't really know how far I would come.  Pretty excited for the semifinals.Q. Are you surprised that you've gotten this far at this point?EUGENE HONG: Yeah, pretty surprised.  I didn't expect to go this far.  I thought maybe if I reached the quarterfinals I would be exempt for next year, so I was pretty happy with that. But I just kept on going.Q. Take us through the back.  You played some birdies that kept you 2-up.  At 10, how did you birdie the hole there?EUGENE HONG: 10?  Oh, yeah, I made a 20-footer.  Like I had the right line so I just tried to trust my stroke. Just kept on rolling and got in.Q. Then he won the next hole but on 12 you had another birdie to keep you 2-up.EUGENE HONG: No. 12, yeah, I hit my 7-iron three foot.  I hitting it long on No. 12 every single time, so I took a shorter club and trusted it and finally had the right club selection.Q. What was the yardage?EUGENE HONG: I think it was 179; hit a 7 iron.  Almost like one and a half club shorter distance.Q. He won the 14th hole, but then you made a birdie here at 16.  How did you do that?EUGENE HONG: I took a short club as I was feeling adrenaline.  I just hit a good shot and made the putt, and John didn't make it unfortunately.Q. What was your yardage in on your shot on 16?EUGENE HONG: 118.Q. And then how close was it?EUGENE HONG: About five feet.Q. How is your stamina?EUGENE HONG: It's okay.  I feel okay.  It's definitely really tiring.  Like just playing in the U.S. Junior it's physical, mental, and skill.  Really takes everything in.Q. How have you dealt with the delays?EUGENE HONG: Yeah, I just relax and try to not really think about it too much.  Try to relax and feel good.
