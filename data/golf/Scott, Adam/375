 Q. Backing up, some general comments about your match, Adam. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was a good victory. You never know. He's the kind of guy that can come out and win. 7 birdies in 12 holes and then you're in a tough situation no matter how good you play. So, yeah, that wasn't how it was today, but, you know, he's a danger around here if he hits long.

 Q. How about your form?
 ADAM SCOTT: It certainly wasn't great golf. But I also kind of played the match. He was in trouble a few times. I played fairly safe and got my two putts and was doing what I had to do to win the hole. But, yeah, I'll take it.

 Q. Changes to the golf course, any opinions? They've done some undulation change?
 ADAM SCOTT: I can't really see that much of a difference.
