  Q. Adam, couple stumbles coming down the stretch. You finished like a champion. That's the closest approach of the entire at the 18th?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I was a little annoyed with myself about the 17th hole. I saved the best for last. Yeah, really was nice and giving momentum going into the weekend. Looking forward to making a few putts. I thought I putted okay. Nothing really went down today.  
  
  Q. I know you didn't make a lot, but I thought your stroke was better.  
 ADAM SCOTT: It was much better today than yesterday. I struggled with it yesterday. Today I found out a kink in it. A bit of patience maybe making it good for tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Could be a nice weekend?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It could be great. I'm hitting the ball really well. Everything is under control. I'm feeling good.  
  
  Q. Got it all coming back, good memories here?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Oh, yeah.  
  
  Q. Is that the least of your worries?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I feel like I play well around this golf course. So, you know, lot of shots suit my eye, and, you know, I'm being pretty patient with myself out there. Want to try and get in the mix over the weekend, so so far I'm doing a good job of it.
