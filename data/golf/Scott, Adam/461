Q.  When the day started, were you thinking second place, or were you thinking let's post a low number and see what's out there?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I was thinking of posting a low number.  I got off to a good start, but after about five or six holes, my swing wasn't quite where I wanted it to be and my rhythm was off and I wasn't feeling it.

So it was a good grind for me today to come out with 69.  I was pretty happy with that to be honest.  I've got a tie for second, so all in all, it's a good week.  I just, you know, want to do better than that, but obviously I saw firsthand today, Tiger played great again today, did everything he needed to do.

So, you know, I've got something to strive for.
Q.  Told us yesterday that you learn something every time you see Tiger play.  What did you learn today?
ADAM SCOTT:  I haven't played with him for a long time, actually, and I was really impressed with the way he played in the wind, tough conditions, and he really controlled everything well, hit lots of drives in the fairway.  I was impressed.  He was totally in control, extended his lead even better.  You know, really impressive.

So, he's obviously at a comfort level with his swing, and that's kind of where I want to get to.
Q.  How good is he right now?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, he's phenomenal.  He's dominating the game, six PGA events in a row, PGA TOUR events.  It's not the first time he's done it, either.  Yeah, we're all up against it.  I've got to start playing in the events he doesn't play in, that's for sure.
