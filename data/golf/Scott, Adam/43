Q. Tough start and then you got it going.  Tell us about the day?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, overall shooting in the 60s at a U.S. Open is a good thing.  I'm happy with that.  It was a tough start, had me on the back foot.  I am playing well.  I had to stay patient and stick in and wait for my chances.  I got it back under par through 9 and then tried to hold on coming in.
Always in a U.S. Open, even in these nice conditions, it's a fine line.  It's easy to drop a shot.  On Friday I'm not going to win the tournament making a birdie -- an extra birdie on two, but I could play my way out of it and I'm glad I stuck in today.  And hopefully I'm not too far back going into the weekend.
Q. How was the wind out there?
ADAM SCOTT: Kind of nonexistent.  Actually it's probably lightened up since the middle of the round.  Interestingly, for here, it's not that cold, heavy wind that we're used to seeing here coming off the ocean.  It's fairly light and it's not affecting the ball too much.  We've had perfect conditions.
Q. The golf course as it stands for the weekend, do you look for it to be more difficult and the scores might go higher, or what do you think?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think there's no doubt this morning the greens were firmer than yesterday.  I think probably the little bit of moisture that fell this morning has helped them stay quite receptive now.  If it had fined up, they would have been very firm.  I think the guys in the afternoon have a nice break with that.  It's going to be playable.  But there's no doubt they can firm the greens up in an instant here.  They're ready to go for the weekend.
Q. One percent of nature's bounty in paradise, can you just give us a few thoughts on how you feel about our area?
ADAM SCOTT: It's so beautiful.  It's -- to play golf it's one of the most spectacular areas.  But I think it's as spectacular as anywhere.  It's a golfer's heaven.
But I think just coming here and being able to spend some time has been incredibly relaxing.  I got to spend all last week here with my family who were here for the first time and they're loving it.  It was pretty nice looking forward in the schedule to see this and being able to spend two weeks in this area is great.
