  Q. Obviously a pretty good match.   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, look, I mean, Nick I think played great. He made five birdies out there today for them, and it was tough again. And Ernie held us up the whole way around, and you know, I had chances; 17 was the real chance, and a shame to miss that.   
  
  Q. How much different were the conditions?   
 ADAM SCOTT: It was a long, cold day, and ball wasn't travelling very far, and the course played completely different. Shots are now stopping on the green a bit today and you can actually hit a couple uphill putts pretty hard at the hole.   
 It's tough to adjust but good to win a session. We have got a shot. It's going to have to be a remarkable day tomorrow but we have a shot at it. That's all we ask for. It's not over.   
  
  Q. Do you think you can do it?   
 ADAM SCOTT: It is a big effort. We have done it before we just have to come out firing and get it done. Everyone is just going to have to take care of business.   
 Look, we won a session today and the first time this week. We had to do that to have a chance tomorrow. If we lost this session, it was over. We have done that.   
 So look, I mean, I think we have got to be positive about this; a bit of momentum, something. We have to think that way. This thing ain't over. This course is tough and every one of our guys has the ability to win their match tomorrow.   
  
  Q. What sort of conditions would you like tomorrow?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Something a bit warmer than this. (Laughing).
