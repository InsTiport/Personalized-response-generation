Q.   Just kind of your overall thoughts of your round today and any areas of concerns?
ADAM SCOTT:   No, not really.   I just kind of compounded my mistakes early with a couple threeâ€‘putts and got me off on the wrong foot today. 
And with conditions being so hard when you're on the back foot, this is a very hard course to pull shots in, even with opportunities at 13 and 15, I didn't manage to do it.   And I just fought really hard but I couldn't get any of those early shots back.
I'm disappointed, but a good round tomorrow could go a long, long way.

Q.   I was going to ask, what is your mindset now going into tomorrow?
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I'm going to have to come out and play a really good front nine.   That's my goal at this point.   I've just got to look at the front nine, and if I can shoot a few under on the front, you never know what can happen here on the back.

Q.   You're only six back.   Bubba came back a little bit to the field. 
ADAM SCOTT:   It's not the end of the world.   There are a lot of people between me and the leaders.   But, like I said, if I can play a good front nine, anything can happen on the back, and it would be fun to post a number and sit in the clubhouse and watch.
