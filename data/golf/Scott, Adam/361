 Q. Another good week. Just comment on your play.
 ADAM SCOTT: It was really solid again, and looking at it now, I didn't have much of a chance today. But I played good enough on the front side where I could have got something going and maybe had something special, but I didn't make any putts on the front. But it was solid golf today. That's all I could do. 

 Q. Talk about your former teammate there. Seems to be kind of the prototypical easy-going southern California guy. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, he's a real down-to-earth guy. I can't say enough about Charley. As much as I joke about all the bad stuff he made me do at college, he made me feel very comfortable, a 17-year-old kid from Australia moving to Vegas, and he drove me around all year my freshman year because I didn't have a car or anything, so he was very nice. 
 We played a lot of golf together, and it's good to see him playing up to the potential that he has. He's always been in my mind a great player, and you know, hopefully this is a bit of a jump start.

 Q. 11 birdies. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah. He can go low. I like that in a player. It's not just easy to win out here, and you've got to have these kind of days to do it. That's how difficult it is. They don't happen so often, but really happy for him.

 Q. You've got to be really pleased with your week. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, everything was really solid, solid weekend, really happy with where my game is at. You know, I really would love to get it going the next two events and try and get a win before the season is over.
