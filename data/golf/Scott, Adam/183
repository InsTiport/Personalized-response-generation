  JOHN BUSH:   We welcome Adam Scott, making his 14th start at the World Golf Championships ‑ Cadillac Championship. 
First of all, Adam, if we can get some comments from you on being back at Trump National Doral. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, well, it's a good week for me.   First week of the year, so I'm looking forward to getting into this season.   Certainly the last few weeks at home, seeing a bit of the guys play, I've got that kind of itchy feeling to play.   But I was home for good reason and everything is going well, so good time to kick it off here. 

Q.   Do you have concerns about potential rust, given you're starting later?   You've obviously had your mind on other things.   Congratulations, by the way.   How are you feeling in terms of where your game is at for the next month or so?
ADAM SCOTT:   I think it's in pretty good shape really.   Of course, you never know until you're out there playing.   But I think I've played a fair bit of golf at home, and trying to keep loose and all that kind of stuff.
I don't think it's going to be too rusty.   Of course, you know, this is a very demanding golf course, especially with the wind.   You can make mistakes easily there.   So I'll try and stay patient and not be too hard on myself with a couple of errors this week, but I see no reason why I shouldn't play well. 

Q.   Could you talk a little about the putter situation, kind of what your plans are going forward with that? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I've kind of enjoyed experimenting at home the last couple months because I've had so much time up my sleeve.   Thinking a little more objectively about it at the back end of last year, I thought because I do have to make an adjustment by the end of this year, if I'm going to spend some time doing it, I should try and start now and maybe find the best solution. 
I've putted lots of different ways at home, and you know, probably going to putt with a shorter putter this week.   It's been feeling good.   I've enjoyed doing it.   It's not that big a deal.   I did it for a long time, too, that way. 

Q.   First of all, did you remember to register?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yes. 

Q.   We've heard it from a couple guys, Webb Simpson actually snapped his belly putter across his leg so he wouldn't be tempted to use it again.   Brendan Steele needed a really horrific week to say forget it, I'm doing this.   How do you envision yourself, in what manner, going full‑time before the start of 2016? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I don't really know.   I'm just going to do it and see what happens.   And like I said, a bit with my game, I think the important thing for me will be to just stay patient with it for a little bit. 
Obviously it's slightly different than what I've been doing, but it's not completely foreign to me.   You know, just give it a chance.   I don't think I need to snap my other putter.   It treated me pretty well, so I don't think it deserves a snapping. 
You know, I'll just go out there and like I said, just stay patient with it all.   It's going to be demanding, certainly if the wind is blowing.   But I'm thinking, you know, my stroke and everything feels as good as it ever has.   So just maybe big difference is probably on really long putts, the feel dishes of putting long ones.   That seems to be coming pretty quickly, as well.

Q.   Have you ever broken a club‑‑
ADAM SCOTT:   I have broken one club, yes.   It wasn't on purpose.   It just happened to snap (laughter). 

Q.   What was the occasion? 
ADAM SCOTT:   It was a bad shot.   I think it was boiling point, yeah.   Don't really need to relive it, do we, Doug (laughter).

Q.   Going back to the putter, how long did it sort of take to you try to get comfortable?   And secondly, you mentioned sort of trying a bunch of different ways, looked like yesterday for example you were using a claw grip.   If you could talk about some of the different methods you've used. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Much like when I switched to broomstick, it takes like a day to get some level of comfort once you find how you want to do it, from I guess a fundamental standpoint and your club setup, your lie angles and all that kind of stuff.   Once you find your spot, it takes a day to get comfortable, and then it's just a bit of a feel thing, like I said, on the longer putts. 
But I have some pretty firm beliefs for myself; and the basic fundamentals I need to putt well, I think a lot of that I learned through putting with a longer putter, and I think I've kind of used them in the short putter, as well.
Certainly using whatever you want to call it, a claw grip or pencil grip or something, it's exactly the same as I had my hand on the long putter.   So that feels quite familiar to me. 

Q.   Three‑part caddie question.   Did Mike approach you, or you approached Mike?   The first week you had him, were you pretty sure he would be the one that you would use?   And what solidified his position with you? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I approached Mike to come and try a week or two with me if possible down in Australia at the end of the year, and fortunately that fitted in at the time; he was working for ThorbjÃ¸rn.   I've known Mike a long time, too.   So I know his personality quite well, and it was along the lines of what I thought I needed. 
I guess once he's on the bag, they just prove they are good caddies, and I felt good with that.   A little bit, you've just got to take a chance.   You've just got to pick someone.   I could keep having different guys try all the time but I don't think I was going to get anything more, so I felt confident with Mike and my decision, and hopefully we're going to start a good run right here.

Q.   Along the same lines, have you talked with Stevie, he seemed very undecided about just how retired he was going to be this year.   Is he done or do you expect to see him back on the TOUR? 
ADAM SCOTT:   For the moment, I think Steve's done.   The last time we spoke about him caddying again was at the back end of last year, and to me he said, "I'm going to take a year and be at home."   I honestly believe he's thoroughly enjoying that, and he's got pretty involved with all things New Zealand back there that he does, racing and coaching rugby and all that kind of stuff, playing some touch rugby himself.   So I think he's pretty content with that for this year. 
But I don't know, I haven't talked to him about that for a couple months. 

Q.   New baby, new caddie, new putter.   Are these the most variables you've had going into a year and how comfortable are you with that many? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, everything was getting a little boring so I thought (laughter) just change everything completely.
But not far‑‑ it's been fun putting with the short putter and I've enjoyed it, and that's why I've kind of persisted with it.   Whereas into the end of last season, I had not even really experimented.   I was just trying to finish the season and then I had some time up my sleeve. 
I thought I wouldn't play around until the end of this year, but I found myself having some fun looking at other ways to do it.   You know, throwing a baby in the mix is certainly going to make for an interesting year this year.   It's fantastic, and you know, it's really exciting times for my wife and myself, and going to deal with lots of different things upcoming for sure. 
I feel like I'm in a really good place with everything.   I just want to get out and play some really good golf.   I think I've been really productive in this off‑season, worked on a lot of‑‑ I've had time to work on some things in my golf game that I wanted to come out this year and feel like I'm in front of the game, or better off for having that time off. 
So I've tried to make it productive. 

Q.   I believe the baby was born in Australia.   Is that where you have been up until this point coming here?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yep. 

Q.   And also, what have been some of the challenges of the first few weeks of fatherhood, whether it be lack of sleep or any of those things that alter your life? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, we were in Australia the whole time and I came back last Wednesday and just gave myself a chance to kind of get over jet‑lag a little bit. 
But honestly, there haven't really been too many challenges.   I must say it's just been a great experience.   I was home for nine days after Bo was born.   And, okay, disturbed sleep the first couple nights was my only complaint.   But it wasn't that big a deal.   I think if you can kind of write up a whole dream scenario of how it should all happen, I think we had a pretty good run of things.   It's been a great couple weeks in my life, for sure. 

Q.   What is your schedule leading up to Augusta, and have you changed a diaper? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I'm going to play here, Tampa and Bay Hill, maybe Texas, as well, Texas Open, and then Augusta.   Just got to see how I go.   I'm kind of starting a little late.   I've got to get playing and try and find that nice rhythm on the golf course.   I think that's my goal the next three or four weeks out here.   Find that rhythm again on the golf course. 
It is different than playing the home track back at home with your family or your mates.   It's certainly much more demanding out here.   But I would love to find my rhythm, and when I've got it, I'll be happy to take a week or two weeks off and then get my head into what I need to do to go to the Masters. 
Yeah, I've changed plenty of diapers.   I thought if I change a lot early, I'll make up for my six‑week absence at the moment. 

Q.   What was more life‑changing for you, the immediate year after winning the Masters or this year after not winning the Masters, and how different will your life out on TOUR be?   Will your family travel with you or will they stay at home and you go to work? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, look, winning the Masters, I don't know how life‑changing it is.   It's career‑changing, that's for sure.   There was a big difference between winning a couple years ago and then not winning it last year.   Certainly hope to give myself a chance again this year. 
But as far as how we're going to manage having a kid, I don't really know yet.   We'll just kind of play it by ear, and as long as they are settled and comfortable, that will be good.   But try and keep my routines of golf as clear as possible for me so I can play well, and if they can travel a bit, that would be great, because I certainly want to see them as much as I can. 
But obviously with this job, like everyone here who travels, you're away sometimes, and just got to find the right balance. 

Q.   During your absence, you, along with all of your other fellow pros, have been sued by the caddies.   And your former caddie, Steve Williams has now joined the suit.   Could you just talk about your thoughts about that and Stevie deciding to join the suit even though he's not even caddying out here anymore?
ADAM SCOTT:   I'm not completely up to speed with exactly what's going on.   But, you know, it's obviously a sensitive subject for the caddies.   They feel very strongly about that, and it will also be a sensitive subject for the pros if this gets pushed along much further, because, you know, if you look at it from our side, it could get to the point where they are kind of biting the hand that feeds them.   You've got to weigh the upside of that versus the downside if it goes wrong for them. 
I think they have obviously thought long and hard about it and feel it's good.   I think there are some valid points in there.   We certainly want to look after the people working for us, whether it's making sure that they have healthcare and all those things are important, certainly in the States.   And not sure that ever going to court with your employer is an ideal situation; that was my feeling on that.

Q.   From the time you've been away this year, how much attention have you paid to golf, if any, and if you have, what story lines have intrigued you the most? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I've chimed in a little bit here and there.     Just a couple weeks ago, I was getting pretty itchy feet to come back out, so I put the golf on telly on Monday mornings back in Australia to see the finish of tournaments.   Obviously, I watched Torrey Pines a little bit, and saw Jas win for sure.   So was very pleased for him. 
But yeah, the last few weeks, I've been paying attention.   Obviously Tiger struggling has been unmissable.   It's in the papers even at home in Australia.   I guess that's a big story.   But I certainly liked seeing Jason win, and Brandt winning again, I think there's been some good stories; Brooks winning.   And it's hard when you sit at home.   You think, you just want to be in that position again.   I'm going to try and make the most of it. 

Q.   I saw you using two putters out there; are either counterbalanced? 
ADAM SCOTT:   No, neither are counterbalanced, no. 

Q.   Another caddie question.   When it became public that you and Steve were no longer together, how many people did you hear from, and who was the most‑‑ the craziest or most entertaining, unsolicited offer that you received? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I won't put anyone in this room‑‑ just kidding.   (Laughter).
Yeah, I got a lot of approaches, but that's going to happen.   I got some real beauties that were written into the office back in Australia, some letters and some pictures. 
There was a letter from a Japanese guy, and apparently he's related to the royal family over there, but even in his letter, he says he's extremely lazy (laughter).   I can't even remember the whole thing.   But I've kept it because it's just too good.   And he included a picture of himself. 
A guy here in Florida, also, sense in a picture of himself, big strong guy, looks like he works out, muscle, muscle man kind of thing and lives with his 85‑year‑old mother.   He made a point of telling me that, as well in the application.   (Laughter) but unfortunately, those ones were unsuccessful for them. 

Q.   When you look back at your year last year, what was the most disappointing thing to you and secondly, most pleasing? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I mean, look, I was disappointed I didn't win a major, and I felt that was my main goal, so I didn't really achieve that.   And probably didn't just finish out the year as strong as I wanted the last four events.   Played well, but it just didn't happen. 
It's kind of a good time to get some momentum going, as Rory showed through the Open and PGA and World Golf Championships and into the Playoffs.   You can really have a great run there, and I just never got it going.   So maybe that. 
But the highlight was obviously getting to world No. 1 and winning at Colonial that same week was a pretty great memory for me in my career. 
JOHN BUSH:   Adam Scott, thank you, sir.
