 Q.   Adam, you came here looking for a lot of confidence carrying you to Augusta.   Unfortunately you didn't get the win.   What do you take from this week?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I take a lot of positive stuff out of it.   I didn't putt at all well today.   It was just a little out of sorts for whatever reason.  
But I somewhat achieved what I wanted out of coming here.   Playing in contention over the weekend was fun.   Definitely identified a few areas that I'll be working on in the next couple of weeks.   And I'm looking forward to that.   It was good to be back in the mix again.  
   
 Q.   Last two opportunities you've had a 54‑hole lead, unfortunately you didn't win those events.   What is the minor thing, maybe it's a Major thing, you told me, but what is the difference in not holding the championship trophy on Sunday?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I really think the putting has let me down on both of those occasions.   I actually played quite nicely in Australian when I had the lead.   But today was a bit shaky.   But this course was asking a lot of everyone today, I think.   And my short game just wasn't there.   So that needs to be tightened up and probably shows that I need to do a bit more work on it to hold up under the pressure.  
   
 Q.   Did you start feeling out of sorts right out of the get‑go?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Not really.   Missing the putt on the first is never a good feeling, but you look to make one somewhere.   But I just didn't give myself that many chances.   It was a little tricky out there.   And the couple of good putts I did hit didn't go in.   It's no excuse.   I need to do a little more work, I think, on my putting over the next couple of weeks.   Because the last couple of times in this position it's not been as sharp as I would like.  
   
 Q.   Can you take any solace in the fact that since 2006 no one's won the Masters having won an event coming into the Masters?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I like it.   I feel good that I played in contention on the weekend.   Obviously not the outcome I wanted today.   I wanted to play a great round and kind of run away with this thing.   
But clear what I have to work on for the Masters and have the putting in nice order.   It was nice the first couple of days, but it's a different story when you've got to hit a lot of 6‑ and 10‑footers with the pressure on.  
   
 Q.   Were you feeling you had to make an eagle putt on 16?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I didn't feel I had to make it, but it was a putt that was never going to be short of the hole, it was straight downhill.   But the next putt I just completely misread.   I feel I hit a good putt there, and just couldn't believe it broke so much, because I felt the eagle putt went very straight by the hole.   And that was disappointing.   Because then at the end of the day to see a putt on 16 short missed and 17 missed and then to stand there on the 18th fairway I would have had a chance to be tied playing the last hole, not making two putts is disappointing.  
   
 Q.   You talked about taking the positives away from this.   Yesterday you said given these opportunities you wanted to close it, is that disappointing?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I'm annoyed that I didn't do better today.   Sometimes you've got to be hard on yourself.   Sometimes you don't.   And I think I was getting into a really good spot and had an opportunity here to run away with an event and really take a lot of confidence.   I'm taking confidence, anyway, from just some good play.  
But some opportunities you've got to take.   
   
 Q.   What's next?   You go home, same thing you would have done either way?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I'll be‑‑ I'm going to Augusta for the next couple of days and then go home and work on it.   If nothing else, it's a good reminder on how much putting practice I need to do for going to the Masters and just how important it is.   And if I think back to last year, I made every putt that you expect to in that last round and ultimately that's, I guess, maybe what gave me the chance to win.  
   
 Q.   What do you think was the difference in the putting today compared to Thursday, Friday, when you seemed to putt pretty well?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I just didn't‑‑ the putts I had to make today, they were too close.   I was making long putts Thursday and Friday.   I read the greens a little poorly, I must say.   You need confidence in that, too, and after missing a couple over the last couple of days doubts creep into your reads.   You need to be certain.   And I just wasn't a hundred percent on.  
   
 Q.   Was there one hole or shot that‑‑  
ADAM SCOTT:   No, I felt I had a chance standing on the 17th hole.   And it was an awkward yardage and I tried to muscle the 6‑iron.   But getting it up and down I still had a chance at the last.   You just never know in golf.   You've got to stay in there.   That's why I'm disappointed that let the putts on 16 go by, because without doing anything and I could have had a chance.
