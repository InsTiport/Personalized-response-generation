  Q.  Talking about the course.   

 ADAM SCOTT:  Good set-up today.  The greens were much softer.  The course played good today, played like it should, the way it was set up to.  Too hard to come back from. (In reference to the slow start.)   

 Kind of to be expected.  The guys in contention for the first time, that's gonna happen.  It depends on the wind too, if it comes up, whoever shoots even par will win.
