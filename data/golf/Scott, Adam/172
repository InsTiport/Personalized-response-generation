Q. You enter today at even par which is historically around where the cut line settles between even and 1-over.  So you needed to get to work today, shot 3-under, I would imagine you're happy with that?ADAM SCOTT: It was a good round of golf.  One bad swing on the fourth tee and it cost me a double bogey.  But I put myself in position, at least with a great weekend, I might have a chance.Q. After that double, the three birdies after that.  How important is it to bounce back from the mistakes, because on a Pete Dye course, those scores are going to happen, it's more of a matter of how you bounce back, right?ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it is.  Mistakes are really punished here, but the good shots are really rewarded.  And it's just important to hit a few good ones right after that mistake because all of a sudden you find yourself in a position hanging on to make the cut, and that's not where you want to be, you want to be trying to move up the board. So it was good to come back straight away.  And there was lots of good in there and hopefully more on the weekend.Q. Comfortably heading into the weekend now.  So for you what's going to be the key to continue to climb up this leaderboard?ADAM SCOTT: Well, I think really limiting the mistakes.  If I can kind of have a mistake-free weekend, that's difficult to do, but certainly no double bogeys and maybe just the one bogey would be nice and I can have a good score.  That's kind of been the story of the year for me, just too many big errors.Q. Rounds of 72 and 69 Adam Scott at 9-under.  You came home over the front nine, you double bogeyed 4, what a way to recover, three birdies.ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I needed to, because it can go wrong so quick around this golf course.  Again, kind of one bad swing today cost me a really great round, I believe. There was lots of good golf in there, but I'm going to have to have kind of mistake-free weekend now to move up and get in contention.Q. It's an observation a lot of players are making, but it can really hurt you, can't it?ADAM SCOTT: Well, it's very hard to recover from the water.  There's plenty of it around here.  So, you make that bad swing at the wrong time and find yourself in the water, with a tough golf course like this, you're staring double in the face.  It's hard to get away from it.Q. You're in the mix and it's a cast of superstars for this weekend.  What can you do?ADAM SCOTT: Well, like I said, I mean, there's plenty of good stuff in there, I just have to limit those errors.  You can have an error, just not doubles.  If can I do that, I think I can catch them.Q. Always enjoy following you because you're never out of the game and you bounced back with those three straights birdies, that was well done.ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, that was really important.  I thought I built a nice round and then threw it away in two holes; and had to just remind myself it was good stuff in there before those couple of holes with two poor swings.  And then managed to claw back and feeling a little more comfortable going into the weekend now.  If I can limit those poor swings on the weekend, I'll have a chance to be up there.Q. You're working hard, all you guys, it's a grind out there.  It always is when you come here, isn't it?ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely.  It was nice conditions this morning.  The greens were a lot smoother than yesterday afternoon and the wind wasn't quite as gusty.  So I needed to take advantage of that. And it is just a tough golf course.  You get out of position and it's really easy to compound a mistake and that's when you start staring big numbers in the face and that's why we see lots of big numbers around here.Q. The leaders aren't too far away, you got them in your sights, don't you?ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know why no one's really been able to run yet, we'll see how they go this afternoon, but it is, it's just a demanding golf course, it's a very hard to get around here bogey-free and the rough is challenging and when you're in it, it's just a little unpredictable.
