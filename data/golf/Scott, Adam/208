  ADAM SCOTT:   I played overall really nice today, but killed my momentum on the 9 with a double.   I played well‑‑ but the next nine as well.   But I just didn't get anything going on the green. 
So I'd like to get out tomorrow and get moving in the right direction.   If the conditions are good, it's going to be low scores all week.   So hopefully get it going for 18 tomorrow.

Q.   Keegan Bradley played with more of a conventional putter.   Obviously something going to be an issue.   What's that transition like?   Is it something that guys who are using the longer putters are dealing with a lot or thinking about at least?
ADAM SCOTT:   I can really only speak for myself, and I haven't even thought about it, to be honest, 18 months before it's really a concern.   And I'm not really worried.   I'll decide then what I think is best.
But I've putted with a short putter and putted with a long putter, and I'll figure what I'm going to stick with, a long one or try a short one.

Q.   Any bit of a lull after winning just a few days ago, and is it any difficulty getting back up after the victory, or you went right back at it?
ADAM SCOTT:   No, I was feeling really good.   My swing feels like it's gotten to a better place since last week, feel very good.   And I went out and started in that fashion and sloppy shot on the 9.   And like I said, it's just a momentum killer.   And it's not always easy to just pick it back up and get going.   And none of the putts went after that.
But I feel like I'm up for it this week.   And obviously I'm going to have to chase some guys down, because there's going to be a lot of birdies.

Q.   What did you see out of Rory today?
ADAM SCOTT:   He played lovely.   Obviously he's in good form.   So he even made an error and shot 9‑under.   There's good scores out there if you're on.   And if we keep getting these good conditions, I expect it to go deep this week.
