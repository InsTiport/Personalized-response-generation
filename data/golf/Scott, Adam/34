 Q.  Phenomenal 66 around here. Golf course is playing pretty tough, I thought. How do you assess your round today and how did you play?  
ADAM SCOTT: It plays tough if you're not in the fairway. The rough is really nasty this year. It's firmer than I really remember it to be honest. So you really do have to be in the fairway off the tee to give yourself a chance of getting any kind of a look.   
 Q.  When I saw you in Napa, looked like you were working on things in your golf swing. What were you working on and have they come to fruition?  
ADAM SCOTT: That was weeks ago. I've worked on heaps of stuff since then.   
 Q.  Looked like you were working hard.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, you know, I was actually -- it all looks really good, but I just haven't had any good feelings of where the golf club is in the downswing, and that's never I nice thing and I've been trying to trust it the best I can. But kind of really found it last week -- although my scoring didn't really indicate it.   
It's just starting to feel where that club head is a little more in the downswing, everything is looking good. I haven't really worked on much. I widened my stance a little bit.   
 Q.  For the rest of the week, what's the key for you on this golf course in making sure that you get it in the house the way you want to?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, fairways for sure. Even if it rains and gets softer, still the rough is so thick this year that you just can't really control anything out of it. The priority is the fairway, and I'm driving it well with my new TS4.   
 Q.  Were you comfortable out there and happy the way you played?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, very happy with how I played this golf course today. You had to be in the fairway, and I hit a lot of them. The couple times I missed, I managed to manage myself out of trouble. You know, you're not going to be able to rely all week on doing that, so I've got to keep hitting fairways.   
 Q.  Is this a nice comfortable combination of yourself, Henrik and Tommy out there? You seemed to be a nice three ball to be playing?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, very comfortable for me. Obviously I know Henrik well. We've been out here grinding for years, and Tommy is great fun to play with.   
I was pretty focused on what I was doing. Of course, it was a bit of a catch-up. I haven't seen Henrik it seems like all year for some reason, so getting clued in on what he's up to, it's all good. We had five hours to spend out there so we had a chat here and there.   
 Q.  You've had WGC success before. These are important events. Every event is important, but it raised the bar a little bit the way the course is set up, the people that are here and the standard and quality of play?  
ADAM SCOTT: Definitely the strength of field has always been a big thing for these World Golf Championships, and like you said, I think the setup of the golf course has just raised the level this year. It's in the best shape I remember, firm, with long rough. I mean, no wind today, I think is giving you a false idea of how difficult the course is, if any wind blows at all this week, you'll see the scores start heading up.
