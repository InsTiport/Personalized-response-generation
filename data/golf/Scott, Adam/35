 Q.  Adam 6-under; nice round. Just get some comments, please.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, some good solid stuff really generally this week. It's kind of felt better every day and I'm putting nicely. I don't know. I mean, you just have to get really hot out there to keep pace, and hopefully I've got one really hot round in me tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're showing enough to suggest that you could do that out there. There has been a lot of chances. That what you need to do, put some scoreboard pressure on early?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I mean, yeah, I'm going to have to shoot ridiculously low, I think. It's possible in these conditions. I think there were two or three 62s out there today, some 63s, so it's very possible.   
Just got to get off to a hot start. That's the tricky thing around here. The first six holes are not that easy. So you've got to play some really good golf in those first six, and then the last twelve holes there is a real opportunity for you to capitalize.   
 Q.  Australia wants to know if you're going to stay up for the NRL final and if you have a tip?  
ADAM SCOTT: Probably not going to stay up for the final tonight. My team is not playing, so...   
But I guess for me, I would like to see Canberra win. Thinking back to when I first got into watching Rugby League, they were a hell of an outfit. Ricky Stuart coaching them, maybe there is an omen in that.
