 Q.  A tough one for you there. You got off to a pretty good start in the middle of that front nine, three in a row, and was hard to pull it back.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was just 5,6 and 7 really got behind the 8-ball. He played exactly how you would want to play a match, really solid. I made a couple mistakes and he hit a couple great shots and I was in trouble. Just too much for me to claw back. He deserves to win today.   
 Q.  Quite a remarkable win in the Americans can get up. It's coming down to the wire.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I was trying not to look too much. I was trying really hard to claw my way back into this thing but it's obviously tight. We need it to go our way. Go out there and give the boys some help.
