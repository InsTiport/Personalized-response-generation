 Q.  How do you process what transpired here on Sunday?  
ADAM SCOTT: I really haven't had time to. It's gutting at the moment. I guess we got off to a slow start, and couldn't get out of that hole and couldn't get the matches in early enough. Once that U.S. train gets rolling, it's a tough one to stop.   
You know, I feel for everyone here this week. I think our guys played exceptionally well. I think they really lifted and they probably weren't given much of a chance, starting the week out.   
From where I sat, they really lifted their games and played some good matches, and we just didn't have quite enough today.   
 Q.  You talked all week long that it's a different atmosphere and different climate in that team room, despite not getting the outcome you hoped for. What can you and this squad take away from this?  
ADAM SCOTT: I think we have taken many steps forward in the last couple years. There are some things now that I feel can only get better for us, and for guys who have bought in this year, will definitely want back in in a couple years, and I hope to be there, as well.
