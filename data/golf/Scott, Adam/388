  Q. No dropped shots, you must be pleased with it compared to yesterday's round.   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was good ball-striking again today, but you know, just ground it out. And a couple of mistakes I made, I missed the green, but I had some good up-and-downs. So you know, obviously no bogeys on a Sunday is always good.   
  
  Q. What was the change in your swing or what was it that sort of flicked that switch today?   
 ADAM SCOTT: It was really my putting. I mean, my putting was woeful yesterday, and to be honest, it was a little shaky today. I didn't have the best touch, but I made all the ones that I should make, and yesterday I wasn't. So there's really a difference in putting.  
  
  Q. Has there been a dramatic change now in your confidence, are you feeling better about your game going into The Open certainly?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I'm feeling really happy about putting a good number on the board this week. It's been a while since I've done that, and the swing is feeling good. Obviously want to work on the confidence a bit, but I think it was good just for the nerves, as well, to be kind of playing not near the lead but up there on Sunday and just feel like you're playing for a position in the tournament.   
  
  Q. How good do you feel about your game right now?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, I feel the best I've felt this year to be honest, but no, it feels very good overall. I think all aspects of my game have improved from past years, and it's really a bit of a confidence thing and hopefully make a couple putts next week and get myself in it.
