  Q.  How was it out there?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  I had to grind; I'm shattered.   
  
  Q.  How do you feel about it?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  I'm so close to playing really well.  It's starting to get a bit frustrating out there.  Just a few yards here or there with a drive.  And then a couple of putts, you know, got rattled a little bit with the 4-putt on 6, so that wasn't very nice.   
 But, you know, I hung in there which is what I needed to do because I felt like at any time I could string a few together and make up some ground, but it didn't happen.  I gave myself a lot of chances.  Tomorrow have to do the same stuff, give myself chances.   
  
  Q.  You're putting so well; how did you 3-putt?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Bit of a brain fart.  I hit a good second putt down on the high side, didn't break so then from the other side I played no break and broke a lot and missed on the low side  (shaking head).  Silly, wasting a couple of shots.   
  
  Q.  A lot of guys said they were struggling to get the feel for the greens out there today.   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Well, it's hard because you think as they are drying out they are going to get quick.  But, you know, they are such severe slope that it's slow up the hills.  And then occasionally one can get away from you downhill, so it's a big difference depending on whether you're putting uphill, downhill; and then on a sidehill, if you've got to putt one up and then bring it down, it's quite tough to judge the speed.   
  
  Q.  With Tiger's closing record and with a three- or four-shot lead, does it become a bit of a formality?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Well, I mean, you never want to say that, but certainly he's proved that he's very hard to catch up to in a major.  But you know, there have been 63s out here, so someone can go out and play the round of their life, thick put a little pressure on him.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel like you're the man that can do it?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  I feel like I'm very close to playing very well.  If I can get off to a start like I did today and keep it going, you never know.   
 But, you know, I don't fear going low, that's for sure.
