Q.   What's the feeling now?   You didn't start well, but you're still right there. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Oh, yeah.   I mean, even par in these conditions is a good score.   Even par or better.   So no one's doing a lot out there.   It's tough conditions today.   Everything was thrown at us, and the pins are really tough, it's easy to make mistakes.   And I didn't make too many and I managed to hit a few good ones to make birdie.

Q.   Did you feel it was sort of going the wrong way early?
ADAM SCOTT:   No, that's just par for the course around this place.   You don't have to do too much wrong to get it in an awkward spot and, like I said, the pin spots are just so difficult, so you have to scramble very, very well not to drop shots around here. 

Q.   You had pointed out those first several as well and you came back a little bit. 
ADAM SCOTT:   You're going to drop a couple shots on a day like today.   And it's just that I had them in a row.   And it was a good thing, I had a lot of holes to make them up too. 

Q.   Was the wind changing a lot or was it quite predictable?
ADAM SCOTT:   No, no, the wind was very, very difficult today.   It was a little bit swirling and then gusty at times and then moving 20, 30, 40 degrees quickly from hole to hole.   So it's really hard to judge shots and pick clubs and pick lines to hit it on.   It's a really tricky golf course when the wind is like this. 

Q.   You maintained that proximity to the leader as opposed to score all week, that hasn't changed really, obviously. 
ADAM SCOTT:   I don't know, I haven't really looked at what's leading at the moment.   But no, I just got to stay in touch.   I'm sure that there's some players that must be bunched. 
So it's going to be an interesting weekend.   I'm sure it's going to be a tough weekend if there's any wind at all, it's going to play tough. 

Q.   You see some guys on the back nine playing well. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, that's what it's all about.   I would love to play the parâ€‘5s a little better, but today they were playing tough all of them.   From 15, 13 into the wind, 8 is kind of into the wind and across, and 2 is even into the wind off the tee.   It makes them tougher and I didn't take advantage of them.   Some days you just can't force the issue.   So hopefully keep putting it in spots to attack on the weekend and I'll have plenty of chances.
