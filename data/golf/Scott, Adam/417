 Q.  You talked in the media center yesterday about a little change in the swing with Butch.  Did it work well for you today? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it did.  It wasn't as free-wheeling as the practice round.  There was a few squirrelly iron shots out there, but I'm happy.  I think it'll sink in here this week. 

 Q.  Is there more fear of getting out in the first round, and then once you get through that is it kind of a weight off your shoulders? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  I think it is.  It's not that easy to get in a rhythm early because it's a little different format and mistakes early are going to cost you the whole week.  You've got to get out there and get right into it.  No, the first round is probably tougher to play than a lot of other rounds. 

 Q.  So you get through, and then tomorrow if you get through 36, suddenly there you are? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, you're looking good.  You're down to 16 guys and your average improves.  But every match is a tough match.  That's the thing, it's just one day.  That makes it interesting and it gives you the opportunity to maybe surprise a few people. 

 Q.  Is this a good course for this event, a couple fun holes? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think it's okay.  You know, it's got some fun stuff for match play, drivable par-4s and some reachable 5s and it's in perfect condition, so it's a pleasure to play.
