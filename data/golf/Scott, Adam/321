  Q. Seemed like you really battled today and you really hit a lot of good shots, a lot of quality shots but just came up short.   
 ADAM SCOTT: They were good early on and I kind of left CT hung out to dry on the front nine the three times I was out of play. So he did well just to keep us where we were but we got off to a tough start and it was a battle. When you're behind early on a day like today against Mickelson and Furyk, I mean, it's always going to be a grind.  
 But we hung in there good and made a match of it and just came up a bit short.  
  
  Q. Talk about the conditions a little today and what it was like, what it was like for you out here.   
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, it's carnage on a golf course like this today. Thank goodness it's match play and we weren't actually counting our strokes. It's a great golf course when it can play fairly in conditions like this. That's a true testament to how good of a golf course it is. It's just very, very difficult. You have to really control your golf ball on every shot.  
  
  Q. What do you feel like you have going well so far this week and what do you feel like you might need to improve on a little bit going into the weekend?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Look, I'm playing really well. Today is a day where it's hard to feel like you're playing well, because you can get out of position very easily. I'm in good shape. I think overall as a team, we are just going to have to find some energy for the week and it's so important for us now.   
  
  Q. You've now had two days, two different partners, anybody you are looking to get paired with going into Saturday?   
 ADAM SCOTT: There's probably going to be a lot of discussion upcoming and we are going to have to find some winning partnerships.
