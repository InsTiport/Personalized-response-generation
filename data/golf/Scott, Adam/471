ADAM SCOTT:  I kind of got off to a bad start on the back nine with a bogey on 12, so I was grinding from there.  A couple loose shots on the front nine.

But all in all, it was pretty good.  I'm putting nicely, so that's a good thing.
Q.  Any part of your game that was kind of struggling today?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, I haven't driven the ball very well this week, which is really the first week this year that I haven't driven well.  I'd like to straighten that out for the weekend
Q.  Do you feel like you're in a good spot at 4 under?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, pretty good.  I mean, at the moment four back.  Might be a couple more back by the end of the day.  But yeah, that's not too far back.  I just need one low round to get myself into it.  Tomorrow would be a great, a 6 under or something.
Q.  What did you think of the golf course today?
ADAM SCOTT:  Pretty soft with that little bit of rain we had last night.  The greens are holding shots well, so if you strike them well, they're going to finish pretty close.
