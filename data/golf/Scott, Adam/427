 Q.  What do you take from this experience? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Well it's disappointing for us, but I felt I played better every day and, you know, it's just hard-fought matches.  The U.S. played great throughout the week and we left ourselves a lot to do today. 
 You know, if we can win a few matches, we can at least walk out of here with our heads held high.
