Q. Two back entering the weekend. Just thoughts on the first two days and how you played and where you're at heading into the weekend?
ADAM SCOTT: Generally it was pretty good. You know, it's the kind of course that penalises your poor shots, so when you hit one, it might feel worse than it really is, but I managed to scramble pretty well. And you know, if I can just keep the number of fairways hit up, I think I'm in good shape for the weekend.
Q. Only two bogeys on this weekend. What do you attribute being so mistake-free so far on obviously a pretty difficult golf course out there?
ADAM SCOTT: I've hit a lot of fairways. My short game has shown up when I needed. I wished I could -- I had a few more opportunities out there today. I wish I could have rolled them in. Hopefully I get the speed down on the weekend and start seeing them drop.
Q. Did you see this coming into this week, how you've felt about the game so far?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I felt good with the game last week. Just felt like I was a bit under done, really. I worked a little bit on my setup and it's hard to take straightaway in a tournament situation. I think the rounds last week help get me prepared for this week.
Q. After this week, what do you have going until the Presidents Cup?
ADAM SCOTT: I'll just be playing the Australian Open the week before the Presidents Cup. So I'll have a nice little break coming up where I can get ready for three big weeks in Australia at the end of the year.
