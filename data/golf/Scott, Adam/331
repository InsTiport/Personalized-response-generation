   ADAM SCOTT: It was a good round out there today. I played really solid. I hit a lot of greens, left a lot of chances out there, but to finish birdie-birdie was a nice way to end the day and make something out of what could have been a really good round.   
  
  Q. Do you feel like there's less pressure with so much attention to the top 5 guys in the FedExCup? Is there less pressure on yourself heading into this tournament?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I'm just playing a tournament here this week, and you know, it's a good one to be at, to only have to beat 29 guys for a change. I don't think there's any pressure on anyone other than those top 5, although I don't know that there's that much pressure on those guys, either. It's kind of a no-lose situation for them all.   
  
  Q. Is it a more relaxed atmosphere here?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It's a nice atmosphere. I've got to say, everything works pretty good when there's only 30 players at a tournament. A lot less egos (laughing).   
  
  Q. It sounded like you had a lot more birdie opportunities that missed, but talk about the psychology of a par save. What does a par save mean to a round and holding things together and sort of the emotional lift?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it means a lot at these kind of golf courses that are set up so difficult and not necessarily that easy to make up shots. So saving a shot is huge for momentum and just to keep a round going and buy yourself some time until you can get in a situation where you're going to make a birdie.   
 For me today there were two good ones on 10 and 11, and that kept me in with a chance, and I just waited until I could convert an opportunity.  
  
  Q. Last week you said that you were hitting it perfect and just couldn't get it done around the greens. Do you feel like you've made that adjustment?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, today wasn't great. I had so many chances from 10 feet today; I think I made two of ten. A little disappointing, but, you know, it's good that I'm playing really great and giving myself some chances. So if I can do that for three more days, I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a hot one out there.
