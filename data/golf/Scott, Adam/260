 Q.   Overall, how would you assess the round today?  
ADAM SCOTT:   It was a mixed bag today.   You know, just a sloppy finish, unfortunately.   Just hit a few poor drivers coming in and made it hard to make par.   
I felt like I was still in there with a chance coming up 13, if I could do something special up there and obviously 14.   You never know.   But the rough got me.   I was in the long stuff too much today to really have a good chance.   You can't escape it all the time.  
   
 Q.   How much confidence will you get out of today to use for the rest of the year?   
ADAM SCOTT:   It would have been nice to get another win in a major seeing I've kind of put myself in position, but I didn't.   So I have got to push on and try and win a couple other tournaments this year to feel like I really get something out of my good play.   It's hard to play good all the time, what I feel is good all the time, and not win.  
So the focus is now on the next few events and the FedExCup.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   It's really satisfying.   It's what I'm working towards.   It was ‑‑ obviously the goal was to win one, but the real goal is to put myself in this position a lot more and play.   
At some point this year, I think I led every major at some point during the week.   
Obviously I'm peaking at the right times.   It's hard to stay there for four days and have the lead the whole time, but I feel like I'm improving still.   So it's something to build on for next year's season.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   It was a bit of fun, the last glimmer of hope, you know.   But then I had three poor drives to finish with.   I don't know what happened the last few holes, but I felt like I may as well have a go at it down 16.   If I drive it in the fairway, it's just a wedge.   If I could birdie them all, I would have finished 10‑under and you never know.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Beg your pardon?   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Not really.   Your don't think about it.   It does afterwards when it's all done.   Really just try and keep your mind on the job on the golf course and do the best you can, always staying positive.   But frustration can come in afterwards, but I'm not frustrated at all.   I wish I could have played better and I really didn't.   If I'd been out there and played great and missed a ton of putts then I would be disappointed right now.   But I knew I would have had to get to double digits really today.   It's perfect.   They set the course up well.   I just didn't play clean enough golf.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   No.   There was no controversy at all.   They gave him thewrong color bibs and they asked me to get him to change it.   I bogeyed the first and I forgot because I was nervey and bogeyed the first.   I forgot to ask him to change, so he never did.   There wasn't anything wrong with that.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   If that is the case, that's good because I had a lot over at U.S. Open; I know that.   That means I'm playing really good in the others.   I think I was cumulative low man last year, as well, in the four majors.   If that is the case, I'm doing something right.   I wish it added up to more than one win in eight, but I feel‑‑ I'm going to try to do all the right things between now and next April and go back and try and defend and get stuck into again.  
I mean, I really feel like I've got the right program in place.   I just have to keep the motivation high and keep working hard.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I have changed many things, my schedule changed a lot to open up a lot more practice time.   You know, I feel for your swing and your short game and your putting to stand up to fourdays of major pressure, if you are in contention, you have to have done a lot of work on it not only just to hold up to it, but it takes some time for the practice to accumulate enough to get to that point.   
There's years work in it before you even get to a point.   It's not just you decide to start practicing a bit harder, take a couple of tournaments off and you play good.   A lot goes into it.   You have got to have people around who are supportive as well.   I certainly have that.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I'm looking just now at the FedExCup.   And like I said, I would like to feel like I could win a couple of those events if I continue to play well and get some satisfaction out of what I feel like has been a good year of golf where I have contended a bit at big ones or not.   I would like to contend in a couple other tournaments and get over the line.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I think the future looks really promising.   Jason obviously has got a real taste for it.   Again, going out today he was hot for a while, I guess, and he looks like he's really got the game to where he's going to be a threat for as long as he wants now.   He is so young.   
Leish has got to be feeling good, too.   And we've got a whole host of guys with the experience.   It's just a matter of form.   We have got the guys with the talent.   That never goes away; it's just their form.   When that comes back, we're going to be really strong.   It wouldn't surprise me, you know, seeing Jason or myself or Leish do well to get right back in the mix, too.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, absolutely, it's a fantastic course.   I think everyone is going to go away from here giving it rave reviews.   The PGA did a fantastic job setting it up, I think, to see some really exciting golf across the week.   
Also, you know, obviously it was tough because the guys who didn't play very well out there struggled to score.   I think it was a true reflection of how you played.   I would love to come back here.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yep, it's a real long time until the Masters.   It's nearly a year.   I'm sure it will go quick like everything does.   
On the PGA Tour, we have still got so much to play for this year.   That's all happening in the next month or so, sixweeks.   There is no time to rest.   There will be time to rest later.
