 Q.  Obviously hard to win two of these things? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  It is.  It's demanding.  I played really well this week, but I made too many mistakes in the first three rounds, and today was better, which is nice to play well on Sunday.  At least I got some good golf out of my good golf. 

 Q.  Just eliminated the mistakes? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  I didn't make too many mistakes today.  I was a little more patient with myself.  I was pretty frustrated the second and third round because I felt like I should have been in the hunt and wasn't. 
 In the end I was too far back even to have a go today.  But my game is in good shape so I'm pretty happy. 

 Q.  You had that big win in Houston.  Do you feel like your entry into the States has sort of affected your rhythm from week to week? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I certainly think it did, but today I'm back on track.  Today was an important day for me, I think, get a little momentum going.  You know, I haven't really shot that many low numbers to be honest, with the exception of Houston.  You know, I've shot a lot of 71s, 72s, 73s, 74s, 75s.  It was good to shoot a low number on a pretty tricky course. 

 Q.  How are you going to set up your preparation for the U.S. Open from here in? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Play Memorial, Memphis and the U.S. Open, so I'll play my way in, as I did for Augusta.  I like the feeling of only being four or five days in between competition rounds teeing it up again where it's not really enough time to get anxious and worry too much about things.
