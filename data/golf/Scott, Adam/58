Q. Couple of bogeys, a double, but you're able to right the ship at the end.  Thoughts on your round today?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, lots of stuff happening out there.  Overall in the end, I'm glad to be where I am.  But I really switched off there for five holes and made a mess of things around the turn.  Might have shot myself out of the tournament.  We'll see how it goes tomorrow, but it's going to be costly and make life difficult for me to win this thing now.  Hit some poor shots and missed a couple putts, but really, the driver let me down there.  I just started missing fairways and with the greens firming up, it's difficult to control it on these small putting surfaces out of the rough.
Q. You finished strong, a couple birdies down the stretch and we know there's a 62 out there.  You never know.
ADAM SCOTT: Might mean the scoring, really.  Some low scores out there.  I'm not sure how they did that.  The greens are pure, so if you're on the greens, you can really roll some putts.  But I just had that run of five holes where I didn't hit it great but the confidence is good.  It's a shame, I think it was, you know, just laziness, really, around that stretch.  Just didn't focus and the momentum was starting to go the wrong way, but it was good to claw back a few and shoot under par.
