 Q.   Eight birdies and no bogeys, ho‑hum 64.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Ho‑hum, yeah, it's pretty solid today.   Really happy with that.   I don't know if you can ever say you can feel that coming on around Doral, but I got off to hot starts Friday and Saturday the front sides, and not being able to capitalize on it.  
So it was great to keep it all going and hold it all together for 18 today and kind of finish the week off on a high note after a pretty slow start.  
   
 Q.   The round of the week, it's always nice to do that on Sunday before you leave town.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, it is, yeah.   And I felt like my game really progressed every day this week and showed in the scores, literally.   It's good for me going into next week, a course that I think I can do well at.   
Although I have not done that great there in the past, it will be a good challenge for me next week to try and get more out of myself.  
   
 Q.   You played pretty well at Riviera, obviously played well here; how are you feeling about your game heading towards Augusta?   
ADAM SCOTT:   At the moment I'm very comfortable with where everything's at.   I like what I'm seeing.   I liked a lot of the stuff I saw, even the first three days here, a lot of good stuff, and obviously tightened everything up today.   It was great.   Got the putter rolling.   Short game feels better this year than it ever has.   So, who knows, so far, I'm liking where it's at and it would be good to keep it going next week.
