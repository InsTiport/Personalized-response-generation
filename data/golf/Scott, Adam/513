Q.  You had a heck of a run down the back nine.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it was a good run.  Tried to hold onto a good bit there, and maybe if I could keep that run going for a couple more holes, I would have had a more realistic chance.  Then, you know, I probably needed an eagle on 18 in the end but I putted out for birdie.   It's nice to play well and you don't want to throw it away.
Q.  You had made those four straight birdies ten through 13 and burned the edges on three of next four holes.  Talk about that stretch there.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, every putt on those four holes could have gone in.  I just played a beautiful back nine.  I hit every green, and every putt I hit had a chance.  So a couple of them, I'm a little shocked they didn't go in.  But, you know, I'm very happy with how that all went today.
Q.  Inaudible?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it was good.  I'm still looking to try to defend the title and I'm sure that feeling would be pretty good.  But after the front nine, and I saw those guys run away, you know, the back nine is no pushover.  I knew if I could make a few birdies, I may have a chance.  I felt I was playing good enough that it would just take a couple of putts to go in and hopefully get some momentum.
Q.  Did you feel less pressure with the focus on Tiger and Vijay?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I pretty much wasn't in any limelight this week, and especially today with Tiger and Vijay going at it, and with so much riding it on, I guess.  It wasn't easy to creep up on it but certainly there wasn't much pressure on me at all and I managed to get myself in with a chance.
Q.  Inaudible?
ADAM SCOTT:  14, I couldn't believe that one, it rolled right over the edge.  And also 17, that one rolled over the edge.  16 hit the lip, took a bit of lip on the way by.
Q.  Inaudible?
ADAM SCOTT:  There wasn't a leaderboard at 12, 13 or 14.  So I didn't see what was going on till I got to 15 and I saw I was one back.  So then I thought, well, you know, a few coming in and I'm right there, and 18 is always an eagle chance.  It just didn't happen at end, as good as I hit it today.
Q.  You seem to like this course.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I adjust well to this course.  I see most of the shots I need to hit out there and I like the way it played this year, 16-under won in the end.  That's a pretty good test of golf I think for a winning score.  It's not 25-under or something like that, but 16-under is a good test.
Q.  Were the par 5s really the key this year?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think they were a little tougher this year just because the greens were firmer.  If you hit a 3-iron or 2-iron or put it real close it would roll out 50 feet or something in the second hole, 2-iron or 3-iron.   It played a little tougher but it was set up great.  Yeah, the par 5s, if you can take advantage of them it helps.

Yeah, last year I played them great and this year I think I played them pretty solid again.  No disasters, anyway.  If you can take advantage of them with a bit of length, that's what you've got to do.
Q.  Inaudible?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, it was a really slow start.  Making the turn it was just another day out there.  Things sparked up a bit, and when that happens, you've got to go with it because you never know what can happen out here.  I just wanted to keep giving myself chances.
Q.  What's your schedule?
ADAM SCOTT:  Actually I have three weeks off and I'll play again at the American Express.
Q.  Inaudible?
ADAM SCOTT:  I think especially here, well they know me here now from last year.  Becoming a bit of a second home to me if I want.  It's nice to have all of the people's support.
