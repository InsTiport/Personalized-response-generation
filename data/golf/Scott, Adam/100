Q. Adam, after a 68 yesterday, 77 today.  What happened out there?
ADAM SCOTT: Just played really poorly.  Got off to a bad start with a 3-putt on a 4-putt and then struggled to put it together to get anything going.
So, it was pretty disappointing after a fairly solid day yesterday.  But, one of those days.  Hopefully I can just throw it away and move on to the next week, which is exciting.
Q. How frustrating is it, when we spoke earlier in the week, you talked about a great chance to play, fine-tune some things, and now you're going to be done after Friday?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah.  You know, obviously going to look at the positives and I'll be fresh for next week.  The weekend weather looks a bit dodgy.  Things may work out as good as they can considering it's a missed cut.  I think I saw enough out there, I got some time on the range today and tomorrow, to really come up with my plan for what I'm going to do next week.  But you know, pretty off day and poor focus on the golf course.  So, hopefully that's out of the way.
Q. With the shorter week than you expected, how will your plans change, when you'll head to Augusta, what you'll do between now and then?
ADAM SCOTT: I'll probably go in tomorrow night and get out on the golf course on Sunday.  An extra day there is not going to hurt.  In fact, it will be most enjoyable.  Obviously it's going to be a great week.  Hopefully I play a little better than I did today.
