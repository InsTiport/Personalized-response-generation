Q. Just talk a little bit about how tough it was out there.
ADAM SCOTT:   It was a tough day.  The greens were really firm.  It was hot -- it got hot early in the morning today, so they firmed up even for the earliest of tee times, I think, and the rough is long.  If you're out of position, you're out of control.  Really key to hit fairways to give yourself a chance of kind of creating an opportunity for birdie.  They're hard to come by out there.
Q. Did it feel a little bit like a U.S. Open out there?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it was getting close.  If they could narrow the fairways another five yards, we'd be there, but I'm glad we're not because I wasn't hitting enough fairways.  I played fairly well except the last five holes.
