ADAM SCOTT: I actually played well today.  It was tough conditions early, but I finally made some birdies on the first few holes.  Made a couple of errors, but easily done, I guess, when you're not spot on.
But I'm very encouraged by the way I hit the ball today.  I finally felt I had things under control.  I rolled a couple putts the last couple days a little better as well.  So I go to the PGA encouraged with how I played.  Feeling close every day.  Three fair rounds this week and one ordinary one kind of made for an average tournament.
Q. How will it be getting back to America and playing there (inaudible)?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, well, that just suits me.  The faster the better as far as I'm concerned.  That suits my stroke better, and I look forward to that.  Hopefully we get some firm, dry conditions at Baltusrol.
