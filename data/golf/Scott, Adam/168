Q.   Adam, it was a nice bounceback today.   4‑under par.   It's a little, what's the word, squishy out there finally?   With all the rain it's finally kind of getting soft out there.
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it is.   And it held up well, though, to be fair.   The greens are still rolling good.   They're not too messed up. 
But yeah, it's wet out there, but this course has, you know, challenged us even in these conditions where you think it plays easier and it's softer, and it does, but the scores aren't phenomenal out there, so it's a great track.

Q.   You drive it in the fairway, huge advantages.   I've never seen the rough this long in 15 years, 20 years.
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, well, it was a little softened today because of the soft greens, but you gotta play from the fairway, and that is my primary objective teeing off every hole here.   I'm needing three drivers around.   It's a lot of three irons, four irons, 2‑irons just to get it in play.

Q.   Try to get a quick one out in the morning and you guys are playing early tomorrow.   Going to go out there and try to be aggressive, try to get back in it.   We may not play more than 54 with the forecast?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah.   Go in and shoot the lights out.   I played really good today.   I just couldn't buy a putt coming in, and if I can hit a lot of greens and get a lot of looks, maybe they'll go in.

Q.   Good luck.   Maybe they'll get 36 in.
