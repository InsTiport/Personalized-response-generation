 Q. Was that just the rust? You were a bit worried about it the other day. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Oh, it was just a bad start I think. Kind of got me behind the 8-ball from the get-go and I battled through the first five holes and started playing a little better.

 Q. Did it feel strange standing on the first tee when you haven't played for awhile?
 ADAM SCOTT: No, I'm feeling all right. I've played a lot. But you know, it wasn't bad at all. My short game was there, which I was most concerned about. 
 Yeah, I feel good. 

 Q. After starting with double or triple --
 ADAM SCOTT: I don't need to think about that just yet but a good round tomorrow, I'll be fine. 

 Q. How is the course playing after all the rain?
 ADAM SCOTT: Not bad. Actually there's no casual water drops today in my group. So I think it's held up pretty well. 

 Q. How's your finger?
 ADAM SCOTT: My finger's fine, but my hand's not good. I broke my hand not my finger. The hand is struggling a little bit, not quite a hundred per cent, but it's fine for golf. 

 Q. Stronger after four rounds, I suppose? 
 ADAM SCOTT: I don't know if I'm doing damage to it or not but it will be all right. 

 Q. What can't you do with your hand? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Nothing, but it's just broken still. I haven't been back for an X-ray for a while. 

 Q. Has the doctor said you might do anymore damage?
 ADAM SCOTT: It's doubtful. Unless golf turns into a contact sport, I'll be all right. 

 Q. Can you shake hands? 
 ADAM SCOTT: I can now, yeah. 

 Q. Do you avoid it?
 ADAM SCOTT: No, it's okay. 

 Q. Do you feel any pain when you're hitting the ball?
 ADAM SCOTT: No, never have.
