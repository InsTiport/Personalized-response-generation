GORDON SIMPSON:  Adam, not a bad way to start the defence of your title with three straight birdies, and maybe could have been a little better at the end.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it was a great opening round, and I certainly had a lot of opportunities and I made some putts.  I had a couple dropped shots where I just got myself out of position a bit, but generally the round was pretty solid.

A little bit disappointing with that late bogey on 14.  To birdie 16, 17 set me up with a chance for a good finish, but unfortunately didn't quite get the putt to go on 18.

You know, the greens are tough.  You have to be careful with your putts.  You can't be too aggressive because they are quite fast.  Overall I'm very happy.
GORDON SIMPSON:  You are behind the Johnnie Walker bar as a bartender tonight. Presumably you won't be imbibing too much?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, I don't think so.  I'll be strictly serving drink tonight at the bar.
Q.  You've done well as the front-runner before?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, it's a good start.  Obviously it's a long way to go.  It's different sitting here Thursday night than Saturday night.  I'm not getting ahead of myself.  It's a course where you can shoot a low score like I did today, but you can also shoot a high one pretty easily.  The penalty off the fairway is quite severe, and the way the greens are getting firm and fast, you're going to need to be in the fairway.  So that's the goal for the rest of the week, and just keep hitting fairways and give myself a chance to put a good score on the board.
Q.  (After your time off, how did you feel during the round?)
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I feel good over the ball.  I practiced on it pretty hard.  It's not perfect just yet.  There were a couple loose shots out there today, but certainly plenty of good shots how I wanted it.

And certainly playing that little draw was a little easier than it was last year, which was the idea of changing my backswing a little bit.
Q.  What did you hit on the eagle on six?
ADAM SCOTT:  The eagle was driver, 2-iron.  I putted from almost the front fringe there from about probably 30 feet.
Q.  Good start to give yourself a chance of winning on home soil?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it's a good start.  The best way to win is to get in contention.  So far I'm on pace, but I have to hang in there two more days so I'm around on Sunday.

Like I said yesterday, I'd like to be out in front.  That's where I'd feel most comfortable.  I also need to be able to be comfortable playing from a few shots behind and play my way into the tournament if I need to.  Just looking for a couple solid rounds to be here on Sunday.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Thank you very much.
