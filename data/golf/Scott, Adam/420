   ADAM SCOTT:  I was just trying to keep it rolling out there because I knew someone else could be, so I didn't look at a board until 15 and Stenson was still with me.  So 16 was enough proof that, you know, 17 gave me the cushion I needed. 

 Q.  Did you have a 59 in your mind at one stage? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Maybe I was thinking about that at 16. 
 It's a great start.  It's ideal.  It's amazing how quick everything came together.  To be honest I was pretty scratchy last week, but there were good signs, like I said, back in Abu Dhabi.  I hit a lot of good shots but there was a lot of scruffy ones there, too. 
 You know, kind of put it together on the weekend and to be honest, yesterday, I didn't hit that many good shots, but miss-hit everything straight and made a few putts and obviously today I hit a lot of good shots and a lot of good putts. 

 Q.  18 greens in regulation, 11 birdie putts, it's almost as perfect a round as you can get. 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, almost.  It was solid, I've got to say. 
 You know, I was just trying to win the tournament, really. 

 Q.  You're the first person to win for the second time which is nice, too. 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Two out of two, good.  I'm not going to quick while I'm ahead, though.  I'm sure I'll be back. 

 Q.  Sort of what you're building up for -- 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, starting the day three back, that's okay.  That's where I want to be.  I want to be around and have a chance on Sunday.  You know, occasionally you have days like this where everything goes right for you, and take advantage of, you know, the first three days.  You've got to work through it and stick with them and not shoot yourself out of the tournament. 

 Q.  How is the putting? 
 ADAM SCOTT:  Probably good for me.  I've been working hard on it these two weeks to be fair.  Done a bit of work on it every day, which you know, is a little bit of discipline for me.  It's easy to finish up even when you're playing okay and call it a day.  But 30 minutes every day on the greens have been good for me. 
 It's a start for where I want to be.  I've got to keep building on this hopefully.  There's not far to go up from 61 but I'd certainly like to give myself chances to win again before I get to Augusta, looking at the big picture.
