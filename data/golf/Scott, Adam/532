 Q.  What do you think about the course, the whole tournament, you are doing the practice thing and the pro clinic?
ADAM SCOTT: I really enjoyed the whole week and doing the clinics is great.  It's something I couldn't turn down with Jack Nicklaus, I'm just really enjoying it.  It's the kind of place you can enjoy it. Such a great club and the course is so magnificent.

Q.  When you see the leader board, this is getting pretty exciting, it's almost like a major field with the names you see up there.
ADAM SCOTT: Yes, I think this tournament just brings in all of the good names because it's such a quality event. 

Q.  Best of luck.
