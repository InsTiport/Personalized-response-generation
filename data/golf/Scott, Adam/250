  ADAM SCOTT:   I hit it decent tee‑to‑green today.   And then made a few long putts early to get my round going, which I needed to do.   I was happy with the way I played.   Too bad to three‑putt the last, but it's good to be around the next two days. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I guess so.   I don't know what defense the golf course is going to put up.   It's pretty moist out there.   It always seems to tighten up pretty good on the weekend.
