  Q. Adam, what a great finish for you there. Eight-under for the event and that's a pretty good place to be isn't it this Sunday?   
 ADAM SCOTT: I think so. Looks like it's going to be well within touch. So you know get out there early and shoot a number and really a hard course to chase down something if you post it early.  
  
  Q. Looked like you were a little frustrated yesterday, as were many players, about some of the conditions. But what a great bounce-back this was for you. And how did you get yourself sort of past that, just turn the page and come out and play today?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I really feel like my game's right there. I'm playing really well every day and I'm seeing improvement with my putting. So I'm happy with that. So I can't just let one obscure thing get me down when I feel like I'm so close to getting back to good form. So I came out today and played well again.   
 And something to work on for tomorrow as well.  
  
  Q. Probably will be some tough hole locations tomorrow. The guys are playing very well. What do you expect for tomorrow, one of those things where you have to be cautiously aggressive?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I think so. The greens are firming up. They've firmed up a lot today. So it's going to be tough to get it close. It's going to require good shots to get in there with real birdie chances so you'll have to be careful. It's going to be tricky tomorrow. It's going to be exciting day of golf, hopefully.
