ADAM SCOTT:  Two different days but my game stayed the same. I played great yesterday and hit a pretty good score despite the conditions and this morning I kept swinging in the same rhythm.

I got off to a good start with birdie, birdie this morning (2 and 3) and finished with a flurry birdie, eagle birdie, chipping in at the last. Things were just going my way.

I was up bloody early, 4.30. I'm going back to bed now. We're coming back tomorrow morning (for the second round). But it's pretty much standard practice now for us. Seven of my last eight events have been full day weather delays. So I'm getting used to it. It's such a shame yesterday. The weather was fine, it was just too windy. The greens got quick but everything was perfect. Just too much wind. Too bad. Spoilt a lot of good tournaments so far this year.

Sergio (Garcia) and I played really well. I just hit a couple of shots close and that was the difference. It was fun to play with him as he was playing well. We'll just have to keep it going.

I've done a lot of work with Butch Harmon (swing coach) this year, thinking a lot about my golf game to try and improve and be more consistent. Fiddled on the range on Wednesday when we had some strong winds and I shifted my weight a bit more to the middle on my feet and it frees me up on my swing. I'm hitting it pretty good so far.
