ADAM SCOTT: In the 60s, first round of a major is a good start.  It could have been a couple better, sure, but you can't really look at it like that.  I think it's a good, solid start.  Probably going to be tough tomorrow morning, so I'm going to have my work cut out for me.  And if I can shoot a good score in the morning, hopefully I'm in good shape going into the weekend.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I stroked it well today.  I made them early and didn't make them late.  Probably not going to make them all week, but if you keep hitting good putts they'll go in.  So I was quite happy with it.  I had a couple of lazy swings out there that were fairly straightforward that I hit into trouble and cost me a shot there on 13, and a couple sloppy ones coming in that I got away with.  So I'd like to tidy that up certainly for the rest of the week.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I think when you're not contending or winning, you're not putting all the pieces together.  So it's one thing or the other.  But the last month or so I've struck the ball really well.  I was just a little bit disappointed to hit a few sloppy ones today.  But overall it's feeling pretty good.  I'd like to come out tomorrow and refocus, find that good feeling again because I've played great in practise and everything.   
But 69 in the first round of a major, you should be fairly pleased and should be looking to go on from there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: I think absolutely, yeah.  I mean it certainly can go the other way easily at majors.  So if someone offered that up, I would have taken that.  I'm playing well, so I know there are good scores out there, but I've got to put it all together.  I've got a make a couple more of those six- or seven-footers for par and one or two better swings and now you're talking 65.  So it's not far away.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, you want to be not too far behind, so we'll see.  There's so much golf to play, four shots is nothing over 54.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: It's too early to worry about that.  Tomorrow's weather conditions will be really interesting, because I think it's going to be windy, and that will spread the field, I think.  If the leader plays well, they'll create some space.  So if it is windy, I've got to hang in there and somehow post a good number, so I'm not too far off the pace.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, 1-under for the Aussies today.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Not really.  I mean, when you're hitting good putts it doesn't matter if they'll go in, it's 72 holes.  If it was 18 I'd be frustrated because I'd have lost.  I felt pretty good with it.   
The pace of the greens is hard for guys to adapt to for whatever reason.  They're just so much slower than we're used to.  Still telling yourself to hit it isn't enough.  And I watched a bit of the telecast this morning and I watched guys in my group today, and if you weren't short then you're bashing it way by.  It just seems like it's a little out of everyone's comfort zone sometimes.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: It is, yeah, it's just a little different.  There's not a lot going on on the greens.  But if you get that speed right, you can make a lot of putts because they're at that pace where the ball will get accepted by the hole in a nice place.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: I played lots of golf in the wind.  You've got to go out and stay calm and very patient.  It's hard to fight the wind here.  Just have to do your best.  You can only hit good shots.
