GORDON SIMPSON:  We welcome Adam Scott.  Adam, of course, won the other TPC in America this year, and now here at the Deutsche Bank Open TPC.  Tell us what's happened since your win at Sawgrass.
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, to be honest with you, not a lot because I've taken five weeks off.  So I'm probably a little rusty and looking forward to getting back into the swing of things on Tour again, especially being back in Europe.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Was it difficult, the tournaments after the win at Sawgrass, to just get up for it again?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I think I rushed myself early in the week after winning at Sawgrass at the BellSouth Classic and kind of blew up there on Friday afternoon out on the golf course and never really recovered for Augusta.  You know, it's all a learning process, and hopefully in the future I'll know I need the time to wind down after a big win.
Q.  Coming back here to St Leon  Rot, what's your thoughts?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I just hear good things about the golf course this year.  I hear they have tightened it up and the rough is long.  The weather has been good, so it's in great shape.  Greens are really pretty fast so I think we have a good course set up for us this week.
Q.  Can you just explain what happened to you on the Friday at the BellSouth?  I was there but I don't remember you blowing up.
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I got off to a decent start, and for five holes there in the middle, I just couldn't hit a shot.  I shot 7 over for those five holes, and that was pretty much the end of the week for me there.  So I think I rushed myself, I took Monday off after THE PLAYERS and went in on Tuesday, I kind of rushed up to Augusta to Atlanta from Orlando.  It was all a big tactic.  I never gave myself time to wind down properly after a big Sunday.

So, you know, Friday, just the wheels fell off.  And then I never really put them back on for the next week, either.
Q.  What do you do to get the wheels back on, what have you been doing for the past five weeks, where did you go?
ADAM SCOTT:   I went home to Australia for a month.  I played a little bit of golf with my friends and pretty much spent the rest of the time on the beach, so there was not a lot happening down there.

But I went to Vegas last week to see Butch, who I'm still working with, and I'll hopefully be in good shape for this week now.
Q.  Do we know the story on Alistair McCain, what happened to him?
ADAM SCOTT:   With me and Alistair?
Q.  I don't think we ever picked up on that one.
ADAM SCOTT:   No, it's just, that's the way this game is.  It wasn't directly related to Augusta by any means.  That had nothing to do with it.  I think Alistair and I had a really great run together and I think he did a lot of good things for my game.  But, you know, the time was coming where I think we needed to take a break and go in different directions.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Who is caddying for you now?
ADAM SCOTT:   Tony Navarro is caddying for me  this week.
Q.  Who told you about needing to take a break after a win, did Butch speak to you about it or Tiger maybe?
ADAM SCOTT:   You know to be honest with you, I don't think I needed to take the whole week off.  I think playing again would have been all right, but I at least needed to give myself Monday and Tuesday to do nothing and just wind down.  You know, I think looking back, everyone around me probably would have liked me to take that BellSouth week off, but I was committed to play the whole time and I was expecting myself to play, it was on the schedule.

So I think a mistake was made of not giving myself at least those two days off where I could wind down, and then Wednesday, we can start again for a new week.  Because I think no matter what your nervous system and whatever you've been working overtime coming down the stretch there on a Sunday of a tournament.  You need to recharge and get it back together for the next week.  I was rushing around a little too much, I think, after TPC.
Q.  What exactly happened during those five holes, is it just a case that you play a loose shot and you suddenly go, oops, where did that come from, and it builds up?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I blocked four drivers in a row and they all stayed in bounds, I don't know how, but all I could do was hit it right.  You know, too much damage was done there and I was hanging on for dear life, but couldn't finish it off and make the cut.

So I may have been a different story then if I made the cut, but I missed the cut, that one, I think and after a good first day.  It was disappointing, but it's all part of learning, as well.  Hopefully I get the chance to have another big win and I can do it right after I win.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Are you back here for a while now or what's your planned schedule?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I'm playing back here the next two weeks, Volvo of course, and then back over to the States for the Buick and the U.S. Open, and then come back obviously through the Open.  So a little bit of jumping around.
Q.  There's a young player from Germany getting popular and successful, Marcel Siem; have you heard of him and played with him so far?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I know Marcel but I've never played with him.  He won the Dunhill at the start of the year.  He's a good player, he's an aggressive style of player, and I like that.  I think he's going to be a really good player for a long time.  It looks like that breakthrough win has kicked him on and he's keeping it going.  So he looks pretty good.
Q.  What are your expectations for this tournament?
ADAM SCOTT:   This tournament, I'd just like to get four solid rounds away again.  I've had a long break, but my game feels good.  I feel like I'm swinging the club nicely and good rhythm.  You know, it will just be important to get the first round going, and I think I will slip straight back into the swing of things.  But I'd like to have a chance to win, of course.  That's what I'm here for.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Adam, have a good week and look forward to seeing you back here.
