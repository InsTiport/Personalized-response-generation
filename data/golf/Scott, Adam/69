 Q.  What seemed to be the flip in the switch from yesterday?  
ADAM SCOTT: I don't know.  I played all right yesterday.  I hit 14 greens yesterday and 14 today.  I hit it close today a lot, so.   
 Q.  Was it a little bit easier coming out after the rain?  The winds died down, the course a little softer?  
ADAM SCOTT: After the rain this morning you mean?   
 Q.  No, after the hour.  
ADAM SCOTT: Well there was no rain in that time.  But the course played pretty easy this afternoon I think probably compared to yesterday afternoon, so we might have had the better side of the draw.   
 Q.  How much do you not want to be playing Monday and just get it done this week?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, a lot.  I have no desire to play on Monday at all.   
 Q.  I was doing a little research and you were entered in 2001 sectionals but you withdrew.  Did you withdraw before even playing or did you kind of play --  
ADAM SCOTT: No, I didn't play that year.   
 Q.  How are you feeling energy-wise after this stretch?  
ADAM SCOTT: I don't know, I haven't stopped yet.  It's not going to be good when I do stop, that's for sure.  Yeah, look, I was flat yesterday, not a lot of focus on the golf course.  It's hard not to beat yourself up about it here and there, but what can you expect, I've played a lot of rounds of golf.  It's been hot as heck the last two weeks too, so I have to give myself a little bit of slack here and there in this stretch that I'm on at the moment.
