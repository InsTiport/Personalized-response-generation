  Q. First off, for you, with a 68, that's a pretty good way to come back and start your defense.  
 ADAM SCOTT: I played well. Kind of slow going for most of the day but finished strong which is important, you know, I really want to make this thing count in my standings. So, off to a good start. That's also something that I would like to do a lot more often, too, is get off to a good start.  
  
  Q. What was it like behind what happened with Kevin Na?  
 ADAM SCOTT: That was interesting. He was miked up. That must have been good entertainment today for the viewers. Yeah, you can really only turn away and giggle to yourself.  
  
  Q. For you guys, it would take you out of a rhythm at all? How did it affect your game?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Fortunately, the three of us stood up there and hit three down the middle after we saw him hit the fourth straight right and left and so it didn't affect us fortunately but, you know, it's never easy and it happens to us all at some point.  
  
  Q. How is the game?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Good. Kind of a bit of a slow start, just kind of finding my rhythm but certainly became good at the end and, you know, finished strong. So put myself you know on pace with everyone out there.  
  
  Q. How about the course in general, how does it play, what are your thoughts about it?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It's playing a little different this year. It's fully overseeded that was different than last year, I think. But, you know, the condition of the course is perfect, immaculate and beautiful playing off the fairways. So, we'll try to hit them.  
  
  Q. Is this beneficial to the longer hitters like yourself?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I don't think so. I think it's playing very fair. The ball is rolling and it's all right there in front of you. It's a very fair set-up.  
  
  Q. You certainly put yourself in position to contend all week. Your thoughts about your round and being near the top of the leaderboard.  
 ADAM SCOTT: It's a long way to go. I mean we're just one day in. But certainly keeping pace with the leaders at the moment, that's got to be the plan for the next few days so come Sunday I've got a shot.  
  
  Q. Did you happen to look up on the leaderboard and have any empathy for Kevin Na today? Tough No. 9 on him today.  
 ADAM SCOTT: I watched it. He was right in front of me. I've been there. I haven't -- I think I made a 10 back at Bay Hill one year or at Doral, it was, and I know what feels like. You hit a few bad shots. That's what happens. You know, one of the things, that's golf, it's a weird game.  
  
  Q. You've not laughed.  
 ADAM SCOTT: I hear he played quite well other than that hole. It's amazing how one hole can destroy your week.  
  
  Q. That's golf. What it's like coming out from the Masters and playing here? Bit of an adjustment? Just glad to get the first day out of the way?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's good to be getting on the course. I certainly feel like I want to use any momentum that I have coming out of the Masters to my advantage and that's why it's important to have a good back-9 today and finish strong and make it count as much as any other week.  
  
  Q. Remember last week or are you trying to put that out of your mind?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It's another week. I'm not thinking about that anymore.  
  
  Q. You use that to kind of motivate you, all the good things you had?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Obviously at anytime, so, you know, I certainly take all the good stuff from any tournament, move on to the next one and hopefully use to it my advantage here.  
  
  Q. Why is it no one has ever used a long putter, ever won a Major Championship? Have you heard that stat?  
 ADAM SCOTT: That's commonly known.  
  
  Q. Is that just fluke or why do you think that is?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, I mean not that many players, you know, percentagewise on Tour use a long putter. It's one of things I'm not surprised. The odds are against it happening, probably.
