  Q. Thoughts about the week?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's always an incredible experience playing in these team events. To spend a week with these guys is so much fun, including Frank and Greg. We had a great week.   
 But it was close, and today, never had any momentum this week. The team, we were fighting it all week. We hung in there a long time, but today the U.S. played great. So disappointing not to win one of these.   
 But for me, you know, it was a tough week. I played okay, but just not good enough. I played really well today against Stewart Cink, but he played fantastic. So that's the way it goes. But a great week, yeah.
