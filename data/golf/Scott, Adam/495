Q.  How did it go out there, an overview of your round?
ADAM SCOTT:  You know, I played a lot of good golf, and I played some poor shots.  I tried to get a good break on 15, but, you know, I'm very happy with the round.
Q.  Was this course set up good to score, do you think, today?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah.  You know, I don't think it was playing its toughest today.  The greens are nice speed for making putts.  You'll probably see a bunch of guys 5 or 6 under.
Q.  Good start for you, though?
ADAM SCOTT:  Oh, it's perfect.  You don't want to fall too far behind.  You don't want to have to make too many birdies the last round, so if I can hang in there I'll have a chance on Sunday.
Q.  Misjudged the wind on 18?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was a bad shot, a silly shot.  I had a hook lie and I tried to hit a cut.
Q.  What did you hit?
ADAM SCOTT:  A 6 iron.
Q.  Can you tell us about the chip in on 15?  That looked like it was a bit of a tricky shot.
ADAM SCOTT:  I guess Jose's magic rubbed off on me.  He played some chips today that were awesome.  I was nearly 90 degrees from the hole and they came down the hill and just curled in.  That was nice to get away with it.  It turned it around and I finished strong.
Q.  You can make a big number out here in a hurry if you don't pay attention.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, you can.  There are some trees that you don't really think about come into play all of a sudden if you hit a bad shot, and you can't get anywhere near the green, much less the flag.  You know, I got a good break on 15, it hit the tree and kicked into the fairway.
Q.  Was the wind a problem?  Was it swirling?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, I didn't have a problem with the wind swirling.
Q.  Jack's goal was to really make you guys think about every shot and think your way around these golf courses.  Is that the way you found it?
ADAM SCOTT:  Absolutely.  You've got to think about the positions that you can't put yourself in.  You've got to play away from them, yet still be somewhat aggressive to make some birdies.
Q.  Talk about playing with Kenny and Jose today.
ADAM SCOTT:  I really enjoyed playing with both those guys.  I love watching Kenny strike a golf ball.  I think he's probably the best driver of the golf ball in the game, and I love watching Jose play.  He puts his heart and soul into it every day.
Q.  He's got a pretty good short game, too, doesn't he?
ADAM SCOTT:  Exactly.  He's impressive.  I love watching both those guys.
Q.  Did you play last week?
ADAM SCOTT:  No.
Q.  You weren't in Memphis?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, I had three off.
