  Q. Would you be quite happy if Saturday and Sunday the weather does turn a bit?   
 ADAM SCOTT: I don't want to spend the next two days in the rain, but yeah, I wouldn't mind if it played tough. I think that would be good for me. I'm striking the ball well over two days in tough conditions, and I think my ball-striking can hold up.   
 But look, you know, around this kind of course, like I said, it's going to be tough to get the ball close. You're not going to have that many opportunities. You're going to have to make some par putts, so you'd better putt well over the weekend.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 ADAM SCOTT: Not really because I was at a point where I was so fed up with my putting, I'd been searching for the whole of 2010 to find a nice stroke, and there were moments of it. I putted good a few weeks last year but not consistently well enough. You could have given me a hockey stick and I would have used that if they were going in. Once I saw this going in, I was very happy to switch.
