Q.  Do you change your approach and get more aggressive or is
it dangerous to do that?
ADAM SCOTT:  We'll see how the greens are.  You have to
be careful if you're getting aggressive.  I think you've just got
to be patient and wait for the right numbers to show up on your
shots into the greens.  It's just so hard to force it or be cute.
You pay a big price if you make a mistake.
Today I didn't get many great numbers, and I just decided
to hit clubs that I knew would get to the front and that left me
60 and 70 feet all day.  And that's hard work two-putting them all
the time.  But to be cute and try and trundle one up there, if it
doesn't come off, it can end up in a bad spot.  So I just took my
medicine and ground it out there.
Q.  I know you were wondering what it would be like to come
in as a Major champion, any different than what you expected or
not?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes and no.  I think, yeah, absolutely.
There's a bit of weight off the shoulders having won a Major.  But
I still have haven't won The Open, so the nerves and the anxiety
is still there to win this event.  But overall it's a great
feeling, that's for sure.
Q.  Is your mom here?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, mum is here.
Q.  How was it showing her the green jacket?
ADAM SCOTT:  She loved it.
Q.  Did she try it on?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, no, she hasn't tried it on.  No one gets
to try it on (laughter).
Q.  Is that right?
ADAM SCOTT:  Club rules (indicating quotation marks).  I
don't think they'd appreciate that at Augusta.  But mum loves
seeing the jacket, yeah, for sure.
Q.  I haven't seen you since Riviera, I'm just curious, what
has this year been in experience, anything you could ever have
expected, once you did it, is it what you expected or no?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think so.  I think the thing that
takes you back is just how big an impact the Masters golf
tournament or Major golf tournaments have on everything, really.
But certainly on other people.  And the depths that the Masters
reaches, it's almost beyond just golf.
So it's been a whirlwind, for sure, as the last few
months have gone by.
Q.  How about the inner feeling, though?  Has it been the
satisfaction that you always sought after?  Did it go to those
depths?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think so.  I think there was some
instant satisfaction when it was all happening.  And I'm quite
pleased with myself ever since (laughter).
It's been all very, very good.  But I've got to come out
and play golf and I can't rest on my laurels and it's not the only
thing I wanted to win in my career.  So I've got plenty more work
to do.
Q.  So it's time to do it again, right?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, absolutely, no time like right now.
My form is good, so I should take advantage of that.
