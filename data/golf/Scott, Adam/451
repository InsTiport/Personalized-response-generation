   ADAM SCOTT:  I'll have it for tonight, anyway.  It was a good day.  I could have had a couple better, maybe, but I'll take that.  Keeps me in with a chance for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Tough finishing in the dark?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Little tough.  I mean, you have to trust yourself when you can't really see.  I'm glad I got in, otherwise I would have an early start with a long wait in between.   
 I got in with a 4 on the last, so I'm happy with that.   
  
  Q.  You lost momentum.   
 ADAM SCOTT:  It was a bit wobbly on the back nine today.  It was getting late.  I could see the concentration fading out there.  It was good to get in with some pars and a couple birdies on the back today.   
  
  Q.  That save on 18, was that okay?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  It would have been pretty rough if I bogeyed the last, finishing in the dark, but I'm happy with a 4.   
  
  Q.  How do you spend your time?  What do you do?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Normally I would be at the hotel.  I spent it all in the locker room, and I was in the workout trailer, trying to stretch and worked out and slept for awhile on the couch and eventually we got out.
