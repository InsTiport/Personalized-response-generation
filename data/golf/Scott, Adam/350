 Q. Obviously not the ideal day, lot of wind activity and so forth going on just. Just your thoughts on the day.
 ADAM SCOTT: I just didn't have much of anything today. Whatever it is, I missed everything left and I figured it out on the back-9, I was aiming left and, you know, so, you know, I got in a few bad spots, four, five bad shots and made four, five bogies. 
 Didn't make any putts for momentum. Just a tough day because I wasn't getting myself in good shots.

 Q. You start off feeling that way or you just kind of --
ADAM SCOTT: I felt good, the swing felt good but everything was coming out left of where I was seeing it come out and, you know, I couldn't figure out why until the back-9 I figured out I was aiming left and, you know, corrected it and it was a little better but I just couldn't get anything happening. Every putt I hit looked good missed. One of those days.
