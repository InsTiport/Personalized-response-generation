 Q.  Disappointing. Looks like things are starting to catch up a little bit here.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, we definitely got turned over this afternoon, but there's a couple matches still out there. If we can somehow turn it around like they turned it around late on us, you know, it would be nice to keep a lead going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  Talk us through that match. You were close there for awhile and these guys got back at you?  
ADAM SCOTT: Had a couple lipouts on 11 and 12 and put us 2-down. They were good putts and lipped-out. We just couldn't quite get back in it unfortunately. The putts didn't drop this afternoon for us.   
 Q.  As a team leader here, how do you regroup and reset for tomorrow?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, look, we've given ourselves, no matter what happens this afternoon, a great shot to win the session tomorrow and win this Cup. I think we've got to be pretty happy about that, come out tomorrow, leave it all on the golf course.
