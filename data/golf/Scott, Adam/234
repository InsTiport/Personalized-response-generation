Q.   Bogey‑free 3‑under par 67, three for three out of the bunkers.   How did things go out there?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I played really a lot of good golf today, especially the first 14 holes or so, and then had to make a couple saves coming in, but that can happen around here.   It's hard to hit these small greens, especially if you're in the rough.   I was pretty happy with the way I played, and to finish birdie‑birdie made me feel a little better.

Q.   Is it an easy transition from Kapalua to here or do you struggle at times?
ADAM SCOTT:   No, it's much easier adjusting that way than going from here to Kapalua.   That's the wake‑up call for walking around a golf course, and coming here is a real pleasure.   The greens are rolling beautiful, so we're in for a good week this week.   Got to get it going now.

Q.   You gave Steve Williams the week off.   You've got a buddy of yours on the bag.   How did he do out there?
ADAM SCOTT:   He did great, for his first time in a PGA TOUR event with a pretty good big, he did amazing today.   We had a lot of fun.   Hopefully he did.   I did, that's for sure.   It was good to have him out there.
