Q.  Everyone was waiting for him to make a mistake, he maybe a bogey early on, but he made right up for it with the birdies, and you expect something to happen in the final round?
ADAM SCOTT:  I played with him yesterday and this morning when he seemed to be very under control with his game.  And obviously he was putting very nicely.  And he made some important putts that's going to keep you in the game, and that's what he's done well, by the looks of it.  He was playing great yesterday, just the way he wanted to play for the final round, tee to green.
Q.  Can you assess your week thus far and how you go into the next couple?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was a good week.  I played pretty good.  It was weird morning for me, I didn't hit a good shot this morning.  I just didn't really get good numbers.  I was left with down hole putts that I couldn't really get caressive with.  And that's what's tough about this golf course.  You have to hit a really good shot to get them up there past the hole.  I didn't leave myself many of them coming in.  It was a little tricky because you can't get too caressive.
Q.  You looked like you were swinging pretty well.
ADAM SCOTT:  I managed to get it going in the first couple of hours.  I have been swinging well.  My games feels good.  It's a shame to come up a few short again.  But I have something to work on next week.
Q.  Carl seems extremely calm out there.
ADAM SCOTT:  I think so.  He's extremely calm by nature and obviously playing well.  He'll be a good champion.
Q.  How do you refer to your putting today?
ADAM SCOTT:  I think I putted pretty well.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT:  The rough certainly made it play more difficult and the bunkers made it play more difficult.
