Q.  You played to the finish, Adam, solid round of golf here today.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it's just what I needed to get myself in the mix.  I was a long way back, so overall I'm pretty happy.  Unfortunately I dropped a couple coming in, but I had my moments of brilliance out there, and it felt good to get it going again.
Q.  Was the golf course weakened a little bit by the rain?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, the greens softened up and are really receiving shots well and holding them even with long irons.  I think that's why you're seeing a lot more birdies today.
Q.  What does it feel like when you get in a stretch where you're 7 under after five holes?  It's pretty amazing.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it just happened somehow.  I don't know, I made the putt on 10 and that was important to birdie the par 5 to keep it going, and then all of a sudden hole out a shot from the fairway on 11 and 9 under for the tournament from nowhere really.  40 minutes ago I was in contention.  Funny how it works, but hopefully it happens again tomorrow.
Q.  It's been a while since you've won out here.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah.  It's nice to get back in the hunt and play in contention, and hopefully I can get out early tomorrow and make a couple birdies and get right in it from the getgo.
Q.  Next week this tournament will be the week before THE PLAYERS Championship.  Do you think it will be affected at all?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, I think that's two pretty good weeks.  I like playing golf courses that are good courses and good fields, and I think this one is a perfect example of that, so I don't think I'll be skipping it.
Q.  Your thoughts just on getting out early tomorrow and trying to beat the weather.
ADAM SCOTT:  It's a good idea, I think.  We'd like to beat the weather tomorrow and get it in.  It's not a sleep in, but I think we can all deal with that.
