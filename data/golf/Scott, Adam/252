Q.   How did the course play today compared to the first three days? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I think it was probably more comparable to yesterday than the first two days.   Yesterday it had dried out a bit, and today obviously dried out a bit more and there's been a bit of wind blowing across the course and some greens are really firm and others are still a bit damp.   But you know, the wind direction is so different, and the last two days, it's been pretty similar wind, and I think everyone's a bit more comfortable with that wind today. 

Q.   What's the key to your round today? 
ADAM SCOTT:   No bogeys I think is always a good thing.   Took advantage of a few good shots and the couple poor ones I hit I managed to scramble and save par.   That always adds up to a pretty good score.   But I don't think it's going to be quite enough. 

Q.   The leaders are at 13 I think right now; those last few holes, what do you think will happen, maybe 11 the hold up? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it might be wishful thinking.   I'm sure with the quality of player there is out there, even the guys at 10â€‘under, there are enough opportunities to have a couple birdies coming in if someone wants it bad enough.
