  Q. Adam, well played today. It looks like you may come up one short, but you've got to be proud of your effort.   
 ADAM SCOTT: I played good today. I mean, I don't think I can ask for anything more. I had a putt at it on the last, and it was kind of an outside chance. Not my best putt, but everything else was pretty good today.  
  
  Q. I have to tell you this is the most confidence I've seen out of you on the putting green in maybe forever, at least six or eight years, and if you keep that up, there's a tremendous future for you.   
 ADAM SCOTT: No, I feel like my game is in great shape, and it was great to make a run this weekend. I had a ball out here. Just want to get back in the mix next time.
