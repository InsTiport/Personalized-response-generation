  Q. 2-over 74 for Adam Scott. Not quite the day that maybe you anticipated but tell me how the limit quality of that round and the wind that we had here today?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Overall, it was pretty good. I had a stretch around the sand where I made three bogies in a row, just hit a couple loose shots over the green, shots not like myself which is kind of easy to do when it's windy, it's gusty, too, so it's not easy out there. Overall, it's not a bad round.  
  
  Q. What's your feeling now about the position on the leaderboard with these conditions? You feel like you kept yourself in the tournament with this round?  
 ADAM SCOTT: So far I have. We'll have to see how the day unfolds. I can't imagine anyone really running away with it. The pins spots are very difficult.  
  
  Q. Swirling wind or just the velocity or just overall?  
 ADAM SCOTT: The wind was quite strong but the pin spots were very hard to get near. You know, easy mistakes to be made.  
  
  Q. The wind is blowing opposite from yesterday. How difficult did that make things from the course you played yesterday?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Completely different. It was hardly even blowing. It was perfect yesterday, beautiful day for golf. This course is very difficult around the greens anyway and when that bit of control that you do have is taken away, it's, you know, magnified by the severity of these greens.
