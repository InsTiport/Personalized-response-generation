  ADAM SCOTT: Luckily, I think, it's super bunched, so it's really going to be a shootout tomorrow.  This course is soft and it's taking on a lot of good scores, so surprising the leaders didn't really get it going today, but that's the pressure of The Open, so I'm happy with that.  I'm still in the mix, and I've got to go out and get off to a quick start and kind of put myself on level peggings with them.   Q.  You couldn't get anything going early while others were throwing numbers up.  Any reason for maybe having a whole day off?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I was slightly off my rhythm in the swing today.  It just felt a little bit harder than the last couple days, and that's a little frustrating because it was there to be had.  The good shots finished close, and there just weren't enough of them for me today.  I didn't make all the putts that I could have, but three back, I mean, it's not a lot, really.  So I've got a chance.   Q.  What is that like literally having a day off in the middle of a tournament?  ADAM SCOTT: I thought it was pretty nice, actually, having a little recovery day.  Yeah, maybe they should think about that moving forward.  Given the conditions, it was quite good that we didn't have to play any golf yesterday.   Q.  Just the conditions here at St. Andrews, a lot of guys putting great scores up.  Can you remember in your career having a major tournament course that was this accessible?  ADAM SCOTT: Not really.  But the defense of this golf course certainly is the weather and the wind.  You know, there was no 62s.  The magical number didn't appear today, and if there was ever a day for it, it probably was today.  It's still holding its own.  We see low scores at other majors.  I don't think -- it's just that kind of course.  These courses when the wind is down, you can get away with a few bad shots and scramble because you've got options around the greens if you miss them in the right spot, and it's not too severe like other major venues.  On a calm day you can still shoot high scores.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ADAM SCOTT: The game is in good shape.  It's just one of those days, I was just ever so slightly off.  10 feet further away from the pin every time that I would have liked to be, and that makes your chance of holing it a little less.  I'd like to just wake up tomorrow on the right side of the bed and go out and swing really freely like I did the first two days.  I think I can get it going.   Q.  Any consolation, any similarity to the '13 Masters that Jason is there, Leish is there, that worked out well for you?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it did.  We'll see.  No, I don't think it owes me one yet, but certainly from my position, if I were to come out on top tomorrow, it would be a special round of golf because one of the lot in front is going to get it going.  There's no doubt.  I can see a lot of guys who would be very hungry to win, and I'm just going to have to play a great round.   Q.  Do you follow cricket?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I've grown up with it.  I heard we bowled them over today.  Yeah, it's going to be a good series.  Yeah, big fan.
