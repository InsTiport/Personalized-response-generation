  Q. Did you sense a round like that coming?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I felt I was playing really well coming in here, and I just struggled for my rhythm the first couple days. But today on the range it kind of all fell into place. I was feeling really good hitting those shots and got off to a good start, which is something I seem to struggle with here. To get a couple birdies in early and then keep the momentum going into the back nine was nice and certainly exactly what I needed to do today.   
  
  Q. What's it like for a player in your position heading into Sunday?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think it's not a bad thing because you're not really expected to hold onto a lead or you're not playing out in front of anyone. And around here if it's crowded, anything can happen. You can get on a hot stretch and pick up a lot of shots. So it was still just Saturday. I was certainly playing a little more aggressive than I might if I was coming down the line on Sunday.   
 But you have to hit those shots at good times to pick up shots. You know, we've seen Phil do it last year at crucial moments. You've got to go for it at some point to pick up some shots.   
  
  Q. (Question about winning.)  
 ADAM SCOTT: I can't even think about that to be honest. It's too far away. I'd just love to play a solid front nine and see if I stand in contention then.
