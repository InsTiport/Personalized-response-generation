 Q. Adam, a nice round of golf, 3-under 69.
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah. A solid day today. A little tricky out there. The wind was swirling, and it was tough to tell if it was down or into on some of the cross holes. So, you know, it was a solid, solid round. I'm happy with that start.

 Q. I still have visions in my mind of a putt coming over the ridge on the 72nd hole two years ago. You got to have great memories here of when you won.
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah. Played a lot of good golf at Redstone, which is a nice feeling. I'm looking for three more good days this week to get myself in with a chance.

 Q. Are you happy with your putting this year?
 ADAM SCOTT: No, I'm not. I've really turned my ball striking around, but I've putted poorly. I'm working hard on it, but it's taking a while for me to put that out on the golf course and have it feel really natural, but it's getting there. I missed one little one today.

 Q. You're off to a good start.
 ADAM SCOTT: Thanks.
