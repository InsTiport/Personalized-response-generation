JOHN BUSH: We would like to welcome Adam Scott to the interview room here at the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. Making his 11th start. Adam, a couple third place finishes here. Just talk a little bit about Bay Hill and this tournament and what it means to you.   
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I've come here on and off throughout the years, but it's a course I've really learned to love, I guess, the last 10 years or so for me. I feel like I've played a lot of good golf here. I'm confident around this golf course. Unfortunately, I've never really put four solid days together in one go. So that's my goal this week. It's a special place, obviously, with the Arnold Palmer connection. It's very strong. You can see that with everything going on here, but also through all the players. Here's a guy who meant so much to the game of golf. To win an invitational-style event connected to Arnold Palmer would be really quite satisfying, I guess, for me in my career. I would rank it fairly highly.   
JOHN BUSH: Speaking of good golf, you're in really good form right now. 14th official TOUR win at the Genesis Invitational. Just talk a little bit about the state of your game.   
ADAM SCOTT: My game feels really good, actually. I like where it is after today. I feel like it's still moving in the right direction after Genesis. Mexico was not my best performance. I'm pretty much thinking I'm one of the worst altitude players on the TOUR after that. I really don't get very comfortable at altitude. But I feel good about where the game is moving on from Mexico back to a bit closer to sea level here and feeling very confident. I like the way the course is set up this week. I believe it's going to be windy and hopefully my ball striking can get me a little bit of an advantage in these kind of conditions.   
JOHN BUSH: Open it up with questions.   
 Q.  You share the course record here with Greg Norman. You got guys like Marc Leishman and Jason Day have won. What is it about Australian golfers that seem to thrive on this golf course?  
ADAM SCOTT: I don't know, really. There isn't anything particularly similar or that different than home, really. It's just, I think there's, with the connection to Arnold Palmer there's extra motivation for everyone to do well here. I think that was the case in Greg Norman's day when he was playing here as well. It's neat to have the course record here. I remember the round well. I don't know if that's going to be possible to attack this week. The greens are pretty firm out there and the wind's going to blow, so breaking par would be more kind of my scoring goals this week.   
 Q.  And just to follow it up, what are your first, what are your thoughts on the first two days? What do you need to sort of do to get yourself in position for the week and is it a matter of surviving the first two rounds and maybe posting something under par?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it might be good to be out Thursday morning potentially, given the weather. And if I can take advantage of that and have a solid score, it can set me up for a good week. But no matter what, even if that is the way it goes, there's going to be some survival going on. By the looks, it's going to blow pretty strong and out of a difficult direction for this golf course. A lot of the holes that are flanked by water, the wind is going to be coming off the water, so you're going to have to start it over the trouble, essentially, and the ball striking will have to shine through a little bit.   
 Q.  You talked about the state of your game is very good and you're pleased with it, but what does it do for your game going into the Majors when you win early in the season like you did?  
ADAM SCOTT: In some ways it takes the pressure off, from the sense you don't have to talk yourself into being confident. You can actually be confident because of a result. And then you must manage your own expectation after that. So hopefully, given that I have got a bit of experience, I can do that well from this point on. But I'm really enjoying the way my form is going, so I'm excited to play again this week and get myself back in that kind of position I was at in Genesis. That's really my, the challenge to myself for the next three days out here is put myself in the winning position Sunday again. And I think my game is definitely still there and the confidence is still riding high, so I'll try and take advantage of that while I've got it.   
 Q.  How does this tournament, tournaments like this help you prepare for the Masters?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, it's a very important part of the preparation because it's so close. So it's very hard not to think about the Masters. Of course, we have the PLAYERS championship next week. But this golf course, the way it is this week with the rough is up a little bit and the greens are firm, it's -- and the wind is predicted, it's going to be testing everyone's patience, very demanding golf course, which is what major championships do. They really penalize bad shots and this course will do that often because of the water. There's really no escape from water. So it will be good to kind of get a, get your emotions under control and be able to use that to your advantage maybe at the Masters in a few weeks.   
 Q.  At Riviera you seemed quite positive about the Premier League concept and what it could offer. Obviously since then, Rory's come out and been very outspoken. There's been a lot of other chat about it. Has your sentiment changed in any way or been endorsed or what do you think now, a few weeks on?  
ADAM SCOTT: I'm still very positive about the concept of what it could be, for sure. It doesn't mean I think it's going to happen, necessarily. Everyone sees it from somewhat of their own agenda. Being an international player, I mean, the thought of a world TOUR sounds really great. Maybe less so for someone based in Florida who doesn't have to necessarily travel as much. But it's what I'm used to. So, yeah, I don't think my sentiment on the concept has changed at all. I still think it's fantastic.   
 Q.  Talking about the Masters, how has your preparation changed over the years? When do you start thinking about getting ready for Augusta now, versus maybe 10 years ago?  
ADAM SCOTT: I think it's changed a little bit, to be perfectly honest, because TPC is back in before it and I regard that tournament very highly. So really, I'm trying to get myself in great shape for that. And if I can do that, it's like a small step to getting ready for Augusta. So until last year the focus on Augusta was kind of starting from Riviera. And at the moment I'm trying to put that out of my head and think about TPC as much as anything and get myself ready to have a really good run there. I mean, for me, it's a tournament I would love to win again. I think it would go a long way in kind of getting me satisfied with what I've achieved in my career. If I could win the TPC twice, that would be amazing. Then it's a quick shift now then to Augusta. We have got a little bit of time. But I think between what I see here this week and TPC next week, you should have a good idea of where your game's at and what you need to do to be ready to play the Masters.   
 Q.  Were you still at Augusta last year when Tiger finished? And if so, did you watch it on TV? Did you -- what was your, what was sort of your reaction to the reaction?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, just as I was finishing my round you got a sense, as he was kind of taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening. There's always an electricity in the air at Augusta on a Sunday, but then when Tiger or certain people are in the mix there's something more. After I finished out and I stayed and watched, there was a lot of guys watching in the champion's locker room and I stayed and watched. You don't often get that group of people together very often. All of us definitely cheering hard for Tiger to win. And you just had that sense it's a significant moment in the sport again. But seeing Tiger's reaction was great because it felt like a significant moment for a guy who is achieved everything and more in golf and you could see in his reaction to the win how special it was. So that was -- it was great as a golf fan to watch that.   
 Q.  How do you think Tiger's decision to go without a coach and kind of go it on his own the last few years helped him get back in the winner's circle and win another major?  
ADAM SCOTT: How do I think it helped him?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ADAM SCOTT: I really don't know how to answer. Maybe it just uncomplicated things for him, really. I mean, we all do our best to complicate the game a bit too much and maybe when you're as talented and as accomplished as Tiger, your gut instinct must be pretty good for what you need to do, so maybe he did that. I don't know. That's a guess (Laughing.)   
 Q.  This and Riviera are two of the strongest fields of the year thus far that don't have built-in fields, for example. What is the difference between something like this, something like the Memorial and Riviera, compared with a WGC?  
ADAM SCOTT: A few faces in the draw? I don't know.   
 Q.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I think it's a good thing that these events are strong, these invitational events. They should mean something. And I think that was the idea with the World Golf Championships. But they have certainly changed over the 20 years that they have been around and gone in a, gone in whatever direction they have gone in, not quite necessarily -- I guess they get the best players from all around the world together, but there's been some levels of compromise, I guess, with them on locations and venues and timings and all these kind of things, and even the Match Play has been moved around and gets fields, it doesn't get fields, but that's most tournaments. Even though this is a very, very strong event there are a couple guys not playing. Most do. I think a lot of that is out of the respect for Arnold Palmer, of course. The venue at Riviera and Tiger's involvement also commands a strong field. So I think they sit up in that similar kind of level, given the fact they are pulling strong fields.   
 Q.  But you've missed some WGC's over the years based on your own scheduling preferences. Was there a time early days where it was thought that these are ones you just don't miss?  
ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely, yeah. They have gone along, they have, I guess when they -- there are many factors that are different than 20 years ago when they started. The PGA TOUR had far less international events 20 years ago, they have a lot more now. It was much harder to get the world's top players together. Most of the world's top players play on the PGA TOUR as a PGA TOUR member now. They were significantly more money. Now everything is a lot of money. I don't think they are doing the same as what they did 15 or 20 years ago, that's for sure.   
 Q.  When on his game who is the just toughest guy out here to match shot for shot and keep up with?  
ADAM SCOTT: To pick one guy?   
 Q.  Yeah. One.  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, Tiger then (Laughing) on his game. I mean, his record speaks for itself. I mean, I love Rory's game and I love Dustin's game as well. I think on their day those guys would be very, very difficult to beat when, if they're on their game.   
JOHN BUSH: All right. Adam Scott, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.   
ADAM SCOTT: Thank you.
