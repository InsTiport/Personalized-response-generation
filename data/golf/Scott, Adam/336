  Q. Looks like it's not going to be enough.   
 ADAM SCOTT: You know, maybe or maybe not. 9 was the killer. Just to make bogey there wasn't a big deal, but birdieing 8 would have been nice to get on a bit of run and get in it, but it didn't happen.   
 I didn't hit a fairway on the back nine -- I hit one, actually, or two. I hit the 18th, as well. But I just never gave myself a chance to get the ball near the hole. And I was up-and-down a lot of holes.   
 I mean, I did the best I could. That was a good score today, because I gave myself less opportunities than every other day.  
  
  Q. Considering, as you said it could have been a disaster for you, but you hung in there.   
 ADAM SCOTT: Oh, yeah, hung in there well. Just for me, it's just positive. I mean, my short game is that good now. It's good enough to hang in there on the last nine of a major to keep a score going. Everything is right where I want it to be. Every day I have my opportunities. You know, you need to take them all to win these things.  
  
  Q. On the back of last week's win, real solid tournament; what's your mind-set now?   
 ADAM SCOTT: It's positive. It's a good week. It's easy to come in the week after and just play it around the golf course, but if you do that here, you're probably going to be going home Friday afternoon. I worked really hard because I wanted to build on the good finish of last week.
