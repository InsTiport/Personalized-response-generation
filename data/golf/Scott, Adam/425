   ADAM SCOTT:  It was pretty good considering it was tricky out there. Hit some good shots and made some good putts. Scrambled hard. Had a few long putts which I managed to two putt. I am happy overall. Disappointing to miss that one on the last. The greens were a bit funny this afternoon with all the traffic they have had over them.   
 It was a tough breeze and hard to hit it close. There were some tough pins and in awkward positions and the wind was blowing.   
  
  Q.  Only two back after a round of three under par?   
 ADAM SCOTT:  Hopefully catch a break and it is a little calmer in the morning and I can make a load of birdies and set myself up for the weekend.
