Q. Here with Adam Scott, just posted a nice 67, best round of the week for you as we march on through the playoffs.  What do you take away from the Deutsche Bank Championship?ADAM SCOTT: For me it was a tough week, nothing really went my way.  I hit the ball pretty good.  I didn't make anything on the greens.  It was one of those weeks all the bad bounces just came my way, and I never had any momentum.  I'm moving on and trying to find something special at the BMW.Q. At the BMW Championship, Cherry Hills, not a lot of players have seen this golf course.  How much of a quick study are you as you move to this game?ADAM SCOTT: Sometimes I think it's not a bad thing to go out there and not have too much of an idea of what's going on, where all the bad spots are.  You just go and hit it at the target.  If you're hitting it well, you're going to be able to play anywhere blind.Q. Your mentality as you go through this four week somewhat of a grind through the playoffs, what is it?ADAM SCOTT: Playing better.  If I can play better every week, that would be nice.  But, you know, it's been a bit of a grind the last two weeks.  There's good golf in there, but I've got to get some putts going in.
