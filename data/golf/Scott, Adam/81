ADAM SCOTT: It was just difficult.  I mean, I don't know how else to assess it.  Tough wind for this golf course, too, I think.  I know it's allowed to blow a lot out of here, but just south of the southeast it made angles pretty tough, fairways tough to hit.  It's pretty challenging out there now.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, absolutely.  Get a little lucky and tomorrow morning is nice conditions, I can try to put 18 good holes together and I'll be right back in it, for sure.  After the turn and the wind was picking up, I knew it was a matter of survival and I survived.  I didn't do a great job of it but it was pretty tough out there.  As soon as you hit a shot up in the air, I hit three bad tee shots in a row on 10, 11, 12 and 9, but I got lucky, you're out of position, and I did well to make bogeys on some of them.
It's hard to be critical of the swing and everything because everyone lost a shot on the wind out there today.  But it wasn't feeling great.  I didn't warm up well, the rhythm wasn't there.  So I was fighting it a bit today.  And kind of did well to only lose a few shots out there rather than completely capitulate.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: I think the straight downwind is just -- howling 20-mile-an-hour straight downwind is tough wind to warm up in.  You get no rhythm.  The ball hardly gets airborne.  It is cold.  It's straight downwind.  The ball doesn't want to go up in the air, it's just getting knocked down.  So you don't see very nice shots on the range, it makes going to the first tee pretty challenging.  And it took me a few holes to figure out where my comfortable spot was.  It's not a day you want to be thinking about your swing when you've got a play with so much feel, and you're aiming 30 yards left of where you'd normally look, and just swing, and the wind moves it.  You just want to be free swinging.  And I was fighting myself a bit out there, so it wasn't that easy out there for me.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: It's just routines, I think, are important.  One of his great attributes is he feels what's going on so much, more like a player than a caddie, I think.  So he's feeling the wind gusts, he's feeling whether it's just turning into or across.  When it's this strong it makes a big difference if you play it straight across or hurting.  There's 15 or 20 yards difference in a club.
So they've got to be very in tune with that.  I think on a day like today you really want to heighten your senses and that's the caddie's role, as well.  It's just a day to focus and -- because errors get magnified on a day like today.  As much as the player doesn't want to make an error, the caddie doesn't want to, either, or it looks pretty bad.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: Well, yeah, it's just so gusty and I think he knows my routine so well that if I'm standing over the shot a bit too long, something or a thought has come to my head like I'm trying to find my balance or I'm not feeling I'm aligned right.  So certainly in these conditions it's better to start again.  The same thing happened into 18.  It's just so critical.  I'm right on the cut line, and I've got a great chance to hit a good shot on 17 and make a birdie.  And also into 18, I'm on the cut line again; I can't afford a bad shot.  So you've just got to be so disciplined at that point.  And I think that's kind of what I was trying to get at with the role of the caddie today.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: No, no, yeah, it's gusting so hard, it can knock you slightly off balance.  On 18th green there it's really -- must be coming down in the stands and hitting the stands and coming back.  And it's very hard to stay stable over a putt.  Yeah, it's very difficult.  So when you're out in an exposed fairway and a gust hits you, you're not going to hit a shot until you're settled.  And if you're just taking a second longer, it might just put your rhythm of your whole swing off, so it's best just to back off.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: No, he says, "Just wait a second."  But it's a big goal to call someone off a shot when you're standing over it.  But when it happens, you just start and stop again completely.  So it was a good time to back off those, too, because I hit two good shots in the end and managed to make it for the weekend.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: Well, of course.  I'm assuming that means he won't be here for the weekend but I don't know.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: Plus 5.  You never know.  It's going to be tough.  He obviously was playing really well until that point.  It's 18 holes of golf.  And this happens occasionally.  I did it at Memorial four days in a row, I shot 4-over my last four, almost every round that week, and it's a 18-hole test.  It's really -- it's a tough pill to swallow.  Hopefully he gets another crack at it and has a good week and can brush it off.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: I will.  I will enjoy watching them play out there this afternoon.  I don't normally tune in, but I need -- hopefully watching will make myself feel a little better.
Q. (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT: No, these are the best players in the world.  I think 67 is not completely unrealistic.  But maybe 65 or something would be.  Anything in the 60s is a hell of a round out there today.
