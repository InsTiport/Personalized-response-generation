   JOHN BUSH: We'd like to welcome our current leader in the clubhouse, Adam Scott, after a 3-under par 67. Adam, it's always nice to start with four straight birdies. Just get some comments on your start and also your round as a whole. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was a fast start, which was very handy, this morning. But after that it was a bit of a battle, a fair bit of scrambling going on. The conditions were tricky. It was hard to hit fairways and hard to hit greens, hard to hit it close. Getting off to a quick start certainly set me up for a nice round anyway. 

 Q. Was there something with the weather conditions early that -- was it calmer earlier? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Not really, I just managed to hit a few good shots in a row. That was about it. And there weren't too many after that. It was just a matter of hanging in there. 

 Q. You mentioned yesterday about being at The Masters; the Tuesday and Wednesday of preparation probably wasn't what you liked, I imagine, coming off of strep throat. But do you feel like basically over the last month, month and a half you've been playing really good golf? Do you feel like this is a continuation of what's been a good stretch for you?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I've really played pretty good all year. I've been happy with how I've played. I haven't scored my best, that's for sure. But, you know, it's been a matter of trying to put four days together. So yeah, it's kind of a continuation, and that's why I came back. I felt like I was still playing good, and I shouldn't waste that at home. 

 Q. Did you feel like your swing started to get a bit out of synch, or was it purely difficult conditions?
 ADAM SCOTT: It was tough. I hit some average shots but I hit some good ones that finished in the rough, some good shots that finished 30 feet away. It's not easy to judge. 
 The pins, there were some pins tucked near edges of greens which have runoffs, and you can't afford to miss it over there, so you err on the side of caution and end up 30 feet away and it's a pretty decent shot. No one is really doing much out there. It's hard to get it going. 

 Q. Are you really happy with your position or do you feel like you should be further ahead?
 ADAM SCOTT: It would have been nice to get a couple more after my start this morning, but I'm pretty happy. Hopefully whatever happens, even if someone does get ahead, I'm still in good shape, I think. 

 Q. This tournament in the past had a lot of 64s, 63 occasionally. Do you like the maybe 10-under-par winning score versus the 20-under-par winning score, or does that not matter to you?
 ADAM SCOTT: It doesn't really matter, but I think -- you know, often if the course is set up well and the conditions are fair, you know, 10- and 12-under is a pretty good -- you've got a good test of golf out there for us. I think that's a fair test but still challenging. It doesn't matter if it's 10- or 20-under. I think the scoring would be a little better if it was perfect conditions out there. 

 Q. Can you talk about the challenge of the 15th hole and how you approach it, and how it compares to other tough par-4s maybe on TOUR?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, well, I mean, it's just playing long, into off the left. It's not ideal, maybe, unless you're a left-hander. But it's just playing so long. In saying that, I think our group hit 6-irons in today. It's a pretty small green, though, I think, for a 500-yard par-4. I think that's probably the hardest thing about it is the size of the green. It seems to be pretty small. 

 Q. There's been a lot of talk this week about the stretch from 14 to 18. How much does a course's finishing holes kind of define a great course or a great tournament test, if you will? Obviously Wachovia next week, people talk about 16, 17 and 18, and TPC, same thing. How much does that weigh into a course's challenge or how much you guys enjoy playing it?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think it's an important part of the golf course, and especially for a tournament golf course it's extremely important. Sawgrass is probably one of the best finishes you can get out there. It's a little unique. 
 But yeah, it makes a big difference to the tournament or the atmosphere and what we think about it, I think, if you've got a nice finishing stretch of holes. 
 JOHN BUSH: Adam, take us through the birdie on No. 10. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Birdie on 10 was a 3-wood, 7-iron and 12 feet. 
 11 was a driver and a chip to a foot.
 And 12 was a driver, pitching wedge to 15 feet. 
 13 was a 9-iron and a 25-footer. 
 No. 4 was a 3-wood and a 9-iron, 15 feet. 
 JOHN BUSH: Adam, play well this weekend. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Thanks.
