 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Not really, no, it was a bit of a frustrating weekend.  I played okay.  I didn't hit my irons very close.  I only made one bogey on the weekend but I wasn't really in that close to make a ton of birdies either.   
It was a bit frustrating because when it's calm like this, you feel like you can shoot low.  And if you're a bit off, you can still have a respectable score, but it's not really close to shooting low.  And that's kind of how it was over the weekend.   
The game is feeling close.  It's a horrible thing to say, "What is that?"  But I think my swing got a bit knocked around on Friday.  It was feeling really great Thursday, and Friday it got a bit knocked around and I struggled to really get back in my best rhythm for two days.  The ball position felt funny because it went so far back in my stance on Friday.  And then I just felt a little bit different from where it was.  These are the kind of adjustments that you have to make on the fly at these big events when there's a little adversity, and I just didn't do quite well enough Friday and didn't do quite well enough on the weekend.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Oh, absolutely.  My game is pretty good.  Really good three-round golfer at the moment.  Senior Tour is just calling my name, I think.  It's four rounds of golf.  There's something not quite in the spot and hopefully I can identify that in the next week and a half before we're getting ready to go to Akron and the PGA.   
But, yeah, my game's in good shape.  I keep finishing okay and I know that's not far from contending.  It's very little things.  I'm happy with how my putting has felt after putting so poorly at the U.S. Open, it's back to a nice spot.  So for me that's obviously a huge thing for confidence.  If I can just keep my swinging rhythm a little better, I'll be in great shape.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: I think the best golf courses identify the best players all the time, and probably the case here.  This is one of the best on The Open rota.  So just a good, solid course.  It's a little more of a defined links course.  You play the hole, there isn't -- yes, you can hit it off line and still be able to play, but it's not like playing St. Andrews or something where you come from all kinds of angles.  You need to be still quite precise to get it close to the hole.   
The pins are very interesting today.  It will be interesting to watch the leaders play, because they're all sitting just perched right over a bunker, right over the fall-off at the front.  Easy to hit it to -- "easy" -- relatively easy to hit it to 20 feet, very difficult to hit it in close, because you're going to take some risk.  All those things add up to this being one of the best we play.   
It's a beautiful golf course.  And there's almost no rough, really.  And we're not shooting the lights out.  I know it was tough Friday, but it's just held up very well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, that's very challenging, Carnoustie.  It's very easy for them to make that course hard.  They don't have to do much.  It's slightly different.  It's just got some brutal stuff.  A little more penal than just bunkers.  It's quite tight.  It doesn't give you much room at all, Carnoustie.  And then you obviously have the last three holes which involve a hazard, which doesn't happen that often on the links courses.  And there's not escaping from that burn or ditch on 17 and 18.   
I'm sure we're going to be challenged there again.  But I look forward to hopefully going back and trying again at The Open.  It's fun to be here but it's disappointing when you're not contending.  I've had that experience a lot and it's where I want to be.  And it's disappointing to me that my game wasn't quite good enough.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: I think, one, he's an incredibly gifted golfer and, two, he's young.  I only speak for myself, I don't know that I've ever won a tournament wire to wire.  I can't think of it, but maybe I have, maybe I haven't.  But just holding onto a lead on Sunday, at least, a lot easier it seemed for me as a youngster.  I had a really good record going into the final round with a lead for the first ten years of my career, and that seems to have been more difficult the second.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: I'm kind of saying that.  But I'm not discrediting how good Jordan is, he's a phenomenal player.  And how old is he, 24?  He's 23 right now?  He manages his game as good as the most experienced pro out here.  For a 23-year-old, that's so impressive.  He's a great competitor.  And I do, I think he has already built many great experiences leading.  So he should be confident.  I'm sure people will reminded him of one, but he's won how many others from the front.  It's much more in his favour.   
He's going to be in that position a lot more times and he's going to win a lot, and he'll probably lose one or two more when he's in that position because golf just doesn't go your way every time.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Jordan?  It's awesome.  It's really great for the tournament.  Great for Australian golf.  I love the fact that Jordan enjoys coming down, and he's already said how excited he is to me to be coming back and playing, it's a big boost for us.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, look, I think just competing here is amazing, but I really enjoyed the lead-up, the preparation to it, to come and play The Open when the stands are empty, as well, and get to learn the golf course when it's very quiet out there.  And it's a very peaceful experience for a golf tournament because we don't often get that.  So the lead-up to me is always the special bit.  And obviously playing is incredibly special, as well, and competing at The Open.  But those slightly different experiences being here early when no one's around and having the course to yourself when it's closed is quite nice.  It's a week I look forward to very much.
