Q. Our first question, they just want to see if you could talk a little bit about today's round.
ADAM SCOTT:   It's a lot to digest really.  When it gets tough at a U.S. Open, it's hard to -- unless you shoot even par, you're trying to figure out how it's all a positive.  It's just very, very hard to get in a rhythm out there because if you're just off the fairway, you're just slashing and scrambling.
I did an okay job of it.  I mean, I just got off to a slow start.  It's a hard start and a hard finish, and I got off to a bad start.  I finished well, hung in there.  I still like my chances for the weekend.  I've got to play a great round tomorrow.  If I shoot under par tomorrow, I'll be right in the mix for Sunday.
Q. That kind of leads into their second question.  They said, based on your current position, do you feel you're still within striking distance of the leaders?
ADAM SCOTT:   Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I'm confident now, after seeing what was out there this afternoon, over par will win this tournament.  The greens finally dried out.  It was a difficult afternoon.  If there's any breeze, over par is winning.
