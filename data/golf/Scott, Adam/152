Q. Happy?
ADAM SCOTT: I'm always happy, you know that.  I played well today, but I could have had a couple better, but it was a good day.  I played well and the scoring's great, so it's a start, but I'm going to have to keep it going.
Q. Was the course there for the taking today?
ADAM SCOTT: Pretty much, yeah.  I mean it was just perfect out there.  No wind.
And greens are rolling good, so you could really make some putts, it was a good chance for scoring.
Q. Did the early bogey slow the momentum down and then the late bogey, too?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it would have been nice to have a clean card today, because to walk out of there with like two shots better would have been a really nice start.
But even though it's there for the scoring, if you get out of position and in the rough around the greens, you can get some pretty tricky lies and you got to play solid.  You can't just go out there and have a good score just because it's playing easy.  You got to hit good shots.
Q. How is the finger feeling?
ADAM SCOTT: Everything's good.  Really good.
Q. There was one question that was asked.  He noticed that you're always wearing sunglasses when you play, but not today.  Why is that?
ADAM SCOTT: It's too hot.  The sweat is just dripping straight into the lens, it's so hot.  And the lens is fogging up.  You can't even play in sunglasses out there.
Q. Do you feel comfortable playing without it?
ADAM SCOTT: After awhile my eyes adjusted.  It was a bit glarey for awhile.  But it wasn't too sunny today, so that was good.  But it was just too much sweat.
