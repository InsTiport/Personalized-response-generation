   ADAM SCOTT: I think we were just a little too soft on them. We gave them a couple of easy holes and that proved to be the difference in the match. Pretty much conceded 8 and 13, and obviously you can't do that. So disappointing. We are both playing well but a few putts, costly.   
  
  Q. You made a beautiful putt at 17, but how difficult was the short one?   
 RYO ISHIKAWA: Good putts for me, especially the putts on 16, 17 and 18.   
  
  Q. Ernie, you're happy to play with Ryo, you've said it all week long, you've played three matches together, how do you feel now after watching what he did on the last three holes?   
 ERNIE ELS: The man has got so much heart. Even in our first two matches, we ran up against Bubba and Webb and they played great. Yesterday was yesterday and it was a difficult day.   
 But I could see Ryo was finding his feet on the golf course. This is a golf course where you've really got to know where to hit it and he started striking it so well. Today he believed unbelievable. And his putting reminds me a little bit of myself back in the day (laughing).   
 But it was great putting. The one on 16, I was trying to leave it close for him there, and I left it by four feet and this one I wanted to leave a little bit shorter.   
 He's got a great future obviously and he's a great player, and I'm so glad to have played with him.
