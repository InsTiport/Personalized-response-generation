 Q. Your third time under par at a U.S. Open, good time to do it, your best ever score at a U.S. Open.  So good time to do it.ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely, I needed a good one today.  I think I probably got the better end of the draw on the first two days, coming out early after a bit of soaking rain overnight and that front nine certainly we could fire a little more aggressively at the pins. Hit some good shots and made some putts today and it still felt like hard work, but I'm very happy with the score.
Q. (No Microphone.)ADAM SCOTT: It's great golf for Martin.  There are so many talented guys and he's certainly one of them and he's confident enough after winning a big event already this year.  And when you're playing like that, you want to just keep it going.  So for him to come out today and back it up is super.  If he does it for two more days, then we're all playing for second spot. But we all know that U.S. Opens get very difficult and if I can just somehow put together two really good rounds, maybe slowly but surely I'll creep my way up towards Martin.
Q. What's the hardest part of holding a big lead?ADAM SCOTT: His is considerable.  I think you just have to keep the big picture in mind and think there's 36 holes to go and don't play like you're leading almost.  That doesn't mean play aggressively or do anything stupid, but I don't know why he would change anything of what he's doing. Potentially, he goes out tomorrow and plays better than everyone again and this thing's over.  So just keep doing what you're doing and enjoy it, enjoy that position.
Q. At what point do you have to change your mindset?  Is it at the end of the day tomorrow or at some time on Sunday or earlier that you have to get more aggressive to catch him?ADAM SCOTT: I think if I drew up my perfect plan right now, over the next 27 holes you would like to narrow the gap to you know, less than half of what it is.  Anything could happen over nine holes at a U.S. Open, so if I played great and he continues to play great, I think I can narrow that gap and hopefully feel like I'm in contention come the back nine Sunday.
Q. What comes with more pressure or expectation, coming into a U.S. Open No. 1 in the world, like you are this year or coming in as the defending Masters champion, the only one who has a chance to win all four like last year?ADAM SCOTT: I'm not sure there's too much pressure on either, to be honest. Last year, I felt the weight of the world off my shoulders.  I had just won my first Major, so I thought everything was bonus from there. Certainly a little bit of expectation on myself and maybe from everyone else as being the No. 1 player at the moment, to perform like that.  That's something I've tried to adjust to after the last few weeks since being No. 1.  So maybe there's a little more pressure being No. 1, in my experience.
Q. In your lifetime only one player, Tiger, has won the Masters and the U.S. Open.  Why is it so hard to do?ADAM SCOTT: Well, they are both such demanding tests of your game, and to be in that kind of form those two weeks in the one year is asking a lot.  The competition is getting stronger and stronger and only a guy with Tiger's record has been able to do that and it shows you how hard that is.
Q. (No Microphone.)ADAM SCOTT: Winning any big tournament is difficult, but when you're playing at that level, it's just really a month ago that Martin won THE PLAYERS.  It may be a little easier to keep that kind of form going. I think that the gap between the Masters and the U.S. Open at nine or 10 weeks is a long time to just guarantee that you're going to maintain Major winning form.  That's not an easy formula to figure out.
Q. Have you ever felt like you were playing perfect golf a day, a week, how long can it last?ADAM SCOTT: There have been a couple times where I felt I played 17 holes really good, but there's always something that you can nitpick, because I think the perfect round would probably be 18 birdies.  Not to say that I've made 17, but I feel like I've played some rounds that are almost flawless, other than making every putt.
Q. Which scenario gives people a better chance to catch up, the course drying out and playing tougher for Martin or some rain coming and everybody having a chance to be more aggressive?ADAM SCOTT: It's a tough one, because obviously I don't have a great knowledge of this golf course.  I haven't been here a lot.  But maybe it getting even softer is the best chance.  Because if guys start making birdies, maybe he'll feel a little more pressure to make some and you just don't make them because you want to out at a U.S. Open, even if it's soft.  You've got to hit great shots and maybe if it softens up it's a better chance for people to catch him.
