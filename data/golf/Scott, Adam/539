Q. It seems like every time you come to Scotland you play well?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes well on the last two trips it has been good. I got off to a bit of a rough start today but I fought well out there and I could have had a really low score on the back nine but I snap hooked my drive on the 12th to take bogey six which was a real pity but four under is not too bad.

Q. At Gleneagles, you showed your confidence on an inland course, are you just as confident playing links golf?
ADAM SCOTT:  I'd say not quite as confident but I'm definitely playing a lot more links golf now that I was a few years ago and I am learning a lot more about it. I am really enjoying it but I think I need to learn a little bit more yet.

Q. St Andrews tomorrow, does that suit your game?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes absolutely, as long as the wind is down then it is there for the taking. The first 12 holes is where you make your score and then after that you just try and keep your round going so that is what my plan will be tomorrow.

Q. Will you be more aggressive than normal?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes a little bit but I suppose unless the leaders stop where they are now I don't think I really will have a chance of winning this thing. I'm seven back now and that is a long way to come back, it is not impossible but it is pretty tough, it would take a low 60s score or something like that to win.

Q. You are now confirmed to partner Craig Parry for Australia in the World Cup, how do you feel about that?
ADAM SCOTT:  I am really looking forward to the World Cup, I think we've got a great team. I've heard that not all the top players from the other teams are going so there is maybe a chance for us to go there and sneak the title away. I've had a good year, Craig has had a good year so it is really ideal for Australia and hopefully we can go there and perform and win the trophy.

Q. Have you played in Mexico before?
ADAM SCOTT:  I did once in college but not at that course so it will be a bit of a new experience for me and I'm looking forward to it.
