 Q.  Are you happy with your round?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was tougher this afternoon, for sure.  The wind kicked up a bit and the back nine played very tough coming back into it most of the time, and then in and across, and all of those kind of things make it very demanding. But positioned it off the tee really nice today.  I can't say it could have been better, but it could have been, I guess.  18 was messy, but there were a couple of short putts and a couple of par 5s I didn't take advantage of, and from good position. But to keep pace with an early lead of Rory is important, I think.   Q.  Was it just the weather that changed things or was it anything else?  ADAM SCOTT: No, most of the front nine you're getting some assist with the wind.  And then you get to 11 and you turn straight back into it, it's much more demanding.  Even hitting good shots down the fairway, if you get a slight upslope lie into the wind, it makes the shot into the green that much harder even if it's a wedge.  It's very hard to keep the spin off and keep the flight down and hit all those really great shots that we don't get to hit very much.   Q.  You had some good saves on the front nine, some important ones.  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I did.  I putted lovely as soon as I made a nice one on 2.  And then they started all going in on 4, 5 and 6, and that's a good feeling, for sure.  A couple got away from me on the back nine, but overall everything's feeling pretty good.   Q.  Looking forward to going out in the morning tomorrow?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, we'll see.  The wind might be up a little bit, but I had some practice at that today.  And I think the weather is going to be the thing that separates this field.  It seems pretty bunched at the moment.  Lots of scores under par.  A full day of wind will certainly sort the field out.   Q.  Can you pick out a highlight of your round.  ADAM SCOTT: I hit a lot of nice shots but I think the 6-iron into 13 was really a nice shot, just nice controlled flight and to roll the putt in.   Q.  Based on winning a major, do you feel more confident you'll be there on Sunday?  ADAM SCOTT: It's a good start.  I've got a long way to go.  36 holes to put myself in a position.  So I'll just be grinding the next two days.  If I keep swinging well, I think I'll give myself enough chances to be there.  Like I said Tuesday or Wednesday, I've kind of got it make it happen when I'm playing good at the moment.   Q.  How much of a confidence boost posting the best afternoon round?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, like I said, it's important, I think.  You've got to keep pace with a guy like Rory.  He has the potential to really put his foot down.  I've seen him shoot lots of low rounds, and there's nothing stopping him from doing that tomorrow, either.  I don't want him running away.  We've see what happens, he wins majors by eight.  And Martin did it just a few weeks ago and makes for a tough weekend when you're that far behind having to force it.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  ADAM SCOTT: I got two.   Q.  Did you have any kind of lie after all of that?  ADAM SCOTT: On the drive, you mean?   Q.  After you dropped?  ADAM SCOTT: Oh --   Q.  Did you have much of a chance -- did you have a good lie?  ADAM SCOTT: After I dropped it on the drive?  It was average.  I was trying to force it a little bit, you know.  I felt I could get something low and scuttling, and it could get to the green, but I didn't get a good flight at all out of there.   Q.  You saw what was going on with Phil?  ADAM SCOTT: I didn't.  No, I didn't know what was going on.   Q.  Having won a major do you feel a lot more confident?  ADAM SCOTT: Maybe not.  This has been a big focus for everyone in my crew this year.  We've had our minds obviously on the other majors, but we felt we've been close the last couple of years.  And obviously to win the Claret Jug is such a huge thing.  Our mind has been firmly set on Hoylake this year and doing well here.   Q.  Were the mobile phones a distraction out there today?  ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, we had a couple, I guess.  But hopefully as the week goes on they will learn hopefully to switch them around.   Q.  Your compatriot MacPherson shot 90 today.  What would you say to him tonight?  ADAM SCOTT: Tell him to have a couple of beers, that's all he can do.  That's really tough.  I feel for him, but he'll bounce back, hopefully and have a bit of fun out there tomorrow and enjoys the experience and he'll shake it off, I'm sure.  We've all had a shocker at a major before.  I have.
