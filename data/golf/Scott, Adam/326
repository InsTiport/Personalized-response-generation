 Q. Tough day for you out there. Just comments on the round. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Just a very disappointing back nine. You know, when I missed the green, I seemed to make the worst of it and threw a couple three-putts in for good measure, too. So very disappointing. But going to come out tomorrow and have the round of my life hopefully.
