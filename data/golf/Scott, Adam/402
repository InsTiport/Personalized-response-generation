Q. How is the finger first of all? 
  ADAM SCOTT: Well, it's broken. It's not my finger anyway it's my hand, but. It doesn't really affect my golf swing, so I'm pretty lucky to be playing. 
   
   
Q. Do you have any good stories? 
  ADAM SCOTT: I got lots of good stories on how it happened, yeah. It's pretty miserable. But a friend slammed my hand in the door. 
   
   
Q. Of a car? 
   
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah.  
   
   
Q. Did it catch it like right here? 
   
ADAM SCOTT: Right across the edge. Yeah, it's broken right  
here.  
   
   
Q. Where was it? 
   
ADAM SCOTT: In London. It was the night of the Champion's  
League final in Russia.  
   
   
Q. Do you normally overlap or interlock? 
  ADAM SCOTT: I overlap, fortunately, because I wouldn't have been able to play of I interlock, it would have been too much stress on it. 
   
   
Q. Did you just try to rest it coming in or did you, what did  
you do to kind of minimize what you were going to face out here with  
it? 
  ADAM SCOTT: Well, I had to balance resting it and keeping -- if I put it in a splint or a cast the muscle would have wasted away for a few weeks. So it's like a balance of resting it and keeping the strength, doing some strengthening exercises on it. 
   
And obviously it hasn't healed yet, it's only been a couple weeks  
since I broke it. But it's strong enough to where I can play and  
it's improved a lot in the last five days since I got here. So  
it's been no problem.  
   
   
Q. What did you think when you heard about the pairing?  
Were you probably wishing this week you were actually ranked fourth in  
the world? 
  ADAM SCOTT: No, I know it's a big pairing and there's a lot of hoopla about it, but often when I played with, I played with Phil a lot in Majors, it seems like I get drawn with him a lot. But I enjoy playing with Tiger as well. I find it a lot easier to focus because I think I got to be a little more disciplined. And I felt like I played really well out there today and I really didn't make any putts. So my game didn't feel too bad. 
   
(Sound is off.) 
 If I could get a few putts I would have been  
really happy with the round, but I'm still happy with how I went  
today.
