Q.   Are you experiencing something similar to Rory McIlroy with fan support after the Masters? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I certainly feel like I've been received very well the last couple weeks since I've been back and it's great to have support. 
Yeah, I may have won a few more fans.   Unfortunately it was from not winning the tournament, but maybe I can change that here over the weekend. 

Q.   With the wind up‑‑
ADAM SCOTT:   It's very tough.   I think I played pretty well.   I mean, I could have saved a couple shots maybe.   But it's very easy to let shots slip out on this golf course.   So I think, consider 75 kind of a par round of golf out there today.     It's really very tough.   I did a lot of good things.   I hit a lot of fairways again.   And that makes this course a little bit easier. 
But it is hard when you miss the greens.     There's some severe spots, and I made a couple errors, but it's going to happen on a day like today.   You've just got to stick with it, keep grinding, and like I said, I'm not disappointed with 75. 

Q.   How much harder is the courseand how much more wind ‑‑
ADAM SCOTT:   No, it's fine.   The greens are at a speed where I think they could hold a lot more wind.     It's just a hard golf course because it doesn't really invite you to play many low shots in the wind.   So you've got to put your ball up in the air and rely on the wind doing its job, or not.

Q.   Did one of your drives hit a fan? 
ADAM SCOTT:   I did, unfortunately.   I hit a lady on the 7th.   She was getting some medical attention.   I hope she's going to be okay.   And it was a good break for me, because it kicked it just in the rough.   It was going right, but it actually kicked it back and away from the treed area. 

Q.   What club? 
ADAM SCOTT:   A 2‑iron. 

Q.   Did you talk to her? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I just wanted to make sure she was okay.   And luckily enough, there was a doctor standing right next to her who was kind of treating her until the medics got there.   So I hope she's going to be okay.   I'll find out if she's all right.   She seemed to be okay at the time.
