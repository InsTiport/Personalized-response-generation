Q. Adam, bogey-free, 4-under, 68.  How do you characterize your day out there?
ADAM SCOTT: There was enough good stuff out there to keep me very optimistic for about the rest of the week.  I certainly would like to drive a little better.  If anything, that kind of let me down, but fortunately I didn't have to hit too many drivers today.  If I can straighten that out, maybe I can get in it there a little closer.  Just too many putts kind of from 30 feet.  I need of 15 or 20.
Q. How does this golf course change with the rain we saw from Wednesday?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, like it played softer.  Pretty firm and firery, which was really nice.  A little friendly way to ease us into the first round here.  If the weather stays like this, very clear and low humidity, it will dry out quick.
Q. What are the positives you take away, knowing you put up a good one and you know it wasn't your best?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah.  I feel like I managed my game really well and I was pretty disciplined and didn't push it out there when things weren't going my way, which is all the things you need to do around Major championship.  It's a real test to do that this week and then hopefully execute a little better tomorrow and get in it there closer and give myself some more realistic chances at birdie.
Q. Lot of guys seemed to be struggling with mud balls.  Was that an issue for you?  Were you surprised you weren't playing the ball up this morning?
ADAM SCOTT: It was an issue for everyone, I'm sure.  You know, I got off fairly lightly.  I didn't get too penalized.  I hit some shots that finished further away on the green than I would have liked, but nothing in the water like I'm sure some other guys probably ended up with.  But, you know, that's the call they make.  That's the rub of the green in golf.  It's hard to know what the right call is, I'm sure.
