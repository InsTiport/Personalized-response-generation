Q. Pleasing to be have increased your lead?
ADAM SCOTT: Yes, it was a long day but a good day and I did what I had to do because I knew the guys behind me were going to make birdies if there was no wind so that worked well and hopefully we can get some nice conditions tomorrow and everything keeps rolling along as it is because I feel comfortable.
Q. You knew you weren't going to get finished, so presumably it was just a case of putting as many shots on the board as possible?
ADAM SCOTT: Yes this afternoon was just about making a few birdies and hopefully stay out in front and so far so good. But Goose is obviously playing well and has found his stride and he seems at the moment to be the danger man.
Q. What happened at the sixth?
ADAM SCOTT: I three putted from the back edge where I had a little bit of a lapse in concentration which can happen in a long day but I bounced back and made a couple of birdies which was pleasing so overall I am very happy.
