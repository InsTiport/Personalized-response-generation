JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Adam Scott, thanks for joining us here, runner up here this week at the Barclays Classic, your fourth straight Top 10 on the PGA TOUR, so you're obviously doing something right.  Maybe just a couple comments about the week.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it was a good week of golf this week.  I played really well, particularly in the first and third rounds, got a little off line in the second and fourth rounds, but I managed to keep the score reasonable and then a good finish today on the last couple holes, but it was too little, too late unfortunately.  But overall I'm happy with my game.  I'm just disappointed that I didn't win today.  Looking at it, I'm pretty happy with where things are heading into a major.
Q.  Was that putt on 18 kind of    (inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, it was great, amazing.  We said after 16, Tony and I, that we better finish 3; 3, you never know, but Vijay was too solid today.  It was nice to make it and finish 2nd, but I knew my chances were gone.
Q.  What happened on 14?  Was it just a misread or hit a bump?
ADAM SCOTT:  The first one was down the hill, down the grain, and I overread it and I hit it through the break and it went over the left edge.  And then the next one, I don't know, I thought I hit not a bad putt and maybe jumped a little right, maybe I pushed it a bit, hard to say, but it was up into the grain and a little bumpy roll.

I had a couple of them this week, but it was an unfortunate time for that to happen.
Q.  You talked about how Vijay was so solid today.  That guy obviously has a lot of wins under his belt.  He's been in this position a lot.  Is there at all an intimidation factor when a guy like that has been so proficient at winning over the past few years and you're playing with him?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, not really.  I've played plenty of golf out here with all the top guys.  I don't really feel intimidated by them.  Once Vijay settled into the round, when he birdied the 5th, I could see he was playing pretty nicely, had things under control.

I was just looking for a bit of steady golf, but was just a little erratic off the tee today, more so than I've been in the last few weeks, and got myself out of position.  It was a little tough for me to be that solid.  I didn't give myself easy shots at the green.  That's probably what cost me at the end of the whole day.
Q.  Can you remember holing out five times in a week like this?
ADAM SCOTT:  I know, yeah.  It's better to be lucky than good, right?  I don't know, it was just one of those things; they all kept going in.
Q.  With the momentum that you've built, is that helpful going into next week, or can that go away in a hurry?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, it can go away in a hurry, especially at the U.S. Open, but I think if I'm smart and can prepare properly the next three days or so before we tee off Thursday morning    I'll just stay patient, and it's similar to here, you've just got to stay patient.  No one is running away 20 under par, so if you can hang around par at a U.S. Open you know you're right in it.  It's going to be tough, but I'm hitting enough good shots, I'm swinging the club well, I've just got to make the right decisions and take my time out there.
Q.  Have you gone over to Winged Foot?  Have you played there?
ADAM SCOTT:  I did, yeah.  I played nine holes on Tuesday, and I've played the course beforehand, also.  I heard they cut the rough on Friday or Saturday, cut it down a bit shorter, which is good.  I like the course.  I think the key to Winged Foot other than keeping it in the fairway is really learning about the greens and the break on the greens because they're a bit tricky.
Q.  Generally what's the feeling in the locker room about Vijay going ten months, nine or ten months, without a win, and how do people account for it?
ADAM SCOTT:  I don't think it's been mentioned to be honest.
Q.  Never, ever?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, I wasn't aware it was ten months without a win.  I think that's just how good the Tour is.  It's deep and you've got to play well to win.  He did it today, got it done.
Q.  You talked about staying patient.  How did that play a part in today, up and down round, led after 12 and fell off pace a little bit and finished up strong?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, yeah, I just didn't want to get down on myself.  I knew I was still in it, and I hit a bad shot off 16 and that cost me a couple shots and then I was out of it.

You know, if I just waited, I knew with a par 5 finish anything can happen, but unfortunately I was too far behind by then.  But yeah, stayed patient and I saved a bit of face at the end and birdie eagle finish and I got 2nd place out of it which is probably better than finishing par par and coming in 12th or something.
Q.  With these past results the past few weeks in the States, is this the best form you've had heading into a major or perhaps recent majors?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I'd say absolutely.  In the past I really haven't gone into majors playing particularly well or coming off great results.  My confidence is certainly at a high.  I feel like I know where the ball is going, which is a nice thing going into a U.S. Open.  I feel good about next week.  Like I said before, I've just got to play the first two rounds and get them locked away and then go about the weekend.
Q.  Percentage wise, how much more percent do you think you'd have to pick up to go one better next week?
ADAM SCOTT:  I think I'm there.  I think I'm playing well enough to win.  It's a matter of making that short putt on the par 3 today.  It's a couple shots here and there over a week.  Two shots extra saved over the week is going to make a difference.
Q.  You began your career with a bit of a spotty record in majors.  What was the toughest thing for you to teach yourself in regard to these big tournaments?
ADAM SCOTT:  I always played too defensive in the majors, and I was kind of afraid of the golf course.  I'd play defensive golf, and then when I'd hit a bad shot playing defensive golf, it would get in a really bad position.  Recently, and especially at Augusta this year, I played a lot more aggressive and just played my shots, how I saw them and the way I wanted to play them and took a few flags on and had a go at a few more putts.  You've got to back yourself to execute them, and you don't win majors not making birdies, so you've got to make some birdies out there.
Q.  Are you better prepared for the U.S. Open than you were before you got to Westchester this week?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think so.  I have four testing rounds under my belt, a couple in the wind here on the weekend, which is going to    if it blows like that next weekend, which it could just down the road, it's going to be good to know how the ball is playing and all that kind of stuff.  You know, another week in the hunt playing under the pressure of contention, and hopefully I can learn something every time from that.
JOEL SCHUCHMANN:  Adam Scott, thank you.
