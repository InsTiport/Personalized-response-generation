 Q.   A great turn around?   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I was playing fine, but obviously, you know, 5 and 6 are tough, and I made a couple bad swings and made bogies.   But I figured I'm playing fine.   I got my opportunities, and I got back hitting fairways and greens and had a few chances.   Could have made some more, really.   The game is good.   Good save on the last hole, so I'm happy about that.  
   
 Q.   (Indiscernible)?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Just short, just ran back down.   Just down the rough.  
   
 Q.   It's one of those situations too I feel like where you're not at your absolute best but you're still amongst it.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I mean, Geez, I played really lovely apart from a couple of swings on the front.   This is a tournament and the way the course is set up with four rounds in the 60's, it's going to go a long way this week.   That's one.   We've got three to go, and I'll be right there.   You saw last year 8â€‘under might have won.   It's a tough trek.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to get in a little bit of trouble?   
ADAM SCOTT:   If I keep driving like I am, I could be in good shape.   I didn't drive it into that long stuff.   I missed a couple in the first cut, but the fairways are 15 yards wide, so it's not easy all the time.
