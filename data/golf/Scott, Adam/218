 Q.   What's harder, facing a playoff putt for the Masters or asking the woman you love to get married?  
ADAM SCOTT:   The putt definitely, because I didn't even have to ask.   So I got out of that one.   That was good.   
   
 Q.   How did it all come about then, if you didn't have to ask?  
ADAM SCOTT:   We just decided over a conversation.   We thought it was time, so we did it.   
   
 Q.   Good place to do it, too.   Nice location.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it was a week where we knew some people would be around that we wanted and we kept it a secret for a couple months and then surprised them on the day.   
   
 Q.   How, in this world of 24/7 social media, were you able to keep this secret for all this time, that sort of almost is as remarkable an achievement as winning the Masters.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I don't know.   I thought that ‑‑ we just wanted it to be a secret for the day and then we haven't told anyone to keep it a secret since, but I think people didn't want to do the wrong thing by me.   So I've got them right where I want them.   
(Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Did you hear much from the fans about it at all today?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, a few people yelling out.   It was good fun.   I'm glad everyone thinks it's fun.   It's been great for me.   
   
 Q.   Were the women in mourning?  
ADAM SCOTT:   No, it just happened that way.  
   
 Q.   How do you think it will change you as a person and maybe as a golfer to be married now?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I don't know.   I'm only a couple weeks in, but I think it's good for me.   I think it really suits me.   I feel very comfortable with it and I don't know that it really should change me too much.   But it's exciting, looking to the future.   
   
 Q.   Will she travel more with you?   
ADAM SCOTT:   Probably not.   She's busy.   She works hard, so.   She doesn't travel much.  
   
 Q.   Did your parents know?  
ADAM SCOTT:   My parents did know.   We swore them to secrecy.  
   
 Q.   I heard you sent out invitations to a garden party, was that the wedding invitation?  
ADAM SCOTT:   We just said we were having a party, so come on over.   So then they had no idea that it was going to happen.   So that was the fun little game for me and Marie to play for awhile, planning it and stuff.   
   
 Q.   Where does one who gets married in the Bahamas honeymoon?  
ADAM SCOTT:   We figured we didn't need a honeymoon, our life is pretty much like a honeymoon all the time.   So there were no real plans for any of that.   We'll just keep on going.   
   
 Q.   I have to ask, are you guys wearing wedding rings?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, we have rings, but, I don't know, I've never played with one, so I wasn't going to start this week.   We'll see if it makes it to the course or not.   
   
 Q.   Do you think about getting to No. 1 at all in the position you're in right now?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I don't know, depends on other guys, too.   It's just not set in stone.   So the goal tomorrow has got to be to, depending upon conditions, to try and get to double digits.   It's possible, I'll be off fairly early, probably again, and try and sneak up there as high as I possibly can.   You never know what's going to happen out here.   
At the moment I've just played with Brandt and he's sitting in the top‑10 and it's ‑‑ this golf course plays tougher over the weekend, especially late.   The wind's up, there's some critical shots coming in that you have to hit really good shots or you're in danger of dropping.   
So the guys have their work cut out for them this afternoon.   If I can put a good round on it tomorrow and post something good, I think I can have a high finish.   
   
 Q.   On that though, if you get to the last few holes and you're looking at the first place on the leaderboard, will you look at it, 16th on the leaderboard, to see where you are in relationship to that?  
ADAM SCOTT:   No, because like I said I need to know ‑‑ there are other guys who could threaten it, so I'm not going to study leaderboards just to do some math on rankings.   I'm just going to play and see what happens.   
   
 Q.   Do you plan to go to Pinehurst prior to the U.S. Open?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I definitely would like to.   I'll definitely make one trip there and I would like to make two.   But we'll see how that goes.   
   
 Q.   What's your feeling about it, not having been there since they really changed it?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I'm excited to see what it looks like.   I've heard only good things and it sounds like they're setting it up appropriately, albeit long.   But I think it's probably a good look for that golf course.   The last time there was some issues around there and I'm not sure that it's the kind of course that you need to play six inch rough down the edge of every fairway.   So it sounds like they're setting it up right.   I'm looking forward to going and having a look at it.  
   
 Q.   What about Hoy Lake?   What do you remember of that course?   What do you like about it?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I remember how dry it was that week, how hot it was.   We had a couple years there where The Open Championship was really hard and fast.   
2005 at St. Andrews was obviously good weather as well.   Hard and fast there.   
2006 might have been the hardest and fastest we have ever seen.   
But it's a tricky little golf course, playing in that condition, obviously a lot of irons, and that's well documented, Tiger didn't hit a wood and won.   So it's all dependent on the conditions.   
But there's so much strategy in those little links courses, so many different ways to play it and you assess the risk and decide how you're going to tackle it.   You got to have a good game plan.  
   
 Q.   Do you scale back and driver if it's dry and hard?  
ADAM SCOTT:   You kind of have to, otherwise you risk running into trouble because there's nothing stopping a driver once it's hitting the ground.   If it's off line, it's going to get in trouble.   
   
 Q.   After your start today you had a couple bogeys and now you're doing well, what cause that had turnaround?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Just golf.   I started out and didn't swing the club well the first few holes and got up on the 5th rough there and made a nice swing out of the rough.   
Then a couple good swings down 6 and stopped trying so hard, maybe.   I was trying, forcing it a little maybe early with trying to swing it too perfectly and it's hard to do that when the wind's up and gusting and creating shots, sometimes you just got to aim and swing and I think I did a better job of that at the end of the round.
