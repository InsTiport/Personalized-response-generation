Q. Good match, saw a few putts rolling in.  That had to feel good?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was a good match.  We all played pretty well for foursomes.  Certainly the front nine conditions were tricky and it's gotten a little nicer now.
Yeah, made some putts today, so I'm feeling good about that and looking forward to the next two matches.  If we can finish strong in these last couple matches, then it will be a good day for us.
Q. Been such a close day, seems like 1-up, 2-up, no real blowouts, lots going on for both teams.  Can you talk about Leish being a good partner?
ADAM SCOTT: He's solid and great in the moment, Leish.  You just have to get him in that mind-set.  It was an up-and-down match, and get him to dig and he performs really good.  You know, he was a good, solid partner today.  We played really well.  They played great, too, so maybe a fitting result.
Q. You're going out this afternoon with Lahiri.  Are you excited to be paired with Anirban?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  Obviously I've not played a lot with him but it's better-ball this afternoon, and just get in our rhythm and hopefully attack.
