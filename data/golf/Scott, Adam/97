Q. So the grind is over, you've done well. Green lights hopefully now for the weekend. You put yourself in position. 
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, in position. Today was a really good day, can't ask for much more. Started 10 back and I'm now four back. This is a good result. 
It would be nice if we get a little calmer conditions on the weekend, just because it's too hard playing this golf course like this four days in a row.

Q. You're leading the field in greens in regulation. Do you feel there's even a few more out there tomorrow? Birdies?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, if I get the putter going. I mean, it's okay, but I've missed a lot, and close ones that you're hoping to hole. You're not going to make everything out there when it's this windy, but, unfortunately, I left a few out there that, if you were really on, you would make a few more.
And I'm not going to say I'm not happy with my round today, but it could have been one of those special ones like Charley had yesterday.

Q. Can you do something in the putting stroke that you can get your handle on for the weekend?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, look, it's just hard. It's hard to hit a putt here. Most putts are outside the hole and you're aiming them outside the hole, it's meant to break left and the wind is blowing left‑to‑right, it's very hard to commit and hit. And I felt like I committed on a lot of them and I just got them wrong. I didn't always hit poor putts, it's just very difficult. I think that it will get easier if that wind settles down and all the good stuff how I've been putting really well will fall back into place.

Q. Sounds like you've been hitting it as well as you have been, you've proven that, right, so you must feeling good that that game has translated to competition and it's just those few putts that might be the huge difference?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, it is. When I won in 2013 I don't think I missed a putt inside six feet for the week. And I'm going to have to kind of have that weekend here, if I really want to win. I mean, they all count the same, but it feels like those ones that you don't want to let slip. And if I can sharpen that up a little, which I have every belief I will, if it's just a little calmer generally out on the golf course. It's pretty hectic out there with the wind.

Q. What has it been like since you won in 2013? Do you feel a heightened sense of freedom? You sort of have, like you said before, nothing to lose and everything to gain?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I can't even really think, the last couple years, I haven't really been in contention, so it hasn't really mattered that much. I mean‑‑

Q. You had nine holes, went through nine one Saturday and then fell off on the back nine one year. 
ADAM SCOTT: Well, yeah, I mean, it's an incredible feeling coming back as a Masters champion here anyway. The reception on the weekend get better. Of course, the crowds have their favorites, like Freddie's and Tom Watson's and Mickelson's, but it's definitely a feeling out there today when I got it going that they liked seeing us past champions doing well. And if I can get a couple birdies early tomorrow, feed off a bit of crowd momentum, it will be a fun day.
