Q. Really solid round of golf today.  That was a tough golf course out there.  Thoughts on how you did play?
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I played well.  I must say, that's probably the best I've played tee to green for quite some time, so that's pleasing.  Of course I wish I could have taken more advantage of it, but it was tough out there, so I put myself back in the tournament, which is good, for the weekend.  Another couple days like that, and hopefully I'll have a shot at it.
Q. Dead center on that 50-footer at 17; that was sweet.
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's a funny game because I felt like I missed a couple, had a couple three-putts, and then you hole a 50-footer.  It's amazing how it all pans out in the end, golf.  I'll just go and try and do the same stuff on the weekend.
Q. There was a little rain this morning, but this golf course just seemed to firm up again today.
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's firm.  Even my wedge shot on the last, I was thinking maybe it's a little softer but it still got a big bounce through and ended up 10 feet beyond the hole.  It's playing just how you want it.  The greens are a little slower than we're used to seeing here, which is fooling everyone a little bit here and there, but if we adjust to it on the weekend, there could be some good scores.
