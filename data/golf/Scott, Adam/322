 Q. Obviously playing against Tiger in the last group, what are your feelings about it? Looking forward to playing with K.J.? Obviously a pretty strong team with woods and Stricker. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, they are on a good run at the moment, Tiger and Stricker, 5-0 in their last matches. They won every match I think last time anyway. You know, it's going to be a tough match, so I feel like my game is good. It's a good pairing. 
 K.J. and I, we have had success in the past, and you know, geez, I'm looking forward to it all starting. It's a big build-up. It's just nice going to be nice to get out there and get the match going. Every point is going to be a hard-earned one this week. 

 Q. Do you anticipate getting a lot of support from the locals? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Hopefully, absolutely. Hopefully we have got some support on our side. I think everyone is going to really enjoy the golf overall, but there's always my feeling of playing at home and certainly here in Australia this time around.

 Q. One more question, what's the best part about K.J.'s game that you like the most? 
 ADAM SCOTT: He's such a consistent player, I think he hits the ball so straight, it's nice to have that to fall back on.
