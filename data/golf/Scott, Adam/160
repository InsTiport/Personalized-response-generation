 Q.  Overall thoughts on the match?  
ADAM SCOTT: It was a pretty good match.  I think it was all good stuff.  They got off to a good start, birdieing four holes in a row on the front, and we were fighting back.  But we had our chances to make putts and we didn't.  And that was the difference.  Missed three really good chances on the back nine, and then it slips the other way quickly and it's over.  So we had our chance but they played well.  It was really solid stuff.
