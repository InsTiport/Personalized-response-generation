ADAM SCOTT: I didn't really have anything going my way.  And got myself in some trouble I couldn't get out of, which was disappointing.
Q. Obviously you really want this sort of tournament day.  How do you recover after a round like that?
ADAM SCOTT: I've just got to go and shoot a low one tomorrow.  I feel like I'm playing well enough.  Just a few things today that cost me at least five shots.  I don't think there's much in it.  They're the errors you can't make.
Q. It's classic links golf.
ADAM SCOTT: It is.  You've got to stay out of them and when you're in them you have to get out.  And twice today I left it in a bunker.  It's always easier said than done.
But it was one of those days, every bunker I was in I was on the back side of the bunker, and it wasn't as simple as getting it out.
Q. You had a great putt on the 2nd, but your short putting let you down.
ADAM SCOTT: I missed two short ones today.  What's new?  I missed two short ones at the U.S. Open, too.
It's more about putting myself in really poor position that cost me a lot of shots.  It was tough out there at times.  The overall thing was, I just didn't get it in there to give myself -- you couldn't rely on getting them back.  There wasn't birdie opportunities out there unless you hit a really great shot.
Q. Do you know what to work on after something like that?
ADAM SCOTT: I don't think I really need to work on anything.  I think I'll just brush this off and say it was a tough day at the office and come out and play hard tomorrow.
Q. It was a bizarre situation on the 7th.  Have you ever been involved in anything like that?
ADAM SCOTT: I've heard of guys playing their own ball, but not three shots in a row.  It was bizarre.
Obviously the rhythm of the round wasn't going so good, anyway.
Q. A little frustrating it went 5 1/2 hours, almost?
ADAM SCOTT: It went quick for a major.  That felt good.  No, it's not bad for a major, to be honest.  I think they set the course up really well.  It was probably the windiest conditions I've seen here in two weeks today, and the course played very well.
Q. There was a big spread of scores.
ADAM SCOTT: No, it's a great track.  And if you hit the right shots in the right spots you can have a good score.
