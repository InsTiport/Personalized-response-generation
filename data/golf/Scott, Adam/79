Q. If we can get some comments on your opening round.
ADAM SCOTT: It was difficult today.  It was hard work.  Teeing off the 10th was probably the tough start, and didn't really have a good look at birdie until my 11th hole, a putt from so far away and the greens were fast.  I spent the first ten holes making four- to seven-footers for par.  The good news was, I made all of them.
But like most of the year, the swing wasn't quite there today.  But actually the last few holes, I felt like there was something good in there.  So tomorrow, hoping for better-ball striking.
Q. Did you get affected by jet-lag?
ADAM SCOTT: You know, I've travelled so much less the last five or six years, occasionally I do a little bit.  I'm not too bad.  I'm only an hour or two out at the moment.  But when you're getting up at 3:00, it makes for a long day.  I was trying to stay awake and go to the gym and wear myself out.  But it wasn't too bad today.
