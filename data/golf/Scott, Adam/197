Q. Roller coaster round, but you did pretty well?ADAM SCOTT: There were some ups and downs, but it was really, really important to finish with a couple of birdies and put me in good shape for the weekend, I think.Q. In the context of your tournament, how big could those birdies be?ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's hard to know.  They all count the same.  But it was a good time, a good way.  Lunch will taste a lot better.  If the wind stays up this afternoon, I shouldn't be too far back.Q. (Inaudible.)  You're in a pretty good position right now?ADAM SCOTT: I am happy with believe that.  Could have been better today.  I played really well, but didn't take advantage of my good shots today and compounded that with some areas from the middle of the fairway.  And the tee on No. 13, which is kind of a huge mistake when you're in good shape.  It's one thing if you're in trouble to make a bogey, but when you're in the middle of the fairway, you don't want to make a bogey.  And I had a couple of them on the back nine.  I hit the skids and had to scramble coming in.Q. (Inaudible.)ADAM SCOTT: Today was much tougher out there.  Just the slight direction change and the gusts.  All of a sudden there were holes where I had -- was hitting 6-iron from in the 140s.  That's when you know it's pretty windy.  And drives are going miles and 4-irons are going 300.  It's crucial on how well you adjust to that on a day like today.Q. You'd like to see more of this kind of weather over the weekend?ADAM SCOTT: Seems like we're going to see it all over the weekend, maybe.  Tomorrow doesn't look great, and I think that's all right.  The last 36 of the major is going to be a grind.  And if it's tough conditions, you know, I'm certainly up for that challenge.  I feel like I'm swinging the club really well. So the tougher it gets I think more of that favors me, if I can keep swinging well.Q. When the wind is blowing on this kind of course, how much are mistakes magnified?ADAM SCOTT: Depends, if you pick the right shot and make a mistake, it's like on a scale, you know, you've got -- if you pick the wrong shot on the wrong time they can really get away from you.  A hook on a hook wind, hooks 60, 70 yards into places that you haven't even looked at.  And you really have to be careful of what kind of shot you pick.  Shot selection is huge.  And you can afford to make a little error in judgment, but not a big one.Q. (Inaudible.)ADAM SCOTT: Not really.  The couple of errors today was just on how strong the wind was.  It's the strongest wind since I've been here.  And all of a sudden downwind the ball was going very far and the greens gave out a lot more, 20 and 30 yards almost, some balls bouncing on the greens coming in with an iron.  We just haven't seen that yet. So they kind of got my attention after a couple of holes and I was a little more cautious because I went over the back and made bogey.  Like I said, how you adjust -- you have to adjust quickly and have your thinking hat on here, otherwise it can get away from you.Q. And your thought is it's going to be more of that?ADAM SCOTT: Well, I don't know if it's going to get harder or if it's going to rain.  But it could play hard even if it does rain.  If it's windy and rainy, it's not easy to have a good score, that's for sure.  But typically majors do seem to play tougher on the weekend, if there was no wind and sunshine it might be a different story, but that's not looking like the case.Q. Which hole did you hit that 6-iron 140 yards?ADAM SCOTT: The fourth.  It was 147 or something.Q. (Inaudible.)ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I didn't make much today.  The pace of the greens is tricky because uphill into the wind are the slowest winds we'll ever putt on.  And downhill, downwind you have to adjust.  It's all about adjusting.  I didn't have my iron quite as good as yesterday, but I still made some good putts.  It's just a grind.  Everything is hard out there.  Every shot is so crucial and it can all get away from you, even putts.  The wind is affecting the break of a putt.  And if you misjudge that, you can three-putt from nowhere, if you're not careful.Q. (Inaudible.)ADAM SCOTT: It probably was 25 feet on 17, I'd say.  And the first one on 18 was probably 80 feet.
