  ADAM SCOTT:   Absolutely.   It's an unfortunate thing, I feel, because the tournament is clearly affected by weather, but what are you going to do?   It's just the way it is.   It's still a great event.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
    ADAM SCOTT:   Oh, it was very difficult today.   It was blustery today, and not consistent.   But strong.   And around this course that makes it very difficult.   Downhill approach shot over water, I mean, it doesn't get much tougher than that.   It was challenging out there today.  
   
 Q.   Even around the greens?   
    ADAM SCOTT:   Absolutely.   I hit a couple of putts that I left fairly long.   Pushed up the left and missed.   And another one downwind.   It was very windy.  
   
 Q.   Much has been written about Rory's troubles so far, do you think it's been exaggerated?  
    ADAM SCOTT:   I think they're being exaggerated to an extent.   I played with him a couple of weeks ago at The PLAYERS, and I was really interested to play with him.   It was the first time I'd seen him hit a shot this year, and he really impressed me.   I just think he hasn't quite put it altogether this year yet, which sometimes happens.   But it's all right there for him.
