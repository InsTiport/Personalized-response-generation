  ADAM SCOTT:   It was good.   I actually played a lot better than really my score showed this week.   One of those tough weeks on the greens where I hit lots of good putts and they didn't go in, and a couple of my good shots didn't turn out so good, which can happen.   It's all really solid stuff.   I was hoping for better, but it's a good start back. 

Q.   How is the course playing?
ADAM SCOTT:   The wind has just picked up a little bit as we finished the round, so it's certainly making for a tough finishing few holes.   It's just the greens; the greens are really releasing a lot.   They're not receiving the spin on the ball so much, so that's the hardest thing to judge, I think.

Q.   Where do we see you next?
ADAM SCOTT:   I'll be at Memorial for sure, so looking forward to that, and trying to get some momentum happening before the U.S. Open.

Q.   And you'll get back home and slip on that green jacket again and walk around the house?
ADAM SCOTT:   Absolutely.   Can't wait for that.   It'll be good.   I can do that and work on my game a bit and hopefully come back ready for Memorial.
