Q.   That birdie putt at 18, but you played awfully well today. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, yes, I fought really well out there today and scrambled when I had to, hit a few good shots here and there, and somehow it added up to 65.   So I'm pretty happy with that, although I could have done much better.

Q.   How was the condition of the golf course?   Obviously, you only had the one putt at 18, but throughout the day. 
ADAM SCOTT:   No, it was nice today.   I think the greens have really smoothed out each day.   I certainly felt like I had the putter rolling today nicely.   So hopefully that continues tomorrow.

Q.   The way Sergio's been playing, certainly going to be a little bit back.   As you go into Sunday, does that change anything for you? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I've got to go gungâ€‘ho tomorrow and try to have a really fast front nine. 
If I can shoot 4 or 5 under and he gets a slow start, maybe just close enough where he has to think a little bit.   Or someone's got to get him thinking a little bit tomorrow.   You never know what can happen.   Got to be optimistic.
