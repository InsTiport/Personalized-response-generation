Q. Adam, the start to the back nine, your back nine, not one you'd like, but you managed to rally and make the best of the situation.
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I hit two really bad wedge shots from the fairway and cost me bogeys when you're really hoping to make one birdie out of those two.  And caught me on the back foot there a little bit after a really solid start.  I was playing well, and then I kept playing well.
So I just didn't really take advantage of everything I could have today.  But I certainly didn't do any damage.  And a good front nine tomorrow morning.  Hopefully will be kind of on par with the leaders.
Q. Four shots back is not out of the realm of possibility to make a move up the leaderboard.  What do you need to do tomorrow to make that happen?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, you know, you're just going to have to get on a little run where you're under par for, you know, a nine-hole stretch or so and then kind of get in a comfort zone, and then there's no stress and you're playing kind of stress free, which is nice.
But you can never not concentrate out here.  A mental error, a lapse in concentration is incredible costly, and that will be the main focus tomorrow.
Q. The bogey, it's something you have to recover from, especially if you want to make a move or just be in contention.  What was the approach you took once you were off that hole and moved on to the next one?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, I was -- you know, you just have to keep thinking that you're playing well and you probably -- odds are you're going to make a good swing on the next shot and a good putt.
That's where you just have to trust all the work and preparation you've done.  Keep yourself calm.  If you start getting out of your comfort zone at U.S. Opens, it can go horribly wrong.  I've learned that in the past.
Q. What's the main thing you need to avoid in a second round here?
ADAM SCOTT: I don't really know how to answer that.  There's lots -- so much trouble at a U.S. Open.  If you can hit some fairways and greens, the greens are receptive enough still, they don't have that scare factor in them.  And they might over the weekend, but there's -- as we've seen today and good conditions, there's a good score out here, and that's what I'll be thinking about.
