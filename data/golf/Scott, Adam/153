 Q.  Strong finish.  Do you like where you are?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, just a slow start today, but then I played well the last 14 holes or so, so need to put 18 together tomorrow.  A fast start would be good to get in the mix.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you missed a chance on the front nine which seems to be the easier of the two nines?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, yeah, yesterday I got off to a fast start, and I had the same score as today.  So I just got to put 18 holes together.   
There's just a few holes somewhere out there where I go backwards and that's why I'm going to be four or five shots behind the lead.   
 Q.  After three days here playing, do you feel like you're fighting a little bit more in terms of the greens and stuff like that?  
ADAM SCOTT: I think the greens I've been really good with all week.  I can't complain about that.   
I think I putted nicely.  I made lots of putts.  I'm very happy with how that's going.   
So if I can just get it in there a bit closer and get all the wedges up-and-down tomorrow, have a low round, 61, 62, we have seen it out here this week.   
 Q.  Do you feel that there's a low one in there for you this week?  
ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely.  I played enough good golf that it comes down to just 18 only, I can find it.   
 Q.  The heat isn't an issue for you, is it?  
ADAM SCOTT: Not too bad, it's just like home, almost.
