JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Adam is joining us here.  You're defending your first title here on the PGA TOUR with two more wins down the road.  Why don't you just talk about coming in and defending for the first time in your career on the PGA TOUR and then maybe a little bit about the golf course.  I know you had an opportunity to play today.
ADAM SCOTT:  I had such a great week last year.  It's always a little bit different defending a title, but lucky for me, I've defended a couple of titles in Europe before, and although I haven't successfully defended, I gave it a good show, and that's what I'm meaning to do here.  I don't want to give up my trophy too easily.

As far as the course, they've done a great job.  The greens are beautiful, nice and firm, and the way they reshaped the fairways, just getting it in in some places I think is going to challenge us a little bit more this year.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  A little bit.  I feel very confident on the golf course because last year I played very well, and I see all the good shots that I hit in my mind, so that helps when you get up on the tee, or any shot for that matter into the green, so I think there is a different level of confidence.

You know, there also is probably a little bit more expectation from outside and also myself, as well, as to how I perform this week.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  Not at all.  I didn't really have a problem with the course last year.  I think the 9th hole is the hole that needed to be changed, and they did a good job with that.

But it's in great shape.  The greens, I really like the way they're playing.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  It's very good.  I think as far as ball-striking and the physical aspect of the swing goes, I'm at a pretty similar level as to how I was coming in here last year.  You know, it's not 100 percent, but it's pretty close.  I'm hitting some nice shots.  But I feel I've got a little bit more experience and confidence in my game than last year.  I've put up a couple wins, and winning definitely makes you feel a little bit more comfortable.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  At the start of the year, I said I'd like to win more than twice for the year, wherever that would be, and I've done it twice.  I've still got that to achieve.  Other than that, just trying to make a little bit of a move up the Money List.  Obviously I don't think I can win the Money List, but I can probably get up pretty high.  I've still got a few events to go, and I'll have a go at that and see how high I can go.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  I'll probably just play enough in Europe to keep my card next year and a little bit more over here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  Not so much, other than I know how well I can play at that course and I'd like to live up to that again.  You definitely don't want to give your trophy away without a fight.  Out here this week I feel pretty confident that I can get myself in the mix come Monday.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  No, nothing at all.  It changed a lot from the golf side of things, got me the Tour card and an exemption for two years.  It's been nice to take advantage of that in the last year and really just allowed me to play whatever I wanted to play in for the last year, which has been great for me.  I've really been able to work a pretty good schedule and take advantage of it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, you never think about losing your card when you're out here, but just to not even have to worry about it at all is quite nice.  So certainly for the next five years I think I'm set, and I can just go and play and work on the things I need to to take my game as far as I can.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Adam, for joining us.
