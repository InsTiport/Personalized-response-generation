Q.
Lovely finish there, Adam, great-looking round.
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes, just what I needed, big finish like that.  I was playing nice and then kind of blew it on the 11th there.  That got me fired up a little bit and I finished strong, but I've been playing good, so it was nice to get something out of it.  It was the first round back after three weeks off, so I'm pretty happy with that.
Q.  What have you been doing in your three weeks off?  And then tell me what happened on the 11th.
ADAM SCOTT:  I've been home in Australia taking it easy, a little bit of golf, little bit of surfing, not much else.

On 11 I hit it fat off the tee in the bunker and hit a nice bunker shot to two feet and three-putted it.  I don't know what happened there.  Brain fart.

I started playing good again after that.  At least it didn't cost me too much, 11.
Q.  A great start, 5-under.  There are a lot of big names up there like you would expect in a field like this.  Thoughts for the next three days?
ADAM SCOTT:  Just keep pace with everyone.  You know, it was important today, big difference between finishing even and 5-under like I did, and I'd be 6 back if I was even, then it's hard work for the rest of the week, but I'm in good shape right out of the box, so I'll just hang around with them and see if I can have a good on Sunday.
Q.  Tell me how you regrouped after the 11th.
ADAM SCOTT:  I had a good up-and-down then on the next out of the bunker and got a good break on 13, hit it short and got a big bounce up to the pin and made it.

Then 15, hit another good shot and made a nice putt.

Same on 16.

17 was a two-putt birdie, then a nice one to finish at the last.  Pretty solid stuff.
Q.  How long was that putt on the last?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was probably 30 feet.  Great way to finish.
Q.  Thanks for your time.
