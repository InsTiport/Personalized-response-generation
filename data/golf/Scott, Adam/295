 Q.   I know it's a tough one because of how Rory put that number on the scoreboard, what was it like out there from a mentality standpoint?   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I just never really got it going.   You know, Rory had it in his hands today, and put it out of everyone's reach.   
You know, it's a hard golf course and it was a grind.   I didn't play my best.   It makes it hard to get around.   
   
 Q.   Another double at 13, kind of the point where the round got to that area‑‑ what happened there?   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I pulled my tee shot.   I just wasn't committed to that shot.   Put myself in some trouble.   Easy to do out here.   A shame, really.  
   
 Q.   The bounceback this week, to be in top form, what's the last couple of weeks been like for new major championships?  
ADAM SCOTT:   It's been great.   I've been in the mix in both majors, and with a better finish in this morning's round, I would have been right in there in the final round but I was too far back.   But the game is right there and I have eight months to think about it and get ready for the next one.   
I think the course was playable for three of the days, and then we had that second round where it obviously beared its teeth with the wind, but I enjoyed the whole week.
