 Q. Nice playing today. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was really solid today. I was pleased with how I putted. It was solid. I made some good putts and I didn't miss anything that I should be making. It's getting there. Very happy with it, 6-under.

 Q. 25 putts today, five less than you had yesterday. In that regard, how difficult was it out there with the blustery conditions?
 ADAM SCOTT: It was a little tricky. There were some tricky pins, and trying to get it close a couple times, forcing it a bit, missed some greens. Made a couple mistakes out there, but made up for it with the good putting, I think. And it's nice to have that kind of round rather than yesterday was really solid and missed everything and came off a little disappointed, whereas today I feel pretty happy with myself.

 Q. Take us through from your second shot in there at 18. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was 207 hole, and I kind of just threw a 6-iron up in the air and tried to get it to come down soft. The greens are firming up nicely and not much area to keep it on the green there. I hit it perfect. It was right on line. Unfortunately the putt just stayed a little high. 

 Q. Does this course play to your strengths? 
 ADAM SCOTT: I'm not sure. Yeah, you get to hit the driver a lot, and I think that's the strength of my game is driving it. You get to pull that out a fair bit, so that's good for me. 
 You know, and I like it when it firms up. It's tough to get the ball close when the greens are firm, and that requires good ball-striking. So I guess it does a little bit. It's a demanding course when it plays hard. 

 Q. Does your victory here seem like a long time ago?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it does. I mean, it was a long time ago, seven years.

 Q. How have you changed since then?
 ADAM SCOTT: How have I changed? 

 Q. Yeah. 
 ADAM SCOTT: I've got a lot more gray hairs.

 Q. Come on. 
 ADAM SCOTT: I'm dead serious. You just evolve as a person and a golfer, I guess. I'm 30 years old, so I'm not the kid I was back then. 

 Q. What was that like winning here? I think you were a sponsor invite. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I was. It was a thrill. I don't know, everything fell into place that week. I know I shot 80 the round before in Akron before coming here and then managed to shoot 20-under or something to win here. Bizarre game. But it was a great week, and I don't know, it all seemed so easy. I had a two-shot lead and then a three-shot lead and then won by four. It was a good field. I don't know how that happened. Maybe I should sit back and think about how that happened.

 Q. Maybe watch tape of it or something? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, that would be good. I was obviously feeling it that week.

 Q. Can you carry over any of those vibes? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I like going back to places where I've had success, absolutely, and whether the course is different or not, it's still the same area and the same people that come out. It's nice to be here and have them remember that I won here once.
