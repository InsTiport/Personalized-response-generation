Q. Adam, a stellar round today, 5 under, and you finished with an eagle.  How is it to have come out on a high note like that?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, it was nice to finish birdie, eagle.  I played such a great round today and kind of left everything out there.  But it all came in a hurry at the last two holes.  It's a nice way to finish the year.
Unfortunately, I wasn't up there contending this week.  That's disappointing because I started in such great position in the FEDEX, but lots of positives to take from this year, and lots of good ideas to work on the next year.  Hopefully, a little rest before some more golf the rest of this year.
Q. Yeah, what do you do in the off-season?  You had, like you said, a great season, back-to-back wins.  How do you unwind and take it easy?  Do you put the clubs down for good?
ADAM SCOTT: No.  I'm actually playing six of the next ten weeks.  So I'll be quite busy around the world.  Then I'll take a break from December through until mid to end February, and I'll start back up at the end of the West Coast.
You've got to put the clubs down for a little bit, but you also can't lose that touch.  Everyone will be playing and getting better and better, and that's my idea too.
