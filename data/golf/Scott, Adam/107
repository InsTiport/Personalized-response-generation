 Q.  Maybe not quite where you want to be but still a nice finish.  
ADAM SCOTT: Bad start today but a good finish.  Hopefully all my good golf is in the last three rounds this week.  I'm going to have to shoot really low scores.  But I felt my swing really falling into a nice spot.  If I can get a few putts to drop, I feel like I can get back in this thing.   
 Q.  Were you struggling with any part of your game today?  
ADAM SCOTT: I hit a few bad shots in the round and made some bogeys unfortunately.  It's really good scoring conditions, so that was costly.  Just didn't quite make any long putts today.  I made the short ones but not the long ones.   
 Q.  So 2-under, are you going to go very aggressive tomorrow onwards?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think you have to play aggressive.  I need a really low round tomorrow and get up near double digits under par, and try and get back in this thing.   
 Q.  2016 is coming to a close now.  What would you say is the highlight of the year for you?  
ADAM SCOTT: For sure, winning two events in a row on the PGA TOUR was a real highlight for me, part of my highlight for my career.  It's hard to win on the TOUR, let alone win two weeks in a row, so that was a good run.  I played lots of good golf.  Hopefully I can keep doing that and get a little better next year.
