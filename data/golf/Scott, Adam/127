Q. It's obviously frustrating for you.  There were some encouraging signs there for you?
ADAM SCOTT: I played fine.  I finished par par par, but just didn't beat the guy that I'm playing today.  You have got to close it out like you're trying to win a tournament and that wasn't good enough today.
Q. Did you see anything that went on earlier?  Did you watch any matches?
ADAM SCOTT: I didn't.  Look, it's really hard coming in here with one practice round to know the course and that's what cost me at the end.
I hit it in a spot on 16 that you just can't hit it.  Massive error.  In command of the match, to let him off so easily there was a big error for my part.  Probably a lot of guys did.
It all counts for something, even the chip here.  Just having not hit it and not understanding how severe that part of the green is.
Q. You played that course in Arizona at Dove Mountain.  These greens don't look as severe, but they are?
ADAM SCOTT: They are very severe.  They are as severe as Dove Mountain.  It's just a shortened kind of all confined course.  Knowledge is handy, for sure.  I look forward to having another crack tomorrow.
