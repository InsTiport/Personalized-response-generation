 Q. Obviously not what you're looking for, that start, just not quite on today?  
ADAM SCOTT: No, it's definitely not on, with my iron play certainly. Right from the first hole I didn't quite come out on my line. On the back foot from the get‑go. Nothing unusual coming here, but it was tough. I just didn't really hit it solid enough into the greens and I left myself grinding for par even when I was putting for birdie.   
   
 Q. Seemed that your birdie chances were relatively long?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yes, when I got it in close I made some putts, and I even made a really great putt for par on 10. But I just couldn't get it in there. I just didn't hit it well enough and it's easy to misjudge a couple with the wind. And all of a sudden you really limit your birdie chances. Even the par‑5s, I feel it's a par or more. I feel even in tough conditions I was 2‑up out there. And if I came in 2‑over, you kind of limit the damage tomorrow.   
But I've got a tough day tomorrow. I'm going to try to get it back to even par and then have a great weekend.  
   
 Q. Basically hot foot it from the start, try to put 3‑under for the front nine and see what happens?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, that would be a dream scenario, wouldn't it? As long as Im under par through nine, Ive got an opportunity on the back nine, playing good golf. But some guys got off with flyers today, go out and start 3, 3, 3 with a little luck. And if that's the case then that's right where you want to be.  
   
 Q. Can you explain to me what was happening on eight green?  
ADAM SCOTT: Well, there was unusual damage on my line, and I wanted it fixed. And they didn't really know the rule.  
   
 Q. They didnt allow you to fix it in the end?  
ADAM SCOTT: I was allowed to move my ball away from it, which seems kind of bizarre.  
   
 Q. You were on the eighth green when Ernie was on the first, did you realize what was happening?  
ADAM SCOTT: I don't know what happened.  
   
 Q. He 7 putted from two feet.   
ADAM SCOTT: Oh.  
   
 Q. The winds were changing at different times in different places?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it played difficult. It would swirl around and it's very hard to know exactly what's going on, especially around 11, 12, 13, that kind of area, 15, 16‑‑ I mean it's not even standing on 18. It's blowing hard straight down when I'm picking a club on 18. Then I let Brooks hit and he looked over and now it's blowing hard, and it makes such a big difference.   
You have to be paying attention. Just like on 14 when I stood over it it was hard, straight down. And by the time my ball was up in the air it was kind of more quartering across. So my ball drifts ten yards in the air and then catches the slope and I'm 75 feet away, with an okay shot. Not my best shot for sure.   
But that's the challenge of this place, you've got to really be on point. And I didn't think I played that poorly today, but I wasn't really sharp. I just never really created any opportunities. The guys that are playing really well, they can still create because you hit it in the slope and you can work it, even though the wind is up.   
   
 Q. Do you get frustrated when you're not quite on?  
ADAM SCOTT: No, no, I mean I'm super patient. It's a long week. I was trying hard to try and find a couple coming in, but it just wasn't there for me. Now I need to find a couple on each side tomorrow and I'll be in good shape, I think, because I find it hard to believe that if it's windy like this the first three days that the leader will shoot three top rounds. If he does, then fair play. But at some point it's going to catch up with everyone. It will even out over 54 or 72 holes.  
   
 Q. What happened on 12?  
ADAM SCOTT: I just hit a beautiful shot and it was like the wind just stopped. I made a really good bogey out of a lovely bunker shot. The momentum wasn't going my way. And then that falls down seven feet from the hole and you knock it in uneven, and then maybe birdie one of the pars coming in and then I shoot under par, such fine lines.   
And that's why these majors are the best test, because you've got to be sharp. It's very hard to play just off and be right there. I just need to come out tomorrow with the full belief that I'm just going to stripe it right down the line with my iron play.
