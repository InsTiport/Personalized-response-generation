Q.   You had the good bunker shot on 9.   On 14 you holed a club off the green.   Anything else that‑‑
ADAM SCOTT:   I just played a little more solid and hit a couple closer to give myself‑‑ I had a lot of chances, really.   I have every day, there were just a couple of holes each day where I was a bit squirrelly like 17 yesterday, where I hit it in the water.   Today was a little more solid, but everything felt good. 

Q.   Do you dare to dream of a low one tomorrow?
ADAM SCOTT:   Oh, I'd love to have a low one tomorrow.   I don't think it's a dream.   I mean, winning might be a dream.   I think the course is soft, so you never know.   Depends on what they finish and if they play with pressure and I win.   We've seen it happen before.

Q.   Did you see a 63 on the scores today? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I mean, wing it a little bit and you might be able to see it.   It's a tough track because any errors are punished severely here.   It's slightly softer today.   If you're hitting from the fairway you can attack a lot of pins and score.
