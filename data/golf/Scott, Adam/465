Q.
Make a couple comments on your round today?
ADAM SCOTT:  My iron play was really good today.  I hit a lot of shots five feet and in and took a lot of pressure off my putting.  Yeah, it was just really dialed in with the irons.  I hit a lot of fairways.  It was really good.
Q.  How was the course playing?  Was it playing that easy?
ADAM SCOTT:  Not if you don't hit the fairway.  I think the rough is quite severe.  I think I missed my first fairway of the day, which was the 10th hole, and had to chip out and made a bogey right at the start.  I didn't see it for the rest of the day, but I'm presuming it's pretty thick all around.
Q.  Did you feel a round like this coming earlier in the week?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I played really well last weekend at Medinah.  I had it 7 under through 15 on Sunday there and unfortunately bogeyed two coming in.

But it was just something to keep the good vibes going from there and carry over here.  Once I got settled into the round a little today, I knew I was swinging well enough and just waited, and the good shots came and rolled in a couple nice putts, as well.
Q.  How does it feel to be leading?  Got to feel pretty good about that, best of the best?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I mean, it's one of our best events of the year, and World Golf Championship is an event you try and peak for.  You know, it's important for me to keep this going now for the rest of the week and get right in it and give myself a chance Sunday.
