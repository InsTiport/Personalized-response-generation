  Q. Any round with no bogeys is good; how good was that one?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It was a very solid round. You know, I wasn't in any trouble really. So I would say it probably could have been a couple better. But I'm pretty happy with that. Just still getting used to the greens.   
  
  Q. Tell us about the course, obviously a new one for the players?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting one. Just kind of plod your way around in between the bunkers, avoiding them. They are quite deep and probably leave you some blind shots.   
 But you kind of plod your way around, and also on the greens, they have some sections and you can use the slopes to help you a little bit. But I think it's really for everyone just getting used to the greens.   
  
  Q. You've had a horrible year, 17th to 62nd in the World Ranking, but it looks like it's turning, third and sixth in your last two starts. What's changed?   
 ADAM SCOTT: I've just been working on some stuff that's finally settling in, and my ball-striking is really solid, my putting is getting better. You know, it's all felt very uncomfortable for a while, but it's finally settling in.
