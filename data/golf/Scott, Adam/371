 Q. (No microphone.)
 ADAM SCOTT: It is when you putt like a moron out there. That's the worst putting display of my life today. 

 Q. What went well?
 ADAM SCOTT: I hit the ball great. It's hard to have a good score out there putting like that. Four 3-putts, that's just ridiculous. And I missed every other putting opportunity I had. So it's a frustrating day. It's a shame to play good and then putt like that. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ADAM SCOTT: No, but just coming from a long way behind now starting the weekend, I mean I have to have a good round tomorrow to have a chance. I'm not out of it, but it means I have to play great for two days and I don't have any shots up my sleeve anymore. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 ADAM SCOTT: No, I was steady the whole way around. I just 3-putted three times on the back. That's just annoying. But that's what these greens will do. Confidence is shot, that's what happens when you have a few too many putts out there. 

 Q. What happened on the drive on 13?
 ADAM SCOTT: I just pulled it. 

 Q. Was it in an azalea bush?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah. You managed to pick my one bad shot there, didn't you. 

 Q. I'm sorry, but I was going to get in and say I followed you on the front nine and you seemed to have the ball on a string there for awhile. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Oh, yeah, that's how I played for two days. I barely missed, I shot 3-over the back nine, missing three greens. And I hit most on the front. So it's very frustrating. 
 It's so annoying because you make an error like I did on the last and you just already paid the price from poor putting before, it just feels like I just have to go out and play perfect to have a good score and that's not a very fun way to play. 

 Q. Can you look on the bright side of things and think if you can get the putter going you still have a chance the way you're hitting it?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think I am. I just have to turn it around. Like I said, I don't think I have to do anything crazy over the weekend, because I think it's going to play harder and harder. 
 But you just can't throw shots away and I need to be making the putts from 10 feet and in and I just stood there and missed all day. It's so annoying. But it's a work in progress.
