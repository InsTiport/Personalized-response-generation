 Q.  Adam, 67 TODAY. Talk about the round.  
ADAM SCOTT: Did it again today. Really didn't do much wrong and left a few out there again. So, overall, it's good. You know, if I can keep it really tight next week I feel like I've got a chance.   
 Q.  The last question, Presidents Cup team finalizes today. Talk about how excited you are for that team and the young guys on, veterans and you guys.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, definitely some new faces, for sure. I mean maybe the start of young blood. I might be the last old blood on the team, get rid of me soon, too.   
Happy to see some young guys playing really good. You can really see they want to make the team and Ernie, he's definitely bringing some good energy towards these young players who are going to be in Melbourne.
