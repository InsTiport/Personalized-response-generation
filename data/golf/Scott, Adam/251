  ADAM SCOTT:   There are a few others that would have been nice to see go in, but the good thing is I'm rolling it well, so as long as I keep the pace in check, I feel good for the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   Talk a little bit about the difficulty of the golf course because I thought there was a difficult wind out there.   
    ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it picked up probably after about five or six holes, and it really got your attention.   Yeah, a little tricky.   It's tough to really judge it.   You're teeing off in amongst the trees and then hitting out to these open areas that are really getting affected, so you've got to keep your wits about you.   
   
 Q.   4‑under today, just kind of talk about the day.   
    ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I played really, really well on the front nine and burned a few edges, could have been better.   But set me up for a good round, and I managed to hang on as the wind picked up, and 4‑under around here today is a good start.   Something to build on for the rest of the week.   
   
 Q.   Is anything going to change going into tomorrow?  
    ADAM SCOTT:   I think the temperature is going to change going into tomorrow, but that's fine.   That could be fun playing out here.   As long as the wind stays up, this course is going to provide a challenge, and I think you're going to have to be playing sharp golf in order to shoot good scores.  
   
 Q.   How much is that win at the Barclays carrying you into these weeks?  
    ADAM SCOTT:   Well, it's very handy.   That's a good one to win, for sure.   I didn't really use that momentum in Boston, but I need to pick it up here and have a big run these next two weeks and give myself the best chance of a look at winning the whole thing in Atlanta.
