 Q.  What was the difference, a 64 today compared to other days?  
ADAM SCOTT: You mean yesterday or -- I don't really know.  I just played and started hitting a few good shots, and then made the turn in 4-under and kept hitting good shots.  And then I made a couple putts and all of a sudden I was having a really great round.  Managed to get it in with 64.  It's just a wonderful game, golf.   
 Q.  Another example of how silly it is, isn't it.  
ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely.  I couldn't do anything right; nothing felt good at all yesterday.  I felt hopeless out there.  And today, I just tried to salvage something and it was one of my great round this year.   
 Q.  When you feel hopeless out there, you came off the course, you were smiling, but I imagine that was more rueful than anything.  Do you go away and work?  
ADAM SCOTT: No, it's too late in the season for work.  It's one of those things, I'd be really gutted if it was April and that kind of thing happened.  But it's late in the year and I think we're all kind of getting to the end of our tethers for good and bad play.  You kind of either have it or you don't at this point.   
 Q.  Does that mean you free-wheel it in the third round with no expectation?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yes and no.  I wanted to make sure that I was not going to compound poor play and affect my confidence, so of course you're going out there trying every day.  But there's a chance to free wheel a little bit when nothing really matters, but it can also get away from you, too, if you're not careful.   
I'm very pleased with 64 obviously.  One more would be fun.   
 Q.  Absolutely it would be fun.  I appreciate you're not knocking on the door of the leaders at the moment, but could be a tidy finish.  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think it would be amazing to finish in the Top-10 with an 80 in there.  That would be fun.
