Q.   I guess you're on your way to a hot weekend. 
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, going to have to be really hot tomorrow, but it was a good round out there.   Anything in the 60s is a good score around here no matter what the conditions are.   There's always plenty of trouble.   The game is sharpening up to where I want it to be, so I'm happy about that so far.

Q.   You're progressively getting better and that was the plan after the first round, obviously, and you have to continue that role on throughout, I guess?
ADAM SCOTT:   It'll be nice to play another solid round tomorrow, kind of nearly bogey free today, just dropped that one on the last, and that's good golf around here, and also good to get those rounds in before a major next week where dropped shots are so costly.

Q.   Do you ever scoreboard watch and think it would be a great tournament if Tiger won?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.   I hadn't thought of anything but just trying to get it in the hole here because ‑‑ although Tiger is kind of running away with it. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT:   There is, but every credit to him.   That score is out there for anyone else who can play good enough, and no one has this week.   You never know, someone might throw a low one out there tomorrow.

Q.   Do you think when he's on a roll like this you guys maybe are less intimidated than back in the old days? 
ADAM SCOTT:   Well, I think times have changed since then, but an eight‑shot lead or whatever he's got is still an eight‑shot lead.   That's tough to catch.   He's obviously got his game very much under control around here. 

Q.   Do you feel as though you've tied up any loose ends for next week, swing‑wise?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, absolutely.   I think I've done what I needed to do the last couple days.   I'm going to go and hit some more balls tonight and keep the good feelings.   I've been driving it a little better since Thursday, and I feel it's getting to where I would like it to be.   I think by next Thursday I can be really sharp. 

Q.   How does the PGA Championship course suit your game, the way they set it up?
ADAM SCOTT:   Generally they do a very fair job of setting it up.   I think it's always demanding.   The rough is long and has been long over the last seven years probably, but they never really push it to where the greens get out of hand and that kind of thing, so I think there's still an opportunity where they don't manipulate the golf course too much, they just make it tough.
