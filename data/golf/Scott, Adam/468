Q.
How would you rate that round?
ADAM SCOTT:  Disappointing considering I got off to a quick start and didn't go anywhere from the fifth hole onwards.  So a bit of a shame, but, you know, I played better today I think, a few of my drives went into the first cut of rough which makes it pretty tricky because you get flyers and that's where I got into trouble.

I played better but I need a really, really low round tomorrow.

The course is playing a lot easier today, far, far easier.  I think just hats off, it's a lot harder to get into trouble.
