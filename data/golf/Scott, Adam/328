 Q. Tremendous round today, let's just get your comments. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was a good round. I really turned it around after a slow start and put it all together for the last 12 or 13 holes, I guess. So very pleased with the way I brought it back and got myself in the tournament. 

 Q. How much did you feed off the energy between you and Jason today? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I definitely was. I mean, he was embarrassing me early on in the round, and I turned it and, and we kind of pulled each other through the back nine, really, both competitive, and we both probably want to win desperately this week. It's good to see us both playing well and pulling each other up to the top of the leaderboard.

 Q. You guys have had a lot of conversations about possible pairings at the Presidents Cup. Is there something about your games that match up or is it just a personality thing that you think would work?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think it's all going to work. I think I'd be a good pairing for him. He's really fired up about being on the team and being in the event, and I think with the little bit of experience I have in it, I think I could probably make him feel really comfortable really quick if he didn't straightaway. We'd be a strong pairing. I'd certainly like the chance to play with Jason.
