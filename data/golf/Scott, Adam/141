Q. Your ball-striking was fabulous.
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was great this week.  Tough out there today for lots of reasons.  Wind a little different and tough track and it's Sunday, pressure's on.  But hit some great shots at the right times and squeaked out a win, which it was tough out there today playing against Sergio.  Could have gone either way.
Q. The putts you hit throughout the round, I don't know how many edges you hit, but there were many.
ADAM SCOTT: I hit a lot of great putts again today.  Golf's a game where some days they go in like yesterday and today they just were rolling over the edge but I hit a lot of good ones, but I made some, too.  Yeah, look, I did what I had to do.
Q. How good does it feel to be in the winner's circle?
ADAM SCOTT: It feels good.  It's been a lot of hard work and I feel like I've made a lot of good moves in the last six months and I want to keep it going.
Q. We talked about what it would be like, first time since January 1 -- everybody was talking about the putter.  How do you feel as you reacted to the situation?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, it was pretty good.  I hit a lot of good putts.  Not as many went in as yesterday, but this is a tough track.  It's hard to get it close all the time.  I played exceptional yesterday, so I had to kind of reel in my expectations today, the pressure of Sunday.
I got off to a good start and made one on the first and that definitely relaxed me.  I hit a lot of good putts.  Some didn't go in.  Fortunately it was enough in the end.
Q. How quick of a start, getting that birdie at 1, knowing it was pretty much you and Sergio the entire day, what did that do to you to calm yourself down?
ADAM SCOTT: That's a good feeling to just hit a putt, see it go in the hole.  It's like any round, but maybe more so important at that point.  Got off to a really dream start to kind of set the pace and make sure it was me and Sergio for the whole day.
Things got tough out there at times but that's expected, too.  It's such a tough track and the wind was slightly different today but it was nice to hit some good quality shots coming in.  Luckily for me, it was just enough.
Q. We had a long conversation in the Bahamas at the Hero World Challenge about you being still amongst the young guys, but one of the older of the young guys.  This is your 12th PGA TOUR victory, the most of anybody under the age of 40 on the PGA TOUR.  What does that say about where you are right now with your game?
ADAM SCOTT: Well, my game's come into a really good spot at the back end of last year, and starting out this year, I've been working hard to get it there, because I think it was a bit loose last year.  The consistency wasn't there.  Made some nice progress in all areas, especially obviously noticeably on the greens and paid off this week.
Q. Having a family life at home, how has that transition taken place the last few months to enable you to get to this point?
ADAM SCOTT: It feels very good.  It's only been a great transition, although certainly trying at times, trying to balance everything on and off the golf course.  I've had a lot of things changing over the past 12 months that I think's really settled down now.
It's fantastic to feel like we've really got everything in the family life under control and my wife and daughter, very happy with everything.  We kind of have some idea of what we are doing 12 months in now.  I'm sure everyone knows how that feels.  Just looking forward to many more good years.
