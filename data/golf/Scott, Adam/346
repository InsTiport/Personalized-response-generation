   ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's a good start. I'd love to be in the hunt someday. I enjoyed being in that position at the Masters so much, and that's what I've worked hard every week since, to get myself in this position. So it's a pleasing start.  
  
  Q. If you were to have a chance on Sunday would you be glad to have Steve on the bag?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, absolutely. A lot of experienced caddies, and none more so than Steve in that position over the last 13 years or so. He's been there so many Sundays with Tiger. Like I said, it might just be that one comment at the right time, and he knows to back you off a shot or get you to go on a shot, and it makes a difference.  
  
  Q. Overall was your game good in all departments?  
 ADAM SCOTT: You know, I putted nicely from 10 feet and in today. I ran a few putts past the hole early and made them all coming back, so I putted nicely from in around the hole. Yeah, everything was fairly solid. I was happy with it all.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it was just the wind was starting to switch so much down, that I could pretty much take the bunkers out of play with one bounce, and it was a big target and just got it turning over and into the left rough. That's what happens with a bad swing.
