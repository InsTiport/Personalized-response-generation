 Q.   Winning The Barclays, first round of the FedExCup, how do you feel?  
ADAM SCOTT:   I can't believe it to be honest.   I just played a good round today and I came in and really didn't think it had a chance.   But obviously things went my way a lot out there, and so happy.   
But just quickly, I've got to say, this win is for a new member of my family.   Olivia was born yesterday, so a big shoutâ€‘out to my sister and her husband, Brad, who is actually my coach, too.   I'm thinking of you guys.  
   
 Q.   What a Sunday charge by you.   
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it was a good charge but obviously I got a lot of luck, the guys struggled coming in.   I've been in their position, too.   It's hard getting it done and I was playing from a position of nothing to lose today.  
   
 Q.   How sweet is this one for you coming from six shots back and shooting that 66 in the final round?  
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, it's pretty sweet.   It's a great event to win.   To win the first playoff event really sets you up for a great run and excited about the next few weeks now.   Looking forward to getting into East Lake, hopefully having a chance to be a FedEx Champion.  
   
 Q.   Could you imagine, the way things were going yesterday, that you would be the champ?   Look at you, the champ of The Barclays?  
ADAM SCOTT:   It is, really, like I said, it's unbelievable.   After about 12, 13 holes yesterday, I was playing like a dog, and somehow just managed to grind out a decent score, and it's so important to do that, because you never know what happens in this game.
