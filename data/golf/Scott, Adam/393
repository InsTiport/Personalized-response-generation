   RODDY WILLIAMS: Adam, thanks very much for coming in and joining us, we would like to know, what's the situation with your clubs? Were they lost in transit somewhere?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, apparently they are on their way to Frankfurt at the moment. They got lost in San Francisco. They are expected at 10:30 tonight. I might be in a little bit of trouble, but Titleist, as we speak, are building a backup set in the U.K. which might make a flight in tonight, anyway.   
 So hopefully something arrives.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS: So no practise round for you, but you've been out walking the course today, haven't you?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I've been walking the course and it's in great condition. A little more lush than last year. It's nice to get out there and obviously a lot of nice memories from the last time I went around it.  
 It's great to be back defending, and hopefully keep this run going here in Qatar.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS: What is it about this place that suits you; two wins?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, obviously I played well here, but when I play well, I usually drive the ball well, and I think if you drive the ball well on this golf course, it's a big advantage. It's a fairly lengthy golf course, so maybe a slight advantage there. The tee shots kind of suit my eye and I think I hit a lot of fairways, which gives me a lot of chances. So if I can make some putts, I'll be up there.   
  
  Q. We are hearing this is the strongest ever field for a regular European Tour event but how are your preparations affected by no clubs?  
 ADAM SCOTT: The last couple of years, this tournament has really put together a fantastic field, and I think the better the field gets each year, the more important it is to be coming here to play this event. We all want to play against the best fields in golf. I think that's how we measure ourselves.  
 So, you know, the tournament organisers have done a fantastic job promoting this event and building the event. The word gets around, and people want to come and play.   
 Obviously, I wish I had some clubs to play today, but I've been playing the last couple of weeks, and doesn't really feel like I've not been playing that much. I think I'll be pretty fresh for tomorrow, actually, if I can get a good night's sleep.   
  
  Q. Has that ever happened where the clubs haven't turned up?   
 ADAM SCOTT: No, I've never really been in this situation. I guess they are going to show up and I'll be fine.   
  
  Q. When do you expect your clubs to arrive?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Apparently leaves London at 8:00 tonight, so must get in here early in the morning, that's the new set from Titleist.   
  
  Q. Anything special in the old set?   
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's got a one-off putter that I used last week, actually, that Scotty Cameron made for me, and I like that because it felt really good.   
  
  Q. How did your knee do in Hawaii?  
 ADAM SCOTT: It held up well. It wasn't really good going to Maui, but it got stronger as that week went on, which was pleasing, because it's a very difficult walk around that golf course. It held up well, but it needs more strengthening work and while I'm out here on Tour, I can't really do that and rest and play.   
 So that's why I'm going to take some weeks off after this week.   
  
  Q. How is the knee now?  
 ADAM SCOTT: The knee? It was probably at about 70 per cent. Been a fair bit of muscle wastage from the accident; and then rehabbing it and getting it back to a point where it was good enough to play.   
 It's the same today as it was when I went to Maui. We haven't been able to get it any stronger.   
  
  Q. You must be hoping for a New Year that's injury free?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, for sure, looking to put 2008 behind me. I'm going to take a few weeks to get my knee right and have the rest of the season at 100 per cent.   
  
  Q. With The Race to Dubai we see other golfers such as Boo Weekley, Brandt, Aaron Baddeley all joining the Tour which miust be a good thing for the European Tour?  
 ADAM SCOTT: I think so, yeah, definitely. This is the impact that they wanted to have on the golfers. I think a lot of people are understanding what a global game it is now, and what's happened here in the Middle East over the last few years. You just have to look at this week, the strength of the field. Last year it was a really strong field and this year it's even stronger again.   
 This is a destination where as a professional golfer, you need to be playing now. The Race to Dubai kind of sums that all up.   
  
  Q. Just how good was that final round here last year?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, it was pretty good. There's only one other round of golf that I can compare it with. There was a round in America at Muirfield Village that I shot 62, which was 10-under, at Jack's tournament on a very difficult golf course. That's the only other round I can compare it with, but 61 in the last round is always pretty special.   
  
  Q. Should win every time?  
 ADAM SCOTT: You'd think so, although I shot 62 in the Honda Classic on Sunday and only moved up five spots, from 62nd to about 57th.   
  
  Q. Your year is obviously focused on the Majors again?  
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, yeah, there is a focus on the majors, but I'm kind of preparing myself so that I'm just ready to play every week and treat every week as the same, put the same effort and preparation into every week; and therefore, get the most out of my game at a major.   
 You know, trying not to treat it differently. I just want to be prepared the best I can every week I play this year, and that goes into fitness and mental training and practise on weeks off and just being ready to go when I get here. I think if I do all of the right preparation and be where I want to be, I think the results will come so I don't -- so I'm not preparing just for a major.   
 RODDY WILLIAMS: Thank you very much.
