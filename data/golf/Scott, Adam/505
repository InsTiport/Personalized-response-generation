Q.
Talk about your round, no mistakes?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I think it was 16 greens.  I had a lot of chances.  I had one good save on the second hole, which felt like a couple of days ago.  But I think, you know, I need to keep hitting that amount of greens and hopefully get some touch going with the putter and I'll be fine.
Q.  Adam, a lot of people pay attention to 17.  Flashing back all the way to last year and to 18 and what happened to you on the 72nd hole, how does that, if at all, play through your mind when you play 18 now?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, today was the first time I've played the fairway since last year, so I couldn't help think I should try to not pull this one in the water.  Fortunately I hit a pretty good shot on the green there.  I'm glad that's over now.  The course is so soft 17 is really not much of an issue.  But that becomes tough when it's windy and the greens are hard.  Hitting a wedge on to that really shouldn't be a problem for all of us.  But 18 is a tough hole because it's just    left is totally dead and right is pretty dead as well.  You're not going to be hitting it on the green out of the right rough.  It's a very difficult hole, and I think a couple of guys have found that already this week.
Q.  You were saying the other day you weren't quite 100 percent happy with your swing.  How was it today?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was a little better today, but still    it's a bit manufactured, it's not just step up to it and hit it.

I'm working pretty hard on the swing, although I did hit some nice shots today and I felt a lot more in control of my swing.  I'd like to see myself loosen up a little bit with my putter.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
ADAM SCOTT:  I hit 16 greens and I only made four of them.  It was a little frustrating.  I had a chance to get a couple closer and that would have been a nice position to be in for me, anyway, going into the last two rounds.
Q.  You've put yourself in position to do something that some of the game's greatest have never done and repeat here.  Can you talk about where you stand right now?  How much extra motivation does that give you to do something that's never been done before.
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, I'm just trying to win a tournament.  I've put myself in good position and this is just any other week for me now.  It just so happens I won it last year.  There's so much golf to go and some crazy weather coming in, I guess.  You don't really know what's going to happen.  But there's still 36 holes in the tournament left for me.  It's a long way off.  A lot of things can change.  I'm just looking to keep building on this score.  If I keep having these bogey free rounds, I'm sure I'll be in good position come Tuesday.
Q.  Playing these first two rounds as a defending champion, is there a certain amount of confidence when you step up to shots knowing you've been successful on this course before?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yes and no.  Yeah, I do feel I put a lot of pressure on myself Thursday to, okay, you know you want to put in a respectable performance this week.  So I feel like I've done that already.  But the course is playing so different this year, and I've never really seen it play this way before.  So it's hard to know, well, I've had this shot.  Well, I have, but the ball is responding on the green a lot different, it's backing up instead of jumping out.  But I think no matter what course you've played well at you always draw on that and take some confidence out of it.
Q.  I guess the crowds that have been here through the rain, how have they been reacting towards you, have you gotten a good reaction?
ADAM SCOTT:  Oh, absolutely.  I've enjoyed what they've had to say out there, and it's nice to get a little support.  And that's always handy, no matter where you are.
Q.  When you're saying your swing is kind of manufactured, are you taking as many risks or trying to cut back and not gamble as much?
ADAM SCOTT:  I don't think I'm gambling that much, but I don't think I'm at a point in the tournament where I need to.  That's why I'd like to get a bit better feeling come the next couple of rounds, because I may need to take a gamble and pull something off.  So hopefully it falls into place, but so far it's been pretty steady.  You've got to be careful, otherwise a hole like 18 will just jump up and grab you.  And that can really put a hook to a good round quickly.
