Q.   How hard did you grind down the stretch?
ADAM SCOTT:   I was grinding hard, unfortunately.   I bit off more than I could chew at 16 and made a bad mental error.   It wasn't really going my way out there with much today.   I was grinding all day to be honest. 
17 was a great way to hang in there and make a 4 out of nowhere really and give myself a chance to have a good round tomorrow and maybe post a number.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
ADAM SCOTT:   It's not quite as good as I would like to be.   I would like to be leading.   Four back is well within reach. 
Mickelson ended up winning the Open by quite easily being four back.   Anything can happen in a major.   We just saw the pin spots get tough today and scoring in the final groups was very difficult.   With so much danger around, it's hard to be completely free where major pressure on the line. 
Tomorrow is going to be similar.   If I get off to a good start, I feel like my game is in good enough shape where I can carry that through and shoot a number.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
ADAM SCOTT:   No.   You've got to build yourself up to stand there and know that this is maybe your last shot at this tournament.   It can all slip away. 
18 is no pushover.   You hit a bad drive down there and bogey staring you right in the face.   You have got to stand there and hit the putt like it is the last one to win the tournament.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
ADAM SCOTT:   I think so.   I mean, look, hopefully I just go out there and find a little better rhythm with my swing tomorrow than I had today.   I was just a little off didn't quite hit it straight down my lines as I would have liked.   It's hard to do that fourdays in a row in a major.   Hopefully today was my day off and come back out tomorrow really sharp.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
ADAM SCOTT:   Yeah, that's why 16 is disappointing because that is what I'm doing.   I'm just hanging around.   I'm not really doing anything out there.   To lose a couple hurts. 
There was some tough shadows and the greens were getting a little bumpy coming into the day and that is because of all the rain we've had.   Just not quite as smooth as we would all hope.   You have just got to stand up andhit the best putt you can every time.   I have got to hit more good ones.

Q.   Are you feeling any pressure to win your second major?
ADAM SCOTT:   It will be only from myself.   I don't think there is any pressure on me going into tomorrow at all.   It's a different story if you are leading or close to it. 
Tomorrow, you know, like I said, I would like to have a nice bit of rhythm and be able to open up out there and free will I.
