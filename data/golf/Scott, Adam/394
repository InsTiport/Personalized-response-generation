   ADAM SCOTT: I'm fairly pleased with the way I played. I think probably couldn't have been that much better. It could have been a little bit worse maybe, so that's encouraging to get the most out of a round. Like to hit it a little better, but it was quite hard to pick lines today. The visibility was poor, and wasn't easy to feel your way around the golf course. 

 Q. But this is in the context of having some time off and away, so all the better, presumably? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I'm very happy. I have to say, you know, I've done a little bit of work the last couple of weeks in getting prepared for here, and at least that's on the right track. 
 So something to build from, for sure.

 Q. I take it this is a good tournament to start off a year, isn't it, because it's prestigious, all of the people are here, lovely money at the end of it?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it's a great event. They have put together a hell of a field this year, and it's the event you want to be in right now.

 Q. What are your thoughts on The Race to Dubai?
 ADAM SCOTT: I think it's a good initiative from the Tour. And I think it gives just something a little more to the tour. Obviously the U.S. has tried to do it with the FedEx, and I don't know how successful that's been yet, so we'll see how The Race to Dubai goes. 
 But certainly a positive step. It's put a great event in at the end of the season next year. Who is not going to want to be playing the Dubai World Championship? 

 Q. Is it just an Order of Merit under a different name, or is there added excitement because of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, if you like?
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, I think everybody is excited to get a little added bonus at the end of the year for their performance. Seems like it's different from the FedExCup because it's a straight peformance-based thing over the year. But I think it's a good move and I like it. Always been involved in Europe and will continue to be hopefully.

 Q. Will we see a bit more of you now?
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, hopefully, this time of year and the start of next year, definitely. But the schedule, I just go with how I feel on the schedule. There are certainly some events that I'm looking forward to playing, yeah.
