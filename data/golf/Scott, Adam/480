ADAM SCOTT:  There was nothing wrong with my game--it was just that I didn't make enough putts to push on the way I had hoped. I made heaps of chances - probably even more than I had in shooting 64 yesterday - but hardly made any, and the back-to-back bogeys didn't help either. It wasn't that I hit bad putts - I just tended to mis-read too many. It was one of these days.

The main thing is that I am still around for the weekend and still in a pretty good position all things considered. I just need to hole a few tomorrow to get myself right in contention.
