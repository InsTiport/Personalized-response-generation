TODD BUDNICK:  First round, 7-under, 65, clubhouse leader right now.  Coming off three top-10's, it's a continuation of your good play this year.
ADAM SCOTT:  I've really turned my game around a little bit.  Not just this year, but from the second half last year, I played pretty solid.  And it's just been steadily improving since then.  So that's what I've said for the last year or so, I want to be more consistent playing.
TODD BUDNICK:  You finished T17 last year, so you're fairly comfortable with this course, as well?
ADAM SCOTT:  Definitely.  I played nicely last year.  I was late on Saturday, and I didn't play great on Saturday.  But I got a feel for some of the atmosphere late on Saturday at play.  There were so many people around and pumped up about 17, so I got to experience that, so hopefully I might need that later next week.
Q.  Most of the players said greens very hard, fast, rough high.  How does someone shoot 7 under?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was a perfect morning this morning.  And they put a little water on the greens just to keep them wet.  By the end of the day they'll be alive and kicking.  This morning they were perfect.  It was just a little bit of moisture, so the ball will stop if you hit a good shot.  I took advantage of that this morning.
Q.  Just one bogey today, so your all-around game was pretty good?
ADAM SCOTT:  It was all pretty good.  I had three greens I missed on the back nine, but I managed to get two saves out of it.  So it was a pretty solid round, overall.  I'll take that.
Q.  How important is it to get the 7-under today?
ADAM SCOTT:   Any morning tee time that you've got in the first two days, it's always good to take advantage of it.  Usually the wind starts blowing in the afternoon, so it's tough to go out there tomorrow if you're a couple over after the morning and battle it in the wind all day.  So I've given myself a little bit of a comfortable position to be in for tomorrow, but it's a nice start.  And it's important to take advantage of the good conditions when you're off in the morning.
Q.  Everyone kind of labels you the next great.  Is that extra pressure any more than you put on yourself?
ADAM SCOTT:  No, it's not any more than I put on myself.  I've kind of got a plan of where I want to go, and obviously I want to get there as fast as I can.  But I'm a pretty patient person.  I'm seeing my game improve.  As long as that keeps happening, I keep moving up, you're going to win some good events and become a great player.
Q.  What is that plan?  You said you know where you want to go.  Where does it take you?
ADAM SCOTT:  Well, you want to become a major champion and No. 1 in the world.  I think Tiger has pretty got that No. 1 spot locked down right now.  I'm climbing up there, but for me right now, looking at a top-10 in the world and trying to get myself with a chance to win these big events, THE PLAYERS, the Majors, THE TOUR Championship, that kind of thing, the World Golf events, that's where I want to see myself playing under that kind of pressure, and then you really see how good you are.
Q.  What do you attribute your better play to?
ADAM SCOTT:  Lately?  You know, I've worked on my game a lot.  My swing is better than it's ever been, I think.  I think I'm getting it in really good position, and it feels really natural.  So that takes a lot of pressure off your game when you know you're going to get up there and hit it down the fairway and hit most of the greens.  I've been pretty solid in greens this year, and it just lets you play a little more freely.
TODD BUDNICK:  Let's go through the birdies.
ADAM SCOTT:  No. 2 was driver and a 4-iron, chipped it on there to about 30 feet and made it.

No. 4 was a 3-wood, sand wedge about four feet.

No. 7 was a driver, 9-iron about four feet.

No. 8 was a 4-iron to three feet.

No. 9 was a drive in the rough, 6-iron layup and 9-iron to six feet.

12, that was 3-wood, sand wedge, probably a 30-footer there.

Bogey, drive and a wedge in the bunker, out of the bunker, two putts.

16, driver, 5-iron, two putts.

18, 3-wood, 9-iron to about three feet.
Q.  Has this been building up?  I think you led Bay Hill last week in greens in regulation, this kind of play?
ADAM SCOTT:  Yeah, I've seen -- in Sony open in Hawaii I played probably the worst I have in about six or seven months.  And I think it was a good time to do it and realize I need to knuckle down and get things sorted out for the start of the new year.
Q.  What happened at Sony?
ADAM SCOTT:  I was just swinging the club terribly.  It was long, it was loose, it was not in time, no rhythm, and I made it a struggle, obviously.  So I had a week off and I thought about the swing a lot and spoke with Butch about it and went and

worked -- practiced a lot harder.  And over the next month or so I started to see it fall into place.  I thought I was swinging it really well at the Match Play and I just didn't quite take it on the course with me, but the two weeks off after that I got into the groove a little more.
Q.  Where do you work when you work, in Las Vegas with Butch?
ADAM SCOTT:  I was there just before the Match Play, yeah.  That's the only time I've been there this year.  I've been everywhere already, in Australia, in London, Vegas so far this year.
