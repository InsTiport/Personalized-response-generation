Q.
Talk about your match.  

ADAM SCOTT:  It was a tough match because I just lost it a little bit about the driver there on the back nine and I only hit three fairways for the day, so that was hard work.  But I hit a good shot into that last hole to close it out and not worry about hitting another driver. 

Q.
Was there any time or point in the match where you felt like you turned it around or felt more comfortable out there? 

ADAM SCOTT:  No, I really felt less comfortable the longer the match went on because I was three up after 8 and I couldn't win a hole and it didn't look like winning holes, either, I was just hanging in there.  So to finish it off was nice, before the last. 

Q.
Do you play Allenby? 

ADAM SCOTT:  Yes, Robert, tomorrow.  That will be a tough match for sure. 

Q.
Have you ever played him before? 

ADAM SCOTT:  Not in match play, no.  He hits the ball a long way and the course is wet, so it could be a bit of a slug fest for us tomorrow. 

Q.
Thank you.  Good playing.
