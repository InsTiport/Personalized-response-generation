  ADAM SCOTT: Overall it was good. Under par around here I think is a good start. I was in a position to have a really good score and just dropped a couple coming in.
 Overall it's good. I think it's something I can build on for this week. 

 Q. Keys to this week? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Just maybe that you just don't have to play perfect golf to have a good score. I wasn't perfect by any stretch of the means out there. It wasn't bad, though. But just managed myself nicely around the course. 
 So if I can start hitting the shots the way I'm seeing them all, then there's potential to have a good score. 

 Q. Does that boost your confidence, posting a low number early? 
 ADAM SCOTT: Well, it's just important. I always feel that it's tough to make up a lot of ground over the weekend, the pressure, and the course plays hard. 
 So to get in the tournament early is important; to be right there from Thursday. I will be leading but I won't be too far back at the end of the day. A good score tomorrow will go a long way.

 Q. The 15th has probably been one of the most talked about. Talk us through it. 
 ADAM SCOTT: I found it quite easy today. It was just a hybrid on the green and I made the putt for two, so I don't know what all the fuss was about really. 
 No, it is, it's not a lot of fun to play that hole. It's 260 yards or. So you've just got to hit a great shot just to get it near the green, but so much trouble left, and right water. It's an intimidating hole for sure.

 Q. You got through the last four holes at 1-under par, how many shots do you think you gained on the field? 
 ADAM SCOTT: I might have picked up a couple on the field probably. They are very tough. I mean, you know, I'd like to do that for the next three days, as well. I'd do really well this week then.
