ADAM SCOTT: Let it go on a couple of par-5s that had 5-iron in and made bogey, that's costly around here.  So I think the rest of it was really good other than that.  But you know, I'm going to have to sharpen that up for the weekend.  The rhythm of the swing wasn't quite there today like it was yesterday, so if I can just go out and find that for tomorrow, I like where I'm at.   
 Q.  Does it feel good knowing that you're still in great position even thousand you felt a little confused by your game today?  
ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, it is, of course.  I'm not quite sure why the scoring isn't better.  It just must be tricky out there.  You know, everyone trying to come to terms with a few little changes here and there.  The greens certainly aren't fast.  They're firm, and maybe it was a tough set of pins today.  I don't know, it was just tough to get it close.   
 Q.  If you're coming out of the rough, being able to control the release of the ball on the greens, is that kind of the toughest part out there with the wind kind of kicking up a little?  
ADAM SCOTT: Absolutely.  Out of the rough is not good at all.  I mean, any front pin you really don't have anything.  But just around the greens they're running off a little more, even though it looks like they've given us a little more surface to work with.  Yeah, it's just playing nicely at the moment.  You've just got to play really solid.  You know, this course you have to ball strike it to death to kind of limit the mistakes, and if you hit one off line, it's hard work getting it back on track.
