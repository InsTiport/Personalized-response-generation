 Q. Looks like you beat Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, and got to play in front of your home folks on one of the great courses in the world. 
 ADAM SCOTT: Yeah, look, it's disappointing to maybe not get the Cup this year, but to have this oh vent here at home, it has been a fantastic week and one I'll remember for my whole career. You know, we played hard. 

 Q. Was it harder to play at home because of the pressure or easier to play at home because you were at home? 
 ADAM SCOTT: I think it's just a really demanding golf course. You know, we got 12 great players on our team and 12 great players on their team. No matter how good you are, on this course it's just too hard to hit the ball well to get it around here, and they might have done it just a little bit better than us this week.
