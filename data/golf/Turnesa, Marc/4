   On competing at THE PLAYERS Championship for the first time.  
 MARC TURNESA: It's awesome to be here. I've never played a major and this tournament has as strong a field as any of the majors. I'm excited to play because this is as big a stage as I've ever competed on. I'm really looking forward to it.  
 On following THE PLAYERS over the years and now playing in the event.  
 MARC TURNESA: I watched the tournament every year. The moment that stands out for me the most was Fred Couples' hole-in-one on 17 a few years back. I just love watching the drama coming down the stretch with those last three holes. Those are great holes, in fact there are 18 great holes here, but those three coming down the stretch are really fun to watch.
