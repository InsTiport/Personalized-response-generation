Q.   6â€‘under 66 that is pretty solid going around the South course. 
MARC TURNESA:   Yeah, I was happy with it.   It played about as easy as it could play.   Not much wind, greens are soft and they're rolling perfect.   But nevertheless, 66 is a great score out here.

Q.   Key to the round more than anything is this morning how warm it was when you came up.   You're out hitting balls and probably didn't have to wear a sweater as cold as it's been early morning on the west coast.   That's pretty fun. 
MARC TURNESA:   Yeah, it was different for sure.   I tell you, the trickiest part was because the ball was flying its normal distance today.   In the practice rounds I was taking off 4, 5, 6%.   Then I came out here, and the ball's flying pretty good, so it was nice. 

Q.   It seemed like the greens, the guys were adjusting to the greens on the North course.   No one's getting it to the hole.   Here they were running a little quicker.   Guys were getting it to the hole outside of 20 feet.   Any reason for that, do you think? 
MARC TURNESA:   I don't know about the greens on the North course.   But the greens here are absolutely perfect.   I don't think they've ever been any better.

Q.   Putting green maybe, was the practice putting green any different? 
MARC TURNESA:   Yeah, that might be it.   That practice green, I told my caddie when we were warming up, I said the greens were slow today.   Then we got out here and they weren't slow.   I just made my first four or five putts so I didn't have to watch the ball run by the hole.
