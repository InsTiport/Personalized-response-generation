Q. Did you know that you were tying the lead for the day with that last putt?
DANI HOLMQVIST: Yeah.  I saw the leaderboard, but I was in a good frame of mind.  So just try to hit a good putt and see if it goes in.
Q. You had three birdies to start the day.  What was the key to that fast start?
DANI HOLMQVIST: Just good momentum, and I had some good putts.  I think that was really it.  Just felt solid, but really good frame of mind from the beginning.
Q. Yeah, and all day that lasted?
DANI HOLMQVIST: Yeah.  I think so.  I was really relaxed and had like a good round.
Q. Anything in particular you've been working on recently that's paying off?
DANI HOLMQVIST: Just everything.  For me it's been feeling like my game has been good all year.  I just haven't really been able to put it together.  So it's just nice to see some result of that.
Q. What's the plan for the rest of the day?
DANI HOLMQVIST: I think I'm just going to take it easy, maybe go and see the legends room.  My coach is on one of the statues^  there.  So I might go and see that.  He told me to go look it.  So it will be fun.
Q. Who's your coach?
DANI HOLMQVIST: Mats Sundin.  So it'll be fun.
