An Interview With:
HAROLD VARNER III
Q. You must be psyched about your day.
HAROLD VARNER III: I think I made one bogey, but it was a good plan.  Just played solid and just ready to keep doing that this weekend.
Q. The golf course is obviously vastly different than what it was playing through the first round.  Speak to what the winds are doing out there.
HAROLD VARNER III: It got going there at the end, but I feel like we've been playing in wind every week, so nothing new.  Everyone has got to deal with it.  I don't really know, just my caddie tells me what to do, and I just go hit it.
Q. You did something because you didn't have your best stuff for a little while, but then the T9 last week.  What was the catalyst to the improved play?
HAROLD VARNER III: Well, I just think I'm obviously putting better.  You get out of a few jams when you chip it bad and you hole a few putts you're supposed to hole, it just makes it a lot easier.  I think it's golf, though.  You're going to play bad at some point.  If you respond well, that's what makes a great player, I think.
