Q. Just overall comments, off to a nice start.  Obviously you played pretty well last week, as well?
HAROLD VARNER III: I did.  Just playing solid.  Didn't hit it really well today but managed to get it around.  It's just super hot.  I mean, I'm burning up.  But it's just a cool experience, just trying to take it in.  Obviously the scores are really low.
Q. Anything course condition-wise?  Is it soft out there?
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, super soft.  Especially I guess it rains a lot here.  But still, I mean, you've still got to shoot 8-under -- they are playing pretty good.  So we'll get on it tomorrow and figure it out.
