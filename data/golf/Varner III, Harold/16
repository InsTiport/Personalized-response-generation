Q. We are live here at the Charlotte Country Club with Harold Varner, III.  Harold, tell us why you're out here.
HAROLD VARNER III: Just here just supporting locals; just I play out here a good bit.  It's a pretty cool environment right now.  A lot of support.  It's pretty cool to see.
Q. So what did it mean to see one of your former college teammates doing well in a USGA championship?
HAROLD VARNER III: It was crazy.  You know, obviously I know he's good at golf, but doing it is another thing.  And being so close to home and happen to be here at the same time as much as I travel, so it's really cool.
Bummed that he lost, but he played some great golf.
Q. What's more stressful, match play or stroke play?
HAROLD VARNER III: Match play, because you try your best to play the golf course, but it's hard to when whatever the other player does dictates what you're going to do.
Q. What did you think of Tiger's win last week?
HAROLD VARNER III: I lost my mind.  It's crazy.  Still can't get over it.  Looking forward to see how they play in week in Paris.  Going to be a lot of fun to watch.
Q. How did Tiger influence your golf game?
HAROLD VARNER III: A lot.  I mean, fortunate enough to be able to talk to him here and there.  When I was a kid, that's the reason why I played, that's why I watch golf, and I think right now that's why a lot of kids are really good at golf.
Q. And you played a few practice rounds with him this year, right?
HAROLD VARNER III: I did.  I did.  It was a unique experience.  Always wanted to play with him, but to be able to learn from him -- I think he's the best golfer to ever play.  I love trying to learn from the best.
Q. So what does it mean to qualify for the U.S. Open.  You've done that a few times.
HAROLD VARNER III: It's awesome.  It's just so hard every time.  I just want to qualify for one and play a little bit better.  Shinnecock just beat my head in a few times, but we're going to figure it out one day.
Q. How do you think the winner of this week's championship is going to feel teeing it up at Pebble Beach next year?
HAROLD VARNER III: It's going to be awesome.  I hope I get to join them.  That's the biggest thing for me.  Tomorrow is going to be fun.  It's two guys from North Carolina, one from Charlotte.  It's going to be crazy.
Going to come out and watch a few in the morning and then head out to the greatest place in the world, Greenville, North Carolina.
Q. And you hit the first ball at Shinnecock this year.  Any advice for players who have got those first-ball jitters?
HAROLD VARNER III: I didn't really know anything about it until this year.  I hope you hit a good one, because everyone is out there.
Q. What do you think of Pebble Beach as a U.S. Open venue?
HAROLD VARNER III: I'm excited.  I played the Wal-Mart First Tee there with Morris Snitowsky in 2008.  I haven't been back since.
Q. And you did real well in that, didn't you?
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, Morris did well.  I was supporting cast.  We had a good time.  I'm looking forward to -- man, I just want to be there.
Q. What would it mean for you to play there next year?
HAROLD VARNER III: A lot.  A lot.  Gosh, that would be 11 years.  I want to be there.  That's a special place.
Q. And who is bringing home that Ryder Cup this weekend?
HAROLD VARNER III: America.  Go, U-S-A!
