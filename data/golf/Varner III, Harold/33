 Q.  Always love your attitude, your positive energy out there.  Again, today you felt like you had it going?  
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, yeah, played solid, hit a lot of the greens, it's just kind of tough in a few places because the greens are so fast.  So just want to give yourself putts at it, whether it's 30 footers or 5 footers.   
 Q.  The only blemish on 7.  Three birdies and an eagle.  
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, the eagle was pretty good.  So just playing solid.  Just didn't play well last week, so this course sets up pretty well for me.  You get to hit a lot of drivers and I'm pretty excited for the opportunity obviously going to the South Course tomorrow.   
 Q.  With your length it's usually a huge advantage here, but if you hit it in the rough it's another world.  So finding fairways the key?  
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, I didn't find too many of them today, but it's okay, I'll figure it out.  But at least you're further up there.  But I'm going to work on getting something grooved in.   
 Q.  You've had a pretty good start to your PGA TOUR rookie season and when we saw you when you got your card, I just thought you would be one of those players to watch because you've just got the right attitude.  How are you feeling out here now, first go?  
HAROLD VARNER III: I feel good.  Just good golf's going to take care of everything.  So I just focus on stuff I can control, because there's a lot of other stuff that can get you a little deterred.  But I think I'm doing a pretty good job with it.   
 Q.  What are you going to work on tonight?  
HAROLD VARNER III: Just my putting.  The pace.  I just hit a few by.  It puts a lots of stress on your putter, those five footers on the greens late in the day.  So I want to find the fairway and give myself the best looks possible.
