Q. In those conditions, how impressive was that round you put together?
HAROLD VARNER III: I played really well.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities and just hung in there.  That's all you can do when it's super-windy.  You know, I had a great pairing.  Kisner was a lot of fun.  I like to talk a lot.  He doesn't talk as much, and sometimes for me, I just need to shut up, and it's easy to do when you're playing with him because it feels like competition; sometimes I get out there, and I'm just playing golf.
Q. You played well last week obviously in Greensboro.  Continuing that good form here this week?
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, I don't know what it is about this time of the year, but I play well.  I think the options go down.  All you can do is play well or you go home.  I like home a lot, but not as much as playing golf.  Well, you know, for a lot of money.
Q. Do you relish that kind of competition, when it gets a little harder and you know you need to step up, do you relish that and step up your game a little bit maybe?
HAROLD VARNER III: I would like to say that but I've been having one bad round, you know, last two or three tournaments.  I'm learning.  I'm getting older.  I'm getting wiser.
Just a lot -- you know, the last couple months, I've just been trying to make it be so accountable in myself.  Everyone out here, you have a team, they do this, they do that, but like at the end of the day, you've got to take care of yourself and just looking at myself in the mirror and just knowing that it's going to be all right, something good is going to happen; attitude is everything.  Just been doing that the last few weeks.
So pretty bummed not to have finished off a good tournament the last few weeks, but it's obviously coming together this week and just need to keep that attitude, no matter what the result is.
