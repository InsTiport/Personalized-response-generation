Q. Making his tournament debut. But let's go back 13 years ago. Competitive golf here in the First Tee Program, on the Champions Tour. What are your memories from the success you had in 2007?
HAROLD VARNER III: The only thing I remember is who I played with and I birdied 17. But, yeah, it brought back a lot of memories today being out there. It's crazy how much you don't remember, how fast it goes away. So it was good and I obviously played well and obviously having fun.
Q. Winner 13 years ago with Morris Hatalsky. What was it like the walk around here today? Now you're a PGA TOUR member.
HAROLD VARNER III: It's obviously different. What's weird is I wouldn't go back to being that kid. It's just like, it was just a different, different day and age, I guess. But, yeah, it's just, I wish I could just call Morris and just tell him, This is crazy.
So, yeah, it's a lot of fun. Just want to play well. Got off to a rough start this year and I've been close, making some cuts but just haven't cracked the egg yet. But we're working on it.
Q. What was the difference that allowed you to play well?
HAROLD VARNER III: Just keep working at it. It's not the end of the world. It's just golf. Nobody's going to die out there. Just keep it in perspective. And obviously, I have a lot of perspective from what I had 13 years ago to now. It's never as good as you think it is. It's never as bad as you think it is. So just keep it in between the lines.
