Q. Harold, nice playing today, man.  6-under par, 64.  When you make birdies, you don't mess around.
HAROLD VARNER III: No, I do believe they come in bunches, and just got a good knack for the hole lately.  Just getting back to the basics.  I'm hitting it really well.  It was nice.  I only had to chip it one time today.  I just wanted to give myself a chance with nine holes to go.  That's all I really wanted to do.
Q. Is it just the time of the year for you?  When it heats up, it seems like you do.  Kind of late in the year, late summer?
HAROLD VARNER III: I wish it wasn't that way.  But it is what it is.  I do enjoy playing in the heat.  I think we have a great opportunity these next few tournaments.  Obviously, when your back's against the wall, the best thing you can do is keep swinging.
Q. Has there been a swing change or anything, something that clicked over the last couple weeks that's working?
HAROLD VARNER III: No, ever since THE PLAYERS I've been playing pretty well.  Just sometimes golf happens, missing the cut by one or two.  That's when I think you're closest is when you're not that far off, and I've felt that way.  I think if you have a good attitude, you can turn that into a good week.
Q. Thinking about what's going on for the weekend?  What are your thoughts going out there?  It's a course you're going to have to attack.
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, for sure.  You just can't focus on everyone else.  You can't birdie every hole, so just because someone's birdieing these holes, you've just got to do your job.  Do the stuff you can control.  I think if I make ten birdies, I'll have a good chance.
Q. Are you doing a little calculation there?
HAROLD VARNER III: Yes.
