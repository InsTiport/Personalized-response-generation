Q.   Your first round, what do you think about it? 
HAROLD VARNER III:   Yeah, good start, you can lose it today but you can't win it today.   Just got to keep driving the ball well and I'm putting well.   Just have to play a little bit smarter out there.

Q.   You're a full‑time member of the Web.com Tour, you got a very special exemption here, the Charlie Sifford exemption; how hard was the decision to play?
HAROLD VARNER III:   IT was an easy decision to play, but the guys on the Web.com are good so it would have been a good experience either way but it's always nice to play against the best.

Q.   Anything you can tell us about yourself?
HAROLD VARNER III:   I'm 5‑8 and I have a flat top that that's about it (laughing). 

Q.   This better than what you expected in the first round or did you come in expecting‑‑
HAROLD VARNER III:   Yeah, I felt really comfortable on the range and I had played in the U.S. Open last year, and so I knew what to expect.   Hopefully going to do tomorrow the same thing I did today.

Q.   What was going well for you?
HAROLD VARNER III:   I drove it well and put myself in good spots on the green to make putts.   Just have to do it again.   A lot of uphill putts‑‑ got a little greedy on 8 but it happens.

Q.   Course get more difficult as the week goes on? 
HAROLD VARNER III:   Yeah, it was firmer today.   I was hitting it in places I wasn't hitting it in the practice rounds.   I just need to keep playing.   You're not going to get any better by not playing.
