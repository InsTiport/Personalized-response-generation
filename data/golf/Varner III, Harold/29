Q. 1-over yesterday, but 4-under today.  Was it playing easier this morning?
HAROLD VARNER III: Without a doubt.  The greens were a lot softer.  I was happy to take advantage of it.  I wish I could have made a few more putts, but looking good going into the weekend.
Q. You have had yourself quite the rookie season so far on Tour.  What would it mean to move on to the Playoffs, move on to the Deutsche Bank?
HAROLD VARNER III: It would be awesome.  I always wanted to make it to East Lake, and today got me closer to that.  It's pretty exciting but I'm ready to just play tomorrow, get some rest, chill, watch some movies.  I'm in a house with Smylie and Luke, so it's pretty fun.
Q. Is it fun to have those young guys there with you, all kind of in the same boat?
HAROLD VARNER III: Sometimes.  Until they start playing the piano at like 10:30 at night.  They think they are like rappers.  It's weird.  It's pretty funny, until I'm trying to sweet.
Q. So you have kind of a frat house vibe going on?
HAROLD VARNER III: Yeah, never really thought about it like that.  Not really like a fraternity guy, but feels like it.  I've been in one once or twice.  Not to play golf, though.
