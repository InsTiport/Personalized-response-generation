Q. Another good round.  What was the key to your play?
JEONG EUN LEE: (Through translation.)  My round was bogey-free and on the greens I played well, and so that's why I made a good score today.
Q. You've been playing really good of late.  Is there one thing really working?  Irons?  Putting?  Is there something that's been the key to your strong play the past couple weeks?
JEONG EUN LEE: (Through translation.)  My iron shots were so good from last week.  Some hole I made mistake to make a bogey but I saved par.
