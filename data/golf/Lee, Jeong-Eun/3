(Through translation.)
Q. How does it feel to be playing well back on the LPGA Tour?
JEONG EUN LEE: I played in the Bahamas, and every since then -- this is my second tournament after the Bahamas -- and so this is my first tournament in the United States since I rejoined the LPGA.
I think this course suits my game play pretty well.  I think I'm going to be able to have a good score.
Q. What is working this week?
JEONG EUN LEE: I played really well at 8-under.  I think if my putts dropped a little better it would've been even better.
So my putting on both sides is what worked on my game, and at the same time where I felt like I could have improved.
Q. How did it feel to get full status the LPGA Tour back at Q-School, finishing fifth at Q-School?
JEONG EUN LEE: I got into Q-School this last year on my third try.  I think that made it so much more meaningful and has made me even more determined to play well on these first few tournaments.
