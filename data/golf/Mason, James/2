 Q.   Would you let me know your overall thoughts on how things went for you today.   
JAMES MASON:   I played pretty well, I actually got it back to even par with five or six holes to go and couldn't bring it into the house.   
I hit one wayward drive over there on 14, knocked it in the hazard.   
I just ‑‑ and then bogeyed 17.   
But I played pretty well overall.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on the course now after two days and practicing this week?  
JAMES MASON:   I thought they did a very good setup today.   They gave you some chances, one, to knock it on the par‑4 and moved up a par‑5, and they played a couple of par‑3s fairly short.   
So the greens, they're tough, they're very tough and very penal, but they gave us a good golf course, I think, to play today.  
   
 Q.   What would it mean to you to play this weekend?  
JAMES MASON:   Oh, it would be great.   I should be okay, I would think, but it was, you know, plus 2, almost trending on 3.   So it should be, I'm going to guess, 4 or 5.   That would be my thinking.   I think 3 should make it fairly easy.  
   
 Q.   What's your mentality heading into the weekend?  
JAMES MASON:   Just try and make birdies.   There ain't many of them out there, but I'm going to try to make them.
