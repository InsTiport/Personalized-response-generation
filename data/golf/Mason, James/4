 Q. Thoughts on your round?
 JAMES MASON: I made a lot of birdies, nine birdies and three bogeys. The bogeys I could have done without but I made nine birdies so obviously I putted pretty good.

 Q. And the fans?
 JAMES MASON: They are great. This is one of the best crowds we've had all year and they are very, very gracious.

 Q. You've had a couple great rounds lately, you played well last week. Anything you can attribute it to? 
 JAMES MASON: Driving it in the fairway and putting it in the hole. Easy as that.
