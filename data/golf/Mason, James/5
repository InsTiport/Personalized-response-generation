  Q. Get a couple quick quotes on your round today. I saw the front nine there, birdies on 2, 4 and -- 2, 5 and 6?  
 JAMES MASON: 2, 4, and 5, yeah. And missed a short one on 1 and I had a makeable one on 3. So I got off to a good start and then I gave them all back and then I got them back.  
  
  Q. You got them back on 15 and 16, the two long ones?  
 JAMES MASON: Right. And then made a great four on the last hole.  
  
  Q. Talk about the 68 and what that means going into tomorrow?  
 JAMES MASON: I don't know how it's going to end up, but it's going to put me in shape from what it looks like. I should be in shape, if I can shoot a low round tomorrow, I got a chance to win the Tournament.
