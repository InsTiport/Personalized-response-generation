 Q.   You finished with even par, what are your overall thoughts on the day?  
JAMES MASON:   I made some birdies, but I made too many bogeys.   I hit a couple of pretty good shots I thought and didn't turn out well and I 3‑putted a couple of times.   
   
 Q.   What did you think about the course today?  
JAMES MASON:   The course again is in great shape.   If you don't get the right bounce in some instances, you're going to have a tough time making a par.   
   
 Q.   What is your mentality going into tomorrow only plus 3‑over all?  
JAMES MASON:   Just try to shoot as low as I can.  
   
 Q.   I imagine you've gotten a lot of messages from back home in Georgia from folks today with encouragement.   What are some of those messages and what have they been saying?  
JAMES MASON:   "Nice going on making the cut."   And then, "Try to take it as low as you can."   And that's what we'll try to do.
