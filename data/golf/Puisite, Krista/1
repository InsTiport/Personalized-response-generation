Q. Playing in your first LPGA event.  How does it feel?  What are you looking forward to?
KRISTA PUISITE: I'm pretty nervous, but I will call it excited.  I'm just looking forward to playing as well as I know I can play and then seeing where that leads me to.
Q. Is there anything you've been working on maybe to gear you up for this moment?
KRISTA PUISITE: I've been working on all parts of my game, as always.  Last week I played a Symetra tournament to get in the playing mode more.
So I guess just letting myself play my game and not overthinking the mechanics of it.
Q. Yeah.  Have you got a chance to play the course yet?
KRISTA PUISITE: Yes, I played on Monday and yesterday.
Q. How is it?  How does to fit your style maybe?
KRISTA PUISITE: I like the course.  I think it's a great course, of course.  I like that the tee shots are pretty wide open.
But the rough is pretty thick, so I'm going to really be trying to stay on the fairway.  The rough, when it's that thick for my swing and how I hit the ball is not my favorite spot.
But the greens are just kind of undulated on your approach shots.  I will definitely be sure to know where I'm placing the ball.
Q. What are your goals for yourself this week?
KRISTA PUISITE: Well, I think finishing in the top, let's a top 50 would be good for me.  Yes, I would be content with that.
Of course anything higher that than would be great.
Q. What are your goals for the rest of your rookie season then?
KRISTA PUISITE: Well, my goal is to really capitalize on the tournaments that I actually get into since I'm getting into so few.
Just hopefully securing pretty good playing status for next year.  But we will see how this goes and how many events even I get into.
