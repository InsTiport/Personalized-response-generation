  Q. You took a test last night; have you heard back on that?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, I did a new one.  I got a little throat swab instead of a nasal swab, and it came back positive.  I'm easily surprised by that.  I think that's six in a row now, so I'm really fighting hard to pass that test.  I've never failed so many tests -- actually I've never failed a test before in my educational degrees, I guess.
 Q. Can you talk about what it's like -- have you ever played in a onesome before and what's it like playing between a bunch of twosomes?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, it was just like golf is Monday through Friday at my home golf club, just normal golf.  It was quite nice; I kept a nice pace.  I didn't really touch the guys in front of me, just managed to stay about a half a hole back and waited on a couple tee boxes, but it was actually quite nice pacing, to be honest.
 Q. Harris English was up here earlier and he said the situation you guys are in is kind of lonely.  Would you agree with that?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, I mean, I don't have a girlfriend or a wife or anything, so I'm pretty used to that.  He obviously has a wife and tons of friends on TOUR, but I stick to myself usually, so there's not too much difference in the day-to-day social aspect, but yeah, it's nice to see some faces and chat to guys and find out how they're doing, but you only really get to see them on the driving range.  That's the only place.
 Q. Have they given you an idea how long this could last?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, I have a friend in Japan, I've mentioned it before, he's been a month in and he still hasn't tested negative.  I'm ready for the long haul here, and I'll be playing next week.  Hopefully I can get that test sooner rather than later.  But I'm not worried, I'm keep testing and we'll wait and see.
