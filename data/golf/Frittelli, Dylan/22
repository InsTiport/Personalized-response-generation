Q. Highlight was the eagle and quite a few pars coming in.  Did that get frustrating after an eagle that you couldn't get a couple more?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, it did.  I wasn't too frustrated off the tee and into the green but the putts didn't really go in or come close to going in.  That was kind of sad at the end, but really happy with the way I played and played well through the front nine.  So I've got a lot of positives to take till tomorrow.
Q. Haven't been too many bogeys on the card this week.  What do you feel has been the strongest part of the game so far?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Definitely ball-striking.  Earlier in the week, I said to some of the media that ball-striking is going to win this tournament.  Long and straight off the tee is definitely going to help.  I've done that pretty well this week and managed my game pretty well around that, but I need the short game to kick off.  I had a couple chip-ins today, which is amazing for me.  I haven't had a chip-in in a while.  That was good and hopefully I can get the flat stick to cooperate tomorrow.
Q. Looks like it's bunched at the top of the leaderboard after looking like a runaway leader yesterday.  So it's a nice situation to be in going into Sunday if you want to be aggressive around this golf course?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, for sure.  I was a bit dejected out there looking at 15 and 16, and I looked at the leaderboard; whoa, hang on, Colsaerts has come back to the field.  That kind of gave me a bit of momentum the last couple holes trying to make birdie.
Tomorrow could be anyone.  Seems like there's seven, eight, nine guys around the lead.
