 Q.  Well played, that's two 67s to open up the tournament.  You've got a good run going on the back nine, and then had to be more patient until your final three and two more birdies?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I lost a bit of focus on the back nine, or front nine holes, but managed to claw back with birdies on 9 and 7.   
 Q.  How will the wind change things for the afternoon guys?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I was pretty excited, I hit driver and 8-iron on 9 and I thought, oh, a bit of wind here, it will make it tough for the guys in the afternoon to stay where they are.  But those guys on 6-, 7-, 8-under will probably push into the double digits this afternoon.   
 Q.  How important was it for you to get that win this year and really start the year off in positive fashion and carrying good form now into these big events, including the Rolex Series?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Pretty big.  Honestly I had forgotten about that one.  It's been a while now.  Looking forward to these big events in the summer, I didn't capitalise last year on these events.  I missed pretty much all the Rolex cuts until Turkey, actually.  So just trying to get some Race to Dubai points through the middle part of the season.   
 Q.  Two very different nines here.  Is it an enjoyable golf course to play?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, for sure.  You go from the back nine being super hilly and a lot of elevation changes to the front nine being relatively flat besides two holes.   
I enjoy it.  It's a nice course and beautiful scenes around the course, so if you get frustrated, just look up into the hills and try to calm yourself down.   
 Q.  Nicely in touch for the weekend and not too far off the pace going into Saturday?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, for sure.  Last week was a struggle.  I missed the cut but I was striking the ball really well.  I managed to fix a few things, got a new Odyssey putter in the bag and hopefully manage to get that working on the weekend.
