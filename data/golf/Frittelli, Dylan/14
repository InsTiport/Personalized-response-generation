Q. Finishing with a birdie for a 67, how happy are you with that?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Pretty happy.  I had a couple bogeys on the par 3s, but besides that, it was a flawless round.
Q. How is the golf course playing today?  Any different to yesterday?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: It is a little bit easier today.  The wind kind of settled down and was a little more consistent.
Yesterday I feet like it was switching on a lot of holes, and you're looking up in the sky trying to figure it out.  I just felt more comfortable on the golf course today.  Tee shots were better and putting was a lot better.
Q. You had a breakout year last year, some victories and other great successes.  How do you reflect on this year as a whole so far?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: It's been good.  I've slipped a little down the World Rankings the last few months, but it's because I've been playing back in the States doing the Web.com qualifying.
I've got a PGA TOUR card and playing in big tournaments, and obviously a bunch of South African events coming up now, so I'm hoping to climb back up those rankings.  It's been a great year.  Consistent and happy with my performances.
Q. How will you sort out your schedule next year?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Main focus will be on the PGA TOUR, but I'm always happy to come back to Europe and play, especially Rolex events.  I mean, they are premiere events in the world.  So you'll catch me at all the Rolex events more than likely, and might jump back a little bit.
Q. Your thoughts on your position now in this tournament going into the weekend?
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I haven't even looked.  There are a lot of birdies left out there, so if I'm in the Top 15 by the end of the day I'll be really happy.  It's going to take two really low ones to get into contention.  Hopefully I keep climbing the leaderboard and making birdies.  That's the goal.
