 Q.  Talk about getting off to that perfect start.  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, I was always looking that, trying to make a few birdies through the first few.  You're only going to lose pace if you go even through three or four, and luckily those few birdies went in.   
I don't want to say it was easy out there.  It just felt a whole lot easier than it has been the last few weeks.  I definitely struggled on the weekend the last three, four events, and luckily today I calmed my nerves down and really did well out there.   
 Q.  To be in the pressure cooker, a couple European Tour wins, trying to break through here, how did you rely on that experience when you needed to hit the big shots down the stretch today?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: It was huge.  I was calling back on the wins in Europe and the Challenge Tour.  I was thinking in those moments I was really stressed and feeling the adrenaline and there's no purpose for that.  Just calm yourself down to the point where you can hit good tee shots and hit it on the green and hopefully hit a good putt here or there.   
But the experience does give you a lot of confidence when you're out there, and luckily I was able to calm myself down.  My sports psychologist in San Diego was key for that, and luckily I did that to perfection.   
 Q.  17, playing the bunker shot out -- getting that putt to drop, obviously a bonus?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, I didn't see the leaderboard until my putt on 17, so I figured five holes to go, I was trying to get three birdies out of five; four holes, two out of four and two guys birdied 17.  You can't give up shots to the rest of the field.  When I saw the leaderboard, putting downhill, I thought, if I make this, a little bit of breathing room with Russell in the clubhouse already.  Managed to lip it out, 400 degrees, luckily that putt went in and I had some breathing room.   
 Q.  You have a flight now, Open Championship, what does this mean?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: It's huge.  Move up the FedExCup rankings.  I was looking at post-season possibly playing the Web final and trying to figure out a schedule and take some time off, and it's really been stressing me out.  But now I can sit back and have a clear mind and try and can play for another 2 1/2 years.   
 Q.  Now a PGA TOUR winner, after your round yesterday, you realized you were still in the mix, and you shoot a Sunday 64.  How did you keep your composure?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I just called on experience.  Winning around the world, winning on The Challenge Tour as an amateur; by biggest help was my sports psychologist in San Diego who has helped me my whole career.  I chatted to him and I was able to stay calm and worked well today.   
 Q.  Looks like you were enjoying your round based on body language rage.  How about the decision-making on 17?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Yeah, it was just basically the theory of have fun through the whole week, and I managed to stick to that on Sunday; and last week I didn't quite stick to it and this week I did.   
17 was huge, the cushion I had, to make birdie there.  Hit a perfect iron shot and had presence the mind to play the easy shot and leave myself a six-, eight-footer, and luckily caught a corner of the hole.   
 Q.  You mentioned your experience around the world, winning on The European Tour and back to your Challenge Tour days.  What was the grind like to get to this point?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: It was tough.  I turned pro in 2012 and won the National Championship, and flew over to Europe and played a bunch there and South Africa.  It was a lot of travel, playing 12 weeks in a row.  It's definitely a whole lot easier now knowing that I have some job security for the next two years.  I can plan ahead and take some time off.   
 Q.  With the exemptions, with the fact that you get into THE PLAYERS, the Masters and a whole boatload of other perks, what does this moment mean to you?  
DYLAN FRITTELLI: Just proves that the work I've been doing is the correct work.  Being 15th in the FedExCup throughout the season is so frustrating because you don't see the results come through, if you just keep sticking to it -- and I made that change on my mental game this week and last week and thankfully came to fruition this week and helped me out.
