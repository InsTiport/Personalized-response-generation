  Q. Three good rounds this week; could you just summarize your week?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, I've got to put everything in perspective.  I've been pretty terrible the last few weeks on TOUR, so I think this week was a really good week.  I had my coach Chuck Cook here and my physio Nic Catterall and they had a good plan put together.  Chuck really helped me out on my long game, so back to my normal ball-striking ways now, being very consistent, fairways and greens, and then just getting rid of some scar tissue of hitting some bad shots and just laying down some positive neurons there, seeing good shots, and that's really helped out this week just to get rid of some of the stuff I was going through.
 Q. Was there any one specific thing that you changed that helped this week?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, my golf swing.  Just entirely my golf swing.  It was out of whack.  I don't know where it went wrong.  It was really good going into San Diego and three weeks later coming out of there it was just really bad.  I didn't fly back to Austin my week off and didn't see Chuck, so sadly I was in Florida in the good weather, but I didn't get to do any technical work with him, so it was good to have him here this week.
