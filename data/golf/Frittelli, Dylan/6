Q. Nice round, 4-under par today, 3-under par total.  Just characterize your round.
DYLAN FRITTELLI:   It was a pretty good round.  I played about as well as I played yesterday.  I feel like the course was at least two or three shots easier than yesterday afternoon.  Similar golf to yesterday; I managed to capitalize on a new longer putts.  But yeah, just nice consistent golf.  It's nice to play a tough golf course compared to last week.  I seem to excel under tough conditions physically.
Q. What were the last two days like playing as a twosome?
DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Fine.  I had G-Mac in the group with me, lots of banter, lots of chat with him and caddie Ken, and it was good fun.  It's nice not to have to rush if ever you get out of position because a two-ball plays really quickly, so we were able to stay in position pretty easily.
Q. Tomorrow you're going to have to play as a single, kind of within your group of 3-under.  How are you going to manage that, because obviously you're going to play a lot quicker than the guys in front of you?
DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, we'll see.  I'm actually going to go take a test this afternoon.  I haven't taken once since Tuesday morning, so if I can test negative this afternoon then hopefully I can play with somebody tomorrow, but I'm not going to be too worried.  It may just take a bit of walking slowly between shots and just trying to pace yourself so you don't end up waiting for every shot.  But I've played golf before; I've played on my own; I've played with three people; I've probably played with six people before in the same group.  It's still golf at the end of the day.
