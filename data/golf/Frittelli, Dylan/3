Q. A turnaround in basically half an hour; what's the advantage and disadvantage of having to face that kind of return here for the second round? 
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I definitely think it's an advantage because I'm playing well right now, so I'm just going to keep the balls rolling. I'll probably just head to the locker room, have some food and then rush out back to the first tee and play that nine again. 

Q. What did you do best? 
DYLAN FRITTELLI: I putted well. I think those few putts I madeââ I drove it nice and long but it wasn't tremendously straight. Hopefully I can tighten that up and post some more birdies.
