  Q. Dylan, you got the home crowd rooting for you, all the Longhorn fans in your favor, and what an eagle putt to close things out against Jason Kokrak.
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, that was pretty cool to end there on 16.  I definitely didn't want to go down 17 and stuff can happen there, and going down 18 is definitely nerve-racking, so glad I nailed that eagle to finish the match.
 Q. You went to the University of Texas; do you feel comfortable on this golf course, and do you know it and do you think that gives you an advantage?
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, I think I definitely know it more than other guys.  I've definitely played probably the most rounds, between myself and Jordan out here, maybe Scottie Scheffler, too.  But it's more so the factors of sleeping in my own bed and feeling comfortable on the roads driving here, and that's going to aid me in the rest of the week, I'm sure.
 Q. You have Will Zalatoris on Friday.  You can close things out and move into the round of 16; what an accomplishment that would be.
 DYLAN FRITTELLI:   Yeah, that would be huge.  Obviously it was my goal starting out the week just to get to the weekend.  My coach Chuck Cook was actually on a holiday in the Bahamas, and he told me, get to the weekend and then I can give you some lessons.  That was my goal, to try and have some time with Chuck this weekend and get into some competitive environment with him on my side.
