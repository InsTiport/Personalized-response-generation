  Q. The weather won? Talk about the weather?  
 BILL SAUTTER: The weather was almost, when we got on the back nine today, the top of the hill there, on I guess 12, 13, it was almost unplayable. The ball was oscillating on the green and on the tee. It was that gusty. So.  
  
  Q. What are you looking to do tomorrow?  
 BILL SAUTTER: I can't believe that this won't blow out of here tomorrow. But you got to shoot a pretty decent round, a pretty low number to be able to hang around. I don't even know what the cut line is going to be.   
 So you shoot under par tomorrow and you can move up a whole bunch. But if it's like this again, it's just, it beats you up, wears you down.   
  
  Q. How has your time here been?   
 BILL SAUTTER: I had a great time, met a lot of lovely people, but it was just about four months too early up here. How about that?
