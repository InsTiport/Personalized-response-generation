Q.   The biggest question out there today is the wind, it was a bear.
PAUL SCALETTA:   It was brutal.   That's all I can say.   You feel like you're hitting a golf shot the way you want it to‑‑ I've played in some tough conditions, and I like when the wind blows, I still like it, and it was just tough.   On the greens, the wind was blowing the ball around on the greens.   You get in your thoughts and routine and settled in but it was just hard. 
I didn't really care about the results and I didn't really get upset with anything.   Just tried to do my process and hit golf shots.   Didn't happen.   Hit a couple of bad shots and it got course.   You know, whatever.   I'm always going to take something from it, though.   I'm going to take something out of this, and it can only get better.   That might be the toughest conditions I'm going to face in any tournament. 

Q.   This is your first PGA Championship, what do you take out of this going forward and what do you take back to your club? 
PAUL SCALETTA:   Going to have to give some golf lessons the next few days when I get back.   Go back to doing life as a PGA professional and go back at it again and teach and play and just do what I've been doing. 

Q.   Other than the windy conditions today, how was the experience overall for you? 
PAUL SCALETTA:   It was fantastic.   You know, and you definitely can build on this for next time, and then for other tournaments in the future.   So it's great.   I want to kind of test myself here and I'm going to go to the second stage of TOUR School and I'll definitely give a go at it.   I don't think there will be any conditions tougher than what we've seen today.
