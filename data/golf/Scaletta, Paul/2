 Q.   First off, can you kind of take us through your day?   How was the course?   Obviously the wind came up, pretty tough later as the day went on.   
PAUL SCALETTA:   You know, I hit some good golf shots, put a plan together and just tried to execute that plan.   Just put myself in position to make some putts or do whatever.   Whatever happens, happens.  
   
 Q.   You went off the first tee this morning, first time playing in the event.   
PAUL SCALETTA:   Yep.  
   
 Q.   What was that tee shot like?   
PAUL SCALETTA:   You know what, I was just focused on the target, figuring out the kind of shot shape I wanted to do, just keep an eye on my thoughts, stay calm, and I did, and I executed and hit a good golf shot.   The second shot I hit, I hit a little gap wedge, a little amped up and flew a little bit further than I thought it would into the wind, and hit a good putt there, and kind of settled into my round from there.  
   
 Q.   What does it mean to you as a club pro to be able to play in this event?  
PAUL SCALETTA:   It's an honor.   
   
 Q.   What did you think of the course out there today?  
PAUL SCALETTA:   I love it.   I think it's great.   Beautiful piece of property right here on the ocean.   We got some wind conditions.   It was great, fantastic.   The course is in great shape.  
   
 Q.   How do you build off of today's round heading into tomorrow?  
PAUL SCALETTA:   Just going to do the same thing, put the plan together.   Whatever happens, happens, just try to execute my golf shots.
