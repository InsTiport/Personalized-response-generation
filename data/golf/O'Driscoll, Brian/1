Q. How did you find Carnoustie today?
BRIAN O'DRISCOLL: It was actually more gracious than it usually it considering the weather but my game was well off the place.  Unfortunately I can't blame the difficulty of the course or the conditions.
Q. I saw you hit a few tee shots, looked like you were hitting the ball well.
BRIAN O'DRISCOLL: It's one part of my game that I can usually rely on but apparently it not good enough with what other components are doing together to shoot a score and my short game today was pretty tragic.
As a team we struggled, too.  We didn't really dovetail.  Sometimes if one or another of you are struggling, if you manage to work in consecutive holes, you can nurse your score around here, where we certainly didn't do that.
Q. And tomorrow?
BRIAN O'DRISCOLL: Kingsbarns.  Hopefully a day like today, a vast improvement on performance and we'll still have a good time irrespective.
Q. What do you enjoy about playing Carnoustie?
BRIAN O'DRISCOLL: Well, being in such close proximity to the pros and listening to how they hit the ball and even getting a few tips, so desperate for anything.  Hopefully I might go away and do a little bit of work on the range.  I rarely say that but I need to do something so I don't humiliate myself for the next two days.  Just try something at the range and around the chipping green will hold me in good stead for tomorrow.
