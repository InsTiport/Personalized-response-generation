 Q.  You went up after the 1st hole.  Just talk about the match a little bit.  
GARRETT BARBER: Yeah, so, I mean, I went up after the 1st hole.  I mean, I just didn't hit any fairways today.  That I was my struggle.  I just couldn't put it in play.   
He played well.  I just got flat out beat.  He played well.  I just couldn't put it in the fairway, and it was hard to attack this golf course without hitting the fairways.   
Joe played well, and so he deserved to win that match.   
 Q.  What is your biggest takeway from this week?  
GARRETT BARBER: You know, just have fun.  I was just kind of -- I think I just pressed a little bit too hard.  So, I mean, I'll have to think about it a little bit.   
Yeah, I mean it's crazy this is all over, my junior career, so I'll have to look back on it a little bit.
