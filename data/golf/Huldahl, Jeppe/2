   GORDON SIMPSON: Well, Jeppe, it's been a remarkable tournament for you, I know 61 today, but for a man who was 4-over par after nine holes on Thursday, and then had to make two birdies the last two holes to make the cut yesterday, to be leading the tournament by two shots, everything's happening to you this week.
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Yeah, well, I didn't think it was two days ago. Yeah, it's quite special. With two to go yesterday, I had a feeling I had to birdie the last two, and got in. And then this morning, yeah, figured -- yeah, well, just go with the same mind-set and think about birdies and sort of just happened.
 GORDON SIMPSON: You were telling me that on Thursday, someone had said the ball was in the hazard and it wasn't, and that cost you how many shots on that hole.
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Should have only cost me two, but I lost my head, as well, so it cost me four I guess. Yeah, so I took a plus four for a nine. So it was a rough start. 

 Q. Which hole? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It was on the 7th down the left side.

 Q. So you played the second one -- how did it happen?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Well, it happened -- I hit it left where I couldn't see it. So I wasn't sure if it carried the hazard. They said it was in the water, I couldn't hit a provisional, and then hit a new one. And it wasn't in the hazard, no.

 Q. Did you ever feel that you could have hit 59 today?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: No, I didn't. I think I got the most of this round. Obviously when you shoot 61, you can always go, well, I 3-putted 10. I holed so many good putts today and made so many good shots, I'm quite pleased with 61.
 GORDON SIMPSON: Not even on 17 when you're in the middle of the fairway? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It crossed my mind but I chickened out in the end. That second shot on 17, it's a tight pin right and I wanted to get it close, but nah. 

 Q. Did you figure out --
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Well, there's always shots to pick up in the round I guess. But I did hole a lob shot on 13 and stuff, so I think I had good things happening to me today. 

 Q. Is this your first 12 straight birdies?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It is. I think my record was five before. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: One outside The European Tour record which is eight birdies in a row. But he equalled the record of 12 birdies in a round, all-time round, equal. 

 Q. What's your lowest score? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: 63, something like that, in Tour School I guess. 64 out here or something. Tour School, 63. 

 Q. PGA Catalunya?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: No. Porto. It was back in '03. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: But in actual European Tour events, you think 64? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I'm not quite sure (loving).

 Q. But you haven't done it this year apart from this?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: No. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: You've also done something Martin Kaymer did, shot 61 on this golf course. How do you feel about now about your position? Do you think the leaders will pass you? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I'm pretty sure I won't be leading before tomorrow. I'm definitely in a better position than I was this morning. So if they don't run too far away, you never know.

 Q. Where are you now in The Race to Dubai?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I'm about 120 I think. You can check that, as well. I'm not sure. I haven't seen that. 
 I'm actually exempt for next year, I won in Wales last year at Celtic Manor, so I'm not too stressed. 

 Q. Your strongest this year --
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Oh, by far, definitely.

 Q. Is this your first time here in Portugal?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: No, I played this tournament last year. I've played in Portugal many times but my second time in this tournament. 

 Q. And your position last year?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Not good. I learned it now. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: Did you make the cut last year? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I didn't. No. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: You have learned. And obviously we are looking at half a million Euro first prize, that could make a big, big significant move up The Race to Dubai.
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Oh, yeah, probably shoot me a bit up the list I suppose. But I'm not thinking about winning right now. I have to do a bit of practise this afternoon, taking it easy with my family who is here, so I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow and see if I can get something going again. We'll see what happens. 

 Q. Was it the putting that's the difference? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Yeah, I didn't putt particularly well the first two rounds. And today, I just sort of started seeing the lines again, and started on it with the right pace and just dropped in the middle every time. 

 Q. How many putts? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Today? I don't know. Check the stats. Probably not too many. (Laughter).
 GORDON SIMPSON: Well, you should know how many single putts you had.
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Well, I did have a 2-putt birdie, as well, so I must have had like 11 I think, and I holed a chip, as well. 

 Q. Where did you hole the chip? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: On 13. 
 GORDON SIMPSON: Great performance. Keep it going tomorrow. Thanks very much.
