 Q. Really good scoring for you out there today?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It was. It was solid after two weeks off. 

 Q. What were you going for those two weeks? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Practising, so I had a pretty good feeling but you never know, do you. It was nice that it turned out like this.

 Q. Is that often the case, you have a couple of weeks off and come back fresh? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It's important for me to recharge the batteries. You need to take some breaks, and I enjoy it when I get some time to take some weeks off and it worked this time.

 Q. You've been to this event I think once before; obviously a course that suits your eye?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I didn't do too well last year but I like the course and I like the event and I really enjoy coming here.

 Q. You got your breakthrough win last year on The European Tour, looking to push on this season and with some big weeks coming up, maybe now is the time?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I think so. I feel like I've been playing better than the actual results lately so I'm just trying to push on and hopefully it will come.

 Q. Keeping your eye on the World Cup with Denmark in action? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It could be a great day.
