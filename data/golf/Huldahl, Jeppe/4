 Q. Good start. 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Yeah, this is probably the easier -- I mean, the weather has been perfect, and I think there's going to be a lot more wind the next couple of days, it seems like in the weather forecast. I think we had to enjoy it today and then maybe a bit more struggling the next two days. 
 I think Carnoustie could be tough on Saturday if it gets as windy as they say. 

 Q. How is your game? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: Well, it's been a bit up-and-down really. I've played some actually, to say the least, really bad tournaments lately. 
 I just had a little baby four weeks ago. It was my first, a girl, Vega. My mind has not really been on golf but still nice to shoot 5-under. 

 Q. Does that change everything, I suppose? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It's tough to get away from home. You miss home a little more I guess. This is not the most important thing anymore, I would say. It's still important, it's still my job but now there's something more important back home which is quite good I think. 

 Q. And I take it Wales helped all that? 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: That's right.
