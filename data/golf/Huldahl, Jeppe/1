 Q. Jeppe, 68 today puts you in a nice position, how tough is it out there today?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: This course is never easy. We had pretty good conditions today, not too much wind, but it still, those last four holes, you don't really want to play them even though they are great holes. It is a tough course.

 Q. But at 3-under par, you must be pretty satisfied?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: As I said, you always take a score like that around here. Yeah I'm really pleased.

 Q. Looking at the form book at the moment and really it doesn't look like you've had too much form. Were you surprised by that or was that coming, that kind of round?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: It's got to turn around at some point, so it might as well be here, or somewhere else. So I'm just waiting for it to happen. I feel like I'm doing all the right things but it just hasn't happened lately. So hopefully this week.

 Q. What's it like when you are in that kind of run? Do you feel like sometimes you just can't get back into the kind of groove that you want?
 JEPPE HULDAHL: A little bit. It's been a while since I played a really good round of golf. So you tend to get a bit more nervous down the stretch and really want to close it off, and doesn't really help with these four holes coming in. It was nice closing it off decent.

 Q. At least tomorrow when you play your second round, you'll be closing it off on the front nine. 
 JEPPE HULDAHL: I actually thought about that already. That's nice.
