  Q. First round of the tournament. Shot a 20. How do you feel?  
 VINNY TESTAVERDE: I feel good. I feel like I played over my head to begin with. But I had a lot of saving par putts coming in, 16, 17, 18. That helped out a lot. And I got to play with Trent Dilfer, one of the better golfers out here. So I watched him. He came in at 23.   
 Just watching the better golfers you learn about the tempo of your swing and what side to err on if you're going to make errors. So it was good to be paired up with him.  
  
  Q. Do you think it helped your game being paired with him?  
 VINNY TESTAVERDE: There's no question. I enjoy playing with better golfers than myself because they're better for a reason. Just watching them and talking to them a little bit, figuring out what they're thinking, it helps me.  
  
  Q. Got a game plan for tomorrow?  
 VINNY TESTAVERDE: Well, just to go out and get the same tempo. I'm sure we're going to have another gorgeous day. I'm sure the pins will be a little tougher. But I'm having a good time, and that's the main thing.
