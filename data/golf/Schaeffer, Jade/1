Q. What went well today?
JADE SCHAEFFER: I think it's hard to come back on the course with a big event like that, do it on the last day.  But I don't start very well, like because I just made a bogey for my first hole.  But I have to be focused.
I know I have to be focused, and I try my best for the rest of the holes.  I made a lot of putts for birdies in the middle to my round, and at the end, I don't play well.  I am a little bit hurt in my back but it's okay.  I just try my best again.
But I'm happy.  I'm happy to be here and I'm happy to play in Dubai.  It's a very good area.  You know I love this area.
Q. You did play well here last year, as well.
JADE SCHAEFFER: Yeah, yeah, I feel very good.  I found a good caddie, too.  His name is Aryaan.  He's from here and he's a very good guy.  He's just smiling with me and talking with me.  He's so cool.  I'm very happy to be with him.
Q. How old is he?
JADE SCHAEFFER: 16.
