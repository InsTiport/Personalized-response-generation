   CARLOS RODILES:  It was very satisfying. I have not been playing a lot lately. I have been at home and it is pretty warm and it is not easy to get out there and whack balls and putt as it is too hot. It is very nice on the beach or by the pool but difficult to practice. I tried to practice a little but you lose your rhythm and it not the same as coming out here with the big boys. I am really happy as I wasn't expecting a lot. Everything turned out okay and I putted well. 

 Q.  There is some frustration about not being out here as it has been a good season? 
 CARLOS RODILES:  Yeah. I think the re-rank should be done a lot more often so the guys that are playing well are playing constantly and maybe it should be done every two or three weeks. But I knew the way it was done at the start of the year and although I wasn't playing I was lucky as I had enough money to not be under a lot of pressure coming down to the last few events. If I had a few quid less I would be under a lot of pressure. 

 Q.  Does it upset your rhythm not playing so much? 
 CARLOS RODILES:  Absolutely. I had a very good run up to Austria and since then I have only played in the K Club. Those are all the big events and what the European Tour is all about. The 2-3 million euro events. They are the events you want to get into. Everybody wants to play. 

 Q.  This is a good one to play? 
 CARLOS RODILES:  Absolutely. These is one of the big ones and I am very pleased to be playing here and off to a good start.
