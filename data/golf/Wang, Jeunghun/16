Q. Talk a little bit about the match, it was very close.
JEUNGHUN WANG: It was close.  I played really good today.  Also my partner, K.T. Kim, played also good.  I don't have any regrets.
Q. It seems like you guys missed some putts when you had opportunities.
JEUNGHUN WANG: European guys really played really, really good.  I think no bogeys today.  I think we have to work more putts.
Q. Talk about 18, the second shot on the fairway.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually the wind is coming from right-to-left, but I don't know, I feel like it's going to be going left but just goes straight.
Q. How about tomorrow?  Seems like a big European lead.  How hard will it be?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Of course we still have a chance to win.  I think if I do like today, I think I can win tomorrow.
