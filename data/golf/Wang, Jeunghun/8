 Q.  Your thoughts on the final round?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually, I hit it so bad today.  Like my driver, I think I hit fairways only like four or five times, and greens, like eight or nine greens only maybe.  So it's really a long day for me.  Unlucky, but I still have a lot of tournaments.  I think this is a great experience for me.   
 Q.  And it started so well.  You were five strokes clear at one stage, as well, weren't you.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, I was.  I don't know; unlucky.   
 Q.  Do you, though, when you find that somebody is up there, do you try to go for shots, just try to be competitive, when you know it's harder, you've just got to try to catch them?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, I was keep trying, keep trying to make birdie and keep trying to hit it close to the pin.  But I don't know why my irons like going left, right.  I don't know, so bad.   
 Q.  You've won twice, you're now second in a huge money event with lots of ranking points.  All that is good, isn't it?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, it's really big for me.  It's really fantastic.  But if I shoot like even par or 1-under, it's going to be really great.  I shoot 3-over, so I feel a little bit bad.   
 Q.  I know you're so disappointed, but Dubai is next week.  Can you shrug it off and say, another big tournament, up for it?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, sure.  I'm going to keep going, keep trying to make a lot of birdies to be the leader.  This is good experience, to maybe next week, going to be no mistakes.
