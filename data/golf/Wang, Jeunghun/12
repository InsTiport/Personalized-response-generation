Q. Please tell me your thoughts on how well you've played over these two days.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I had a lot of mistakes first round but I had a great recovery today.  So it's really a great round today.  I love my score very much.  I love my position.
Q. Are you proud of the way you've played given the windy conditions on a tough course?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually the weather is pretty good today, the afternoon, just a little bit of wind, but I can't control it.
Actually my irons today really good, so I can shoot like 5-under.  So happy about it.
Q. Do you like the challenge, because everybody says this is a hard course.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually for me, it's I think not really hard.  I like the course and I like the green condition, fairway, perfect.  I think I have a good round, that's why.
Q. Does that mean that when you first came here and you looked at Le Golf National, you thought:  I like this, what are they talking about?
JEUNGHUN WANG: No, after I played a practice round, actually last week was really hard.  The rough is really tough.  So after I played, this week is a lot easier.
Q. Are you finding the game easy?  We know you've had those two victories back-to-back, but we haven't seen you a great deal since then.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually, after I come to Europe, it's quite hard for me.  The weather is cold, so dry.  The rough is pretty hard for me.  So I have a lot of missed cuts.  But finally I play well this week.
Q. And are you enjoying Paris?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Oh, yes, perfect.  I love foods here.  It's really nice hamburger and spaghettis, salads really good.  Actually I saw Eiffel Tower when I'm going to hotel, fantastic.  Eiffel Tower.  Maybe after this tournament, I go to Paris to see Eiffel Tower.
