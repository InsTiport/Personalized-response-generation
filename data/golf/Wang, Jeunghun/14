 Q.  Please tell me the story as far as you're concerned of a very tight match.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I played very well today but my opponent played just as good or if not better, so I was very nervous throughout the whole match.  But considering that I tied the match, I'm very pleased with myself.   
 Q.  Is that a huge thrill?  To make it must be hugely satisfying.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I was pretty nervous but it got to the point where it's just give it my all and make it and the result was good.   
 Q.  What do you take, and I appreciate that Asia have been beaten, but what do you take personally from this week?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Since I got the opportunity to play with the world-class players, I take a lot of experience from it.  I feel very confident when I go out and play in other tournaments and I feel like I can win this year.
