JEUNGHUN WANG: I had a great front nine with my four birdies.  I had three bogeys and I felt a little bit down, but that's okay, I have tomorrow.   
 Q.  You still smile; you accept that's the nature of this golf course.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually this golf course is hard and windy today.  So I think 3-over is okay on the back nine.  I have a lot of problems with the front nine.  Doesn't matter.  I think good position.   
 Q.  You said yesterday how much you like this course.  Was it different today with the wind changing a little direction?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, especially No. 18 was downwind when I hit a tee shot into the wind, so I hit driver.  It's quite difficult to hit fairway but I made par.   
 Q.  You have already won twice on The European Tour.  Now that you go into a final round in this position, what is your attitude?  What is your approach?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I don't have any pressure right now.  Before I was, but now not anymore.  Just try to enjoy this golf course and try to make birdie every time.
