Q. Fantastic year.  Have you ever played better than that?  64 out there today, in that wind, with those pin positions, was amazing.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I hit it really well today.  I played really good.  So I made this far.  I was trying to make -- trying to save par and trying to make birdie and keep going.  It was fantastic for me, yeah.  Fantastic round.
Q. How much do you like this golf course?
JEUNGHUN WANG: I love it right now because I shoot 64.  Maybe I love the course.
Q. What food will you eat tonight?  There's lots of choices here.  What food will you go for before you play the final round?
JEUNGHUN WANG: I always eat hamburgers before I play, like three days in a row already.  So maybe tonight also I'm going to have hamburger.
Q. Please tell me just how special a round that was.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I'm so happy that I shoot 64 and I'm more happy that I don't have any bogey today.  So it's a really great round for me.  Maybe I love this course.
Q. Are you a little surprised?  In these winds, lots of players are struggling.
JEUNGHUN WANG: When I start, I try to make only par.  Like try to hit 1-under, 2-under.  I keep trying to make par and birdies.  So it's lucky.
Q. Wonderful eagle, which wasn't lucky.  It was very nearly an albatross.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I saw my shot on the leaderboard, it was really lucky.  I hit the rough twice and then kicked right and almost hit the hole.  Lucky day today.
Q. We know this season just how well you can play.  How does that compare with the best rounds of your life?
JEUNGHUN WANG: It's really hard condition today.  It was really hard to shoot -- I think 4 under is really hard to shoot.  I shoot 8-under on this course in this wind, I still cannot believe it.
Q. Is your best round ever?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually, I shoot 9-under before.
Q. Maybe that was an easy 9-under?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Maybe, I don't know.
Q. What do you think about leading this tournament into the final round?
JEUNGHUN WANG: I don't know.  Just I don't want to think about any win.  I just want to focus on the last 18 holes.  I just try to do same as today.
