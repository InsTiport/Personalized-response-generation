 Q.  Just describe what the last two weeks have meant to you.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I didn't even think about win last week but I got lucky on 16, 17, so I got a win.  I won back-to-back two in a row, so it's really good for me and it's a really great two weeks.   
Actually, Sunday was my father's birthday, so it's double, extra bonus.  I think I give him a big present.   
 Q.  Can you believe yourself what you've achieved, winning the last would weeks?  Can you believe what you've done?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I still cannot believe it.  I don't know how did I putt on the last three holes, I don't know how did I putt on the last hole.  I was so nervous.  I still am dreaming.  I feel like I'm dreaming right now.   
 Q.  Nice to have all your friends there last week?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I tried to come here --   
 Q.  Champagne?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: That was my two friends.  I was rooming with them and have a great week with them.  I drink a little bit champagne, too, so it's great week.   
 Q.  You're only the third player to win two weeks in a row, did you realise that?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: No, I didn't know that but I saw on the European website.  It's really like so proud for me.   
 Q.  Is it your first time in Ireland?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yes, first.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts so far?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I didn't know it's cold weather here, but it's really cold.  I feel like I'm in Korea right now, so it's perfect.   
 Q.  How has the reaction been back in Korea?  Have you seen any newspapers?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I saw the news in Internet, so I'm happy about it.   
 Q.  You're the new superstar in Korea?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I hope so.  I'm not sure yet but I hope so.
