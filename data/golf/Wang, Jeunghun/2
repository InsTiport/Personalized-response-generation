Q. How did it go out there?  You played really well.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually, my driver is not really good today, but my recovery shot and my putting was really good.  So I think that's the key that I played 4-under par today.  I like my position.
Q. How are you feeling out on the PGA TOUR?  Are you getting comfortable sort of playing with all these players and on these courses?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Oh, yeah, very nice courses, everything is perfect.  Maybe one time I'll get a PGA TOUR card to play the PGA TOUR.
Q. What should people know about you?  What are you like away from the golf course?  What do you like to do?  What do you like to do away from golf?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Just relax in my room.
Q. Movies?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Not really.
Q. Reading?
JEUNGHUN WANG: No.  Not at all.
Q. All golf all the time?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah.
Q. Are you thinking about the Presidents Cup at all?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Right now, no, I'm not focusing on the Presidents Cup, it's maybe too much pressure.  Just trying to enjoy all the tournaments and maybe if I get a chance to play the Presidents Cup, that would be great.
Q. What do you like most about being in the United States?  What's your favorite thing about being in the United States.
JEUNGHUN WANG: The food is really great and the courses are perfect, so, I love that.
Q. That hat that your caddie has, was that originally for you?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, actually, yeah.  I don't know where he got that before, so.
Q. He wanted to wear it?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, he wants to wear it.  So I gave it to him.
