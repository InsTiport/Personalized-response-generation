Q. Tell me how good of golf that was.
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I did really good putts today.  I made a lot of 1-putts and great, big saves.  So I'm trying to save my birdies and keep making pars.  I did well today.
Q. Does this mean you like the course?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, like the course.  When I play practice round, it's really tough.  I feel it's really tough.  But when I play the tournament, I feel a little bit easier.  Yeah, hope to getting better and better.
Q. Is it sometimes good, though, to play a tough course, because you know you have to concentrate all the time?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, I have to.  I did today.  I did every shot, every putt, I concentrate.  I make a lot of putts, long par putts.  Good round for me.
Q. You have won in Morocco, Mauritius; why Africa?
JEUNGHUN WANG: I don't know, maybe I like the grass or course in Africa.
Q. When you look around here at Sun City and when you first came here, what did you think, not only the course, but everything?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Oh, everything, it's my first time here and I'm really enjoying South Africa.  A lot of things to see and watch.  I really enjoy it.
Q. Have you gone into the national park?  Have you seen the animals yet?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Not yet but I'm going to watch on Sunday.
Q. Looking forward to that?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yes.
