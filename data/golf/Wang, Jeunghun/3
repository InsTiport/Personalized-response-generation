 Q.  How does it feel to win?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Feels really fantastic for me.  It's really, really great.  I'm so happy.   
 Q.  You played so well out there today.  You got off to a really good start and conditions changed, didn't they.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I got nervous, like crazy at the back nine.  I missed every iron shot I made.  Saved par, everything.  I think my chipping saved me this week.   
 Q.  Showed some real mental strength to go and win in that playoff there.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, I just want to play playoff, and I got 18th hole, the last hole.   
 Q.  Were you confident going into the playoff?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Not really, but I just tried to get confident.   
 Q.  Game is in great shape.  How does that change your season now?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I'm not sure.  I just don't want to get any pressure this year.  Just want to learn from the other players.  I just want to keep winning I hope.   
 Q.  How do you think you'll celebrate tonight?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Not sure.  Drink some beer (laughs).   
 Q.  Towards those closing stages, just how nervous did you feel?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I was really nervous at the back nine.  I missed a lot of greens.  But my chipping was really good today.  So I saved everything.  Finally I won.   
 Q.  Before the playoff, standing over the 18th hole, you hit an absolutely super putt and it dropped agonisingly short.  What was going through your mind?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I just want to try to make birdie at the last.  I don't know, I don't think about anything.  I just want to try to make birdie.   
 Q.  On your 18th in regulation, did you think that putt was going to drop?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Not really but just try to hit it hard and it's short.   
 Q.  Just talk us through your emotions in the three-way playoff.  Tell us how you played the hole.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I just tried to make just on the green I think in playoff, but I pulled it a little bit.  It's lucky, I thought it's in the hazard but it's over the green.   
 Q.  Did you sense that Jaco Van Zyl would sink his putt for birdie?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I think he's going to hold his putt, because his putting is really good today.  I just prepare for my putt and try to go next playoff.   
 Q.  This victory really sets you up for the season in 2017.  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, I've really got a lot of confidence right now.  I just want to play another tournament.
