Q. That smile on your face coming up 18, 5-under today.  You looked like you enjoyed yourself.  What are your thoughts?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I hit it well today.  On the first front nine, my putting was really good.  So I made like a lot of birdies today.  I feel really good right now.  I just want to keep going.
Q. Conditions, how much harder was it today than yesterday?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yesterday was absolutely no wind, but today, really blew so hard.  Hard to putt on the green and distance control.  I think that was the hard part for me.
Q. You've already got two wins under your belt and you're still incredibly young, so what do you have to do over this weekend?
JEUNGHUN WANG: I don't want to get pressure.  I just want to play my own game.
Q. Thoughts on 5-under today?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I hit it really well on the first nine.  My putting was really good.  So I feel happy about my second round and just want to keep going on the third round.
Q. Some players were struggling with the wind out there but just like Mauritius, you seem to enjoy it.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I do know that I'm playing well in the wind conditions.  I hope windy in the third round and final round, too (laughing).
Q. And you're still in a very strong position going into the weekend now.
JEUNGHUN WANG: I'm so happy about my position right now.  I'm happy about score.  I think I can have a good result this week.
Q. And it's your first time playing here.  How are you finding it?
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I thought when I played a practice round, it feels like really hard course.  But when I'm playing the tournament, not really.  So I feel good.
