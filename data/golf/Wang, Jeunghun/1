 Q.  Thoughts on a 67, now 5-under for the tournament?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Yeah, it's really great finish for me.  I certainly remember the two years ago, putting on 18.  So it's a really fantastic round for me, and, yeah, I hope to play well tomorrow.   
 Q.  What made it a great round out there, 5-under for the last few holes?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: Actually I made two long putts on hole 18 and 14.  That helps me a lot.  That 2-putt makes me 3-under, so yeah, it's a great round.   
 Q.  The conditions today were a little different to the previous two days.  How much did they help with softer greens?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I think the pin is harder than the previous two rounds, but the conditions are a little bit easier, I think.  No winds in the morning.  So that makes me play well, yeah.   
 Q.  You won here a couple of years ago and you have a chance to do it tomorrow.  Are you excited?  
JEUNGHUN WANG: I'm really excited to play tomorrow and this course again.  I hope I do something tomorrow.
