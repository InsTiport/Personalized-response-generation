  Q. Good round.   
 OLIN BROWNE: Not good enough.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 OLIN BROWNE: Offensively lot of work for even par.   
  
  Q. Really?   
 OLIN BROWNE: It's a hard golf course, you've got to manage yourself and play from point A to B and I did that effectively today, hit a ton of greens today. I think I may have hit close to 15 or 16 greens today. I felt like I was in it all day long. Every time I had a putt it rolled three feet, made two birdies and two bogeys and --  
  
  Q. Some of the guys talked about the greens being "baked out?"  
 OLIN BROWNE: There are fewer guys tracking the courses so half the field is playing, that helps certainly. And we had nice, overcast all morning long.   
 It's not that bad today and I thought they held up nicely. Not nearly as firm as they were on Thursday. Thursday they were a horror show, they were really hard. And today they were playable, you know?   
  
  Q. And the pitching wedge made it back in the bag?   
 OLIN BROWNE: Pitching wedge made it back in the bag for two swings, so -- neither one of them resulted in anything great but didn't hurt me either.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 OLIN BROWNE: The guys here fixed it.   
  
  Q. Right here?   
 OLIN BROWNE: Yeah, and they did a nice job. Rather than break it apart and put it back together again I just left it as is and I'll get it fixed perfectly next week.   
  
  Q. Good luck.   
 OLIN BROWNE: Thank you.
