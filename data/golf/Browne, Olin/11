 Q.   Compare and contrast the front nine and back nine.   
OLIN BROWNE:   I played a nice round of golf today.   I ended up in a couple of tough spots, I 3â€‘putted twice, and I hit a ball in a hazard.   And that's basically what it comes down to.   
Today was the kind of day where you're out there doing the best you can to get by.   And I thought that this course was quite difficult and under the conditions it was borderline unplayable today.  
   
 Q.   Is it one of those type of courses where you just learn as you go along?  
OLIN BROWNE:   No, I don't think that there's a lot to learn.   You hope that you get good bounces in spots and you hope you can stay out of the trouble.   
There are some holes out there that are, what's the word I'm looking for?   That are, you know, really, really hard.   And there are very few holes where you feel like you could get after it and take advantage of it.   So it's a super challenging event.
