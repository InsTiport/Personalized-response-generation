OLIN BROWNE:  Vijay just made a birdie somewhere, so he's 7 under.  This is a great start to the week and I hope I can make three other 66s, and if I do, then I figure I'll have a good chance to win.
Q.  How was it out there?
OLIN BROWNE:  It's beautiful.  As pretty a day as I can ever remember here.  No humidity, light sky, very little wind, the greens were perfect as always, and it's a treat to be playing here.
Q.  Was there a turning point in the round?
OLIN BROWNE:  Hung it out on No. 9 on my second shot.  Hit it halfway to the next hole and made that for par, and that kept the momentum in the round going and then made a birdie.

Very conventional, easy day for me.  I was in or around the hole pretty much all day.

I don't know where I made birdie.  I made six birdies, so just a very unstressed day.  It was a very easy day.  Course had dried out a little bit since the rain.  It was just one of those days where I got off to a good start, I birdied the first hole and birdied the third hole.  When you get under par here early and you feel good about what you're dealing after struggling early, it was a nice start.  And a great group to play with; Dennis and Billy are great guys.  It was an easy day.
