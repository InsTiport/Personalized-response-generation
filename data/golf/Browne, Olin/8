Q.   You praised the course setup yesterday.   Describe if it's similar or different today. 
OLIN BROWNE:   Yeah, I think the course is a terrific course, and I felt like the wind is up a little bit today.   It's a little bit difficult to pick your club and a little more difficult to hit the fairway.   So it's going to be a challenge. 
But it's a terrific golf course, and I think it will acquit itself well.

Q.   What do need to change in your game to get yourself in a position on‑‑
OLIN BROWNE:   I need to hit more fairways.   I can't hit the fairway right now.   I'm going to go figure out how to do that this afternoon.

Q.   Okay.   Thank you.
