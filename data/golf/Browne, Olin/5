 Q.  Tell me about the round today.  
OLIN BROWNE: Couldn't really get anything going on the front nine.  Got off to a good start on the back nine and got 4-under on the back nine.   
Finished poor.  I hit a couple of poor shots on 16 and 17.  But overall I think I played pretty solid golf.  I'm looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  What happened on 16?  
OLIN BROWNE: I had a little bit of an uphill lie and I was in between clubs and I just quit on it and flipped the club and it went left into the hazard.  I managed to make a bogey.   
And then the next shot that I hit on 17, I hit a really aggressive shot, I thought the wind was over my right shoulder and it was really pushing the ball to the right.  So I missed it in the bunker and it was short side and a tough bunker shot and I didn't get it up-and-down.   
But that's kind of the way this course works, you got to play to the edges and really be pretty precise with your iron game.  It's a challenging golf course.  So, we'll see what happens going forward.   
 Q.  What are you trying to do over the weekend?  
OLIN BROWNE: Trying to shoot better scores.  Make less mistakes and shoot better scores.  It's pretty simple.  The equation is easy, you just got to stay away from the trouble.
