 Q. Talk about some of the highlights of round three for you. 
 OLIN BROWNE: Highlights? Three birdies early and I played really solidly today. I hit a lot of really good putts that didn't go in. The speeds of the greens, I think, are a little bit inconsistent today. It started out there was some spots that are a little quicker than others and I think that has to do with a little bit of local knowledge. Once you figure that out, you're going to have a distinct advantage. 
 Then birdieing three early, that's exactly the kind of start you want. And then I got into the back nine and had a lot of good looks. 
 I had a good look at 11, I had a good look at 13, 14, 3-putted 15, hit the wrong club off the tee on 16, and then drew a tough lie over there on 18 for my only bogey of the day. So overall a pretty good round, but I sure feel like I left a bunch of shots out there.

 Q. Was there any difference for you between the first two rounds and today at all?
 OLIN BROWNE: Well, the wind was different for starters. It was different all over the golf course. It was more out of the south and it was predicted out of the southeast and then it swung around to the west and then it shifted almost northwest on the last few holes. 
 On 18 obviously we were hitting drivers and wedges and nine irons and we're back there with 200 yards into the pin. So, yeah, there's a significant difference today. And it's the guy who makes that adjustment mentally who is going to shoot a really good score. The scores are out there, somebody's going to be shooting 68, 67, 66. I don't see that being out of reach. 

 Q. How does it feel to be playing in your first Senior PGA Championship?
 OLIN BROWNE: Great. I wish I were 31 instead of 51, but I'll take what I can get at this point.
