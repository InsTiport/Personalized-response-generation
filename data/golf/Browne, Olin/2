Q. So maybe not the most conventional four rounds of golf in terms of scheduling and everything this weekend.  Just talk a little bit about your first impressions now that the tournament is concluded.
OLIN BROWNE: Well, it's just a shame that the course changed as much as it did from Saturday to today because it was a tournament golf course all week and just a great golf course.  It's just a shame.
But it's a wonderful place, and I thought the setup was really good, and the scores are indicative of what a challenge this golf course is.
Q. Shot even today.  So maybe just talk a little bit about what was working for you out on the course and what wasn't.
OLIN BROWNE: Well, even today is not very good.  Even Saturday would have been brilliant.  You know, there was no wind to speak of, and the ball wasn't rolling in the fairway, and it wasn't rolling much on the green.  So as long as you hit your start lines, you were going to be in play all day long.
It's just a question of getting accustomed to the speed of the greens.  I left a couple of putts short today, which is unusual for me.  I tend to putt fairly aggressively, and that's a condition issue.
It's hard to make those adjustments, but, hey, we've been doing this a long time.  So we ought to be able to do it.
Q. Lastly, you've won this tournament before.  What makes this tournament so special for you?
OLIN BROWNE: Well, it's our best tournament.  It identifies the best player in golf that week.  Generally speaking, the golf courses that we play are great golf courses, and they are in really good shape, and they are really difficult.  And it tests every facet of everybody's game from the 14 clubs in the bag to the game you have between your ears.  So it's just a great challenge.
