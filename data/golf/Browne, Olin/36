Q.  Do you think this is kind of residue from what's been going on with you the last month?  You get on a roll and keep going.
OLIN BROWNE:  Well, that's probably some of it.  But some of it has to be the stuff I've been working on for the last couple years and I just feel like, you know, if I play well, I can shoot a good score.  Just want to get out there.  I can't wait to come out tomorrow, you know.
Q.  Confidence is a weird thing out here.  When you guys are high, you really roll.  When you're low, it seems like you want to quit the game, which is amazing to me.  How hard is it out there to keep consistent confidence at a high level?
OLIN BROWNE:  Well, it's impossible because one shot can change it in either direction.  So if you're feeling crummy about your game, you hit a great shot, it will jump start you.  If you're feeling great about your game, you can pitch one into the trees, that will be it.

I don't know.  I can't figure out this game.  I just know that when you play well, you want to come back and play some more.  When you're playing poorly, you want to get out of town.
Q.  You've been at this a long time.  Having gotten the job done a few weeks ago outside of Boston, does it give you more confidence going into a Sunday tomorrow when you know you have another chance to win out here?
OLIN BROWNE:  Yeah, probably.  But, I mean, it looks good now, but it's going to be five or six back at the end of the day at least, I would think, and maybe more.

It was nice to play well today, but I left like that last putt   you saw my reaction   I left four of those right in front of the lip.  I would like to have had a couple more on the board.
