 Q.   I'm here with Olin Browne, under par after the first round of the U.S. Senior Open.   Talk about your round.   Talk about how the course is playing.   
OLIN BROWNE:   I thought the course was playing beautifully today.   I was a little off kilter.   I didn't drive it in play as much as I should have today, and I paid the price for that couple of times.  
I would have liked to have made a couple more putts, but you get 1 under par in the first round, that's a good start.   I'll take it.  
   
 Q.   What parts of your game did you think were working for you, what parts weren't?   
OLIN BROWNE:   Well, it's just, you've got to make good decisions in these kinds of tournament.   If you don't, you're going to pay a price.   And I made one bad decision and made a couple of bad swings, and the net result of that was three bogeys.  
So I didn't hit it as close as I would have liked, and I got a little bit tweaked on a couple of the greens.   I thought the greens were softer in some places, and they were firmer so my chip ran out. Another time, I thought it was firmer and it was softer and I checked up.   
So that's the kind of thing that happens to you.   When you figure those things out, you put together a better round. Like I said, under par the first day is okay.  
   
 Q.   A few players have mentioned the importance of hitting the fairway.   Do you think that there's an increased‑‑ at Indianwood specifically, maybe even compared to last year at Inverness, is there more of a premium on hitting the fairway?  
OLIN BROWNE:   Well, the rough is significantly more challenging this year, and the fairways are quite narrow.   So I would have to say absolutely, that's a big component of playing well here this week.   Drive your ball.  
   
 Q.   Thank you.   Good luck the rest of the way.
