TONY ROMO: For tomorrow, I think the most important thing is if I keep hitting the ball the way I am, I think I'll be able to score. I just finished poorly. Those are the scoring holes, 16, 17, 18. You want to come out of there with at least at minimum five points, which is one birdie and two pars. And really you're looking to make at least two birdies. And today to finish with zero points was a good eight points, six to eight points less than what you're hoping for.
But the rest of the day was really good. Hit the ball well. If I keep hitting the ball the way I am, I think I'll be okay.
Q. Obviously Kyle Williams is leading this thing. There's never been a lineman up in this part of the world in the tournament.
TONY ROMO: I love it.
Q. Your thoughts on a lineman competing here.
TONY ROMO: I'm excited, because Kyle, he did the four-ball I think a couple years ago and played really well and got far in the USGA Best Ball match, but I feel like he's obviously improved and continue to improve. He's got a great swing. He's a great guy. I'm happy for his score today, I think it's cool. But he put up 25, that's not easy; that's a lot of points, especially on some greens that are very difficult. And it will be fun. Hopefully he keeps playing well and hopefully I can make a run at him at some point.
Q. Do you remember any personal battles with him on the field?
TONY ROMO: He was a great lineman. That's the other part, you don't see a lot of linemen come out and play great golf. And he's just a rare guy who has a unique ability for hand/eye coordination and to take that to the golf course. And so I think you're seeing that. But that was a really good score he had today. Impressive round of golf.
