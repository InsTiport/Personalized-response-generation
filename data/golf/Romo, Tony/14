 Q.   Tony, chances on tomorrow:   What do you think you need to do to win this thing?  
TONY ROMO:     Well, I think I gotta make some putts.   It's been‑‑ I've kind of got my stroke down where I feel comfortable finally putting on these greens.   And hopefully that will carry over to tomorrow.  
But you hit some good shots, you'll have a chance.  
   
 Q.   Biggest competition?   Does it matter?   Is it just you?  
TONY ROMO:     There's a bunch of guys who can win.   A lot of scores.   But if I play well I like my chances, but there's a bunch of guys who can win this.
