Q.  Mike, does it feel good to be back out here?

MIKE SCHUCHART:   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  It's good to see a lot of guys that I came out with and played a little bit with.  Kind of like reunion week a little bit.  It's been fun to see guys that have had success and been out here for a long time.  Good to get back and play in this arena again. 


Q.  Where did you finish? 

MIKE SCHUCHART:   I finished at 7-over.  It's just brutal.  I didn't putt great.  I hit the ball okay, but just okay; not good.  I don't know how many times I hit it one or two steps out of the fairway and you've just got nothing.  Chipping out, chipping out, having to get it up-and-down from 100 yards, 150 yards, it's just relentless, shot after shot after shot after shot. 

But that's the way it should be.  If you go out there and take care of your business and get in the fairway, get some good shots in there and make a few putts, you can shoot a good score.  I played with Aaron Baddeley, who shot 69, and played great, really solid. 


Q.  How is the course, PGA Championship style?

MIKE SCHUCHART:   Very much.  So there's some difficult holes out there, 17 and 18 are just brutal, and 1, right at the start.  There's some good opportunities to make some birdies.  Just one of those that you just cannot let up and you just cannot hit any wayward shots.  You're going to pay the price out there. 


Q.  How did you feel out there today?

MIKE SCHUCHART:   Surprisingly I felt pretty good.  I was a little nervous Tuesday and Wednesday, but I got out there and I felt really pretty good.  Just kind of go out there do the same thing did I today, hit a few more fairways.
