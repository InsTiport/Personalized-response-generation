 Q.  Awesome round today.  From what I could tell, I think it was the lowest round you've since maybe your rookie season.  What was different today?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I was just making putts.   
 Q.  How important was it for you to make that last putt on 18 to get up and down?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I just wanted to make the up and down.  I think it was my only bunker shot of the day, so just one out of one is good.   
 Q.  Yeah.  Working on anything in particular since Bahamas?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: No.  Just doing the same things I've been doing.   
 Q.  Anything new at all for you?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: No.  Just putts are dropping now.   
 Q.  Do you like this course in particular, the greens?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah, I like desert golf courses.   
 Q.  Do you have a lot of experience playing desert golf courses?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Just enough.   
 Q.  Fits your eye?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: It fits my eye.  We won nationals here my junior year.  Yeah, my junior year in college.   
 Q.  Here in Arizona?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah.  I think we played Longbow.   
 Q.  Okay.  Cool.  Thank you.
