 Q. Stellar round out there today. You've had some success here in the past. Can you take us through your round today?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I hit some really good drivers out there. I think I hit about 12 fairways, just the putts started going in.  
   
 Q. I noticed I think it was your caddie was saying, seemed like a lot more things were just rolling in for you; something was on your side. Did you feel that way or was it a game plan that you guys had with each other?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: We were just trying to stay in the moment and just take one shot at a time.  
   
 Q. Is this a course that kind of fits your game?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah, I like it a lot. Yeah, I had a top 10 here, I think, two years back.  
   
 Q. Anything in particular that suits your game at this place?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: No, it's just a golf course.   
   
 Q. The conditions seemed pretty great out there today. Obviously a little bit different weather this morning, probably meant as you made the turn things changed a little bit. Did that affect your play at all?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: No, it was just a little bit windier on the front side, my second nine. That was really it.  
   
 Q. You mentioned you played pretty well in 2012, T9. Does that bring back good memories coming back to Portland? Is it an environment that you like playing in?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: It helps. I'm staying with friends. I stay with two really awesome ladies. They've got a really cute dog and they just kind of distract me during the week.  
   
 Q. Did you know them from before?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah, I know Ann. You saw Ann, the one I talked to in the pink. She used to be the assistant athletic director out at NSU.  
   
 Q. Really?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah.  
   
 Q. So you guys kind of go back a little bit?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah.  
   
 Q. So some familiar faces out here. Did you stay with her last year, 2012, as well?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah.  
   
 Q. Have you been in contention in a tournament before, in this position?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Probably once at Manulife my rookie year.  
   
 Q. So any different tomorrow or do you just try to forget where you're at?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I'm just going to go do the same thing I did today, hit fairways, hit greens and just roll some putts.  
   
 Q. Is there anything in particular you'll be working on this afternoon?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: No.  
   
 Q. Did something click for you coming into the tournament or did it just kind of happen?   
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I mean, I've been hitting it really well. I just wasn't making putts. I switched putters this week. I went to a Cure putter. It seems to be working well for me.  
   
 Q. Did you have a few days to practice with that or you just kind of changed last minute?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I picked it up Monday afternoon.  
   
 Q. It seems to be going pretty well for you?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Looks like it.  
   
 Q. Now, I know that we've still got a lot of play going on in the afternoon, as well. Do you think your score will hold up?  
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Maybe. If not, it's not a big deal. There's still three more rounds.
