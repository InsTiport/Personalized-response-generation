Q. The position that you're in, how good of a feeling is this right now?
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: It feels great.  I made a lot of putts today, and I think that helped.
Q. Will there be some pressure?  Are you nervous about being in this kind of position?
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Probably excited, a little bit nervous.  If you're not nervous, I think you probably just don't care, so yeah, there are a little bit of nerves, but I'm looking forward to it.
Q. To put together a day like this on a Saturday, what was working for you?
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Ball-striking was good, and I just dropped a lot of putts.
Q. Tell us about that last putt.
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: I watched Marina's putt.  It was a really good line, and I just wanted to make mine.
Q. You're setting yourself up for a solid day for Sunday.
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: Yeah, I like being in contention.  It feels good.
Q. Is it a place you're comfortable?
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: In college I was there often.  We'll find out tomorrow.
Q. How are the course conditions different today than the last two days when it was hot and dry but not a lot of wind?  Was it trickier today or was it easier today?
SANDRA CHANGKIJA: It's a little bit softer, and it got windier maybe towards the back nine today.
