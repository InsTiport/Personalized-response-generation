Q.   David, a really solid golf tournament, top‑5 finish issue.   But I know you had higher aspirations at the start of the day?
DAVID TOMS:   Oh, sure.   You know, but a lot of people had a chance.   I'm surprised the scoring wasn't better today.   It was not a hard day.   I just didn't have it today.   I was a little bit off off the tee.   And never did get a real good yardage with my iron shots.   So I was kind of just making weird swings trying to get the right distance.   And luckily I putted pretty well, so that kind of kept me in there.

Q.   You had a lot of momentum, birdies at 5, 6 and 7.   And then as you mentioned, started with the two ball?
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, nine I tried to play safe off the tee, short of the bunkers, and I missed it right.   But I luckily got out of there. 

Q.   Really good par. 
DAVID TOMS:   And 10, I thought I hit a good tee shot and I was over there behind a tree, and I had to hit it out right and I three‑putted.   So that was kind of the start of it. 
And then a bad tee ball at 12.   Bad tee shot at 13.   Bad tee shot at 14.   So just didn't quite have it today.

Q.   Battled to the end, though.   A really good tournament.
DAVID TOMS:   Thank you very much.
