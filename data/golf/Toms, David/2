DAVID TOMS: I felt good about the way I played this week.  Obviously 13-under in a major championship.  Like I said earlier, we would've had a really good tournament this year if it wasn't for Steve.  But, no, I felt good about it.  Obviously you want to come here and you want to play well, defending a title.  Playing as well as I did the first day, and just added a little bonus to it.
Just a fun week.  The people were so nice, the volunteers, the fans, everything around the campus.  Just my wife and my daughter and I had a wonderful week, and just want to say thank you to everyone that organized this here.  It's been certainly a good week for us.
Q. And you played so well today, 2-under 68 today on a day in which the course was playing the most difficult it had all week long.
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, it was very difficult to get the ball close to the hole.  And any time you tried, you end up in a bad spot, which I did a couple times today.  I felt a lot better about the way I played today than yesterday.  It was a pretty easy couple under par today.  A few putts here or there that could have gone in, it would have been a real nice day.
But the way Steve is playing, it would have had to be something really special to even have a chance.  I can take a lot a way from this week.  The putter felt better this week than it has in a long time, which gives me a lot of confidence moving forward.
Q. Good luck this season.  Thank you for joining us.
DAVID TOMS: Thank you.
