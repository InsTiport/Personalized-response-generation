 Q.  You're nine for nine now in the first round of this event.  Any specific reason?  You've never lost here in the first round. 
 DAVID TOMS:  Well, it's unfortunate Zach and I had to play each other today.  We're good friends, and one of not many Americans in the field.  We went out there and played.  I got up early, got a couple up after the first two holes, and then Zach made a nice little run there, got back to even.  It was an up-and-down match, and fortunately for me I came out on top in the end.  My back started hurting me out there midway through the round and I was able to get through it okay and I've got to get that worked on this afternoon so I'll be okay for tomorrow. 

 Q.  How hard is that when something starts acting up?  If you swing differently it can start acting up more? 
 DAVID TOMS:  I just think you're just trying to get through the round, and -- but a lot of times it makes you really concentrate on each shot and take your time out there.  It was really slow.  Today the pace of play was real slow, so I had plenty of time to kind of regroup myself and get through it. 

 Q.  Just going back to that nine and nine, do you have a different mentality for match play?  Do you kind of have it figured out? 
 DAVID TOMS:  No, I've just played well in a lot of the matches.  Other times I've just kind of gotten by.  That's the way match play is, you just never know what you're going to get.  You just go out there and just play.
