Q.
Nice to win early and get off your feet for a while? 

DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, it is.  I played okay today, hit my second shots going a little bit left all day so I was struggling with that, had to get up-and-down a few times, but the back nine I started playing much better, so I'm looking forward to this afternoon. 


Q.
How is your stamina?  You mentioned that you haven't played a lot of golf.  

DAVID TOMS:  Well, my legs feel fine really, and with this soft ground it's no problem on my hand, either, so I don't think it's going to be a factor. 


Q.
And as far as your match this afternoon? 

DAVID TOMS:  Well, either Harrington or Estes, I've played with both guys, know them very well, so either guy will be a tough match.  I've just got to go out and play good.
