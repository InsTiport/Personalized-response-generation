  Q.  Lot of wind out there, gosh.   
 DAVID TOMS:  It was, like you said, a windy day.  It was tough to play, you know, good golf today.  Tough to score.  I hung in there pretty well and had a good solid day.   
 I gave some shots back with a double on 12 and a couple of bogeys.  For the most part, even par, I would take it.   
 When we started off, I knew it was going to be tough.  I'm certainly not out of it.   
  
  Q.  Would you be surprised at all if someone came in with a low score?  Doesn't look like it's going to change at this point.   
 DAVID TOMS:  Very surprised.  I see somebody maybe shooting 4-under.  Any lower than that, they played exceptionally well and probably made a lot of putts to get there.   
  
  Q.  Happy with what you did out there, though?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Very happy.  I gave some shots away, from the middle of the fairway, which I don't normally do.  I'm a little disappointed at that, but for the most part it was a good day.   
  
  Q.  Some of the guys were saying pin placement was crazy out there, probably the hardest pin placement.   
 DAVID TOMS:  We had a lot of back pins into the wind and a lot of front pins down wind.  It made it very difficult to get down close.  It was a good day to shoot even par and get out.   
  
  Q.  David, you've been playing here for several years now.  Is this the toughest you've ever seen the course?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Today was, yeah, you know, with the added length they have and the bermuda greens, which are not receptive as the old bent grass we had, so you don't fire at the pins; you play away from a lot of pin placements.  Little bit of rough here or there.  It's tough and especially with the weather we had today makes it even more difficult.
