 Q. David, nice day out there for you. Comments on the round? 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, you know, I played pretty solid. I hit a few bad shots and I recovered well, and you know, my only bogey of the day was on 14, probably my best iron shot of the day. Hit it right at it and came up a little short and hit a bad chip and a not-so-good putt and made a bogey. Other than that, pretty solid. 

 Q. A couple of guys moved a good bit ahead of everybody else, if those two guys can fall, you're right there, just talk about game plan tomorrow?
 DAVID TOMS: I think it's going to be breezy tomorrow, so probably a little tougher to make birdies. If you do make them, you probably pick up a shot or two on the field on some holes. Just got to go out there and grind away again. 
 A tough golf course. It's going to be tough to get to some of these pins, firm greens and a little bit of breeze and so me, I just have to be really patient. 

 Q. Talk about two straight round in the 60s for you, I think you've done that one previous time in ten starts here. Talk about your career here?
 DAVID TOMS: You know, I never have played well, really well here. I've had some good rounds, but can't put my finger on it. Probably just because it's tough for me to get close to some of these pins because I'm not a high-spin player. But I like the tournament and obviously Arnold has done so much for golf. I like playing here and the weather is tremendous. Maybe tomorrow I can improve upon that.
