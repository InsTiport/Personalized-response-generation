Q.  This was two well matched teams going down to the 18th hole, most of the matches today.  What did you feel out there as you saw the day transpire?
DAVID TOMS:  As far as my afternoon match with Stewart, we had a good time.  You know, I think we missed one green in regulation.  That was the first hole.  We hit a lot of birdie putts and I just couldn't quite make them, and against two really good players in Stenson and Howell and two very powerful players.  They had a lot of short clubs into a lot of the holes.  They were a tough team, and I felt like we played well; we never gave them really anything.  We got away with a half a point there.  The way we hit the ball, we should have done better.  We should have got a point out of that.

But still, overall it was a productive day, and I felt like I played pretty well myself and felt like I hit good shots and made solid putts.  It's unfortunate where we are, 5 3, but I think if we continue to play and get a couple of breaks, start getting some putts to go in, get the momentum going on our side, we'll be just fine.
Q.  Maybe the team got the butterflies out of the system maybe?
DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, I felt pretty nervous when we first started off today, a lot of us did, and I know we settled down as the day went on.  We grinded it out pretty hard.  I mean, every match was close, which is a good thing, and it can go either way, it just didn't go our way.
Q.  The last putt you had, how far was that?
DAVID TOMS:  It was a good putt.  I don't know how far it was, 25 feet or so, and I hit a good putt.  I really felt like it was in.

You know, it's disappointing, but at the same time, we dodged a bullet because I thought he had made his after I made mine.  But it was a good hard fought match.
