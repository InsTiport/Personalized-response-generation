 Q. 13 points. I mean, a really strong first round. What was working for you today?  
DAVID TOMS: I drove the ball really well. So there really wasn't any trouble off the tee. And hit a lot of good iron shots. Gave myself a lot of opportunities. I did hole a bunker shot early in the round, which that always is a bonus. But I left a lot of strokes out there.   
Hit a lot of good shots. Didn't really make very many putts on the back nine.  
   
 Q. What do you think of this course overall?  
DAVID TOMS: It's in great shape. You've got to be really patient with your numbers and pay attention to the wind and, you know, the altitude and everything else, where the mountain is, just everything.   
So a lot goes into it. I think experience helps. I've been around this course quite a few times now. And just had a good, solid day.  
   
 Q. Talk a little bit about No. 124 in the FedExCup standings, a little bit of work to do over the next few weeks, get into the playoffs.   
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, you know it's all about trying to get in those tournaments. Because you never know what can happen once you get in them.   
Obviously I'm not worried about my exempt status or anything because I've got other alternatives there. But I just want to play well if I'm going to be away. Missed a big junior tournament this week that my son was playing in to come out here and play.   
If I'm going to spend the time out here, I'm going to work at it, I'm going to do the best I can and enjoy playing.  
   
 Q. Whistling Straits next week. Juices get flowing a little bit when the PGA Championship rolls around.   
DAVID TOMS: Absolutely. It's a tough golf course. I'll have to bring everything I've got to have a chance there and see if I can build some confidence this week going into that.
