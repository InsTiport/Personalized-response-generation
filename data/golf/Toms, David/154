 DAVID TOMS:  It's a good golf course.  It's in great shape.  It's probably not quite as good for my game as maybe La Costa was.  It's a pretty wide golf course out here, and obviously it helps to hit the ball a long way because there's a lot of good long par 4s out there, some reachable par 5s for the long hitters, and a couple of reachable par 4s if you can bomb it pretty good. 
 But I have played well the first three days I've been here, so I'm starting to get a good feel for it.  You know, you never know.  You just play your opponent and whatever you have to do to win. 

 Q.  Let's talk about today's match.  You pretty much had this in your control from the start. 
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, I played really good.  I birdied the first hole and went 1-up and made a lot of birdies today.  I think I made six or seven in the 13 or 14 holes that we played.  And Arron was a little bit rusty.  He hasn't been able to play any golf.  I felt bad for him. 
 A few shots where he would normally stuff it in there pretty close with short clubs he'd miss the green.  He was a little disappointed with that.  But no, it's just good to see him back out here. 

 Q.  You've suffered from injuries.  Do you think his injury had a lot to do with it? 
 DAVID TOMS:  Oh, yeah, not so much -- not that he scored bad today or anything, but just -- it's hard to really dial in your shots, know where the ball is going, feel good about your short game when you haven't played any golf, especially against the caliber of field that we have here and on a good golf course.  It's tough. 

 Q.  Finally, looking ahead to round two, not sure right now, it's tied between Davis and  Crane, any preference? 
 DAVID TOMS:  I don't know.  I know I'll have to play well to beat either guy, and if I can go out and play like I did today, I'll have a chance.
