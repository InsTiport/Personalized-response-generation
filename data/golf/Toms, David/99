 Q. David, solid start. I followed you on the back nine. You gotta be pleased with that. 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, yeah, I played good all day, rolled in some nice putts. Some of these pins make you a little defensive, and I had some bad yardages the last few holes and couldn't make a real aggressive swing. So that kind of disappointed me, bogeyed last, but overall I drove it in play and bogeyed the first hole and the last hole, and everything in between was pretty solid.

 Q. I've admired your putting stroke for a long time, and today it looked really good. Have you been working on that?
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah. It felt really good, and you know, I hate to miss that last one on the last hole. I hit it right where I wanted to, but it just kind of hit a bump there and missed it. 
 So it feels good. I just need to keep setting myself up, I'll be all right.

 Q. Now you have your early tee time tomorrow. Course should be pristine. That could be an advantage for you. 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah. What a nice place. The weather has been perfect. Today was great scoring conditions. Hopefully we'll get the same thing tomorrow when we get out here.

 Q. Thanks, David. 
 DAVID TOMS: Thank you.
