Q.
Talk about the match?
DAVID TOMS:  It was a tough match, we kind of went back and forth.  He got up on me early, I came back throughout the round and played really well.  And I think 13 was probably the key hole in our match because I had just gone back to even with two birdies and I hit it in really close and he made birdie before me and I missed.  So he went 1-up.  And then he birdied 16.

So it was tough.  He missed a putt on 15 and other than that the whole day it seemed like he made every one he had to make.  But, you know, it was fun.  It was what the Ryder Cup is all about.  Either one of us had -- both of us had a chance to win and I just wished that our, the whole match, the whole matches would have been a little bit closer and it would have been even more intense going in.  But it was fun.
