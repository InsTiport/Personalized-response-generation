 Q. All right, David. Round of even par, but you're still in the tournament. You're only a couple shots back. It's gotta feel pretty good knowing that you're still in it even though not an impressive day.
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, yeah. It was -- you know, the wind was a factor today. We haven't seen the golf course play with this much wind from this direction, and I made the mistake on a couple of tee boxes hitting the wrong clubs, hit a couple balls in the rough there on the back nine, and I made a couple bogeys and really didn't make any putts all day. 
 So to be still only a couple shots back, I'm happy with where I am, and I just know I need to play good tomorrow.

 Q. And so you're going into tomorrow, is there anything you need to work on or is it just a matter of getting some putts to drop?
 DAVID TOMS: Well, you know, that and play a little smarter, hit some better shots. Just overall I need to play better tomorrow. I need to play like I did the first day and be in total control, putt well and get some birdies up there quick.

 Q. If the wind's out there -- does the wind direction change out you attack the course?
 DAVID TOMS: It does. Hopefully it'll blow the same direction tomorrow if it blows like it did today. At least we've seen the course like that. I mean my caddy hadn't seen it. I hadn't seen it that direction that hard. So it was definitely a factor today for us.
