 Q.   Four birdies, pretty good on this course?  
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, I scrambled good the first nine.   
And then the back nine, I started hitting a lot of good shots and made a couple of birdies coming in.   
Overall, kind of what you have to do in a major championship to post a good round.  
   
 Q.   Odd birdie on 17.   That's been one of the tougher holes?  
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, I had right at 250 out of the rough.   I hit a 3â€‘wood, just hit it perfect.   Got out of that first cut over there and ran up on the green.   Zach gave me a good read on my putt; he putted right before me and I made a long one.   
I think I was even par on that hole for the week, which is probably a couple of shots ahead of most people.   So I played that hole pretty well.  
   
 Q.   You seem to like PGA courses?  
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, I've had success over the years in this tournament.   I guess I get up for it a little bit being a former champion and you always have the champions dinner.   You have your name on a parking spot out there in the parking lot.   Maybe that has something to do with it, but I certainly enjoy playing here.  
   
 Q.   What did you get for the gift this year?   
DAVID TOMS:   The gift, some kind of a Bose speaker, which I'm sure my kids will take that as soon as it comes in the mail.
