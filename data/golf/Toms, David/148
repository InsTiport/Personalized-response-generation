 Q.  Thoughts on his round. 

 DAVID TOMS:  It was a good round today.  I shot even par on a Sunday at the Masters.  So I'm pretty pleased. 

 Q.  Did you still think you were in it? 

 DAVID TOMS:  Maybe after number 10 I was still in it because the leaders were at 2-over and nobody had made the big move. 

 At that point I figured I still had a chance.  But I let it slip away when I bogeyed 11 and 12.
