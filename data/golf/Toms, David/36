 Q.   Impressive round today.   What was going well for you?  
DAVID TOMS:   You know, I hit the ball about like I did yesterday, but I made some putts early, so I got under par and got on a roll.   And I had two different times during the round where I made three birdies in a row.   So that was really the story of the day.  
Only bogey of the day was a 3‑putt on the next to the last hole and kind of mis‑clubbed and then I had a long putt and I three‑putted.   But came back and birdied the last.   So made up for it.  
   
 Q.   Did you notice the difference in the conditions between yesterday afternoon and this morning?  
DAVID TOMS:   It was pretty soft, and we had some mud on the ball today.   We had a little bit yesterday, but quite a bit today, almost every hole.  
The course is playing long, but I was real patient and just played.   I knew I was playing good, and I ended up with a solid round.  
   
 Q.   Was there a couple of shots out there that really maybe got you on a roll?  
DAVID TOMS:   Not really.   I guess early on when I birdied, what did I do, I birdied 11, 12 and 13.   I hit some really solid shots there.   I made a lengthy putt on 13, probably from about 25 or 30 feet.   So that got me on a roll there and then was able to birdie the par‑5 after that, so I was 4‑under early.   And just kind of held on and started making some birdies on the front.
