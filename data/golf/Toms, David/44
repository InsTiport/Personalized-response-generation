Q.   Here with David Toms.   David, 17 of 18 greens.   That seems like David Toms golf.   What went so well for you on this day?
DAVID TOMS:   Pretty much kept it in play all day.   I had a couple of drives in the rough, but for the most part I was in the fairway.   And had some good clubs out there, so I tried to attack some of the holes with the greens being receptive. 
I wish I would have putted a little bit better.   I had a chance to have a really good round today if I could have got some putts on go in on the Back 9, but overall I've played really solid golf for two days and I'm right in the hunt of where I wanted to be starting the weekend.

Q.   With all these names going into the weekend, is solid golf going to be enough or are you going to have to really do something special to beat this leaderboard?
DAVID TOMS:   Well, we'll wait and see.   I think the winds are going to pick up a little bit from what I saw on the sheet today, so that'll make a little bit of difference.   Maybe shrink the fairways down a little bit and the greens when they put them on the edges.   So the course will probably play a little tougher.   But with the leaderboard you see some names that have been there before, so you'll have to go out and play good golf.   That's for sure.
