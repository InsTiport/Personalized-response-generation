DAVID TOMS:   I played good, solid golf today.  Early in the round, I struggled a little bit off the tee.  I guess I missed three fairways in the front, but I was able to save par on those holes.  On the back side I drove it great.  I just couldn't get the irons close to the hole.  I wasn't able to really make any birdies and I made a mistake from the fairway on 16.  I hit my wedge over the green trying to be too aggressive and got in the bunker and didn't get up-and-down. 
 
Q.  How difficult was it coming back off of lat weekend? 
 
DAVID TOMS:   It's not hard.  When you are playing good golf, you look forward to the rounds.  I got out there and hit a good tee shot right off the bat.  Set me up, made birdie.  Hit it real close.  Hit it two feet on the first hole.  Made birdie; so that got me off to a pretty good start.  
 
Q.  I'm sure everybody is asking you whether you are going to be tired.  Do you get tired of people asking you whether you are tired?
 
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, but, you know, I am tired.  I'll get to rest plenty in the next couple weeks.  I'm not playing at all.  This week I just want to go ahead and continue to play good golf and worry about being tired later. 
 
Q.  Do you notice any difference in the way they react   --
 
DAVID TOMS:   There's a lot of people out there cheering for me and "saying nice going last week" and obviously a lot of people watched the golf tournament last week, and I'm just glad our sport is becoming more popular.
