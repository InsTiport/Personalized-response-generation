  Q. Just a little bit short of Zach, good week for you, though?  
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, it was. It's a good start. You know, I needed to get off to a good start after the way last year was. I was hoping to obviously get a victory today, but Zach played awfully well. I was proud of the way I hung in there and put pressure on him, and through the whole back nine. He's a good player and tough to beat.  
  
  Q. What does this do for your confidence level?   
 DAVID TOMS: I just had a chance today to win, and all the way to the end. If that doesn't give you confidence, nothing will. I can take a lot from this week, that's for sure.  
  
  Q. Schedule the next few weeks?  
 DAVID TOMS: I'm playing the next two, so hopefully I can get right back in it.
