DAVID TOMS:  I'm pretty excited about it.  Brett is an exciting type of player and I need to play some steady golf and let him play his style, his kind of go for broke style and hope it works well for us.  I think it will be a good pairing for us.

As far as who we play, Sergio and Jos√© are a big part of their victories in the past and are great players.  We're going to have to play good golf to beat them, but rightfully so.  I look forward to the challenge.
