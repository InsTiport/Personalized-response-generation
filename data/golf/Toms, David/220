Q.   Take away two holes this week and you've got an incredible week going.  Talk about 18.  You just got in some trouble?
DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, I didn't drive the ball great today.  Even though I was hitting it in the fairway, I wasn't hitting it very solid, and it finally came back to haunt me on the last hole.  With the pin on the left side, the worst place you could possibly hit it would be the left rough, and I just chopped it around.  I was kind of hot after my tee shot and I didn't really concentrate and tried to get it up and down for bogey and threw away another shot there.
Q.   You were under some trees there?
DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, I was, off the tee, and I didn't have a shot to get back to the fairway.  I hit a hit and hope shot, didn't work out, and made double.
Q.   Talk about your week overall, though.  You're tied for 2nd, five shots off the lead, but talk about tomorrow.  Anything can happen.
DAVID TOMS:  I felt like I played well at times today, and at times I struggled a little bit.  I just need to get off to a good start tomorrow.  If I can do that, maybe I'll put some pressure on the leader.

Stewart is having a good year and he's playing good, and this is a good golf course for him, and he's a U.S. Open type player, and this golf course is playing a lot like that, although it's soft.  I'd look for him to play well, and I think somebody is going to have to come up with a good score to catch him.
