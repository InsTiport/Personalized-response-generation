Q.
What effect, if any, did the rain have on conditions as you went through the round?
DAVID TOMS:  As long as you take your time, get everything dried off, it made the golf course play easier.  The greens are receptive.  The fairways are a little more receptive than they were yesterday.

Maybe a little added length, but not too bad.  We are still getting some roll out there.

So for me it was just all about making sure your grip is right, keeping your club face as dry as possible.  Just concentrate.  A lot of times the rain can affect your concentration if you get yourself in a hurry.  But it was playing slow enough out there that it wasn't a problem.
Q.  How do you assess your position going into the weekend?
DAVID TOMS:  I've got myself back in the golf tournament today.  I needed a good round.  Certainly wanted to make the cut but I wanted to get myself back into contention to have a chance come the weekend and I was able to do that with a great round today.
