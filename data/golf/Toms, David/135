 Q.  When you look back on this Presidents Cup, what will you remember most about it? 
 DAVID TOMS:  I think our team.  We really had a good mix of young guys, some old guys like myself and we just seemed to gel really well together and we practiced really well and we just had fun.  That's what usually happens; when you have fun, you play good golf, and we did that this week. 

 Q.  You will lead the week as the top point-getter; did you have a sense you were playing that well, and that you could accomplish that? 
 DAVID TOMS:  I got some good partners this week.  I played with Tiger when he was playing well; and Woody Austin, the way he finished up one day, and today I played well.  Overall I think it's attributed to the fact that I played pretty solid, and I was stuck with some good partners.
