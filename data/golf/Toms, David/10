Q. You got off to a cracking start today.
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I did.  I got off to a really good start.  Birdied the first three holes and made some nice putts.  That helped a lot, and I knew it was going to be a tough day.  I knew that I had to shoot a low score on the front nine because the back nine coming into the wind was going to be very difficult.  I was watching the guys play as we were going down the fairways, but I just knew that you had to hang on the back nine.
So I was fortunate, 6-under through ten and 5-under for the day, I'll definitely take that.
Q. How nice is it for you to be back here playing a links course?
DAVID TOMS: It's a lot of fun.  I just wanted to enjoy the trip.  My family is over here with me and some friends and it was all about coming here and enjoying the history and experience of St. Andrews.  If I played great, that's a bonus, and obviously I got off to a good enough start to where I have a chance.  So just got to go out there and play really well tomorrow.
Q. Nice to finish with a birdie on 18?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, it's always nice.  You know, with bogey on 17, it's nice to get it right back on 18.
Q. How much confidence after winning a few weeks ago?
DAVID TOMS: It always helps with confidence and that's a big part of golf, knowing that you can make a putt or hit the shot under pressure.  I hope next time I'm in position, I'll do the same or at least have a chance.
