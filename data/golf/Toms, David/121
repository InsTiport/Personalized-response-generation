   DAVID TOMS: I played good. I drove the ball in play except for 16 and 9. All of the other holes, I was in good shape off the tee. I had opportunities.   
 I think I had a good day out there today. The wind was tough to pull a club. It changed about halfway through the round. It was always northerly, but we had some northeast to start, northwest to finish, and made for some tough iron shots with the pins we had.  
  
  Q. Is it by coincidence that so many veterans are at the top of this leaderboard?   
 DAVID TOMS: I don't know. You've got some guys that have been around this track a lot, so that might have something to do with it.  
 Also, it's a tough golf course. You really have to play your way around. It's a lot like a major championship where you need to hit the fairway. And even from the middle of the fairway, there are not a lot of pins you can shoot at. So you really have to golf your ball, and makes for a good, tough track.  
  
  Q. And not only did you golf your ball in making three birdies today, but no bogeys on your round.   
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, that's good to go around this golf course. I think I kept it in play and that's the reason I was able to make a lot of pars. Made a couple of decent putts for birdie. Just a good, solid day for me.
