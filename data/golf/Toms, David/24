DAVID TOMS
Q. David, what a great start to the tournament.  Not just the round, but the way you actually began, starting at the 10th?
DAVID TOMS: Yes.  Played really solid.  The first nine holes was real solid golf, made some nice putts, hit some close shots, then birdied my 10th hole today, and after that I really didn't make anything and I had a 3-putt from long range on a par-3.  But felt very good the way I played today.  As wet as it was out there and the golf course was playing long, so I had to hit the fairways to have a chance, and I was able to do that for the most part, and just hit a lot of quality shots.
Q. How is the golf course playing?
DAVID TOMS: Well, as long as you hit the fairway and you get to clean your ball off, it's not so bad.  But you get in the rough at all and you're going to struggle to try to hit any quality shots at all or get the ball close to the hole.
Greens are fantastic, so if you read them well, you gotta play the grain.  They're a little bit grainy, but they're rolling nice, so gotta take your time on the greens and get a good line, and put a good stroke on it.  If you do that, you'll make a lot.
Q. Great start.  Well played.
DAVID TOMS: All right.  Thank you.
