Q. David, you played well today.  49 years young.  What did you do well?
DAVID TOMS: I kept the ball in play and hit some real good iron shots; hit a couple up close, and unfortunately I bogeyed two of the easier holes on the golf course in No. 2 and No. 9, which was on my back nine.
Other than that, it was really solid golf.
Q. As a veteran, you have learned to shake those things off.  What's the key coming back tomorrow?
DAVID TOMS: Well, I mean, you learn a lot about yourself over the years.  Always got to be level-headed and try not to get too far up, too far down.  Certainly hated the end with a bogey there on a birdieable hole, I'll come out tomorrow and try to get that first tee shot in the fairway and go from there.
Q. It was a gorgeous morning today.  How did you find the conditions?
DAVID TOMS: It was good once we started.  Had  a little fog delay early on, but that was fine.  Helped us wake up before we tee'd off, because we had a really early time.
Yeah, conditions were good.  Not much wind today; it was pretty soft; we had a few mud balls, but not too bad.
Overall the golf course is in great shape.
