 DAVID TOMS: Staying right around the lead, that's what I need to do. What I'm missing is that really solid round when I need it.   
  
  Q. Any sense, we all know what Phil's gone through, but any sense that emotionally, is he there?  
 DAVID TOMS: I think so. He's grinding pretty hard. I think he was probably trying to find it off the tee a little bit. He hit some wayward shots and that cost him a lot of strokes.   
 But as far as the competitive spirit and everything, it seems like he's into it and we're out there joking around a little bit. I think he's fine emotionally and he probably has not been able to put the time in with his golf game that he wants to but he finished up great.   
 I hope he makes the cut; making eagle on 7 and making the shot at 8 and playing 9 solid, that's the way to finish up. Maybe he will be around on the weekend.  
  
  Q. How tough was it?   
 DAVID TOMS: It was obviously tougher than yesterday but you can still score. The greens are receptive. I just didn't putt well today. I putted really well yesterday and today was totally different on the greens for me.
