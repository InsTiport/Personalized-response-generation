  Q. I've got David Toms. All right. David, this is almost a second home course here. You played well again.  
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I had a good day. I got off to a good start. Birdied three of the first four holes, and then I kind of gave it back in the middle round and I finished well.  
 So, you know, it's a good score, 3-under is a good score. The wind came up this afternoon and the golf course played pretty tough.  
  
  Q. This golf course can come back and get you, won't it? The 3-under, that's why it's a nice score.  
 DAVID TOMS: There are a lot of good holes now. Some pretty demanding par-4s. The par-3s are pretty tough. You have to take advantage of your scoring opportunities when you get them and, you know, today I just had a good solid round.  
  
  Q. Why does it play so hard? It doesn't look it.  
 DAVID TOMS: I think the fairways are, you know, firmed up. So you got to hit good shots to get in the fairway, and then they put the pins in some corners of the greens, and then the greens are tough. You know, you don't see guys just making a ton of putts out there. You've got grain. You'll be into the grain and down grain and speed is always a factor in your putting, and so just a pretty difficult golf course.  
  
  Q. Congratulations again on a good first round.  
 DAVID TOMS: Thank you.
