DAVID TOMS: Well, I got off to a great start.  That's always nice birdieing the first two holes.  I guess I birdied 5 as well to go 3-under early.  I just kept the ball in play.  That's really the key.  Even though I missed a few greens out there, I was able to get up-and-down.   
But I'm playing from the fairway.  It's a lot easier to control your ball.  And especially with this altitude and everything else in the rough is tough, like everyone knows.   
So I think keeping the ball in play was really key today.  And my speed on the greens was exceptional until the last hole.  Then I left it short and had to make a tough one for par.   
 Q.  You gutted it out, though, right in the center.  As the week has gone on, do you feel like these greens have become easier to read?  
DAVID TOMS: You know, for me it's been an interesting week.  I'm sure everyone knows my son had to caddie my first two rounds because my caddie was in the hospital for a little while.  And just doing everything I can to read the putts correctly.  And still having trouble.   
And speed is the biggest thing, because even if you misread it, if you can get the right speed you can just go tap it in.  That will be the key tomorrow.  It's just continuing to have good speed on the greens, keep the ball in play and see what we can do.   
 Q.  Other than that, does the game plan change at all?  
DAVID TOMS: I don't think so.  I mean, obviously you see what the weather does.  If it gets breezy you might be more conservative into the greens so you don't get in a bad spot.  But for the most part just keep believing in what I'm doing.  I feel like I'm swinging at it well off the tee.  Hitting good iron shots and, like I said, speed on the greens is key.
