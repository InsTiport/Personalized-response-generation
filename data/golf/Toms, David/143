 Q.  David, first of all, welcome back to the TPC River Highland.  You've been away for a while.  Finally it fits into your schedule? 
 DAVID TOMS:  Yes.  And what a great day for golf we had, perfect weather.  It's a little cooler up here than in Louisiana where I live right now.  I look forward to the week ahead.  I had a good solid day today and I like the golf course. 

 Q.  Eagles are good, that 13 is a fun hole to play? 
 DAVID TOMS: I hit a real good drive and hit a 5-wood up there to eight feet and made a nice putt.  It's good to follow-up a great shot and capitalize on the putt. 

 Q.  Talk about your game.  You played well at Memphis, four rounds at the Open.  You have a lot going on. 
 DAVID TOMS:  I feel good about it.  I thought today I had a chance to shoot a good round of golf, I had a lot of good quality shots.  I hit the water on 17 and it cost me there, but I feel good about my game right now. 

 Q.  This golf course, it's very interesting as far as TPC courses go, isn't it.  It's really different from really all the elements? 
 DAVID TOMS: A lot can happen out there. You have a drivable par 4, you have reachable par 5.  You have a lot of water on the last few holes.  The front nine is pretty strong.  I had a couple good solid holes there.  A lot can happen.  It's typical of a TPC course. 

 Q.  Great open of 67, congratulations. 
 DAVID TOMS: Thank you. 

 Q.  (Inaudible) are you starting to look at the FedExCup points? 
 DAVID TOMS:  All of the above.  On top of having a new sponsor, Travelers is obviously trying to pump up the event a little bit and raise the level of the field and the tournament.  All those things.  I was up here for the U.S. Open and CVS, which is right down the street, and I felt I was playing well and that I could play this golf course.  And it's been a long time since I've been here, and I remember  playing here.
