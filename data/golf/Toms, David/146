  Q.  It's an up-and-down day for you but you finished well.  Are you pleased with the way things went for you all day long?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, it was a good solid round, although conditions were ideal today to score.  It's a long golf course still for me.  The ball is still not chasing like you would hope it would.  3-under is a good, solid score.   
  
  Q.  I heard one of the fans say David left a lot out there.  Do you feel the same way?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, because I was in control all day.  I had a couple of wayward drives, but for the most part I kept the ball in the fairway and could attack at the pins and everything.   
 I just had a good, solid day, nothing fantastic, and I'm right in the golf tournament.   
  
  Q.  When you're playing in conditions like this, the golf course isn't at difficult as it could be, is it?   
 DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, you're right.  With the fairways soft and not much wind, the golf course plays a lot wider than it would if it got windy and firm so therefore you can kind of take a good swing at it and some of those bombers can get it out there and get some short clubs in.  If the wind stays down you'll see the scoring pretty good.
