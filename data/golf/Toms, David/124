  Q. Good week out there, -12. Your thoughts on this one?  
 DAVID TOMS: It was a good week. Anytime you have that high of a finish starting the week, you'd definitely take that. You know, a key to me was I just didn't play the front nine very good. If I could have played the front nine at all, I could have been right there at the end.   
 It's unfortunate, but it's getting closer, the game is getting better, and I really enjoyed my week here.  
  
  Q. Big difference, though, front nine, tougher to score out here?  
 DAVID TOMS: It is. I mean, you don't have a couple of those little short holes and the par-5, and it's definitely harder to score. You've got to get it early on the front nine, and I was never able to do that.  
  
  Q. What did you think of the crowds out here, and specifically 16?  
 DAVID TOMS: I mean, it's fun. I think all the guys that come here and play this week, they know what they're getting into. It's one of those things where you just enjoy the moment. I wish we had some more like that out here on the TOUR. It would make for some interesting weeks for sure.  
  
  Q. Are you going to watch the game tonight, and do you have a rooting interest?  
 DAVID TOMS: I'm pulling for the Cardinals. Early Doucet, I watched him play a lot and got to know him when he was at LSU. Hopefully he'll get in the game some and have a big touchdown catch or something like that to control the outcome of the game.
