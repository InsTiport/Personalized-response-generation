  Q.  Talking about his round.   

 DAVID TOMS:  Actually, I played pretty well today.  I got back in it on the front and then couldn't pick a club on the back nine (with the wind.)   

It got to the point where you didn't worry about the ball moving on the greens.  I didn't knock myself out of it.  When it plays like this, the ones who hit fairways have the advantage.   

 These conditions place a premium on driving the ball straight more than ever.
