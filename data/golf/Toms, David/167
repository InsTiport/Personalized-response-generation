Q.
Some thoughts on your round today.
DAVID TOMS:  I didn't play very good today.  You know, it was a struggle.  I drove it in the rough on the par 5s, which I didn't birdie any of those.  I got off to a good start, birdied the first two.  But after that, you know, I drove it in the rough on 5 and 14 and 10 and just didn't help.

We had some mud balls and I hit some booed iron shots because of that and I got kind of defensive then and started firing away from the flags and didn't feel real comfortable today.
Q.  Do you think the course played a lot different after the rain?
DAVID TOMS:  It was definitely softer and played a lot longer I thought, at least for me.  I'm one of the shorter hitters.  I liked the way it was playing before the rain.
