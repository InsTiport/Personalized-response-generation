Q.   David Toms, 67 today.  You have some experience because you played here as a kid; didn't you?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I have been coming to this golf course for a long time, this resort, a place I always enjoyed coming to and always enjoyed the nice hot weather early in the year.  But it's a little cooler today but actually last 12 holes or so were perfect.

Q.   7 wins in your PGA TOUR career but 6 in the last two years.  Give us an idea what happened over those last two years that wasn't happening to you over the last several.
DAVID TOMS: I think my ball-striking is a little bit more consistent, don't have as many bad days and when I have to hit a good shot I have been able to do that.  So I think that's really the key.  Last few years my putting has come around.  I was always a streaky putter but my putting has been more consistent, to put a lot good scores on the board.

Q.   (Inaudible)
DAVID TOMS: It warmed up the last 12 holes or so because the wind died down, it was actually perfect playing conditions.  Probably as good as I have ever seen at Doral. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
DAVID TOMS: I got off to a rocky start,  but I was able to birdie 7, 8, 9; that kind of got me going.  Then I actually birdied 10.  So I birdied four holes in a row there.  Made a long one on 15, I guess, just had a good solid round, nothing real fancy.  I didn't get the ball real close to the hole today so hopefully I can do that tomorrow. 

Q.   (Inaudible)
DAVID TOMS: I putted well today and that kind of kept me in there early when I needed it, so if I can get my ball-striking straightened out a little bit more tomorrow I believe I can shoot a low round.
