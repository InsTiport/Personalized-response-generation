Q.   200 yards, what were you thinking on the shot?
DAVID TOMS:   I had out a 4-iron because the wind picked up a little bit.   Obviously I didn't want to be short with the creek short and the wind settled before we were able to hit.   I hit a 5 and crushed it right at it.   I knew I had to hit it solid.   Went in the front fringe and rolled in like a putt.

Q.   You done for two others on your Tour career.   Do you remember those two?
DAVID TOMS:   I know I made one at the Athletic Club in the PGA in '01.   I don't know.

Q.   '05 Memorial.
DAVID TOMS:   Is I was playing with Jack and Ernie on the 4 -- I played 1, 2, 3 -- 4, par 3.   Yeah.   That was pretty special playing with Jack in his last Memorial that he played in.   It was a lot of fun.

Q.   You also win mortgage payments for a fan through the Quicken Loans sweepstakes. 
DAVID TOMS:   I hope they'll send me a thank you note.   That's a nice gift.   What a great thing, great sponsorship for them to do that.   You know, I'm sure whoever the fan is is very happy with my shot today.
