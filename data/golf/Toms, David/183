Q.
Talk about your round overall and how it was out there today.
DAVID TOMS:  Another perfect day here in Scottsdale.  I didn't do much my whole round until I made eagle on 15, and then birdied 17.  So I closed pretty well in the end.

I just didn't want to get too far away from the leaders to have a chance for tomorrow.  I'm right there.  I've just got to get off to a better start tomorrow, for sure.
Q.  Front nine playing harder than the back?
DAVID TOMS:  Not necessarily.  All the holes are tucked.  I've got longer clubs in than a lot of big hitters, so I have to really pick and choose when to be aggressive.  If not, I can make bogey.  First of all, I've got to hit my tee ball pretty solid to get it out there and then pick and choose, and maybe get off to a better start tomorrow.
Q.  What club, what distance did you have into 15?
DAVID TOMS:  I had about 210.  I hit a 5 iron.  The ball was going a long way.  I hit a good shot, made the putt.
Q.  How do you feel about these 20 year olds on top of the leaderboard?
DAVID TOMS:  You know, I kept looking at Villegas out there in those yellow pants, about 340 down the middle right in front of me every hole.  I said to Calcavecchia, "Man, that's the future of our Tour, these young guys just bombing it out there."

They're just bombing it out there and having fun playing golf in front of all these people.  More power to them.  I wish I could do it.
Q.  But you're a more mature golfer who's been there before.
DAVID TOMS:  You know, the hole is the same size for everybody.  I have no idea what goes through their head compared to what goes through my head tonight.  Sure, it's hard to win your first golf tournament, but sooner or later these guys will do it, so why not tomorrow?
