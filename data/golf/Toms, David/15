How do you go around this place without a bogey?
DAVID TOMS: I kept the ball in play and obviously my irons are pretty good.  I had a lot of opportunities today.  I misjudged a couple of clubs and was able to get it up-and-down, hit a couple of chips that I thought really had a chance.  And that was all about just being in a decent spot to get up-and-down even though I missed the green.  Obviously it's the U.S. Open; you can get in a lot of bad spot out there today.  I avoided those, and hopefully I can do the same tomorrow.
Q. Got off on a good start.  A lot of guys that had low scores today said getting off to a good start was important.
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I did.  I birdied the first two holes and I birdied five as well.  So I was 3-under early, felt like I was really in control all day.  Had a couple of near misses on the front.  I could have had a really low front nine.
And just held it in on the back.  Continue to hit good shots, hit fairways, speed on the greens was exceptional today for me.  And that's the way you have to play this golf course because you're out there, having to think so much trying to club yourself.  We had some wind that we had to factor in.  And obviously the greens are as difficult to putt as anything we'll play on.
Q. Getting better every day.  Are you learning more about this course or is it just your game is getting better?
DAVID TOMS: I think so.  You get a feel for where you need to be.  When you're in the fairway you can obviously dictate, if you're hitting your irons well where you can be below the hole or right or left of the pin to give yourself the best opportunity to putt into the mountain or whatever it might be.  But obviously you have to be in the fairway to do that.  So that's really key.
