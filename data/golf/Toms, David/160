Q.  What are some thoughts on your first match there and how you played together?
DAVID TOMS:  We played well together.  We just ran into a tough team today.  Sergio played extremely well and Olaz√°bal put in a couple birdies here and there.  It would be difficult for any team to beat.  We played pretty good together, we played pretty decent, we just got beat.
Q.  What about the next match?  You have a new partner; do you think he's going to complement your game more so?
DAVID TOMS:  Alternate shot is a different format so it's a different deal.  Stewart and I are good friends so I'm hoping we can go out and get something going this afternoon and get us a point.
