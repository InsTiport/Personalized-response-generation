Q.   You talked yesterday about staying the course the first day to be in position for the weekend.  It seems you've done that.

DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, I was a little disappointed how I finished up.  I got off to a quick start today and I had a chance to shoot a good round of golf.  I had some driver problems there about midway through the round.  I finished up okay.  I played the last few holes pretty solid.


Q.   Were you able to turn the driver problems around?

DAVID TOMS:   I drove it well the last few holes.  So it is just a matter of a timing kind of thing, and hopefully I'll work it out for tomorrow morning.


Q.   It seems like there's a large clump of people that are all together, does that speak a lot to the way the greens are on this golf course?

DAVID TOMS:   I think it's the golf course in general.  There's not a lot of birdie holes out there.  The par-5s, if you drive it in the fairway, there's a birdie opportunity there, but for the most part they put the pins on the edges of the greens which makes the greens a lot smaller than they are.  You can play away from them, hit to the middle of the green, but then you got a real long putt.  So I just think it's the type of golf course that it is and there's not a whole lot of birdies to be had out there.


Q.   The guy who wins this thing or who finishes on top on Sunday, what's he going to have to do over the weekend to get to the top?

DAVID TOMS:   No. 1, drive it in the fairway.  No. 2, have their lag putting in good shape.  There's some pins out there you got to play away from.  So you got to 2-putt from a long way, away.  So you need both of those things to be a factor.
