 Q.  You had a good start, got a birdie on 1.  Things were pretty consistent for a while.  What happened around 8 in the middle of your round?  
DAVID TOMS: 8, I missed the green, didn't get up-and-down.  9, I three-putted.  10, I hit a bad drive, and all of a sudden I was over par.  I mean, I still felt like I was playing okay, but all of a sudden instead of being 3- or 4-under, I was over par, and the wind was a little tricky the back nine, and I never made any putts, so that was the difference today.  I putted great in the pro-am yesterday, and then today, just one of those days, just never made anything.   
 Q.  So going to work on putting after today?  
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, going that way, as soon as I can grab a bite to eat.   
 Q.  Sounds like you still feel like you played well and you can make a little comeback?  
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I think so, on this golf course.  You've got to give yourself a lot of opportunities, and I did that today.  I just didn't make them.  I felt like ball-striking-wise it was a 3- or 4-under today, and I shot a couple over, so the putter was definitely the difference.   
 Q.  How disappointing is it to be 2-over, especially coming off the big win a couple weeks ago?  
DAVID TOMS: Oh, it's golf.  I mean, if I was worried about too much, I'd have to find something else to do.
