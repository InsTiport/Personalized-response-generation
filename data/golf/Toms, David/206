Q.
Good match.  Just talk about your day today so far.
DAVID TOMS:  Well, I played extremely well this morning.  Both of us played well, and it's a shame one of us had to lose.  We made a lot of birdies, not really any mistakes at all.

And so in the end I was able to come out on top, but at one point in the round I guess I was 6 under par and was only 1 up and then conceded birdie there on the last hole.  So it was a good day for me.
Q.  Do you like the fact that you're going to go right back out and play another match, or would you rather have the rest of the day and come back tomorrow?
DAVID TOMS:  The way I played today, I would say it's an advantage to go out and play some more golf, instead of having to sleep on it.  So I'll probably be tired by the end of the second round, but so will everyone else.  I might as well just get out there and start doing it again.
Q.  Vijay and Tiger both go down today; just proves anything can happen in match play?
DAVID TOMS:  You never know with this format, you know.  It's really hard to get the ball close to some of these holes.  You're always struggling with your club selection, not putting enough spin, too much spin.

It's not an easy golf course.
