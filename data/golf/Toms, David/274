Q.  Talk a little about the match. 
DAVID TOMS:   Well, he birdied two out of the first three, got me down early; and I just didn't have the game today to really come back.  I fell back a couple of time, got pretty close and then gave some holes back with some bogeys.  Just wasn't playing well enough. 
He was playing solid, hitting down the fairway, hitting it on the green; I wasn't.  So, it was tough.  The way he's playing right now, he's not making any mistakes.  Even the hole when he made bogey, he 3-putted, ran one by.  Wasn't giving me anything.  I had to earn it, and I didn't have the game to do that today.
