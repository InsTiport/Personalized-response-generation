Q.
Just comment on your round today. 

DAVID TOMS:  I felt like I played good.  We had a good match.  Niclas played very well for about 11 holes, and I started to make a few birdies coming in and turned it around and got up in the match.  Then he made a great putt on 18, a 20-footer on 18 to square the match, and then I birdied the first playoff hole and made a good putt there.  I'm happy with it and happy to be playing golf tomorrow.
