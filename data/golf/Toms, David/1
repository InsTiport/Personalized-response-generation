Q. You didn't finish the way you started, but still probably a great week I'm sure?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, any time you can shoot double digits under par in a major championship on a good golf course -- I felt good about the overall week.  Certainly after the first day, I had an opportunity to -- if I could follow that up to have a real special event, and it was going to take something pretty special to play with Steve this week because he backed up his first round with some more good play.  Obviously today it would have taken really something low to have a chance, and just didn't quite have it.
Q. And the golf course was harder and opportunities were probably minimal, right?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, a lot of the pins were tough.  Seems like any time you got too aggressive you could bounce a ball over a green or get into a bad spot short side that was tough to get up-and-down.  It played a lot more like we figured this golf course would.
Q. And you followed up your championship with a runner-up finish, just what Colin Montgomerie did after he won.  That's pretty good I guess?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, it is.  Makes me feel good about what I'm doing and my golf game.  Just to be able to even have a chance defending -- a lot of times you put a lot of pressure on yourself to get back there, and I felt like I dealt with that part of it pretty well, and certainly after the first round I was right in it and just one good round away on the weekend from being right in it.  I felt good about what I did this week and defending the title.
Q. Comment on Steve's play.
DAVID TOMS: Oh, he's playing great.  Like I said, I've played a lot with him in the last couple months, and he's great for this Tour.  He's a world-class player, still competitive on the PGA TOUR, and to come out here and win the last two major championships says a lot about the player that he is.
