Q.   Outside of the way things finished for you on the first day, I imagine you're pretty happy with the way you played out here?
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, this is not the best golf course for me.   I just hung in there every day and started getting a little more comfortable with my golf game on the course as the week went on.   Putter started feeling a lot better, and I was able to score pretty well the last few days.

Q.   Seems like the last couple days conditions have really had an effect on how the ball is going to play, how a player is going to get the ball up‑and‑down, especially today we're not seeing poles getting knocked down.   It was tough today, wasn't it?
DAVID TOMS:   Tough, real tough.   I went from hitting driver, wedge on the first hole to hitting driver, 6‑iron today.   Different golf course, but I was proud of the way I hung in there.   I didn't hit every shot great but scrambled nicely and just hung in there and shot a good score.

Q.   You've played this tournament for a long time.   Has it gotten more difficult?   I know the players have gotten better, but has this course gotten more difficult as it's gone on here?
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, certainly a more difficult golf course than English Turn, but it's a good one.   It's a good challenge, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable on it.   Maybe one of these years I can try to contend here.
