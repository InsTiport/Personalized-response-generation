 Q. Did the 18 come up the way the day's gone? Not great, not bad, right in the middle? 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I hit a lot of good shots today. Of it's still pretty breezy out there. Tough to get the ball close, and just never made the putt. 
 Felt like I hit that putt where I wanted to, and I didn't quite read the grain right. It was going that way a lot today. Got it in there tight on the first hole, missed it, and that was the story of the day.

 Q. Last couple of days you've been up-and-down. What changed today? Didn't seem like the wind picked up that much?
 DAVID TOMS: No, we just had some tough pins out there. I never really got the ball very close. When I did, I didn't make it. So, yeah. 
 Played the golf course well, even though, you know, I wasn't making birdies and I got kind of behind, and I needed to make up some shots and play smart and play the golf course like you have to. I couldn't make the putts to achieve the score I needed to.

 Q. What's harder, getting in contention what you're trying to do now or once you get there trying to remain alive? 
 DAVID TOMS: Well, you try to not think about any of that. You're just playing golf. Sometimes it's hard when you look at the leaderboard, and you're six or seven shots back, you start pressing a little bit, and then you make another bogey. 
 So you just have to go out and play the golf course and take what you get.

 Q. You got a number for tomorrow? 
 DAVID TOMS: Something in the mid-60's might put some pressure on the guys behind me, and we'll see how it goes.
