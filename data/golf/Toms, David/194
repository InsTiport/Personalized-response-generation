Q.  Obviously a long day, a lot of waiting.  Let's just get your comments if we can.
DAVID TOMS:  Yeah, it was a long day, a lot of sitting around and stuff.  I was hoping we could get it in because it kind of messes up the day tomorrow, us having to be out here early and then probably sitting around for a while, a long time.

But it's a great tournament.  It's unfortunate, the weather as a factor, but we'll have a good day of golf tomorrow.
Q.  You've been through plenty of days like this.  What's the key?
DAVID TOMS:  Well, I think, you know, just    the key is when we do get to go back out it's going to be great to play.  We went back out there and hit a few shots and thought we might go out again, so you just have to be mentally prepared to go back out at any time tomorrow.  I only have one hole to play and then another round of golf, so it won't be that bad.
Q.  Your comment on your round, the 17 holes that you did play today?
DAVID TOMS:  I was 1 under through 17 holes, kind of an up and down day, some birdies and some bogeys.  I need to go out and birdie 18 tomorrow and get within striking distance and have a good day tomorrow afternoon.
Q.  Thanks, David, appreciate it.
