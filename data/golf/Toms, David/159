Q.  Thoughts on your round today.  You guys came back into it, just your feelings on that.
DAVID TOMS:  We birdied 12 and 13 to get back to even after making a couple mistakes early in the round.  Then 14, I ran my putt by there.
Q.  Did you read his putt first to see how quick it was?
DAVID TOMS:  No, his putt came up short.  Mine was kind of up and then back down and I hit it a little bit too hard and we ended up 3 putting there.

So that was a big momentum swing there.  If we 2 putt that hole, we're 1 up, and then I hit it in the water on 15.  Those two holes really hurt us.

16, I thought we had the upper hand there and they ended up beating us on that hole.  You know, it was tough, but it was three holes.
Q.  What are your thoughts about Phil?
DAVID TOMS:  We had a good time.  We had a good time.  Obviously we're grinding pretty hard line.  We didn't get up early in the match and that hurt us, but I'd like the chance to do it again sometime.
