Q. David, just not quite able to make the charge today, were you?
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, just really didn't make any putts early‑ and mid‑round. In between clubs a lot today, which probably had a lot to do with the wind.
Made a couple stupid bogeys with the sand wedges, but that was being aggressive, you know, trying to get close to a pin when I should have just hit the middle of the green.
Overall I drove the ball great. Had plenty of birdie opportunities. It was right there the whole day until the very end.

Q. You still had a chance there on the last. 
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I had a chance. Even if I hit my second shot five yards left and rolls up onto the green I had a good shot.
It's okay. I had a good week. Top 5 in any tour event is pretty good.
