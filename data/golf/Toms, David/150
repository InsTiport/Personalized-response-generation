  Q.  Talking about his round.   

 DAVID TOMS:  Hit what I thought were a lot of good shots.   

 Yesterday, I ended up in good spots a lot of times.  Today I didn't feel as comfortable.  The putter was good.  Today was definitely a factor.   

 Yesterday, I fired it at the sticks.  Yesterday for me I didn't have much wind.   

 No matter who the guy is, you can get in trouble.  If you don't hit solid shots you can really get in trouble.
