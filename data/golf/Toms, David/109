  Q. Are you happy with the way you ended up today?   
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah. Made a nice putt there on my first hole on No. 5, for birdie, and then finished up with a birdie on 9. So yeah, I played well this morning.   
  
  Q. How much different did you find the course this morning from the way it was when you ended up yesterday?  
 DAVID TOMS: It's been wet all week, so it wasn't a whole lot different. Obviously soft, greens reset, a little bit slow, pretty much the same conditions we've had all week.   
  
  Q. So obviously, then, you'll be back 1:30 or 1:00, thereabouts, playing in the final group of the day. Can you just talk about the way you played this week and going off with Kenny and Ryan later today?  
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah. I mean it's -- I've played well so far this week. It's just a good start is really all it is. I need to keep it up.   
 Obviously the scoring is good, and look forward to the challenge.  
  
  Q. What will you do between now and the time you go back out?  
 DAVID TOMS: Couldn't tell you. Hadn't put any thought into it. I just walked off the golf course. I'll come up with a game plan and be back this afternoon.   
  
  Q. Thank you.   
 DAVID TOMS: Thank you.
