Q.   Just talk about the round. 
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, good solid round today.   I didn't get off to a very good start.   Three-putted my first hole, No. 10, and came right back and birdied 11.   That was nice.   Wasn't in control of my first 9 holes.   I made a couple birdies but hit some wayward shots.   My last 9 I played great.   I hit a lot of good shots, lot of makeable birdies.   3-under par the way this golf course plays now is definitely a good start.

Q.   Talk about that, because everybody we talked to has said, for lack of the better term has used the word "tough" today.   This course always plays tough.   You told us on Tuesday.   Even maybe a little more so today. 
DAVID TOMS:   Even with really not much wind at all, very calm conditions this morning.   Greens were perfect, but it seems like it's just tough to get the ball close to the hole.   So you really have to take advantage of those shots that are shorter where you can attack.   Some long shots where the ball releases and it's just tough to get it close. 
The short game is a little bit tougher around the greens now with the greens being firmer, bermuda, you can't just fire your chips at the hole and they stop.   You really have to pay attention and the rough is up in places, other places, you know, it's fine, but there's some thick areas that you don't want to be in, so overall it's a very demanding golf course.

Q.   I asked you Tuesday if you would pocket 2, 3-under every day.   Here you are 67 and today especially you got to feel good?
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, absolutely.   I would take that every day.   Just feel good about the way I finished up today, the way I played the last 9 holes.   I need to build on that, get some confidence and hopefully continue to play great.
