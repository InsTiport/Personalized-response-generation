 Q. David, that was a terrific opening round. I followed you all day long. You had to be very pleased.
 DAVID TOMS: It was a good, solid day. My speed was good on the greens. I made some nice putts. Kept the ball in play pretty much until a bit later on the back-9 had a couple of wayward drives. Other than that, that was a pretty easy day.

 Q. Have you gotten more length on your driver. Seemed like you were hitting it a little longer today.
 DAVID TOMS: No. I think I hit it adequate for this golf course, anyway. You know, I was hitting it solid. Any time I hit it solid it's efficient enough to go out and shoot a good score.

 Q. Everybody shot 6-under in the three-some. Did you feed off everybody else?
 DAVID TOMS: I think we fed off each other. Lucas even made mention our best ball wouldn't have been very good because we were birdieing the same holes. It was fun out there. I like the guys I was playing with. We had a lot of small talk and we all played well.

 Q. After the play a week like you did at Whistling Straits and you come here, more traditional golf course, how would you describe it? Is it a relief? Is it more fun? How would you describe it?
 DAVID TOMS: Both of those. You know, it's definitely an easier golf course and, you know, more my style for sure. Although last week I really enjoyed the week. The golf course I thought held up nicely. It was awfully long at 7500 but it was fun. And this week you can at least catch your breath a little bit when you're out there playing golf.

 Q. You just need three more 64s, right?
 DAVID TOMS: That would be a good score.
