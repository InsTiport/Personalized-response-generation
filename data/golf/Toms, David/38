Q.   David, put eight birdies on the board and one bogey, all adds up to 15 points.   That had to be fun. 
DAVID TOMS:   Yeah, it was a good day.   Hit some close early and then started to make a couple of nice putts midway through the round.
Didn't really get into trouble much.   Had one wayward drive over there on my back nine.   Other than that, I played really solid.

Q.   You are 175 on the FedEx points.   Obviously you want to crack the top 125 get in the playoffs.   At the same token, as we were just chatting, you don't seem overly concerned about your future.   You've got career money and you're enjoying the summer, watching your son play junior tournaments. 
DAVID TOMS:   I've been doing this for, gosh, 25 years or so.   I try not to get too worked up about it anymore.   But, no, certainly I'd like to finish off well and try to get myself into the playoffs.   And you never know after that. 
So I'm going to grind it out these last three weeks and see if I can move up some and start to play well.   I feel better about my game.   I just couldn't get rounds on the board like I did today.   Finally started making some putts which I haven't done all year.   And it was nice.

Q.   How does playing the Stableford system get you ready for the PGA Championship?
DAVID TOMS:   I don't know.   You tend to play a little aggressive, which probably wouldn't work too well next week.   Just to get some rounds, good solid rounds under my belt and a good round like today and maybe getting into contention tomorrow, that would be a good thing.   And we'll see how I do.
