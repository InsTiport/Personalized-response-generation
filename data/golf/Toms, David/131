 Q. David, a solid start. 67 in the first round and you beat these conditions. It looks like they're looming over the rest of the field. 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I mean, a little rain never hurt anybody; it softens everybody up. As long as the wind doesn't pick up, it should be fine this afternoon. We had ideal conditions this morning, not much wind at all. You could, you know, just pick a club and go with that. 
 And the golf course is about as easy as it's going to play. The fairways are rolling out and the greens are receptive, in perfect shape.

 Q. Some positive momentum you and Charles Howell III both 67s in the group?
 DAVID TOMS: We both had a good day and Cory got off to a shaky start and came back pretty good. There for a while we were playing solid and feeding off each other.

 Q. Are you going to have lunch and watch these guys this afternoon? 
 DAVID TOMS: I don't know about watching golf but I'm definitely going to have the lunch part of that. 

 Q. Good round.
