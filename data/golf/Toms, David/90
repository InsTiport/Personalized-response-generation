  Q. At the start of the day today, if someone had said to you go out and shoot an even par you would be in contention, what would you have thought?  
 DAVID TOMS: When I was warming up on the range, I didn't think the wind was as hard as they were predicting. So I thought if I could shoot 4-under, get to 10-under, I would be in good shape. And you know, I had it 2-under through seven, playing really solid and hit a bad drive at 8 and made double.   
 And I was, you know, back there just trying to get some back. And the golf course, the more we played, the harder it seemed to get and you just couldn't shoot at pins. Unless you were really a high-spin player like Rickie, he got it close to a couple of holes I couldn't get to; for a guy like me, it was a tough back nine.  
  
  Q. But at 6-under par, still interesting this afternoon?  
 DAVID TOMS: It's this golf course. Second shots into the greens, there's not a whole lot of bail-out. If you bail out, you've got long, long putts, and you're trying to 2-putt. If you get aggressive, you can pay the price if you don't hit the shot.   
 So it's the type of course that if you get a little wind blowing, and the greens are firm fast and hard, and just a great test.
