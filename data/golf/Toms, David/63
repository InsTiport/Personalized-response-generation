  Q. Talk through your day, 4-under is going to be a good start for this event?
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, good start for me. It's been a long golf course, a long wet golf course. I got off to a bad start, bogeyed the first two holes and came back nicely and shot 3-under the first nine and kind of held on. 
 Just a solid day, hit a lot of really good shots, mid-range putts were pretty good. 

 Q. Talk about 16, you were one of two people to eagle it today?
 DAVID TOMS: I think I had 81 yards, which is good to be in the rough, took the spin off it, took one hop and rolled in, which I needed at that point in the round because I got off to a bad start. That got me started in the right direction.

 Q. Are you feeling acclimated with everything? 
 DAVID TOMS: Yeah, waking up early in the morning but that's part of it, and just trying to get through it.
