 Q.  David, a really solid inward nine for you, three birdies.  
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, I played solid today.  I got off to a good start actually early this morning, making a couple birdies early.  Gave it right back on my third hole with a bogey.  Then we had a rain delay, and it was just kind of hard to get into the groove again, even though our scoring conditions were really good after we came back out.  Hung in there, and then all of a sudden hit a couple really good shots, made a couple nice putts, and had a nice round.   
 Q.  There's some courses out here that you're going to be length challenged on.  This isn't one of them because you've got to hit fairways and you've got to be able to work the ball a little bit around Colonial?  
DAVID TOMS: Yeah, you do.  I mean, I'm not quite as far behind the 8-ball, I guess, on this golf course, and have a lot of knowledge here having played here for many, many years, and I enjoy it.  Any time you go to a venue that you enjoy playing, you've had some success, I always look forward to coming back.   
 Q.  How do you look at this year leading up to Champions?  
DAVID TOMS: You know, I've had some good finishes and then I've had some inconsistency at times, more mental than anything else, just not being ready, not being prepared to play at certain times.  And we've had a lot of long, wet golf courses the last couple months.  That all factors into it, as well, makes it hard for me.
