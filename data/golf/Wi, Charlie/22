 Q. Can you talk about what tomorrow is going to be like, a lot of people trying to get in the top 5, a lot of people trying to get in the top 30?
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, it's going to be really interesting tomorrow. I know everybody is jockeying for position to get into the top 30 tomorrow on the FedExCup points list. I know where I stand and I know what I need to do, so it's almost nerve-wracking knowing what you have to do and that if you don't perform, you might not achieve that goal. It's going to be a tough test of nerves and emotions out there, but that's why we're here and what we do.

 Q. Do you think you'll know each hole where you stand?
 CHARLIE WI: Well, I kind of know where I have to finish to get in the top 30 right now. I knew that coming into this week, and I definitely put myself into good position to do that. One round to go tomorrow. It's going to either make it or break it. 

 Q. Can you talk about sleeping with the lead last night?
 CHARLIE WI: It was a lot of fun, and I didn't have trouble sleeping last night, but I definitely felt some nerves out there. I didn't have any best swing out there. 
 Overall it's a very nice golf course, and the TOUR officials did a very nice job setting up the golf course.
