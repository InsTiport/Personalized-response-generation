 Q. (Inaudible)
 CHARLIE WI: You know, I really played nice today. It was windy out there, the conditions were really different than the first few days. I drove it really good, I had a lot of good iron shots. The only regret I have is that little putt I missed on 15. 
 We shouldn't be so hard on ourselves. We put more pressure on ourselves in this last round. You know, it's a continuous round that's the only putt I am really dispointed about. I played pretty solid, I'm pretty pleased. 

 Q. The question now is a British Open possibility. You are in a big tie for second. We're hearing that it's a card off, basically, lowest last round to see who gets to go if there is tie. Are you planning on going if you get that invitation?
 CHARLIE WI: You better believe it. I'll be there. I didn't know it was a card off. That's kind of weak. They should let us all in.

 Q. Rock, paper, scissors or a cage match, how about that? 
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, a cage match I would probably lose.

 Q. I don't know. Do you know Tae Kwon Do?
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, a little bit of that. I have metal spikes, too.

 Q. Great play. I hope you get in the British. You played really solid today. Good luck. 
 CHARLIE WI: Thanks.
