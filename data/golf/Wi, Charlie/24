 Q. Charlie, it looked really good and all, but Justin was running away with it. He had an eagle on 9, but you hung in there and made some birdies coming in, and it was close coming down the stretch. 
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, you know, I guess my opportunity, I birdied 11 and I knocked it to about three feet on 12. But I hung in there well today. It's a tough golf course. 1-under on Sunday, that's a very good score today.

 Q. This is your best finish this year, you tied for 8th at Honda so it's late in the year for you to be having your first top 5. 
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, I just played really solid, had a lot of top 20 finishes, two top 10s. I've just got to take care of it. I feel like my game is coming around, and I feel good about it.
