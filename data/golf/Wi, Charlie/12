Q.   I thought you were a little frustrated with the finish.
CHARLIE WI:   Yeah.   You know, I missed a short one on 16 and unfortunately my second shot into the pin, the divot which was filled with sand and then I chunked it and I made bogey but, you know, overall, I played very well today there's a lot of positives to take from that.

Q.   You're talking about your 3rd shot into the 18th hole.   I thought the lie was fine.   Little sandy, little divot there.   Hit the stone wall and just ricocheted back in your face.
CHARLIE WI:   Yeah.   I was very fortunate and then the fourth shot, so that was a bad luck and good luck, I guess.   You know, it was a tough lie and I didn't execute it like I wanted and, you know, I feel like I'm in good position and we'll see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   Absolutely.   Lot of good out of that round.   What a brilliant birdie on 17.
CHARLIE WI:   Yeah.   After missing the short one an 16 I was a little frustrated.   I didn't let it get to me.   Gave myself a birdie putt.

Q.   Charlie, I've seen you in this position a lot of times.   It's not like you're going to be nervous.
CHARLIE WI:   Yeah.   You know, I know that I'm three shots behind and I need a good one tomorrow and hopefully the wind will keep blowing tomorrow.
