  PHIL STAMBAUGH:   8‑under 64, the low round of the day.   The thing that jumps out, you had 30 on the Front 9 and 22 total putts including nine on the Front 9.  
CHARLIE WI:   Oh.   Wow.   Is that right?   I didn't know that.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Yeah.   Just talk about your round overall.   
CHARLIE WI:   You know, Palm Course is a course where you need to score and all the par‑5s are reachable, so I felt like I took advantage of them really well, and what really got me going today was no. 7 when I made that eagle putt from about 15 feet and I felt like I had something special going today.  
But other than that, I know the scores are low out there, and I'm very pleased with 8‑under today.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Can you just take us through the round before we go to questions?   Tell me about your birdies and your eagles.  
CHARLIE WI:   You mean like how far?   
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Yeah.  
CHARLIE WI:   No. 1 I was about 50 yards short of the green and hit it to about two feet and made that.   On 5, hit driver, I can't even remember.   Oh, I was in the bunker and hit my bunker shot to about 18 feet, made that.   On 6, hit 3‑wood, 8‑iron to about three feet.   And on 7, hit driver 5‑iron to about 15 feet, made that.   
On 9, I had 5‑wood, 8‑iron and I was just off the green and I chipped it in.   And on 11, hit driver 5‑wood to front bunker and hit is to about eight feet and made that.  
On 14 I hit driver 3‑wood, right next to the green, chipped up to about five feet, made that.   On 17, hit driver wedge to about ten feet and made that.   On 18 I had driver 6‑iron to about a foot.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   And the two bogeys.  
CHARLIE WI:   Two bogeys, I three‑putted from.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   The par‑3.   12.   
CHARLIE WI:   Oh.   I hit a ‑‑ I was looking at something else.  
   
 Q.   We can't see it.   
CHARLIE WI:   I was looking at the Magnolia course.   I was like, wait a minute.   On 12, hit my 6‑iron in the bunker and didn't get up and down.   And on 15 I hit a good driver 7‑iron to about 20 feet and three‑putted.  
   
 Q.   How long was it?  
CHARLIE WI:   About 18 feet.   Just off the green.   Just on the left side.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   I believe this is your low round since the 61 at Pebble in Round 1.   Just overall, did you do anything different or anything.  
CHARLIE WI:   You know, I worked really hard before the PLAYOFFS, and I actually played a lot of tournaments leading up to the PLAYOFFS to get myself in good position to get in the Top 30.   And I didn't really play that well with all the amount of work that I put into it.   I had three weeks off before I went to KJ's tournament in Korea.   And I felt like something's been clicking since I was in Korea about a month ago.   So I feel like I've been steady the last two weeks.  
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Okay.   We'll go to questions.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
CHARLIE WI:   No.   I was there two weeks.   I played K.J.'s tournament and one of the courses in Korea.   So I got to see two courses that are bidding for the 2015 Presidents Cup in Korea.   Is it in Korea '15 or '17.   15.   So it was pretty cool.   
   
 Q.   When you made the turn in 30, you already said you thought it was going to be something special.   Did you let your mind wander as to how special it could be?  
CHARLIE WI:   No.   I never think about 59 actually.   The closest I think that I came to 59 was I think this year at Monterey Peninsula when I was 9‑under with about three to play, which is a par 70 there, so it's possible to ‑‑ you know, possible to have a chance at 59.   But when it's par 72, it's very difficult to even think about.     
   
 Q.   (Inaudible).   
CHARLIE WI:   You know, I didn't get to play any other Fall Series, and normally my kids come to this tournament with me, and they decided that they're too cool for me now.   No, I'm just kidding.   (Laughs).   
   
 Q.   It happens.   How old are they?  
CHARLIE WI:   No.   Six and three.   
   
 Q.   Already?  
CHARLIE WI:   No, no, no.   We're going to Hawaii in December, and we didn't want them missing any more school, so we kept them in school this week.   
And I like coming.   I have some friends that live nearby.   So doesn't mean anything.   Hoping to be a special week.   
PHIL STAMBAUGH:   Okay.   Continued good luck.   
CHARLIE WI:   Thank you very much.
