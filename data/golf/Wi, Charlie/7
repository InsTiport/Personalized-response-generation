 Q.   Good start for you.   This is a tough golf course, and you made it look easy out there?  
    CHARLIE WI:   I did play really well today.   This year has been a struggle a little bit, but I've been working really hard.   I haven't been able to really score, but to get out there and shoot a nice round is a pleasant surprise.  
   
 Q.   How are the conditions, because it's been breezy today?  
    CHARLIE WI:   Before we teed off the wind started blowing.   It's been windy today.   The conditions of the golf course are perfect.   If you give yourself a decent look you're going to make some putts.   
   
 Q.   What's working for you right now?  
    CHARLIE WI:   I've been playing really steady the last few weeks, starting at The PLAYERS.   It's just that you need to do certain things to score and I haven't been able to do that and I felt like things are turning around.   
   
 Q.   Your putter is working well?  
    CHARLIE WI:   That always helps, doesn't it?
