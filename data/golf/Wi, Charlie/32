 Q. Just a couple of general comments on the round.
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, you know, I putted much better. I definitely hit a lot more greens and hit a lot closer to the hole.

 Q. Did something click? Are you working on anything that may have come through for you?
 CHARLIE WI: Yesterday I shot 3-over, but it's a tough golf course. My speed was a little bit off. I was stillpleased with the 3-over yesterday and I knew that my speed was off, so I came out a bit early and worked on my putting a little bit and speed, and I think that made the difference.

 Q. How about the wind; was the wind a factor today?
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, the wind was switching around, so coming more from the south. But the speed and everything is pretty much the same as it has been the last couple of days.

 Q. And what does a round like this do for you mentally as you prepare, because you are right there in the thick of it now as you head into tomorrow? You have to be encouraged.
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, definitely. If you would have said, take 65 on the first tee, I would have said, see ya later. 
 So, you know, give myself chances tomorrow, and I'm really looking forward to it.
