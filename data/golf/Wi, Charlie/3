Q.   Nice start to the day.   How did you feel about the round out there?
CHARLIE WI:   Yeah, I played really solid, stayed within myself.   Still a very up‑and‑down year, and it's good to have a nice start like that.   It's very promising for this week.

Q.   I know you're coming off four missed cuts.   Is there anything you worked on in the break to get you back to this shape?
CHARLIE WI:   I don't think it was so much necessarily my golf game.   I think that just being close to being Top 125 on FedExCup and thinking too far ahead, and I believe that I wasted a lot of my energy just thinking about nonsense instead of concentrating on my game. 
I kind of went home and just cleared my head and came out here with a great attitude.

Q.   What was the course giving up today?
CHARLIE WI:   You know, we were the first group off, so the greens were perfect.   It was a little bit receptive due to the rain that we had yesterday.   The conditions were ideal, and I know that the conditions are going to be very good this afternoon, so you'll see some good scores this afternoon.
