 Q. Before you teed off, you said the key to the round would be patience. How did you do with that?
 CHARLIE WI: I played beautiful today. The first few holes I missed a couple of greens but luckily I was able to chip them in for birdies. That's how I got off to a great start today. 
 It's such a tough golf course. It doesn't have to be very far off for you to make a bogey out there. To shoot 2-under, I would have been very pleased before I teed off. I know I had a chance out there and I'm a little bit disappointed, but at the same time, I felt really good about playing pretty solid today. 

 Q. A couple chip-ins helps certainly but you had 25 putts today. 
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, you know, I had some good chances out there, too. The course is playing so good and the pins are really difficult. So for me to playing five or six birdies out there was really good today.
