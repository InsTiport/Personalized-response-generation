  Q. Nothing like waiting all day to kind of wait and see. What did you do?  
 CHARLIE WI: I just hung out in the locker room with Steve Elkington and talked to Aaron Baddeley and a couple players. It was very relaxed.   
 So all adrenaline and nerves are gone now. So we have another day tomorrow.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah. Yeah.   
  
  Q. 36 holes?   
 CHARLIE WI: Yeah, I have 36 holes. There was a lot of waiting around all day. I was waiting around for a long time. I worked out and stuff. But tomorrow, you know, we'll get things going, once you're on the golf course it's a lot better. You're doing what you know how to do, so it will be easier tomorrow.
