 Q. How is your first PGA TOUR event going? 
 PAUL DANIELS: Actually I played in the Senior Open two years ago. 

 Q. Great. How is it going today?
 PAUL DANIELS: It was challenging, the wind was blowing pretty hard, but this golf course plays very fair. It could have been a couple better, probably, but overall I'm pretty pleased. I still have a chance to make the cut if I play good tomorrow.

 Q. What was the best club in the bag today?
 PAUL DANIELS: Actually I hit a couple of really good 6-irons, so that was probably the best club I hit during the course of the round.
