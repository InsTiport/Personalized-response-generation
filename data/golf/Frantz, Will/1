 Q. How did the course play today?
 WILL FRANTZ: Pretty difficult, I thought. Greens were pretty firm and pins were tucked away and greens were very fast here. I played in seven Majors now and seven Senior Majors, probably the hardest greens of any place I ever played. 

 Q. What did you think of the back to back par-5s? You birdied one or you parred one of them. 
 WILL FRANTZ: Yeah. Yeah. That's a real nice streak, especially if you start on the back and then you come around and play the back again tomorrow, so we started on 10 today, so we'll have the back nine again tomorrow. 

 Q. You birdied the third hole. 
 WILL FRANTZ: That was my lone birdie, yeah. I birdied that hole almost every practice round. So it just fits my eye, one of those greens where the wind is just right and it's just one of my favorite holes out here.

 Q. Did the course play like you expected?
 WILL FRANTZ: Yeah, a little bit thicker rough than I was expecting before I came here, a little bit more difficult in the rough. A little bit more penal. It's almost like a USGA event, the way the setup is.
