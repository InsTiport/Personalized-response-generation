Q. So, I don't know if you were aware but the projected cut is 7-over right now.  You were 70 feet away with 2 on 18.SAM RANDOLPH: Grind a 2 putt.Q. Take me through 18.SAM RANDOLPH: I was trying not to think about what the number was.  I was trying to play every hole as good as I could and, you know, when it comes down to that 4-footer at the end you kind of know I better make this and I made a good stroke and rolled it.  That felt good, yeah.Q. Playing this afternoon, how differently did that compare to yesterday morning?SAM RANDOLPH: It was really tough.  The greens firmed up.  Pin placements were tougher.  It was really hard to get the ball near the hole on most of them.  So, yeah, it showed its teeth a little bit this afternoon.Q. Going into the weekend, the cut stays the same and you get in, what have you got to do to try to go low tomorrow and attack the course a little bit?SAM RANDOLPH: I just want to shoot a good round of golf.  You know, it's been awhile since I've played.  It will be good for me to get some more reps out there this weekend and maybe put together a good score, get some confidence.Q. Perfect.  Good luck this weekend.SAM RANDOLPH: Thank you
