 Q.  70 to go with a 68 yesterday.  How was that?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Obviously good, positive.  Another round under par.  I thought I started a little slower today.  Couldn't get the putter going early on in the round, but worked myself through it.  I played good golf again.  I hit the ball great off the tee.  Gave myself lots of chances.  A few putts dropped on the back nine, so happy with the score.   
 Q.  Are you pleased with your patience, as well?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I mean, that's a lesson that we should have learned a long, long time ago.  Golf putts us on a test every single day and patience is a must.  I don't know, it's just relaxed.  It's kind of falling to the end of the year already.  It's my third one in a row.  It's easy to lose patience quickly but I was having a good game, so I was happy I managed that properly.   
 Q.  What's your plan for the weekend?  You currently sit four back.  Do you have a score in mind?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Not really.  My plan is to go as low as possible, just keep playing, see what the weather turns out to be.  Just play my game.  Play like I have these first few days.  If I need to play a little bit more aggressive come Sunday, I will obviously do that.  But for now, just stick to my game plan, keep playing the way I am and hopefully that will give me a chance to win.
