Q. 64 on a Sunday in a Major.  You have to be feeling good about that round.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, of course.  I mean, I played good.  I got off to a good start, playing great on the front nine.  Gave myself lots of chances and made some of them.  So that was good.  And then a couple holes that I got myself into a bit of trouble, I made some good recovery shots to keep the momentum going.
Overall, very pleased with the day's round.  It's going to help me jump, hopefully finish top-10 in the event, which is great.  Lots of points.  So really, really happy about it.
