 Q. Five Masters, four cuts, I know it's not a goal, but it's a relief?   
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, first of all, you have to get yourself to the weekend. It was a hard battle this morning out there. Lots of good shots. Lots of bad ones too. I had to struggle up to the very last hole to save par, but great to play again on the weekend. I love this place, and every round you learn something new. So to have the opportunity for an additional two days, it's for sure something to be happy about.
