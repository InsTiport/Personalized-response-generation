 Q.  Happy with the opening round?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, absolutely.  4-under, it was a tricky day.  A bit of breeze there.  I thought I played really good.  I managed myself well.  Stayed away from trouble and pleased with my 4-under.   
 Q.  What do you think was key to your round today?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: I mean, I played pretty steady.  I gave myself lots of chances and hit most of the greens.  It's tough to get up-and-down around with the bermudagrass, and you feel they are very undulating greens, so it's always tricky.   
Hitting greens is very important, and I putted good, as well, today, so that helped me.   
 Q.  Tied fifth last year, so a course that clearly suits your eye.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, I personally think it's a bomber's course.  I'm not a bomber, but I maybe hit it a little further than average.  I like it.  I feel like I can play smart around here and make a good score.  I was happy to do it last year and I'm pleased with today's round.
