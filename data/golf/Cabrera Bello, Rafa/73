Q. Your thoughts on 67 to start?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Very pleased obviously.  It's been a great start.  But on top of that, I also felt I played really good, stroked the ball beautifully, giving myself -- I hit almost every green and a couple chances for eagle, as well.  So actually very happy with the way I played and also with the score.
Q. Good to play alongside Alex Noren, who, I don't know, maybe the two of you pulled each other on?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, I know him from amateur days, so we've been good friends since a long, long time.  It's always good to play with him and he's also playing good, so in a way we can cheer up each other and that's good.
Q. Am I right to see you more confident coming into this week because of the way you played in Qatar and the form you've had here in the past?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I always enjoy coming here.  I feel my game is good at the moment.  I obviously played good in Qatar and had a good finish.  I also played good in Abu Dhabi, even though the final position wasn't as good as Qatar, but I still played very good.  This week, it's nice to have started good, as well.
Q. This course is always evolving.  Is it markedly different or noticeably different for you this time around?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: No, there are a few changes, particularly in the grass.  It's bermuda all over the place, and the run-offs around the green, but the shape of the course, it's the same.  It feels normal.  It doesn't feel like I'm in a brand new place.
