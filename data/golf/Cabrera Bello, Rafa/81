Q.   68 and 70 for 4‑under par.   What's pleased you most about your play over these first two days?
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, obviously the scoring has been good.   Two consecutive rounds under par on this course, it's very good.   It's a very tough course.   There is less rough this year, yes, but it is still hard.   It was very hot out there yesterday.   It's been getting hot throughout the day today and the turf is definitely getting harder.
It's a very, very tricky course that on any hole, really, can get you.   The best thing about it is I haven't had really much, much trouble.   I've made some bogeys of course, but never put myself in position of shooting a high number.

Q.   How difficult is that golf course going to get this afternoon as this sun continues to bake it try? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Obviously if the wind picks up and the greens dry a lot, it's going to be very tough.   The greens are rolling pretty fast already.   We are not getting huge bounces yet but on a couple of parts of the green, you could start, like you say, the grass almost dying and going very hard.   So it is going to be very tricky, yes.

Q.   Top 15 for you in the last four starts, haven't converted one into a win.   Is it a question of keep knocking on that door?
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, obviously some things had been going wrong because my scoring during the first two days, or even Saturday, as well, compared to Sunday is not quite the same.   But I'm working on that, so I'm going to keep knocking on the door and one day, it will open, yeah, for sure.
