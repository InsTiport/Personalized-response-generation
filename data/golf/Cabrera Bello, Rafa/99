Q.   13‑under around this great golf course, how does that sound? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, it sounds‑‑ I don't think 13 is an unlucky number for around this course.   I'm really happy, really pleased, and everything's going good.   I'm enjoying myself. 

Q.   Now, you're a desert specialist, you've won over there in Dubai, you like it here, you played nicely last week; is it like home?   Is it like Spain? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, I mean, it definitely feels like home.   I like playing in short sleeves a lot, I like a little bit of breeze, I like seeing palm trees, I like seeing sun around the courses.   It does remind me a lot from the Canaries, and it's kind of like, I start playing at the end of the year here, and I don't feel that I've left home, so that's why I enjoy it so much.

Q.   What's the plan tomorrow?   What do you do?   You go to the gym this afternoon, definitely, won't you? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, yes, I do my normal routine, and tomorrow is just a new day, we start from scratch, play one shot at a time and just go out there and keep enjoying myself.   I've been doing it for this week and last week a lot, so just enjoy the opportunity of being up there, being in contention, that every shot mattered and just savour that and try to perform as good as I know I can.
