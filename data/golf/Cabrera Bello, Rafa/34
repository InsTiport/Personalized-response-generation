Q. Your thoughts on than round out there today?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, it's been a very tough day again, lots of wind today.  Pretty much the same intensity but kind of felt like it was all over the place.  It wasn't very consistent, and also lots of gusts, so it really made it tough out there.
Really, really happy with the way I played.  I played very solid.  Hit lots of fairways, most of the greens.  Despite the wind, stayed patient.  Overall very pleased with the 3-under today I thought.
Q. Some of the key moments, things that pleased you most?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, it was nice to get off to a good start with birdies on 10 and 13 but then there has not really been one key moment.  It was just the one mistake on 6.  I bogeyed and I should have not bogeyed that hole after my drive.  But I also saved a really good par on 9.
Not just a single key moment.  Good start but obviously gave me lots of patience, and the rest was just solid play.
Q. We interview every week, every day; it's because you're playing some great golf.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Thank you very much.  I hope it stays like that for a very long time.
Q. I want to hear about how pleased you are with this rich vein of form.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I'm very happy.  I don't consider it like a stretch of form.  I think that I managed to raise my golf level to what it is nowadays, and I'm just very pleased that the hard work has paid off and I have managed to improve a little bit on most of the areas of my game to make me a solid and consistent player.
So I'm going to keep working to keep improving.
