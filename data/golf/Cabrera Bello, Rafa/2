 Q. Can you walk us through your round today? A little bit up and down.   
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, started off strong. A couple threeâputts that led to those two bogeys and then some birdies midâround, and it was a very disappointing finish, obviously. I fought hard today. I felt I deserved better, but just didn'tââ the coin didn't fall my side today.   
   
 Q. Big difference between the front and the back, or different conditionsââ   
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO: No, not really. I think fairly the same. The course was very wet today, lots of mud balls, which makes it tough, but of course it rained a lot. The greens are way softer than we have ever played here, so that takes a little bit of adjustment. But we can hear the SubAir on, so I'm sure they're drying them, and tomorrow they'll be drier and so on.
