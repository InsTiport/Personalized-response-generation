Q. Your thoughts on the start?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, very positive start.  Pleased with the way I played.  Pleased with the fact that I think the scorable nine could be 10 to 18, especially at the end, and I didn't manage to do that, but I did come up on my second nine, which happens to be the first one of the course, to score very low.  So really satisfied with that, yeah.
Q. Wind seems to be picking up now but I take it was still fairly challenging out there.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: It was challenging.  I don't know the actual measurements, but it was windy already first thing in the morning.  Wind here is something we expect.  We are used to playing in the wind in this part of the world and it's definitely a challenge.
Q. Do you relish that?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Up to a limit.  I think wind makes it fun.  It makes me feel that I have to be focused on every shot.  It's a challenge on every single shot you hit, just trying to see how much the wind is going to affect the ball.  But sometimes it gets to the point that it's so much wind that it's really impossible to judge, and that's when I think it stops being fun.
Q. Are you feeling the benefit of playing well and challenging last week in Abu Dhabi?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: I'm not feeling any benefit in addition for that.  I mean, last week, I did play great golf.  I mean, unfortunately I slipped out of the Top-10 on the last few holes but I took a positive and my game was very good, my iron play really good.  Worked over this just two-day break that we had on the things that I felt I needed to do better, and happy that this tournament has started good.
