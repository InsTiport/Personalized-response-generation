  RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO: I just finished the playoff.   Unfortunately I didn't get the win, but, hey, overall the week has been very good.   Four holes before the tournament finished, I was way, way, way behind and I had a spectacular finish, just three holes to finish.   I finished birdie, eagle birdie and just being in the playoff was already something spectacular.
Obviously disappointed because I didn't win, but the week has been very good.   It was a four‑man playoff, and it's really, really hard to win. 

Q.   You've been right up there all the week long, and the way you finished, were you telling yourself, there's still a chance, there's still a chance; because that huge putt for eagle, it was another long one for birdie at the last. 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, I've learned after this many years until the end, you never know, anything can happen.   Sometimes it just goes horrible, we've all seen that.   It's happened to me and I've seen it happen to other people, and sometimes it all goes great.   And today was one of those days.   It's just this sport, you never know until the end, until the ball is in the hole on the last hole.   You just don't know what's going to happen. 
I think I played a good playoff.   First hole, I managed to save a par after a bad drive and then I had two birdies with a putt to win the championship on 17.   So just hit a bad shot off the tee on 18, didn't get a great lie and then I just went for it and I just didn't hit a good shot again.   Got it a little bit thin and was unlucky to catch it in the water for a bogey or double‑bogey or whatever it was.   It's a pity.   Overall, there's not much more I can ask myself.
