Q. Are you a very happy man with the way that you forged a good score across the course of this week?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I'm obviously pleased with the result.  I mean, this tournament has a special significance for us being allocated lots of Ryder Cup points, and for me that was a big goal.
I wanted to do good.  I saw it obviously as a potential threat if I didn't do good, but I also saw it as an opportunity; if I did go, I could make some ground, as well.  I'm pleased that even though the week didn't start with my best game, I've worked hard through the rest of the week and managed to finish in a good position.
Q. You've taken your opportunities with a lovely round of 67, bettering the course on the final day.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, it was -- obviously I needed a good one today.  I started good.  I didn't make many mistakes.  I played solid.  Just waited my chances and managed to shoot a good score, yes.
