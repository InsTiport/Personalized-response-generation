  RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:     Really, really happy to keep playing good and happy, also, to putt a good round and be in contention tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   We spoke about your finish to round two, and it seemed like you just carried on when you first started here today?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:     Yes, actually, as a matter of fact I did.   I started with two birdies today, which was good.   I mean, it gave me confidence straightaway, and then, I don't know, many things can happen after the start, but I just stayed calm, one shot at a time, and today it worked.   
   
 Q.   Not easy, though, despite the fact that you're bathed in sunshine at the moment.   There's still a tricky breeze?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:     Yes, it was breezy.   The forecast was for it to die down and maybe just now it's starting to die down, but it has not really died down most of the day.   So it wasn't as strong as yesterday or the first day but still very challenging.   Yeah, definitely made the conditions tougher than the forecast for tomorrow, so we'll see.   
   
 Q.   Excited?   Should be.   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:     I'm happy.   I'm not like really excited or anything.   I'm happy, I'm proud, I'm confident and I'm enjoying the tournament so far, so hopefully tomorrow I can keep those feelings and take them on to the golf course with me, go out there, play my best and enjoy.   
   
 Q.   You know you can.   You will.   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:     Thank you.
