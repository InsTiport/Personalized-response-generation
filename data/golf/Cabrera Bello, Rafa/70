 Q.  What are your thoughts on a very good week?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, yeah, obviously overall very happy, and second again, it's a great position.  It's been a fantastic tournament.  I played really good.  Proud of myself.  Obviously disappointed I didn't get to win but I know playing like this, it's around the corner.   
 Q.  Am I right to presume you should be proud of the finish with a birdie on 16 to put the pressure on with a lovely putt at the last and again to make Danny hole that putt?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, I know the back nine was going to be very important.  Obviously getting off to a strong start would have been ideal.  That didn't happen, so I just stayed patient, bogeyed 6, a little unlucky.  My ball ended up in a divot after a good drive, but any ways, just fought back all day long.  Played aggressive.  I know that coming down the stretch, I could make some birdies and that's what I did.  I tried my best and Danny was one shot better today.   
 Q.  Bodes well for the season, really, if you start 2016 as you have?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Absolutely.  I'm playing really good.  Abu Dhabi was good.  Qatar was good.  This week has also been great.  It's an ideal start.   
 Q.  What is next?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Malaysia.
