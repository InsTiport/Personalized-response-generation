Q.   A round of 66, what pleased you most about your play today? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Thank you very much.   Well, I mean, I felt I played good.   The thing that pleased me most was that I'm keeping the good feelings from last week.   I felt I played very solid the back nine, which was my first nine holes.   Back nine on the front nine, I struggled a little bit with the driver.   Couldn't get too close for birdie.
But luckily the putter was hot and gave me another two birdies.   But need to improve on that a little bit.   But overall, very, very happy and very pleased with this. 

Q.   Last week you got yourself into a good position through two rounds and then struggled in the third round but kept battling away and birdied the last two holes; that evidence of just got to keep going, because you ended up with a chance to win the championship?
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, in Spain, there's a saying that until the tip of the tail, it's all part of the ball, so anything can happen until the very last minute.   As you say, I was co‑leading after two rounds.   Third round, I struggled a bit.   I didn't drove it too good, and then on the greens, I just couldn't make‑‑ get anything happen, but I just hang in there, I was patient and I got my prize on the two birdies at the last two holes.   That kind of like gave me a chance of the next day and the next day, I managed to start strong.   I was leading at some stage.   Had a chance to win end and up in a good fourth position.
