Q.   Talk about coming back to a tournament where you have played well before, good memories and all?
RAFA CABRERAâ€‘BELLO:   Yes, of course, I mean, it's always good.   Basically this course, it's funny, because I played very good here and I also played very bad, so every time I show up, I don't know which part of me came this time.   So far, it's the good side, and I can keep improving.
