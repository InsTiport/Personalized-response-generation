Q. I've got to ask you, the putts that weren't conceded at 15 and 16, was there something there that we didn't see that happened earlier?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: No, no, no.  Not at all.  Obviously he was trailing, so he's just hoping for any chance that may happen for him to win a shot.  Nothing happened.  We're good friends.
Q. You are going to face each other in a playoff here later.  Going to have lunch together?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I don't know.  He's with his party, I'm with my party.  We're friends, but maybe we're not going to push it.
Q. A gutsy match you just played.  Had to have the victory to force a playoff and you got the job done?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Exactly.  Part A of the job done today.  I played solid.  Tyrrell, I new he was going to be a tough opponent.  I had to play good golf and I did that.  I'm happy but still this doesn't mean -- it means that I'm in the playoff, but I still have a very, very tough afternoon ahead.
Q. You have to defeat him again in the playoff, but you control your own destiny?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes, exactly.  When I went to bed last night I was disappointed for not being able to get the half point with Charl yesterday which would have really helped me knowing that if I won this morning, I would be through.  But I still felt in control of my destiny, knowing that if I won and then I won the playoff I can still make it.
