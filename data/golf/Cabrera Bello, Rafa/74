 Q.  Very exciting finish to this championship, wasn't it?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I started good today.  Made a bad mistake on 8, and then it was hard to get birdies.  I had a very strong finish and obviously very pleased with the result.   
 Q.  But when that happened on the eighth, did you tell yourself, look, the back nine does give plenty of chances?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: No, it's just a tough day.  It was common to make mistakes.  Many of the guys out there were also making mistakes, so just told myself that there was still a lot to play for, still a lot of golf to play, and I just stayed patient and waiting on my chances and they came in the end.   
 Q.  This is a very positive start to 2016, isn't it, the way you performed last week in Abu Dhabi, brilliant finish here.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Thank you, yeah, I played good last week and I was playing good coming into this week.  Played very good throughout the entire week and obviously managed to score, as well.  Finished second in the end.   
 Q.  Does it make it all the more exciting going to Dubai where you've won before?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: I mean, it's just nice to be feeling that I'm playing good at the moment, feeling in control of my game, and just looking forward to any week.  Dubai, better, but at the moment, I'm just enjoying golf.
