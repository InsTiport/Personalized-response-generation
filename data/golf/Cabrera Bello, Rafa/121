  RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, I got to play with a friend in Alvaro, very happy for me but I feel sorry for him, and he's such a good guy.   We had a good match today.   I feel like I'm playing really good.   He started playing a bit better and the back nine he made a couple of short putts that put me back to even in the match. 
I really was just trying to get back into the match, and I just tried to go for it. 

Q.   You must be proud of your resilience, as well, because for the second time today you've had to do it very late‑‑
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, my first two matches‑‑ I started off winning both of them and managed to keep my lead. 
And this morning, recovered, tough game being 2‑down with five to play, and now this afternoon, 3‑down after nine and being able to win, I feel really proud of that. 

Q.   You're enjoying it? 
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Not every moment but I'm enjoying most parts of it and I'm learning a lot.   It's good to play match play.   I was missing it a lot because I really enjoyed it as an amateur, and now I've had a chance to play this year a little bit more and this week I've been doing really good. 
I love match play, so it's definitely a game that it's very unfair, very hard and very cruel, but it's a format I really like. 

Q.   And now playing Graeme McDowell tomorrow?
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I have to play G‑Mac, and he has a lot of experience and is a Ryder Cup hero, so he's obviously going to be a very, very tough guy to beat. 
You know, I'm going to try my best and I'm playing good.   Hopefully I can start as good as I did on my first two matches and if I don't, I know I can come from behind and make it through.   So we'll just see what happens.
