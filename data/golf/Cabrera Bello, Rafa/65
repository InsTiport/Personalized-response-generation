Q. You are playing very well out there.  I know Ben had to withdraw.  Talk about the match.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Well, obviously disappointed.  No one wants to win with the other guy withdrawing.  I still feel I played really good golf today and made lots of birdies.  I mean, only really one mistake on No. 2, that I made bogey but the rest was really, really solid golf.  Lots of birdies, really giving Ben not many chances.
Q. What's been clicking for you this week?  You're playing so well.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I've been playing well all year, really.  This week I've done a good preparation.  I came here early.  I got to know the course.  I know Pete Dye designs tend to be very tricky.  So I had three looks at the course before we actually teed off.  I think I know it pretty well by now.  I'm happy with the way I'm playing and I'm happy with the way I'm managing myself out there in match play.
Q. With you getting to the quaterfinals, this might get you to the Top-50 in the world?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Fingers crossed.  I heard that before.  I thought so when I had a look last night.  I still don't know if it's confirmed or not, but it is looking pretty good.  It was the only major I haven't played, so really excited about that.
