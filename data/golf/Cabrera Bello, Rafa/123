Q.   Rafael, how do you reflect on that? 
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   It was a good match.   Obviously playing with Martin, he's an absolutely fantastic player and good friend, as well. I know I was going to enjoy it out there and playing against him, such a good match‑play player, as well, I was really pleased and happily surprised that I end up beating him.   I did play very good.
I started off very strong.   I got some advantage and managed to keep it pretty much for the rest of the round, so I was very pleased with the way I played. 

Q.   You had that marvellous round with an eagle and followed by two birdies after that.   Your game must be in good shape?
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, good start, a little bit nervous, and it was the second match play I've played as a professional and the first one started off pretty good, but being 3‑up and three to play with Jason Day and I ended up losing the match in the playoff. 
So this one was an important one for me just to prove myself that I could do good in match play.   It's a format that I really like.   I love to compete, so match play is the best way to compete‑‑ I really like to play match play and I'm glad that I was able to win today. 

Q.   Sounds like that was playing with your mind‑‑
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   When I lost to Jason Day I was 3‑up and three to go, and I had a 5‑foot putt to win the match, I had that twice on 16 and 17.   So I had a 5‑foot putt to win today on the 16th, and I didn't talk with my caddie but it was in my mind, oh, I'm not missing this one.   Just hit it to the middle and hit it firm and it went in.
