Q. Your thoughts on the day?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Good day overall.  I played some great golf.  Even though not contending for the title, certainly contending for the top 5, so obviously pleased with my performance.
Q. How were conditions?  Looked like it's quite hard to keep momentum going out there today.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, sure, I think today the wind, similar intensity as yesterday, maybe a notch more.  I felt it was gustier.  A few of the pins were further back, as well, so the course was playing much tougher today.
Q. Good points Race to Dubai?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, I wasn't thinking about it.  It's just one week at time a time.  I honestly think Tommy is in very good control of The Race to Dubai.  I'm going to play two more events and we'll see what happens.
Q. Looking forward to the rest of the season?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, it's the real final stretch now.  I have a week off and then three more weeks.  Yeah, excited to see what really happens in The Race to Dubai, and also to have some time off.
