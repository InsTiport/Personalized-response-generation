Q.   Good start to 2014? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, absolutely, it's always the first round of the year for most of us.   I have not competed for the last five weeks, so even though I have been practising and trying to recreate competition, it's not quite the same, so I'm pretty pleased of the.   I started good and I held my nerve and more than that, I played the game I know I can play. 

Q.   Looks like a lovely round of golf, just seeing that scoreboard and we thought it was going to be tougher so 5‑under is terrific?
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   It is tough out there.   You need to drive it good, otherwise the rough, it's very, very thick, and it's not easy to play out of.   So you need to be playing very good off the tee and the greens are rolling really good, so I think that you can make the putts.

Q.   Something special about desert golf after the victory in Dubai? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, not just the victory in Dubai.   I've always said that I feel very comfortable here.   It reminds me a bit of home with the palm trees and the sand and the good weather, so I enjoy playing in short sleeves and in the sunshine.

Q.   And your break, was that at home?   Did you get a chance to recharge the batteries? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I did get the break I needed, some weeks with no golf at all, and then others to practise.   I've been all over the place; I've been on holiday, I've been at home and I've been in the Canaries, as well.
