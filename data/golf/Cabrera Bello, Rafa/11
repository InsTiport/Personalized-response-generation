RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Obviously right now disappointed.  If I had the last finishing six holes I would have won it.  I gave myself a chance, and that's obviously -- that's good in the big picture.   
 Q.  Is there a chance that you were going to take this week off?  I know you were contemplating that?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, I was contemplating that.  This is any fifth week in a row, and it's been lots of golf lately for me.  I've kind of been pushing, pushing through.  In the end I couldn't afford to take it off because I wasn't sure if I would have made next week.  And it didn't turn out all that bad being here.   
 Q.  Probably a good thing you did play.  You've had a good week all things considered?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes.   
 Q.  There was a point you were still the leader out there, were you aware of that when you were out on the course?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I think when I birdied 10 I saw myself that I tied the lead.  And immediately I birdied 11.  So I kind of figured I was in the solo lead.  But I wasn't really paying attention to it.  I was just trying to finish the round properly, keep the good play that I was demonstrating throughout the day, and I couldn't do that today.   
 Q.  Thomas said yesterday he's got one little doubt still about the pick, so are you hopeful you gave him something more to think about for Wednesday?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Well, I hope I wasn't the one who he was doubting about (laughter.)  But I mean I've done everything I can.  I love Ryder Cup.  It would be a huge honor to represent my continent again.  And I would be 100 percent availability if he needs me.  I do understand it's a difficult pick because there are lots of good players outside.  But I feel like even in my best chance, if he was trying to see if I was in form or not, I think this week proves that I am.
