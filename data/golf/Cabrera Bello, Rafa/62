Q. Just give us some thoughts on the game.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: It was a tough day out there today and I didn't do my best.  I feel tee to green I handled myself pretty good, just didn't quite manage to read the putts properly today.
Q. It was a fantastic week for you.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, it's still not over.  I have one more match to go.  I have the opportunity to win the consolation match.  And I'm going to play a world class player, 2 or 3 in the world.  It's a time to test my game against theirs.
Q. (Inaudible.)
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Exactly.  I really haven't given it much thought except the fact that I'm on and just to focus on this week, trying to get the most out of it.  But I'm sure from tonight onwards, I'll have a bigger smile.
Q. Overall impressions on Austin Country Club and the fans here in Austin?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Really good.  I think it's a great choice for match play.  I think everyone has the same opinion that it's a great venue, that it suits all types of players, long hitters and short hitters.  It's a very fair course, as well, and the fans are just excellent.
