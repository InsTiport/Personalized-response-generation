Q. Talk about your round a little bit?
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO: It was a rough start. But fortunately or unfortunately, however you want to see it, it wasn't the first time that I had three‑putted from three feet here at Augusta. So I kind of told myself that putt could happen to anyone, but I hadn't really been playing bad the first few holes. The scoring was a bit unlucky. Just hang in there, grind through the round, there will be some birdie opportunities. 
I made a really good putt on 7 and gave me a boost. And No. 8 I played it perfectly, I managed to birdie that as well. So it kind of felt like, okay, I was back in it. And really stayed patient and played good golf. Gave myself several chances and was able to recover the ones when I got into a little bit of trouble. So I was very pleased with the round.

Q. That putt on 7, can that really turn around a round, is that the way you think about it?
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, No.7 helped a lot. Sometimes it's not just one thing. I mean I think it was more that I was happy with the way Ihandled that three‑putt from three feet on five. I really stayed calm. I hit a good shot on to 6 and almost birdied there, as well. 
But, yeah, maybe the putt at 7 just came at the right time, because then I could birdie 8 and I felt like I generated a little bit of momentum and started the back nine with positive energy.
