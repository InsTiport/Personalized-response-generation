RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Hit a perfect drive.  A bit disappointed, I missed my second shot, caught it a bit thin.  Had the toughest shot in golf which is like a 50-yard bunker shot.  I played it good and left myself a chance and rolled the putt in.   
 Q.  Does it make things taste so much better after a tough day to finish in that style?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, it's been a tough day.  I made some early mistakes and have been fighting to get myself back to par all day long, and it was nice to get a birdie there and be able to shoot under par, yeah.   
 Q.  Exciting, therefore, to find yourself in this position into the final day?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, definitely.  It's a course that I like.  I've played here good before and I'm playing good at the moment.  I'm confident in my game, confident in my possibility, so let's go at it tomorrow.
