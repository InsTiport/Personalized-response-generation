RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, it's been a good week.  Disappointed with the bogey at 16 and 17.  A little costly.  Would have loved to finished 2nd.   
Obviously would have wanted to get off to a better start and maybe charge Si but he got off to a great start and it was really his tournament all the way.   
 Q.  Looking back, after the four days you're pleased with your efforts, though?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes.  It's been good two weeks in a row, making the trip from Rio to here to play good enough, it was great.   
 Q.  How did the rain delay the last two holes --  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Fortunately it's not something that we look forward to especially when the tournament was pretty much over, just two holes to go.  We're used to rain delays.  It's it's nothing something that we fancy.  Luckily we got to finish today.  Would have been bad if we didn't finish today.
