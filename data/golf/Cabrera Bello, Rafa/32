Q. You must be pleased.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Happy to be back here again and happy to start with a win.
Q. Semifinals last year.  You will be looking to go slightly better?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I've just got to figure it out one day, one man at a time.  It's funny because I think this tournament, it's probably the toughest one to win but I kind of approach it as the easiest one.  Instead of competing against 150 guys, you only compete against seven.  So you just have to go one at a time.
Q. What about the golf course, what is it you like about it?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I really like it.  I like the layout.  I like the greens.  I like how tricky it is.  You need to think every single shot.  I like the contrast between the front nine and the back nine.  I tend to be a big fan of Pete Dye and I really like this one.
Q. Can you see a little salsa grande in that front nine?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes.
Q. Making you feel very much at home?
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Pretty much.
Q. Obviously Sergio playing this week, Jon Rahm playing this week.  Spain is very well represented.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yeah, I think so.  I don't know the last time there were three Spaniards on this event.  It's nice that such a young talented player like Jon is here with us.
