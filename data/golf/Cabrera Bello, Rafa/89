 Q.   Well played, an excellent round of 64 and eagle on the second helped the foundations for that round.   Cab?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, thank you very much.   
It was a nice start.   I hit a great shot into it, because then you don't see the hole from the fairway, so I heard a big shout and it was nice.   
   
 Q.   It's been a fairly mixed year for you, so must be nice to get off to a positive start here?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, as you say, the year started off really good and it has not been so good over the past few months.   This course, I do like.   I've played well here before.   The weather should be good, although today was a bit messy but it was still warm, which is my type of conditions.   Nice start and hopefully I can get back on the right track.  
   
 Q.   In 2011 you finished second and you were 19‑under par over four rounds, so consistency is the key to shooting low here over the weekend?   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I think that we are seeing even lower scores this year because of the greens being softer.   So I think the winning score this year is going to be pretty, pretty low unless the wind really picks up, yeah.  
   
 Q.   They haven't had rain here for quite some time until today, so really the greens were a bit softer, more responsive and perhaps as hard as they would have been had we not had the showers today?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I think the greens were already a little softer Monday when we got here, but definitely the rain today, which at times it rained quite a bit has made them even a bit softer.   I think they should be holding up good enough, so people can still be rolling lots of putts.
