 Q.  A 66 puts you at 13-under.  You started the day six behind, went out in 13, went right into the mix in second place.  What was going through your mind at that point?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, obviously I knew I needed to get a hot start, and I think I birdied 1, which was always nice, and then eagled 6 and birdied 7.  So I'm like, okay, this is promising.  And then birdied 8 and 9, as well.  I'm like, okay, let's keep it going.  A little hiccup on 11 and 12 but finished strong with great birdies at the end.   
Overall, great round.  Pleased with it.  I feel it's going to be a little short, but you just never know.   
 Q.  Your best performance in a while since the Arnold Palmer back in March.  What positives to you take going forward?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: I felt like the last couple months since Arnold Palmer, I've been hitting the ball okay.  Without playing okay, I've been playing okay; not enough, I've made virtually every cut, and then not being able to get the weekends I needed.   
So the game has only been -- without being bad, it wasn't quite there.  I did feel it improved this week a bit.  I felt off the tee I was pretty good and I was happy with some iron shots, so I feel the swing is starting to look good again.  Excited for the events coming up.
