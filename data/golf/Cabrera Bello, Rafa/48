 Q.  How good was that to turn that around?  
SERGIO GARCÃA: It's the Ryder Cup, it's as simple as that.  It was tough out there.  I mean, they played so good, so well.  I felt like we played really, really good foursomes.  We were very consistent, giving ourselves chances, making birdies, but they had an amazing start.  We just kept telling each other:  Keep at it, keep at it, keep at it, keep putting pressure and hopefully at some point they will slow down a little bit and we managed to do that, so very happy.  Great partner.   
 Q.  What were you saying to each other to really keep a push right to the end to sneak a crucial half point?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Like Sergio said, we really didn't feel like we had many options at the beginning.  They were just cruising.  We were telling each other that we were playing good also; that we just have to keep doing our job; that they will eventually slow down, and that happened and we saw our window of opportunity.  They made a few mistakes and we played good down the last few holes and we managed to tie.   
 Q.  How much adrenaline was running through your veins the last couple of holes?  
SERGIO GARCÃA: I had to take a lot of breaths on 17 and 18 because the emotions were so high.  To be able to get it back to square and see that we actually had a chance of winning the match -- I mean, all credit to my partner.  First Ryder Cup and he reminds me of a little Spanish guy a few years ago.  I'm so happy for him.   
 Q.  On your Ryder Cup debut, have you experienced anything like that in your life?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: No, not really, nothing -- ever since we got here Monday.  Actually even before we got here just on the plane, I've really been loving the entire Ryder Cup experience.  And playing here, normally I get chicken-skin on the last few holes if I'm in contention.  Here I get it pretty much on every walk from green to the tee on every hole on every putt, and it's extremely exciting.   
 Q.  You looked dead and buried, didn't you.  
SERGIO GARCÃA: We still believed.  You know, we never give up for sure.  Obviously after the little putt I missed on 11, it didn't look great.  But we kept at it.  They kept throwing darts at us.  We made an amazing birdie on 12 to halve the hole, thanks to my partner's putt.  And we just saw a little window, just a little window they gave us and we grabbed the moment.   
We came back strong and actually had to fight hard to not lose the match.  That was a great -- it was a very well-played match.   
 Q.  To get anything from those two, Spieth and Reed, the way that they played in the early stages of that match is a real feather in the cap, isn't it.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I don't know how many birdies they had on the first 12 holes but it was a lot of them.  It was really, really hard for us but we're just hanging in there and obviously to steal a half a point, not just because it's them, which are obviously an extremely strong pairing, but any matches you halve a point when you're 4-down, it's a great chance.
