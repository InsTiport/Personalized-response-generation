 Q.   Ideal start to this championship?   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO: Yes, I don't know if it's the ideal, but for me, it's really, really a good way to start, yeah.  
I made four birdies on the front nine and three birdies on the back nine.   What I enjoyed most about the round was that I played pretty steady and I didn't have like a really high dip or any lows or anything.   I was just playing steady golf in the entire four and a half hours that we have been out there, so really, really pleased.  
   
 Q.   Nice playing alongside Danny Willett who won the last time the event was here?   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, exactly.   I didn't remember he had won here last time because I didn't play here, unfortunately, two years ago.   But I finally asked him, if there are some birdies out there for us today, and definitely someone will have to score around here, and it was Danny.   He played his game, I played mine, but it was nice to play with him.   
I'm playing good and I'm confident with it.   Obviously some weeks it's a bit more sharper than others but this week at the moment it started good and hopefully I can keep it up, yeah.   
   
 Q.   Do you know the new Seve film is out this week?   Is that something you want to see?   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I've seen very briefly some clips but I didn't know exactly it was out this week.   But I will go and watch it whenever I have a chance.
