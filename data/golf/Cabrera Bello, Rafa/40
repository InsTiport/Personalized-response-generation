 Q.  What's the verdict on both the week and final day?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, obviously the week if you look at it overall, it's a great week, finishing second.  Just a little disappointed today.  I managed to start good again but then struggled halfway through the front nine.   
Battled back really hard again, same as yesterday.  But then Sam just played a fantastic 18th hole.   
 Q.  Proud of those birdies late on to give yourself a chance down the last?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, of course.  Obviously still proud.  I messed up a little obviously on 7 and 8, but stayed calm and waited for my chances.  Gave myself lots of opportunities.  Some didn't fall, but at the end, 16 and 17, they were two great putts that did go in.  The one on 18th, almost, as well.  In the end, it's a good week.  It's just a bitter taste finishing runner-up.   
 Q.  Are you able to give an appreciation of what Sam has done?  Most of us wouldn't have known him before this tournament and you've been alongside him for two days.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, I've played with him the last two days.  He's played solid golf and been very patient and shown lots of maturity.  He's a well-deserved winner.
