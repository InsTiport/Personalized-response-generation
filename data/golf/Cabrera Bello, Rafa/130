   RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO: I haven't been playing great lately so to start with that score here is fantastic. Tw o years ago in this tournament I shot 65 here at Kingsbarns and so obviously this course suits me. I had a great start on the front nine, and the eagle at the third (seven iron to six feet) really set me up. But then to follow that with four birdies in seven holes meant I knew I was in for a decent score and on the back nine I felt under a bit of pressure because I didn't want to spoil a good round. I'm pleased with the way I hung on although I made a mistake at the last when I was between a seven and an eight and ended up hitting an eight iron short and down into the water. Actually, to get a bogey five after that was good.
