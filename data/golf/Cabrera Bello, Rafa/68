 Q.  What stage did you take control of that match?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Well, I mean, it's been a little bit of an up-and-down match for me.  Obviously started really good, got some holes on my side early on in the round.  I felt pretty much in control throughout the front nine, 3-up through the turn.   
Then I had a little bit of a messy start of the back nine.  Hideki also played really good those holes.  I don't know, I lost all my lead in just four or five holes.  Just hang in there.  I told myself that these type of things happen in match play, that there's still a lot to play for.  I really played good coming the last three holes.   
 Q.  This golf course, what do you think of it?  Does it suit you?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Well, I think it's a good golf course.  I think it's great for match play.  I do think it's kind of like a European golf course except for the beginning of the back nine, which is obviously a more American (indiscernible).  But I'm happy here.  I'm used to windy conditions.  I'm obviously playing good, really proud to get past a really, really hard opponent like Hideki.   
Now, let's see what happens the next few days.   
 Q.  Did you think you could drive 18?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I mean, I didn't rule it out, but it's not -- I was talking with my caddie, I've been hitting the driver really good all day.  I did feel that to a back pin being down there somewhere, it was a good spot to be.  That's why I decided to hit driver and came out really strong.  A little lower than I thought, but it must have gotten a really good kick and roll up the neck.  I'm take that, although my first putt wasn't -- it's not one I'm looking forward to remembering.
