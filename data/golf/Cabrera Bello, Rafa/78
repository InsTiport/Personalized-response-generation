Q. You must be very satisfied after a round like that and the position you find yourself?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I thought I played really good today.  It was good to follow up yesterday's positive round.  It had been a long break for me after Christmas.  You never know what to expect since you haven't played for so long.  Felt good out there.  Was pretty calm yesterday and today, as well, waiting my chances and I played some great golf.
Q. Are you feeling the benefit of eight weeks?  What did you do with yourself?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: A little bit of everything.  Some time off, some time with the family and some time to practise.
Q. And that recharged the batteries and made you think about the game and getting in the right kind of shape for the season?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Definitely, it cleans out your mind and it's good to reset.  We come here with no baggage at all, so it's always -- we're a happy man out there.
Q. No baggage but some good memories.  You tend to play well in desert golf in these conditions.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yeah, it feels like home to me.  I like the sun.  I like a gentle breeze and I like palm trees.  These courses, they are always in really good shape, and I think they suit my game.
Q. Quite a delay today.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, surprising.  We've seen like a very, very slight fog here in the morning sometimes but it normally fades away quite quickly.  This one took, I don't know, three hours to go away, which was unexpected, but it's a pity that the cut won't be able to be completed today.  But I don't know, I've done my part and that's for the other guys out there to worry about.
