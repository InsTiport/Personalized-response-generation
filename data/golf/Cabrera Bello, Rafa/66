 Q.  You've got all sorts of guns, don't you?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Thank you, thank you very much.  Soren has been a really tough competitor today.  Obviously he didn't have anything to lose, so he -- I mean, he was playing a bit more relaxed, but you could see that he still wanted to win.  Made it really tough for me.  I still felt I played good.   
Not so many putts dropped in today, but I was just hanging in there.  When I saw I was 1-down really on 18, I told myself, just don't think of it as one single hole, just think that you have got two holes.  I knew I had the playoff guaranteed, so I'm like -- it was in a way I felt like I was going to play two playoffs.  I figured out of two, I should be able to get one.  Hit a really good drive and Soren, fortunately, made it easier for me.   
 Q.  You are the 52nd ranker player in the world.  A bit of a surprise that you advanced out of this group.  Did you feel confident in yourself coming into this week?  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes, I started this year pretty good.  My game is good.  I do believe in my game.  I know when I play good, I can beat almost anybody.  I have done it before.  Why not keep doing it this week.
