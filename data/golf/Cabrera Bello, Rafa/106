Q.   Wonderful finish, five birdies in a row?
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, it was very nice to finish that way obviously.   I don't know, I was playing good.   Played good the par 5s, as well.   Managed to hit two very good shots, as well, in the holes in between and then holed a long one on 17. 
So I know it didn't happen easy, but it felt easier than it was.   It just happened, really, rather than me having to work really, really hard first.

Q.   It seemed like one of those days where you are under the radar, nothing special, but then suddenly you're nicely in place now. 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, absolutely.   The tournament has changed for me quite a bit and these last six holes‑‑ I played really good yesterday.   I finished quite disappointed, shooting 1‑over par, which in the end, in the conditions, it wasn't a bad round, but I felt I could have gone much, much lower. 
Today I was playing very good again, just nothing happening on the greens, and I'm just glad that things happened for on the last third of the round.   It's put me where I know I can be and where I feel I am playing at, so it's good to be here. 

Q.   And do you tell yourself, this is The Final Series, big events, back‑to‑back, time to really push on for a good finish to the season? 
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Well, I'm not really like telling myself exactly that but I know they are big events and definitely The Final Series.   I feel that my year has not been going as good as I know I can play. 
So I'm just pushing hard.   I know that a good month here can completely change the year around, and that's what I'm looking for.   So keep practicing and see what happens.
