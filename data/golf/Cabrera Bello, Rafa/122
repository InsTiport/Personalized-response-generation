 Q.   How do you feel from that win?   
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   I'm very pleased.   I played really good today again.   Richard, he fought back really hard so it was a really, really tough match.   I was lucky enough that I could pull a few clear at the beginning, similar way I did yesterday, and the rest of the game, I protected my lead and managed to win a lot of holes again.   
   
 Q.   You are making it look comfortable out there; is it?   
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   No, it's not comfortable.   The competition is very serious.   Match play, especially when you are only like one or two up, it could disappear very, very quickly.   
So you just need to stay tough and just try to go for it on every hole, because if not, someone else is going to do it and end up winning.  
   
 Q.   It was tricky out there as well, wind gusting from different angles.   
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, the most tricky was the wind changed completely the direction, we have been playing with easterly mainly, southeasterly and it changed to westerly, maybe northwesterly.   So completely different course from what we have played the previous days.  
   
 Q.   And could be different tomorrow, as well; so now the trick is to rest up, isn't it, with a long weekend ahead potentially?  
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, potentially a long weekend.   I'm playing really good but this is match play and you never know what's going to happen.   So just play one match at a time, one hole at a time, and hopefully we can have a long weekend.
