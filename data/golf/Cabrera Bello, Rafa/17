Q. Very strong round, walking off with a 65.
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, obviously very pleased.  Bogey on 2 and took awhile for the first birdie to come, but I did play good.  I putted good.  I didn't put myself in lots of trouble and I made lots of birdie putts.
Q. You had a fantastic run from 6 onwards.  How nice to string a run of birdies together?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I feel like on this course, with the way the greens are soft right now, you could really get into a streak of three or four birdies in a row.  I was lucky to did that today from 6 until 9, so I mean, I holed a couple of good putts.  Hit some very good shots in, and yeah, I mean, I really feel there's lots of potential.
Q. Is it nice to be more aggressive with the greens being soft as perhaps you were at Wentworth last week?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I feel that you can attack the pins here.  I mean, you still don't want to miss on the wrong side because obviously you could have -- the rough is quite thick and you could have a tricky up-and-down, but I do feel that with the conditions of the greens being this soft, you can be way more aggressive than average and a little less careless.
Q. Is it a slight relief that the break was only one hour, because you were standing over a putt when the horn blew?
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I kind of felt that the storm was creeping on us, and I was a bit worried that they would blow the horn in the middle of my stroke.  Tried to stall a bit and at the end they actually blew it on the middle of my -- well, at the beginning of my back stroke, so managed to stop that.  Just one-hour delay, it's nice that there's no real damage done.  We all get in to night, I assume, and we have a fresh start in the morning.
