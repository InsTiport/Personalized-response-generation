RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: It was nice today, I'm still a little bit tired from last week, but I enjoyed it.  Playing with Dermot Desmond, we've become very good friends over the last few years, so it was nice to play with him again.
Also in our fourball, we had Martin Kaymer and his dad, so it was a very friendly fourball.  It helped today because it wasn't raining.  That's all that I could have wished for.  I felt good today with my game, and I didn't do too bad a score.  Not as good as Alex Noren, but it was okay.
