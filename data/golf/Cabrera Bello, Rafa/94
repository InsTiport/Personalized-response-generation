 Q.   A good knock for the first day, considering all the disruptions.   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yeah, starting here on Wentworth on this tough course, I'm really, really pleased.   
   
 Q.   You said it's a tough course; you're not making it look that way?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   The way it played yesterday, the Pro‑Am, we played with hard greens, hard fairways.   I thought the scores were going to be high.   When I got to the course this morning and I saw that the guys were killing it, I'm like, oh, my God, what am I going to do.  
But then I heard there had been a lot of rain overnight and I just figured that the greens were softer.   I still felt a little intimidated at the beginning because I'm like, wow, they are really, really scorched.   But I don't know, I just convinced myself that the other guys were doing it and then there was really a way to score out there.   
I got off to a good start, birdied the second and eagled the fourth and that gave me a lot of confidence.   I didn't make many mistakes.   Those few shots that I didn't play good, I managed to save and then just had a silly bogey with a 3‑putt on the ninth.   
But the back nine again, I played really solid and gave myself lots of chances, really close ones, and I managed to make a few more birdies, yes.   
   
 Q.   Is it your best around here?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   My best round, yes, definitely, I would say so.   
   
 Q.   A long first day but you're right up on that board?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, it's hard not to be in a good position shooting a low round on the first day but still a lot to go and many guys still to finish, a long day tomorrow, as well, and hopefully more for the weekend.   So yeah, good position, but it's j‑u‑s‑t really only starting.
