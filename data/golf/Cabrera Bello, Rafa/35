 Q.  Thoughts on that final round today?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Well, obviously going to be two or three shots back.  I felt I played good enough.  Just kind of didn't get things going for me on the greens.  Gave myself lots of chances but not quite -- I mean, I wasn't able to take advantage of them.  But in general overall, I played good.  First six, seven holes, it was much easier without the wind.   
Wind kind of picked up on holes 7,8, and then we had a really windy back nine.  It was tough.  Overall, it's just been a good week.  Just disappointing of not having been able to be fighting till the end for the title.  But just I couldn't get anything going on the greens today.   
 Q.  Disappointed but game is in great shape going into Dubai.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, this year I'm playing good, too.  Abu Dhabi, I started good the first two days.  This week, it's nice to finish Top-10 again.  So looking forward to next week, as well, and continuing The Desert Swing.
