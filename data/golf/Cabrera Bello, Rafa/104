  RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   I played pretty good, very few mistakes, if any, just that bogey at the 14th, but the rest I felt pretty comfortable.   Started off good and kept calm, played good throughout the middle holes at the end.   The finishing holes, the wind has picked up a little bit, they are playing tough but still played them good.   I managed not to drop any more shots.   
   
 Q.   Is there something good desert courses, having won down the road in Dubai before?   
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I always say the same thing:   I feel very comfortable playing in short sleeves with warm weather.   The palm trees around and all the sand, it reminds me of the Canary Islands.   So I do feel a lit like home here even though we are in another part of the world.   
I do appreciate playing in good weather and these good courses, and of course Dubai, with me having won on the other side of the road here, obviously always brings back good memories to be in this city, yes.  
   
 Q.   I take it your length off the tee helps on the Earth Course?  
RAFA CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, I think it's a course that suits long hitters.   I mean, you still need to hit it straight because some holes are quite long.
