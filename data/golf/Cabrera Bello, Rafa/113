 Q.   You've beaten a man 52 places ahead of you in the World Rankings.   How good does that feel?  
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO:   Well, it feels very good.   I didn't know about that being 52 spots or anything, but I just know really obviously the odds were in his favor, but in match play anything can happen.   I just tried my best, and I was fortunate enough to win.   
   
 Q.   2‑down and seven holes to go against someone of Lee's quality, what were you thinking?  
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO:   Well, just stay patient.   No, front nine‑‑ yesterday I didn't play‑‑ I made a couple sloppy mistakes, and that's why I was losing the match.   Obviously Lee was also playing good.   But then, I don't know, just I birdied 10, birdied 11, that gave me confidence because I know that I had started playing good again.   It's just, I never expect anything in particular, I just know match play anything can happen, that 1‑ or 2‑down may seem like a lot, but it's a difference that could disappear very quickly.   So I just tried to play good.   Lee made a couple mistakes on the back nine and dropped a couple shots, got it to the playoff, and I think I played a really good playoff hole, made birdie and ended up winning.  
   
 Q.   Martin Kaymer tomorrow, they don't get any easier, do they?  
RAFAEL CABRERA BELLO:   No, no, I don't think that anyone is expecting an easy match here at the World Match Play.   Martin Kaymer really good friend of mine, so I'm really looking forward to it.
