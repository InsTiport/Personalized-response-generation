Q. Just take us through that form.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Thank you, it was totally unexpected.  I just rolled probably one of the toughest putts on my life.  I stroked it perfectly.  I had an okay lie just off the green in the rough, but didn't really fancy a chip.  It was a fast and tricky chip.  All the grass and all the grain.  I decided just to putt it and it came out perfect, hugged the edge of the slope and miraculously go in the hole.
Q. Two wins heading into Friday.  You are in control of the group.  Tell us about your play.  You are playing nicely.
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes, I am playing very good.  It's a golf course I like.  I came early and prepared good.  I played Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.  So really got a sense of the course, even with this wind, which has been different to the other previous days.  I'm just happy that my game is still good, started good this year.  I'm feeling really confident and I really happy to be in this position coming into tomorrow.
