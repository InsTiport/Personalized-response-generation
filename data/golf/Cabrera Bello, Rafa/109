 Q.   Good start today.   2‑under?  
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Thank you very much.   I played very good.   Played solid from tee to green, on the greens as well, it was pretty good.   I just felt I did all the parts of the game properly and that's why the score played out as it did.  
   
 Q.   Do you like the traditional course like this?  
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Absolutely.   The layout is very good and the setup is very challenging.   
Luckily for us it rained last night, so the greens were softer today and that made it easier to hit aggressively to the pins.   Overall, I mean I think the course is in great condition and it's a fantastic venue for this event.  
   
 Q.   You feel pretty good.   It's what you wanted to do today, stay in it, be right in the mix?  
RAFAEL CABRERA‑BELLO:   Yes, just first day, just wanted to start see what happens.   The last time I played was the Open and I played good there.   I'm happy that I have kept the good momentum going.   I will try to play good the next three days.
