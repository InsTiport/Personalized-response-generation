 Q.  Tell us how good in slightly breezy conditions a round of 68 is?  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, I'm very pleased with my 68 today.  I don't feel I'm striking the ball perfect but I am managing to handle myself on the course very good.  I'm putting good, as well.  I'm not making many mistakes and it's just been a little bit of improvement.   
Regarding yesterday, I didn't hit it good off the tee yesterday.  Got myself into trouble.  Managed to stay out of trouble from the tee today, and that has primarily been the difference.   
 Q.  Presumably excitement builds when you have three birdies in succession so early in the round.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Yes, it's a really nice way to start.  The back nine, once you go past 12, it's probably a hard stretch, 13 and 15, 16, those are tricky holes.  Even the par 5s at the end could be a little cruel to someone, so you want to get the birdies early on in the round and I was happy to do so.   
 Q.  I know you're only at the halfway stage, as is the leader; do you look at the board and think, that's not bad for a weekend.  
RAFA CABRERA-BELLO: Definitely.  I'm five shots off the lead.  A little further than what I would like, but I'm satisfied with the way I've played, just being five shots off the lead, I think I'm in a good position.  I don't think the leader will go very -- will go much lower than that so far, and it happens it's only probably one guy.   
So I think I'm going to have my options for the weekend and just try to play better every day, keep sinking putts.
