Q.  It's always a disappointing to end with a bogey, but you
must be pleased with your position?
RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO:  Yeah, I would have definitely
taken -1 after two days, absolutely, and so I'm happy with the
position.  I'm disappointed for the bogey finish, but just forget
about it and that's it.  Tomorrow is another day.
Q.  How much different was the course playing today compared
to yesterday?
RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO:  Yeah, I think it was obviously
drier.  Everything was harder.  Some pin positions were pretty
tricky, as well.  And the greens were very, very fast.  It was
tough.
Q.  You got through the first two days making the cut.  Are
you looking forward to the weekend?
RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO:  Yes.  It's going to be more
challenging.  Should be fun.
Q.  Last question, can you get aggressive on this course or
do you have to stay patient?
RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO:  You have to be patient, you can't
play aggressive.  The way the course is playing, you can hit some
very, very extremely long drives and have downwind holes.  If you
want to get aggressive, even some par-4s are drivable.
Q.  What's the best part of your game for the two days, do
you think?
RAFAEL CABRERA-BELLO:  Yesterday was all very complete.
I'd say maybe iron play.  Maybe that's the best thing so far.
