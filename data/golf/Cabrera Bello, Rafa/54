 Q.  Outstanding day for you.  You shot 65 and 14-under going into tomorrow.  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Well, I mean I played pretty good again today.  Hit the ball good, good off the tee.  I've avoided the mistakes I've been doing the previous two days off the tee and putting was good yesterday but not brilliant as the first day.   
Iron play pretty steady all week.  One mistake on No. 8, pulled my iron shot end -- sorry, No. 7 with a double there but the rest is almost impeccable round.   
 Q.  Even when you were in the rough you hit 15 of 18 greens today.  That second shot no matter where it was, you could go from was really good.  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: I still felt that I don't know how many fairways I hit but if I wasn't in the fairways I think I must have been in a few first cuts but I was always on the right side of -- I mean hitting towards the green from the right side of the fairway or just out so it's been -- I mean it's easier when you hit lots of greens.   
 Q.  Thoughts on tomorrow.  I guess you know you're going to have to go low again.  That's been the story here all week.  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Yes, definitely the course is good.  There is damage to be done.  The greens are brilliant.  You play good and give yourselves chances you will roll putts and that's what I'm going to try to do tomorrow, just play one shot at a time and stay patient, wait till the end.  Of course it would be great to have a good strong start and just catch up with the leaders.  Going to wait for my opportunity and try to take the chance.   
 Q.  Well done today, good luck tomorrow.  
RAFA CABRERA BELLO: Thank you very much.
