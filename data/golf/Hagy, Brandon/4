Q. Tremendous finish.  What does this do for your confidence moving forward to the last couple of events of the season?  You're 129th in the FedExCup, but after this week, you'll be inside that magic 125.
BRANDON HAGY: It feels really good. I've worked really hard for this.  I've played some good golf.  I think some of my finishes haven't shown how I've been playing.  It's kind of the rub of the green.
It's tough out here.  It's all the best players in the world, but I knew I just had to keep staying the course and working on -- especially the short iron, short game.  I've had some really good putting weeks.  So if I can get the driver in play and hit that good, and have some of the short irons, get close, I knew there would be a good week in there.  It feels pretty good.
Q. Did you think this golf course suited your game?
BRANDON HAGY: Yeah, I'm hitting driver a lot.  There's a lot of bunkers where I can carry the bunkers.
So I think absolutely, it definitely suits my eye.  There's four par 5s that I'm reaching a few of them depending on the wind where I might be the only guy; a couple guys have a chance to go for it.  I dialed it back today.  I had a chance to go for it on 13.  I definitely could have gotten it there.  We laid up, made birdie.  That shows more confidence, more wedge play, to be able to make a birdie that way.
Q. A bit of an up-and-down day, you made a handful of birdies, an eagle on the front nine but a couple bogeys coming in.  How would you sum up your final round?
BRANDON HAGY: I'm really proud of how I played.  It's nice to make that eagle on the second hole and kind of get it going.  Made some good putts.  Chipped in once.  I'm just really happy with how I kept my composure out there and tried to stay as neutral as possible.  I've been working on that a lot this last year, too, so it definitely played off.
Q. Are you playing next week at the Barracuda?
BRANDON HAGY: Yeah.
Q. Have you ever played golf in Canada before this week?
BRANDON HAGY: I've played two Web.com events and it was good.  I think three years ago, Nova Scotia was my first pro tournament.
