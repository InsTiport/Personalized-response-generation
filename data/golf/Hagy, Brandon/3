Q. Brandon, great start.  Four birdies right out of the gate.  Just comment on your round as a whole, though?
BRANDON HAGY: Yeah, obviously to start with four birdies in a row helps get the day going.  And made some good putts out there and good drives and few iron shots when I needed to hit it close and a few tap-ins in the first four holes.
Q. Kept the momentum going from Canada.  Just comment on how well you're playing right now?
BRANDON HAGY: Yeah, I mean I've been playing well for this last month, I would say.  Last week I put it together a little bit more.  I love it up here, though.  I love mountains.  I've been going to Sierra Nevadas my whole life, since I was a kid, so just this environment gets me going a little bit too.
Q. I know you missed the cut the only time you played here, but how does this course set up for you?
BRANDON HAGY: It's good.  I'm able to hit a few clubs less than driver off the tee and keep it in play.  And the ball is going forever, too.  So, if I need to hit a shorter club and hit it higher and stop it closer I can do that.  So I think it sets up well.
Q. Currently inside the top 125, I know it's an important time of the season.  Comment on your goals here the last few weeks.
BRANDON HAGY: Last week, it was a big week for me.  I just want to continue to keep the momentum going into the playoffs.  And I like where the game is right now and I'm doing good things in all parts of it, and just kind of keep going.
Q. Just talk about your round today.  You started with four birdies?
BRANDON HAGY: The start was nice.  I had a few tap-ins, kind of keep it going, hit some good shots, and I hit some close iron shots, made a few good putts coming in.
Q. What do you think about the modified Stableford system?  Obviously you can't do this anywhere else in the tour?
BRANDON HAGY: I think it encourages some aggressive play.  I like this format because I do make a lot of birdies and eagles, so I think a couple of birdies, obviously, makes up for one bogey here and there.  I think it's fun to kind of mix up the pace.
Q. Is it fun to do something different?
BRANDON HAGY: Absolutely.  We play a ton of 72-hole, stroke-play tournaments.  We have match-play events.  And I think this one definitely mixes it up.
Q. What do you think about playing at this kind of altitude and the key -- how does that impact the game?
BRANDON HAGY: I work a lot on my fitness, so I think the altitude and heat is definitely an advantage for me.  But I played in altitude before.  You just kind of have to figure out what percentage you're going to use to take off with what numbers you have coming into the green.
Q. You said you played college golf at Cal.  Is it fun coming -- it's close to Cal?  You're kind of in the region.
BRANDON HAGY: Absolutely.  There will be some people that come up and watch me from that area and I love the Sierra Nevada.  I've been coming up here since I was a little kid more in So Cal, but I came up to Tahoe during school and stuff.  It definitely feels a little bit more like home.
Q. You've got to like the number you put up today and you're on the top of the leaderboard.  Good start for you this week.
BRANDON HAGY: For sure.  It was nice to carry that momentum from last week into this week.  I felt comfortable last week having my name out there and just trying to continue that this week.
Q. Talk about that shot out of the sand trap on 18.  You really salvaged that hole.  That was a great shot.
BRANDON HAGY: I almost pulled off the approach shot.  I clipped the tree and went into the bunker, but I've really worked on that part of my game quite a bit and had a lot of good bunker shots in the last few tournaments.  So I didn't feel stress at all.  I knew I had a good chance to get it up-and-down.
Q. Number one, your only bogey.  What happened on that hole?
BRANDON HAGY: Actually I had three 3-putts on the back nine.  I 3-putted both the par 5s.  And they weren't, like, easy 2-putts, but the first hole, that one just got away from me a little bit.
Q. How do you approach tomorrow?  Want to change up tomorrow?
BRANDON HAGY: I don't think so.  Going into the afternoon, you have to be a little bit more aware of how the ball's bouncing on the greens.  It'll probably be a little bit more wind but not really.  Shouldn't be too different.
