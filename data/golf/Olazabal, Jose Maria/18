 Q.   Go ahead and talk about your round today.   
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Oh, it was a so‑so round.   I mean, it was not too bad.   I didn't make many putts, I didn't give myself too many chances either.   
I made a few silly mistakes, especially with the irons.   I think the irons were a little bit off today.   
I missed two greens and put myself into bad spots and that's why it cost me two bogeys.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions today and how do you expect the rain that's supposed to come in changing for tomorrow?  
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Well, it's supposed to come in, we will see if it comes or not.   I think the conditions were great.   It was just a slight breeze, the greens are holding okay, so the golf course is in great shape.   
Weather‑wise, we'll have to wait and see.   Obviously, if the rain comes, then the course will be playing softer, but at the same time it will be playing longer.   
We have had a bit of run on the fairways today and that won't be the case if we get some rain.   So we'll have to wait and see there.   But condition‑wise, it's been perfect.
