  Q. What pleased you about your play?   
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Pretty much everything. I played solid golf today. Hit a lot of good shots. Missed a couple obviously but overall it was a steady round of golf.  
  
  Q. Give us a sense of conditions out there right now?  
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Similar to yesterday. Maybe not as tough as yesterday at the moment. But close, yeah.   
  
  Q. What about the leaders, they are going out, obviously starting at 8-under, 7-under, what sort of score are they looking at to try to win this thing?  
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Well, I've seen the leaderboard and Alvaro seems to be on fire. He's 4-under after five holes. It's a tough day and the boys will come and you have to be patient. But I reckon somewhere around 10-under par, something like that.  
  
  Q. Nice for you to play four weeks in a row?   
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Yeah, it was nice and actually that's the best part of these four weeks, the body has held on really good.
