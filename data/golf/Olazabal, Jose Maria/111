MARIA ACACIA:  How are you feeling? 

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   I'm feeling okay. 

MARIA ACACIA:  Is the course very wet? 

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   The course is quite wet, but I think this wind will dry the course quite a bit.  It's playing really difficult.  I don't think that the wind was very much predicted this afternoon, but it's really tough.  This is not a course where you really like to see the wind blowing too hard.

If the wind keeps blowing as it is now, the scores will be like basketball scores.


Q.  Did you get your way in having the cork trees cut back; didn't you want the cork trees trimmed at certain places?

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Well, I said it was something I wanted.  I said that some of the trees are in play, some of the branches are getting too much inside the greens and it's affecting hitting good shots.  I think they have to take care of that.


Q.  And they haven't done it or have they?

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Not to my knowledge.  I don't think the course has changed a bit.  I might be wrong but I see still the same trees in the same places.
