 Q. Eight birdies, four bogeys, how do you feel about your day overall? 
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Well, it was an awesome start. I have to say, I hit a few good shots early in the round and then I made a couple of silly mistakes. Like the one on 1, I missed the second shot on the short side and those are the silly mistakes that I shouldn't do. 
 But overall, obviously pleased with the way things have gone the last two days. I think there is a little bit of improvement maybe off the tee, but the rest of the game has been pretty good. 

 Q. A frustrating year for you; how are you feeling coming into this week, was it feeling like it might be a better week?
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Not really, if I have to be honest. No, still a little bit of pain here and there, shoulders and the lower back, and especially when I wake up in the mornings, it's kind of really stiff and it hurts a little bit. So I have to live with that for the time being and try to do the best I can. 

 Q. How much does this golf course examine every aspect of your game? 
 JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Well, I have to say that the golf course is soft and wet, and that is helping the shots on to the green. The greens are very receptive. You can keep any club on to the green, a 3-iron or 4-iron and the ball is going to stop quick, and that is helping obviously the objective of scoring low.
 But you have to shape the ball both ways and I think it favors the long hitters to be honest. There is a lot of carry shots off the tee and in that regard, obviously that helps on every golf course to be a long hitter, but maybe this week, even more so.
