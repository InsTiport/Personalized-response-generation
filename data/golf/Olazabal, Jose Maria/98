Q. You've had a great Spring in America, and then you came back and did well in Ireland last week - do you feel in good shape?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Well, I didn't hit the ball that well last week and I struggled with my game to be honest. I didn't play well at all last week but I am trying to get it back somehow to where it was and it's still not there but we will see what happens this week.
Q. You've done well here in the past?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: I have had all kind of things around here. I've had good years, I've had bad years. This is a golf course that will test your nerves - especially on the greens. But it's a great track and if you play it right then you will score well.
Q. What about the girls you played with today?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  They all played really solid, very good. Melissa (Reid) and Henrietta (Brockway) were the longest of three and Carly (Both) was a little bit shorter but a very clever golfer and she managed her way round really well.
Q. She is only 12!
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: Yes I know, I know. The other two were lovely players as well. Henrieta has a lovely swing - her putting was probably her weakest point, then Melissa overall was pretty good.
Q. Would you say Cary has a weakness, bearing in mind she is only 12?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  No not really. The way she played today was very steady from tee to green. Her putting is good and very aggressive but maybe they are not used to the speed of the greens they played on today. But over all they were all very good, very impressive.
