Q.
Talk about this interesting position.  You obviously are grinding to make the Top 125.  Are you feeling good this week?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  I'm not feeling good about my game I have to say.  I'm not striking the ball well.  I'm fighting the best way I can.  Today was clearly short of that.

I didn't make a lot of great shots, but I made a bunch of up-and-downs, and whenever I had a very good chance I made it, and that's why I managed to score well, but I really don't feel all that good about my swing.
Q.  It must be saying something then because you're 8th or 9th.
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Yeah, but the thing is I'm trying to fight as hard as I can.  I think it's more trying too hard and grinding to good scoring than it is to good swinging the club.
Q.  How closely have you been paying attention to the Money List and all that stuff?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  You know, I mean, I don't mess around much about it, but you only have to look at it once and you know where you're standing and how you need to do obviously.

I mean, I'm in a very delicate situation, and the reason why I came here to play these last two events is just trying to get out of that situation.

But obviously it's going to be very, very difficult.
Q.  If by chance you fell short, would you go back to Q-school?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  No, I'll be playing back in Europe and maybe get some invites here, and that's it.
