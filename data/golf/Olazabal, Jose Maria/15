 Q.   After yesterday's 68, you described your game as a bit of a battle at times, what do you say after today, 69?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Today was a little bit more consistent.   I still missed a few drivers.   But overall, I think it was steadier today than it was yesterday.   I'm pretty happy with the score obviously but I know I have to improve a little bit, especially with my driver.  
   
 Q.   How much is this course and these conditions examining the different aspects of the game at the moment?     
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I think it is testing every aspect of the game to be honest.   It's windy out there.   You have to chip the ball, depending on the wind, you have to chip it one way or another to get close to those holes.   Obviously you have to avoid the bunkers.   There's plenty of those around here.   Especially on greens with the wind, it's not all that easy to putt on.  
   
 Q.   It's often said that the players of your class never forget how to close a tournament out; do you agree with that adage?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's going to be hard for me to remember the last time I won, so, we'll see.   There's two more days to go.   My goal is to keep on improving my game and to put myself in positions like this.   What happens on Sunday, we will see.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on day two around here?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was a good round.   Conditions were a little bit more difficult.   The wind was blowing a little bit more today, even though they move a few tees further up.   
You know, it was a steady round, I played quite well and still missed a few drivers, and I need to improve on that area but obviously very happy with the score.  
   
 Q.   Was the driver behaving a little bit more today?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Behaved a little better today I have to say, yeah.   
   
 Q.   You certainly gave yourself plenty of opportunities, didn't you?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, you know, I missed a couple of chances but on the other hand, I made a great save on No. 5.   I made a long putt there to save par.   
You know, all in all, I think I was okay on the greens.   I cannot complain about that these last two days.   I think that there are other areas where I have to improve a little bit more.  
   
 Q.   You've never been a man to live in the past but let me take you back 23 years‑‑  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   At the moment, no, obviously there's two more days to go, a lot of golf to be played, and my main goal to be honest is to improve certain areas of my game, and to put myself in a situation like this come Sunday.   But you know, Sunday is a little bit far away.   We will have to wait and see what happens at the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything about Portmarnock that sticks in the mind from all those years ago?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Not really.   To be honest I'm just taking every day at a time.   I'm trying to regain my form and that's my goal at the moment.   
   
 Q.   I guess we don't really know what the weather is going to bring for the weekend, but any indication of what might be needed here?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No idea to be honest.   It depends on what the weather brings us.   Obviously if the wind blows, the scoring is going to be a little bit higher.   
As I said yesterday, I think the setup of the course is allowing to have better scores than the last time we played here.   But still, if the wind blows, it's not going to be easy.
