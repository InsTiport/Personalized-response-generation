Q.  Nice way to finish the match with a 15 foot birdie putt?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Yeah, something like that.  It was good.  It was a good morning obviously.  I played pretty steady, didn't make many mistakes, and pretty much that's what you have to do.
Q.  As far as overall in the week, do you look at the draw or anything?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  No.
Q.  Just kind of take it one match at a time?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  No, what's the point of just looking at all    it's just a matter of just playing good golf and playing every match and do the best you can, and hopefully you keep on winning matches.
Q.  As far as the course conditions, obviously different than in the past.  More fun to play this year?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Well, it's playing like it should be playing, let's put it that way.  We've had bad weather in all the previous years, and this is a lovely week.
Q.  Greens in good shape?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Yeah.  You know, they're poa annua grass, but there are not so many players playing this week, and with the weather and the greens being a little bit drier, obviously the whole golf course is in much better shape than ever.
Q.  Overall as far as your game, pretty good shape?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Well, still struggling a little bit with my shots into the green, to be honest.  That's the thing I'm going to have to improve on, and hopefully just make a few putts.
