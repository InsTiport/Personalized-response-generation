Q.  Just wondered what was your opinion overall on the golf course?

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   In what sense? 


Q.  Overall what are your feelings on the condition of the golf course, considering the weather?  And you must have been delighted with the way you came back on those last two holes after 15 and 16. 

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Regarding the conditions on the golf course, this golf course is a golf course that is a very tough one.  It makes you play a little bit defensive.  It doesn't allow you to play aggressive because if you play that way, well, sooner or later, the golf course is going to get you.

After the rain we had early in the week, the fairways are a little soft but the golf course is in very good shape. 

Regarding my finish, obviously I'm very delighted the way I finished after the two bogeys on 15 and 16.  Anything under par around here is good. 


Q.  How tough is 17? 

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   Well, you're not relaxed until the hole is over, let's put it that way.  (Laughter.)
