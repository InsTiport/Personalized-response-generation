  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I was very pleased.   They played really well.   They were determined to win.   Sometimes the determination helps and I think it did this time.   And you know, I'm very proud.   A few guys really played extraordinary well all along the week.   And, you know, it was a great performance. 

Q.   You said before that you would put the strongest team‑‑
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Correct, it's always the same these days.   The differences between‑‑ it comes down to little things.   Playing at that level, that's what you get.   You get drama, you get the attention and great matches were played.   We saw an exciting match in the Seve Trophy in the last match of the last day and it doesn't get any better than that. 

Q.   The team last night‑‑
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   They were all relaxed.   I told them, you know, it was just a bad afternoon session.   But we started from scratch and today was a big day.   We needed five points and a half, and we knew we had to play really hard, and the start was very important, Gonzalo and Nico gave us a point and a half that was very important, and some players did very, very well. 

Q.   How impressed was Paul with the golf? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I'm pretty sure they will take some notes regarding certain players.   I think there are a few players that did very well, and not just their performances, but also their attitude on the golf course.   I think that sometimes is very important when you have to face a big opponent like we do at The Ryder Cup. 

Q.   Captaincy duties, Seve Trophy, Ryder Cup, and you've won both‑‑ if someone twists your arm, you'd come back? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I said it before the tournament when I was asked why I was doing the captaincy.   Obviously Paul had Miguel in mind, but because he played so well, and Thomas was already on the team, he didn't have really any senior player, especially that they would look at and he asked me if I would do it this time.   Obviously I was more than proud, but, you know, I think that's it.
