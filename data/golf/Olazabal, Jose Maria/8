 Q.   Thoughts on day two?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, just a fraction of disappointment.   We let a point go with the Italians.   They had the match under control until the very end.   Then Great Britain and Ireland turned things around there and got that point.   But overall 3‑2 is not that bad.   
It's pretty much what we've said all along.   These guys play great golf, and you have to be on your toes.   
   
 Q.   We enjoyed the tension and drama of the last match.   I daresay you didn't enjoy it nearly as much but it was important.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, correct, it was very important.   It would make even a bigger difference with obviously on the final result of the day.   But that's the way it is.   I mean, golf, when you play at this kind of level, it's decided on little things, and today was a good proof of that.  
   
 Q.   It's not a little thing, you've had to leave two players out for the foursomes in the morning; who and why?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I've left Thomas BjÃ¶rn and Mikko for tomorrow morning.   Obviously you know Thomas I think is okay.   He played well today but 36 holes tomorrow, it could be just a little too much in the sense that I want him fresh for Sunday.   
And Mikko, no particular reason.   The rest of the guys were playing good.   I kept two pairings the same way because they have done well so far, and I've had to rest another guy and in this case it was Mikko.   But most probably he will be playing in the afternoon.  
   
 Q.   And your stand out pair, they play together, Colsaerts and Fernandez‑CastaÃ±o?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   They played awesome golf yesterday and today.   There is no reason to change that pairing so far any ways.   That's why I think with that pairing, and the same reason for Joost and GrÃ©gory.   I think they both played really well again today and it seems to me that, you know, they understand each other very well on the golf course.   So I'm sticking with those two.
