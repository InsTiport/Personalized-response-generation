 Q.   Your position in the tournament going into the final day?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's just a shame.   Obviously the leaders are running away.   I think they are just too far, and it was another day, another bad day off the tee again.   The driver cost me big again.   I think hit only three fairways today, and it's very, very difficult to score when you do that.   
   
 Q.   Not easy sometimes to look at the positive, but there are plenty, because you're still in a nice position, and who knows what can happen?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, but I'm being totally honest.   I think my chances are very slim, the way I'm driving the ball.   I need to improve that department.  
   
 Q.   Is it good to see your name on the board?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's nice obviously.   It's nice to see your name on the leaderboard, but at the moment, I'm more concerned about other things.   
   
 Q.   How do you put that right?   Just have to work?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I've been working really hard with, no results.   I cannot figure out what to do to get more consistent with the driver.
