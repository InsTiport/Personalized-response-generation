  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   We are playing good golf, going to see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   Any special regrets since you lost your advantage, anything that could have worked out better from your point of view? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Not really.   I think both teams are playing good.   A lot of players are playing great.   We saw what happened on 18 when you lose two birdies, not much you can do.

Q.   Special credit to the team of the two rookies, four points in four matches. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, they did very well, I'm quite impressed with that performance.   They are both playing good.   Obviously Joost got here full of confidence and he's been playing good.   But GrÃ©gory was a little bit of a question mark and in front of his home crowds, he delivered.

Q.   Tomorrow you're going to play singles; how difficult will it be to get their minds ready for the regular format again? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I think they are ready.   They realized today that the Great Britain and Ireland team means business, and they have to be prepared for it tomorrow.
