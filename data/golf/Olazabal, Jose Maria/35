 Q.   Tricky week to concentrate on your own golf, I would imagine in.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I don't know what the problem is but obviously I missed too many shots ‑‑ and you know, you pay on a golf course like this.   
   
 Q.   And presumably, you had a look at the leaderboards and you see Nicolas Colsaerts's name up on there, so obviously we have to ask the captain's reaction to that; sorry, but you're the captain.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, three more days to go.   He has a lot of work to do. Obviously he's had a good, solid start, playing in the morning.   Well, we will have to see what he does the next couple of days, if he gives a chance to himself come Sunday.   
   
 Q.   But it is an impressive start for a player who knows what is at stake this week.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, similar to what happened last week with Sergio.   Actually, Nicolas Colsaerts did very well last week; he finished seventh over there, and he's had a good start.   And that is traveling late on Monday, so he didn't have much of a practice this week, and still managed to score well.   
You know, if he stays fit and mentally strong, he might win, we'll have to wait and see.   
   
 Q.   Padraig Harrington has fired a 64 in the first round in New York; so these guys want to play for you.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, they are making things a little more difficult come Monday obviously.   But as I said, there is three more days, a lot of things can happen in the next three days, and I'll keep an eye on everyone, obviously.   
   
 Q.   And it must be very heartening to hear that so many candidates are playing well at the moment.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's nice to see that.   I always said that what I want, truly, and really, is to have them really playing very well.   You know, the 28th, 29th and the 30th of September; that's what counts.   
   
 Q.   What constitutes extraordinary; you said Harrington has to do something extraordinary.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   At least a win.   (Laughter).  
   
 Q.   When did you last speak to Padraig?  
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I don't remember.   Obviously we just crossed words yesterday, said hello or something like that.   I remember telling him he had a good tournament just a couple of weeks after the U.S. Open when he finished fourth, I think, and it was‑‑ and that was‑‑ he said, well, it's nice that you are watching what I'm doing.   
   
 Q.   You said to Tim yesterday, you have about five people possible?   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, obviously there is two players, obviously there is two players that can change the classification, and that is David Lynn and Nicolas.  
   
 Q.   With Hanson pulling out‑‑  
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   But there were 34 points‑‑  
   
 Q.   It went to 32 because of Gonzalo pulling out and Hanson pulling out moved it to 30.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   I thought that more people than Peter had to withdraw to get the points that low.   I didn't know those two guys withdrew.   
Well, then obviously Nicolas is the one that can change things, and you have David and a couple more guys.   
   
 Q.   Did you speak to Martin about not playing here?   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   No.   I've always said that players are free to do whatever they want or whatever they think is best for them.   By instance, I didn't force Sergio to go and play with him.   It was his own decision.   You know, I'm not going to force players to do something that they don't want to do.   
   
 Q.   Would it possibly count against them?   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL:   No.   I've always made that clear.
