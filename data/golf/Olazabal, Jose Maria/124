Q. How many times did you use your driver?

JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: It depends a lot on the wind. With today's wind, almost every hole
except 5, 8, 10, 14, and that's it. I've played okay, but made some mistakes. At the 7th
hole, I hit a very bad second shot. It bounced in a right-hand side trap, and I went out
of bounds. Today on the greens, it's been a bit of everything. I've hit some good putts,
but I missed some other ones. I would not say that I was good on the greens today.
Generally, I was very solid, although I made some mistakes like the bad shot on the 7th
hole. But I think I've played just correct. I know I can do better. I have to improve.
This course, you need to be very straight off the tee, and you've got to be very accurate.
It's been a very good day - no wind, and very good temperature. I don't think we're going
to get a better day for golf. The golf course today was in very good conditions, as it
always is. And it's not that it was easy, but it was okay to play. I don't think the
weather is going to be as good as it was today. And if the wind starts blowing, this
course is going to change. Every year we've played the Volvo Masters, and the American
Express last year, we've always had very strong wind. I think the wind can be the key
factor on this course.
