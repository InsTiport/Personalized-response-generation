  Q.  When is your flight, it must be really quick?   
 JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  About 45 minutes.   
  
  Q.  The string of birdies, just how you got back into it?   
 JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Well, it was pretty much the same scenario as yesterday.  I had a good run at the middle of the round and that put me in a good position.  Obviously I knew pretty much I didn't have any chance to win because I thought those guys on the top were going to finish well under par.   
 But anyways, it was a great round and a great week.   
  
  Q.  Talk about Thursday and coming back and finishing where you are now.   
 JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  After seeing the way you can look at it, maybe that's a shame, but on the other thing, if I didn't shoot at 17 maybe I wouldn't finish fourth.  You never know how this game goes.   
 I'll take the week as a positive thing for me.  I needed a good week.  This was one of them.
