Q.   How big was that point? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was huge.   Those last two matches were massive.   That keeps us just, a chance.   It's been done before in the past.   And well, tomorrow is going to be a big day.

Q.   Are you a believer in momentum in this sport day‑to‑day? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Of course.   And I have to say that things have not gone our way, especially on the greens, and at one point in this match, I believe that momentum will come our way and why not tomorrow.
