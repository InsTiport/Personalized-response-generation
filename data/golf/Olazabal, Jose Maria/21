 Q.   Nice to see three Ryder Cup heros together, congratulations to all of you, would like to run through those closing moments because they were so exciting for the world of golf, starting with you, Martin, playing Steve Stricker what were you thinking when you stood on the 18th green with two putts to halve the match, as it were, and take the trophy home?  
MARTIN KAYMER:   At the end of the day, two putts would make it, but I really wanted to make the first putt.   I know it sounds a little strange but I think it was the right attitude; still play golf, don't just trickle down there and hope that it's somewhere close to the hole.   
I really wanted to make it, and obviously it went a little bit further than I wanted to.   But in the end of the day it was more dramatic and more emotional.  
   
 Q.   What were you thinking at the time?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   On the fairway, I was thinking‑‑  
   
 Q.   So you were not on the green?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, I was not on the green.   I was walking with Francesco off the tee, and I had my earplug on and somebody told me that Martin hit it like three feet past, all of a sudden I didn't want to see anything or hear anything about it.  
I was nervous, standing on the fairway, just walking around, just waiting for Martin to stand over the ball.   You know, when he did so, all I did was just close my ayes and listen to the sound.   
   
 Q.   Now, your emotion when the put went in was unusual for you, why was it so emotional?   
MARTIN KAYMER:   Well, I never really experienced that.   It was a completely different feeling the last three, four holes, or let's say the last five holes.   It was so nice.   It was great.   
It was fantastic to be in that position, so exciting and I never had that feeling when I played The Ryder Cup, I never really had that passion, and that day, is completely changed my‑‑ I wouldn't go as far to say my golf life, but definitely my Ryder Cup experience and my passion for The Ryder Cup.   If that doesn't change it, I don't know what should happen.   
   
 Q.   Now all this time, when you were waiting down the fairway and you're seeing these things, I'm you're not quite sure what's happening, what did you say down the fairway to Francesco?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I went to the edge of the bunker where Francesco was waiting for the green to clear and I looked at him and said, "Francesco, this is not over yet, if you still can get half a point out of this match, we still win the match," and secure tying the match or winning the match.   
   
 Q.   So what went through your mind?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   All sorts of stuff.   It was great.   First of all, I saw Stricker holing the putt and I thought, this is not good for us, because I didn't know if we still had to putt or not.   Then I saw him putting the ball down, so I thought, there's a chance.   And then obviously I saw him making the putt and it was, you know, a huge joy and relief.   
MARTIN KAYMER:   He smiled a lot on the fairway.   Big smile.   Never saw that before.  
   
 Q.   And the instructions, what did that make you think?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I just tried to listen to the captain and I waited for them to finish the celebration and just went through my routine, tried to hit a good bunker shot, which came out quite nicely, and, you know, it was very good for me, and I think for the whole team to get the half point in the end.  
   
 Q.   Just going back, Tiger chipped up, now how far was his putt that he missed?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Well, there's different versions of that.   It's sometimes hard to remember but evidently it wasn't close enough to be considered in my opinion.   My putt was probably three feet and a half, four feet, and his putt was five feet.   
So you know, I never really thought about conceding since my marker was still there.   So I didn't know that my putt was going to be conceded.  
   
 Q.   So what made you think‑‑ you can call chip‑in on this, why did Tiger give you the putt?   Any ideas?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, my point of view on that is that I looked at his face when Martin holed the putt on 18, we were just not far to each other, and the whole desire I think went; he was deflated because he knew The Ryder Cup, it didn't matter if he won his match or lose his match or tie his match; the Cup was coming with us, and I think that was enough for him just to say, listen, I mean, for me, the trophy is not going to be in the United States, so it doesn't matter if we tie or lose.
