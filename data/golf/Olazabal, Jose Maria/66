 Q.  Many of the players have said that putting has been the hardest with the wind.  Do you agree with that? 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Most of the time we have a lot of shots with the wind from the sides, left-to-right and right-to-left, and that didn't make it easy.  But obviously on the greens when the wind was really blowing hard, it made it really difficult. 

 Q.  What about 18? 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Well, 18, you know, we've seen that before, I mean, previous years, we know how tough that whole place -- especially with this type of wind from the left and into you.  The tee shot is really narrow and then the second shot on to the green, the green is tiny-small where you're hitting like three to four irons on that green, and it's one of the toughest holes we play all year long. 

 Q.  With Augusta coming up, do you feel your game is starting to come around? 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  I've been struggling with my game.  I've been working really hard but I missed too many shots on the golf course. 
 Today was a good day but I need to improve or at least cut down the missed shots on the golf course.
