 Q.  Conditions of the course. 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  The golf course is tough.  Greens are firm, fast.  It's going to be tough. 
 The wind died down a little bit, but it's still slick. 

 Q.  Regarding Seve. 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  It's nice to see Seve play.  Hopefully he can play good enough so he can enjoy the game again. 
 The firmer the greens are the more difficult it is.
