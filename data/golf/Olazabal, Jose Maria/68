  Q.  You went to extra holes?   
 JOSE MARIÀ OLAZÁBAL:  Yes, I had a good start, and then I made a couple of errors on 5 and 6.  And then he started to play better and made a few putts, and I was down in the match.  Squared the match on the par 3, ball on 14, and then we go to 16.   
 I hit a lovely shot and he made about, I don't know, a 25-footer, and I had a six-footer and I missed that one, and I think that was a real blow.  It was crucial to make that putt I had on 17 because, you know, it was only one more hole to go and I was 1-down, and the prospects were not very good.   
  
  Q.  How long was that putt on 17?   
 JOSE MARIÀ OLAZÁBAL:  About 12 feet, yeah.   
  
  Q.  And then into extra holes?   
 JOSE MARIÀ OLAZÁBAL:  Yeah, well, I hit a good tee shot on the first extra hole and then I gave myself a nice yardage for my third.  I hit a lovely third shot about, again, five, six feet, and I made a putt.   
  
  Q.  So looking forward to next round now?   
 JOSE MARIÀ OLAZÁBAL:  Yeah, obviously.  I mean, every step forward is important this week.  Well, let's see if I can play a little better than today and make a few more putts.  That's very much needed.   
  
  Q.  But nice to get a first-round win under your belt?   
 JOSE MARIÀ OLAZÁBAL:  Yes.
