  SAM TORRANCE: Just incredible, what a team, what a captain.  He's been exceptional, Paul, he really has been exceptional, never left a stone unturned.  He's had a plan for two years and he's built on that plan and it's come to fruition.   Q.  Vice captain or captain, still just as exciting?  SAM TORRANCE: Absolutely.  I've had an unbelievable week.  Great to be back involved and it's been awesome.   JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: It's fantastic.  It's fantastic to experience all of this once again.  It's a wonderful week.  We knew it was going to be tough and the boys played extraordinary well this week, especially the foursomes sessions were key I think.   Q.  Would you rather win like this or like last time the two years ago?  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: Well, if you have to write a movie script like we did it two years ago.  But for your heart and for a lot of people's heart, we'd rather do it this way.   Q.  What kind of captain has McGinley been?  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL: I told you, everybody asked me that question when he was named captain of The Ryder Cup, and I knew he was going to do a wonderful job.  He's a great man and he has the respect of the players.  He has everything down to the smallest detail and that's the way he was.  He thought about everything and he was spot on.
