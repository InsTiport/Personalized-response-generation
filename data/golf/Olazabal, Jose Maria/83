JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:   It's a pity that I left two or three shots out there, which could have given me some hopes for tomorrow.  But it's been another solid day, and I feel very comfortable.  I holed some good putts on the first nine, but the back nine, they did not go in, and that didn't help the score.

It's not that I am playing better at the end of the season.  You prepare yourself for every week.  Sometimes you play very well at the beginning, sometimes in the middle of the season, and others towards the end.

Today was a perfect day for golf:  No wind, everything was calm, but that made it difficult for the ones up there to make mistakes.  Monty is not the only one up there.  Sergio loves this golf course.   He played very well last year.  This golf course suits Monty.  He hits very straight off the tee, and that's what you need to do here.  He's a very complete player from tee to green, he's in such good form.

But Sergio has great quality.  He nearly won last year, and it's been a matter of one or two more putts here and there, and he would have won many more tournaments.  I think he has all of the chances.

On the 11th, I missed the tee shot to the left in the rough, and the ball was in a very bad positions.  I didn't have any options.  I would like to congratulate the greenskeepers, they are doing a great job.  The greens are fantastic, without spikemarks.
