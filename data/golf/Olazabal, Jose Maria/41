Q.   Talk us through that day, how was that?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was a tough day out there, especially early in the round.   It was raining and windy and the golf course is playing really long.   I didn't hit the ball well off the tee, and I struggled a bit and played better on the back nine.   I had a couple of good breaks, but that evened out with the bad break I had on 17.     But overall, obviously okay. 

Q.   Essentially, that is a very nice score in these conditions, isn't it. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It's tough.   You can see the scoring today was not as good as the previous two days.   The course was playing much more difficult today; longer, and that wind really affected the ball today.   It was blowing harder than it did the last couple of days.

Q.   Give me an indication of the change in clubs on some of the harder holes. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was tough.   Depending on the lie, obviously we are playing a links‑type course and sometimes you caught lies that were uphill into the wind and sometimes you have to hit like three or four clubs more than the distance.   When it was downwind, a couple clubs less; so it was certainly affecting quite a bit. 

Q.   Playing more like a links course? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, except for the rain.   We didn't expect this kind of rain in this part of the world this time of the year.

Q.   Proud of yourself for hanging in there and giving yourself a chance? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I'm proud that I managed to fight today and put a decent score.   I need to, as I said the previous days, somehow I struggle to bring what I do on the driving range on to the golf course and that's what I need to do, especially off the tee. 

Q.   Do you think about victory?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, not at all. 

Q.   And anything would be a victory given what you've been through. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, up to now, these three days have been positive.   In itself, it's been very good up to now.   Hopefully I will be able to put up a decent score tomorrow and leave this tournament happy with the job I had done.
