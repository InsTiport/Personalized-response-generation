JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  It was good. The putting was very, very good and that made the score, to be honest. The rest of the game is still a little bit off. I missed a few tee shots and I think the putter was good today.
Q.  So a 67 playing like that was good?
JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL: Correct. At the end of the day that's what counts but I would like to me more consistent.
Q.  Two big weeks here and we all know what coming in September. Still trying to find your game?
JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Yes, I have been working hard the last few weeks. The U.S. Open was much the same and I also struggled at the French Open but managed to decent round on Sunday and that turned things around a bit for the week, but still fighting on the course.
Q.  Any part of the game not right?
JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  It's just a little bit off, like, not big things. A little bit left, a little bit right and I am not giving myself enough birdie chances and am having to make putts for par most of the time.
Q.  What did you hole?
JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  I made some crucial putts and some up and downs. I bogeyed 18 after a tee shot in the water so that was a wonderful five. Before that I made a lovely save on 11 from the left hand side.

Actually I didn't make that many but a birdie from three feet on 13, a great save on 16 from about 18 feet, then on one and two much the same distance. A good save on four and a 12-footer on five and another 10-footer on six and then up and down at seven and nine from tough positions and a 15-footer on seven. That was the key obviously. I need to improve my game from tee to green, After I hit the shot I know what the problems is! It's before hitting it that I need to sort out. Sometimes I come over the top. It's just a lack of coordination to be honest.
