Q.   Battling on the back nine, how would you describe it? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was a real battle on the back nine.   Everything went pretty smooth on the front nine.   I drove the ball well but then on the back nine I started missing fairways, and I have to battle my way in. 
It was one of those days.   You know, that's the problem at the moment.   I'm driving the ball poorly and it shows.

Q.   It's 27 years since you've played your first Irish Open; what makes this special, because it is special, isn't it? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It is special.   It's a big event.   The crowds are always huge and very nice to us, and through all these years, I have to say that the Irish people have treated us very, very well with open arms, and we really appreciate that. 

Q.   Sorry to mention this, but you're 47 one of our commentators suggested that you are just keeping your game nice and sharp for The Seniors Tour and the other commentator said, no, not at all he's trying to beat these young boys and he still believes he can.   Clear it up for us. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, to the first one, I'm going to kick his rear, and to the second one, he's right (laughter). 

Q.   Your thoughts on 4‑under par around here? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's been a mixed round, I have to say.   The front nine were pretty good.   I drove the ball well.   I hit the ball well.   It was a smooth front nine but then on the back nine, I started missing fairways, hitting to bad places and I had to battle my way in.   And that was the round today. 

Q.   Despite the fact that we thought there might be some Spanish sunshine, you've had to battle elements? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, actually, the last two days were beautiful.   We had sunshine.   We were playing in tee shirts and all of a sudden, boom, yeah, it was one of those days.   But actually we were quite lucky.   It didn't rain all that much in the afternoon.   It's true that it rained for awhile, but just before we teed off, we had the heaviest of the rain. 

Q.   Clearly not the first time we've seen you shoot a lovely low score like this to get involved in competition, so happy enough about the state of game?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, not happy about the state of my game.   I think the driver is not sharp at all.   It's actually pretty poor, and that's what I have to work on.   The rest of the game, you know, I have my good days, my bad days, but the rest of the game is quite decent.   It's the driver that's costing me clearly.

Q.   I gather Carton House is a bit more drivable in terms of driving these days than seven years ago?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, seven years ago, I remember that we had really bad weather and the rough was very severe, and the rough actually got up to the bunkers.   So there was no way you could escape, and this year, they have allowed a little bit of room between the edges of the bunkers and the high rough, and, well, that's allowing the scoring to be better.
