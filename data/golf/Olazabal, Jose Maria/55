 Q. The first round, happy with that?
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: Yeah, I'm really happy with the scoring. Obviously it was a little tricky out there with the wind. I'm actually getting the ball in play.

 Q. Last Tuesday at Augusta National Champions dinner you read a letter to the other Champions written by your good friend Steve Ballesteros to read. Can you share what that letter was about and what the reaction was to it?
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: The letter showed a lot of respect for every member that was at that dinner and a lot of respect for the golf course and the club and the members. It showed us how much he missed not being there. I think that was very clear from that letter and that was it pretty much. 

 Q. Welcome back and congratulations on a very nice round. This is the kind of golf course you have to maneuver the ball around and that's your game. 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: You have to hit it straight off the tee. There's a lot of fairways and very small greens. If you're not going to strike the ball well, you're not going to score. I managed to do that well today. I kept the ball in play and made a couple of putts and that was it.

 Q. Are you able to take a big sigh of relief and decompress down here after such an emotional week the last week at Augusta?
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: Not so much for me. It was a big emotional week last week for various reasons, but I haven't been able to play for the last year, more than a year, and I need to do the best I can and that's what I'm going to try to do this week.

 Q. Are you a hundred percent? Are you as close to being as healthy as you've been in a long time?
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: Yeah, I've been as healthy as I can remember for the last few weeks. It's been good. 
 I haven't had something like that for a long time, so I'm going to try to make the best use of it.
