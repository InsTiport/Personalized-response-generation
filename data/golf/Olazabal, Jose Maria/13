Q.   How is the course playing? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Conditions were very difficult today.   The wind was hard and then we had a huge shower on two or three holes. 
Well, I have to say that the front nine I played really well and then I started making the same mistakes I had been doing the previous days.   I missed a driver on 11 and then 16 and 18, so that cost me. 

Q.   Is it a comfort to you that you can still be competitive with these young professionals at this stage of your career?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, the thing is that the course allowed that this week, because the rough was not all that severe.   I know that my iron play and my short game is good enough.   It's just a matter of getting that driver working, and you know, if I can do that, I believe that I can still compete. 

Q.   And you're feeling healthy, the bones are good? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, a few aches here and there but that goes with age I guess.   Overall, pretty happy. 

Q.   Tell me where the balance is between satisfaction and frustration this week? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I would say mixed, 50/50.   I managed to score well and finish up there this week but frustrated with the way drove the ball this week.

Q.   4‑under through those opening holes, that was terrific. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, I played pretty good golf those ten holes, and then I made three bad drives and a short putt on 12 that cost me dearly but overall, I guess I should be happy. 
At one stage, actually, when I was 9 and 10, I thought I managed to make a couple more birdies and make no mistakes.   But it was nice to be in that position. 

Q.   You felt things were holding together nicely?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it was okay.   I was comfortable with the situation.   It's just that the game is not sharp enough.

Q.   So from here we move onto some other important events and you know that the game is getting there? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   We'll see.   The driver, I do need to improve that club seriously.   The rest of them, I can manage.
