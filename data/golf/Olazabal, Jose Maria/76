Q.  What's your reaction in the end?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Well, the score was the best part.  When I came here this week, I said in the media center that the game is a little bit off, after five weeks and it showed today.  I missed quite a few shots and the only thing is I made four great saves and that saved the round.  But I haven't    I didn't strike the ball well.
Q.  You had to battle?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  Correct, I missed a lot of shots, like 14 and then 15 then 17 and 18.  That's the way it is, so all I can do is try the best that I can and see if I can hold on there.
Q.  Nonetheless, at the end of the day, it's not a bad score on the day.
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  No, that's what I said, the best part of the day is the score.  Obviously the score is excellent.  The guy leading is 5 under, I'm 3 under par, I cannot complain about that, that's for sure.
Q.  Can I ask you about the changes to the course and how you view them?
JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL:  I think the changes are really good.  I think they are fair, the other thing is that we're playing the golf course really wet, and it's a shame, because this golf course, it's meant to play a little bit drier and that would make it even if you ever tougher.

So I think the next few years, if we manage to get good weather, we'll see the effect of the changes.  But I think the changes have been better for the course.  I think it's a much better challenge now than it was before.  And that's a credit to Ernie.
