Q.   An excellent round of 69 but still possibly a weekend off; a possibility you'll be watching the contenders and seeing what they are doing? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I think you are being highly optimistic.   No, there's no chance I'm going to make the weekend obviously.   It was a better round today, even though I didn't hit the ball all that well.   But it was a better round, and I'll be here at the weekend obviously.   I'm going to be here on Monday, noon.   So if the weather helps, I'll try to practise a bit at the weekend and see if I can get something going. 

Q.   A lot has been made of your comment yesterday that PÃ¡draig needs at least a win to get into your consideration.   Why with all of his experience and Ryder Cup credentials is he not closer to the equation already?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, he's as close as some other players; not closer than other players.   You know, simple as that.   If you look at the list, he's well back there, isn't he.   So I said he needed a win or to finish in the top three last week to make the team.
I don't think what it's all about‑‑ he's an experienced player, obviously, but at the moment he's not been able to deliver, period, simple as that.

Q.   One or two of the articles suggest that your problem with him goes back to the 2003 Seve Trophy where you had a dispute; would you like to comment on that? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, of course.   If people believes that that is interfering with my judgment, first of all, they are completely wrong.   If that was the case, I would be failing as a captain.   So that is a lot of B.S., that's putting it gently. 

Q.   Looks like a weekend off for you but not a particularly restful one?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I'm going to keep an aye on a few things, a few players obviously.   Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what happens at the weekend. 

Q.   And it's not just here, but in the United States, as well. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, obviously, yeah.   I will keep an aye on any players that plays well and that's what I want to try to do. 

Q.   Quite a bit has been made of your comment yesterday that PÃ¡draig Harrington needs at least a win to have a chance on making the team.   Would you elaborate on that?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   The thing is that PÃ¡draig, unfortunately, you know, he's well back.   Obviously he needs to do extraordinary well; a win is a win, but we have to look at other things, also.   Simple as that. 

Q.   People are going all the way back to that Seve Trophy match and saying that the falling out then might be colouring your judgment.   What do you say to that? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, that is a lot of B.S., and if that was the case, I would be failing as a captain.   There is not a single bit of truth in that.   I'm just looking at Players, what they have done, how they have played and I'm going to try to get the best players for that team; whoever they might be, that's who it's going to be. 

Q.   If PÃ¡draig were to build on an opening round of 64 and win, that would be pretty hard to ignore, wouldn't it?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, but well at the same time, you can't just play by one tournament, can you. 

Q.   But it is the last opportunity before the team is picked?
