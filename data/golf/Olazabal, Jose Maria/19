  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I hit the ball better today.   Even though I hit three poor shots, apart from those, the rest of the game was pretty solid.   I would say that I played a good, solid 14, 15 holes, and that's a good sign.   Obviously I have to consolidate this the next few days, but it's nice to have some signs like this one. 

Q.   And Jimenez, your playing partner today?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   He was inspirational because he played maybe just the opposite to me.   He played really solid all day long.   He just made a couple of silly mistakes on the last two holes that cost me a bogey on each hole but apart from that he played really well.   It was nice to have him in the group.

Q.   Do you look back at all on your victory here, it's not all that long ago. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's a few years ago, but no, I don't look back.
