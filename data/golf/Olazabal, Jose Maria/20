 Q.   Feeling inspired by Medinah?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   You might say it was.   It was a special event, and it was a lovely round.   I played solidly.   On the back nine, I missed a couple of tee shots, but I managed to save par on those two holes and that was key, and the rest of the game was good.   
   
 Q.   It's been a long course but you were bogey‑free out there today.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, yeah, but I think they moved the tees quite a bit forward.   Some of the holes, obviously if you were playing all the way from the back tees, it would be a monster course.   And we will see what they do the next few days.   But you know, those tees, especially on the par3s, and some par 4s, were moved forward a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Obviously Ryder Cup dominated your thoughts, what's it been like being with all the players?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it was great to see them.   We had a picture taken the other day all together again except Sergio that is the only one missing.   But the rest, it was nice to see them.   We crossed a few words, and it was nice to get that feeling back.   
   
 Q.   Making an early bid for the 2014 team?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Oh, no chance, no chance (laughing).     
   
 Q.   So the winning captain trying to show the boys how to play the game today?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, they showed me how to play the game, so hopefully I got some tips from them.   
   
 Q.   So during this week, before the round and during the practise round, any of your players ask you how to play this course?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, this is a long course.   It's true they moved the tees forward a little bit and made it a little bit easier.   But you know, it's a course that you have to play good.   The greens are soft and that helps a bit obviously.   
But it's a course that, you know, you have to be on your game in order to score.   It was a good day for me today and I'm very pleased about it.   
   
 Q.   Bogey‑free, 5‑under, and just a good touch on the greens?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, the driver was maybe the weakest link today.   But the rest of the game was good.   My iron play was very good today.   I miss‑read a few shots with my irons and I gave myself quite a few birdie chances and I made some of them, and that's why I managed to score well.   
   
 Q.   Well, after watching your players, you were there, you were so excited a couple weeks ago in Medinah; does it get you even more motivated to play the game yourself?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, yeah, it gives you a push to be honest.   You know, it's nice to see the boys play the way they did.   But to be in that kind of atmosphere, that's what we really work for.   And in a way, you know, it pushes you a little bit harder to work a little bit and to give yourself a better chance.   
   
 Q.   So all the players over here at the hotel, they will ask you to pick up the Tab every night?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   (Laughs) maybe, we will see.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on shooting a round like this to start?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's great to shoot a low round.   As I said, I think that the driver was the weakest link, even though it was correct today.   The rest of the game was pretty sharp.   I have to say that I hit a lot of good iron shots into the greens today.   I gave myself quite a few birdie chances and made some of them.   You know, that's why I managed to score well.   
   
 Q.   And it is the first time in a little while to see your name right at the top of a board?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it's been a while.   My game has been off.   Again tomorrow and the next few day, if I want to score well, I will need to hit the driver a little better than I did today, but I find myself improving with the rest of the game, especially the irons.   
As I said, I hit them well today and hopefully I will be able to do that the next few days.   But you know, at the end of the day, it's how good you hit your driver and how many putts you make.   So those are the two clubs that are key.  
   
 Q.   Is there a freedom now that Ryder Cup is behind you?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   In a way, yes.   Obviously it's been a tough year and a half, a lot of things going in your mind, decisions to make, meetings to attend.   I'm really glad that it's over.   
   
 Q.   And yet it's not, because almost all your team is here.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, but the pressure of organizing things and making decisions is off.   So now it's fun time.   
   
 Q.   And presumably that is fun, as every player has said, it's great to get back and reminisce?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it was nice to see the boys get a picture here out in the week.   We crossed a few words at the clubhouse, at the hotel, remembering or recollecting some of those moments.   It's been a lot of fun, yes.  
   
 Q.   Is there a certain sense of inspiration you can get from Medinah for yourself personally?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, we worked hard and practised hard to find yourself in that kind of a situation, that kind of atmosphere.   And obviously, you know, it gives you a push in the sense that obviously you would love to be in that situation.   You know what you have to do in order to get there, because the level is so high, you have to play obviously great golf.   
But it's nice to see that, and sometimes you feed from that, too.   
   
 Q.   And seeing Davis Love do well in his comeback event, if you like.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, he's always been a great player and he's always been a great striker of the ball, long, and you know, it doesn't surprise me at all.
