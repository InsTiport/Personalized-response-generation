 Q.   Your reaction to how you've played across the whole week?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Decent.   The only weak part was off the tee with my driver.   As I said all week long, the same scenario today.   Rest of the game has been pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Asked but whether you were proud of your performance yesterday, are you all the more so knowing that you hung in there throughout the final round?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, I'm really happy and proud of myself this week, even though it was a short field, top players, players that are playing well, and I managed to keep up there.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel the competitive spirit was totally back?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   A little bit, yeah.   Certain moments in the round it looked a little bit like the old days.  
   
 Q.   You got off to a flyer, two birdies to start?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   That's when you feel like the old days.   
   
 Q.   But, there must be added satisfaction that even though things did slip a little bit there after, you still had a chance on the home stretch?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yes, if I had managed to hit better tee shots, I would have had a few more chances.   As I said, overall, a good week.  
   
 Q.   A sign of things to come?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Hopefully.   So we'll have to wait and see.  
   
 Q.   What is the plan?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Next week with the media with The Ryder Cup; I don't know if I'm going to be able to play the tournament or not.   If I can, wonderful.   And if not, I'll take the rest of the week off and see the boys play and then play Qatar and Dubai.   
   
 Q.   Do you have to manage yourself not to overdo things?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   The body will be the one to judge that, depending on how the body feels, I will be able to play more, or not.
