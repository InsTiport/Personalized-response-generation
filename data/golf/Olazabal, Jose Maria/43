Q.   Nice to see you play so well, first tournament of the year.   Can you tell me a little about your round.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It was a steady round.   It was a little bit, how can I say it, there was not many great things going on but it was just steady.   I missed a couple of tee shots.   But apart from that, the rest of the game was pretty good. 

Q.   A lot of the guys are saying the course is quite tough with the wind picking up. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it didn't blow that hard today to be honest.   Earlier in the round, it was pretty calm and then it started to pick up middle of the round on the back nine for us.   But it was not all that strong. 
On the other hand, the golf course, you have to play good.   It's a demanding course.   The greens are water protected and you have a lot of pot bunkers on the fairway that you have to avoid, and on top of that, obviously, if you miss‑hit it, you end up in terrible places.   So you really have to keep the ball in play.

Q.   Are you feeling really fit now? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I have a blister on my right foot, but apart from that, I'm okay.   (Laughing). 
We come from winter, you know, that's the problem, maybe with the change of temperature and all that, because the last couple of days have been extremely hot. 

Q.   Did you practice a lot over the winter in Spain? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Not a lot.   Just a bit, yeah.
