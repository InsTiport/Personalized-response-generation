  Q.  What are your thoughts on the round?   
 JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Well, it was a struggle today to be honest.  My game is a little bit off, especially on the tee.  That puts me in a lot of trouble.  I managed to shoot under par today, but that was thanks to great chipping and pretty good putting.  You know, if you want to really have a realistic chance, I need to hit the ball better.   
  
  Q.  Simple as that?   
 JOSÉ MARIA OLAZÁBAL:  Simple as that.  These guys won't make mistakes.
