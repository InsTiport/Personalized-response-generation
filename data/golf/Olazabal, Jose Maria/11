 Q.   Positive result for your team today.   What pleased you most about what you saw?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, the way the youngsters played I think, and Joost, I think he played extraordinary well today.   He made a bunch of birdies.   ThorbjÃ¸rn played also very well.   Happy for those two guys.   I think it was a great experience for them.   But the main thing is to win points, and that's what we did.   I think the team is really happy today.   
   
 Q.   How is it emotionally for you out there captaining?   I know you'd love to be playing.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I've been in this position now a couple of times, so I'm getting used to it, but rather be the one playing.   You know, it's the nature of life.   It's my role this week to be captain of the Continental side.   You know, sometimes it's tough when you see the boys struggling a bit.   I think that's the toughest part of it.   
   
 Q.   What can you do to help when they are struggling?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, just try to give them a little bit of encouragement, try to calm them down‑‑ there's more holes to be played; there's always a bright side.  
   
 Q.   How do you decide on today's play what you do tomorrow?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, we haven't decided yet.   We still have one hour since the last match finished before we give the pairings, and everyone is in the team room there, so I will go back and talk to them and see what we decide.
