  JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No.1 I missed my second shot left‑‑ well, I missed my tee shot right and my second shot left, and where I was, I aimed just for the middle of the green and I knew I was going to give myself a 45‑footer, but you have to take the medicine and go to the next.   For instance, on No.5, where that pin position was today, you know you can't attack that flag, so you have to go back of it, just play for the middle of the green, take the 4 and go to the next. 
There's a bunch of holes where you have to do that out here.   You have to be patient, you have to know where to hit it, and that's it. 

Q.   When it's difficult do you smile a little bit knowing how many rounds you have around here and things you're going to know that some of these younger guys won't? 
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, you know, I smile here because this place has given me a lot of happiness, and every time I put a foot on this golf course I can't complain. 

Q.   Will you talk about 15 yesterday and today, the club selection difference?
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, yesterday you could go for the green, and today it was straight into the wind.   Actually T.J. went for it.   He went for it in two, and actually he hit it over the green.   But with that pin position on the left, I don't know‑‑ I don't know if it's worth it going for the green in two with that pin position today.

Q.   Where do you lay up on the hole here?
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It depends how you feel more comfortable with.   You know that if you open yourself on the right‑hand side of the fairway you have more green to work with, but if you go down the left, actually you are facing the green straight into you, which is maybe even better.

Q.   Do you prefer that? 
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's easier to stop it. 

Q.   There's a couple guys, I think, they said there were 10 eagles there and today there were probably more double bogeys than eagles. 
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, I remember a similar situation, where was it, it was years ago, we had 9s and 7s and all kind of numbers on that hole with that pin position.   Players that obviously you couldn't go for it in two were laying up, were hitting their third shots, and there were people chipping from the back of the green, and the greens were so fast and hard that were hitting into the water.   Simple as that.
