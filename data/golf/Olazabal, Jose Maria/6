Q.   Continental Europe just won the foursomes series for the first time in history, how does that feel? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it feels good.   We knew it was an important day today.   Still another session to be played in the afternoon, another session of foursomes. 

Q.   What do you think gave you the edge?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   It's hard to say to be honest.   I think both teams have been pretty level.   We saw that in the first match.   We saw that on the last match.   It's just tiny little things.   It's hard to say.   I cannot pinpoint why we managed to win this morning. 

Q.   Luiten and Bourdy, three wins, what did you see that that would work? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, they are good players.   Joost is playing well of late.   Gregory, I know Gregory, he's a solid player.   Sometimes, you know, he lacks a little bit of self‑belief, but I think playing with Joost he sees that good companion beside him and they managed to do well.   Let's see if he can do that in the afternoon. 

Q.   An insight into your foursomes pairings this afternoon? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, the only change is I'm resting Frankie and ThorbjÃ¸rn and I'm putting Thomas and Mike could he, they rested from the morning, so they should be fresh and ready to go.   They understand each other really well and they speak the same language. 
Mikko is a long hitter, and I think we have seen this the last three days.   This golf course, the par 5s, they are all odd numbers, and I felt that little bit of extra length might come handy in the afternoon.

Q.   49‑year‑old Miguel is out there playing five matches, he said you bullied him into it. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   He's playing so well.   I would love to rest him but the way he's playing, but we need strong pairings this afternoon for the foursomes.
