JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL: It's a great feeling, especially because the main reason is I managed to win the event, and I have been able to come back most of the years except for those years that I was ill. Well, I think it's great. I mean, it's great to be here. When you look at the scenery from this sport, you know, I talked to my caddie today on the 2nd hole how special this place is, and it's always great to come back.


JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL: I feel good about it. I try to pass the knowledge I learned from other players, especially from Seve, especially around the greens. Well, it's always, in a way, fulfilling. I mean, to see young kids like Jon approaching and asking for advice, that is great.
