 Q. You've been here 30 times.   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL: It's a great feeling, especially because the main reason is I managed to win the event, and I have been able to come back most of the years except for those years that I was ill. Well, I think it's great. I mean, it's great to be here. When you look at the scenery from this sport, you know, I talked to my caddie today on the 2nd hole how special this place is, and it's always great to come back.  
  
 Q. It seems like every year you come here you're a reference for a lot of players. They come to you and ask for advice on chipping, on putting, on everything. How do you feel about that?   
JOSÃ MARÃA OLAZÃBAL: I feel good about it. I try to pass the knowledge I learned from other players, especially from Seve, especially around the greens. Well, it's always, in a way, fulfilling. I mean, to see young kids like Jon approaching and asking for advice, that is great.
