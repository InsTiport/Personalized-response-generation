  SCOTT CROCKETT:   Thanks for coming in and joining us, a great effort today.   Give us your thoughts on the day and a good position in the tournament.
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I had a couple of bogeys on the front nine but I managed to get under par and then I played pretty steady on the back nine.   Didn't miss many shots and whenever I had a birdie opportunity, I converted it.   So obviously very pleased with the scoring.   Just trying to get ready for tomorrow. 
I think today was a little better than the last two days.   The last two days were really hot and humid. 
Today the wind blew a bit more than yesterday I think, but still the conditions were really benign.   The golf course is set up in a way that if you hit good shots, you get rewarded.   So I think that's why you see guys under par.   It's a good test, the golf course and just pleased to be here. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Your big days are coming up over the weekend and for your amateur partner today was his big day.   How did you cope with it and how did you cope with it? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   He seemed a little nervous the first few holes, trying really hard but I think after a few holes‑‑ he did okay. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Unusual format playing with the amateur.
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, especially for the Amateur.   We are used to playing Pro‑Ams and we have a couple of tournaments around the world that we play with an amateur, but I think that with them, it must have been a nice experience but a tough one. 

Q.   Inaudible. 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I think the last couple of years I've played pretty poorly, so improving that, it was not all that difficult.   I drove the ball well.   I hit lovely shots in the fairway but for whatever reason‑‑ taking it on to the golf course.   But at least I'm swinging sometimes on the driving range, and hopefully I will be able to bring that back on to the golf course and that would make things a little bit easier. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, not just for my pride.   Obviously, you know, it would be nice.   But on top of that, I would love to be‑‑ that would give me the chance to play sometimes with the boys when they are playing and chat with them. 

Q.   You obviously enjoy playing with Miguel Ãngel JimÃ©nez; if he qualifies for The Ryder Cup, what kind of part will he play, perhaps more than most?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I don't want to talk too much about The Ryder Cup.   We are having a conference next week about the Ryder Cup. 
You know, Miguel, as you know, is a good friend of mine.   We go back many, many years.   I would love to see him play.   I know he's working really hard, not just on the golf course, but off the golf course.   He's pushing hard to get stronger.   We'll see what happens. 

Q.   If you want‑‑ if you are interested in playing The Ryder Cup, so we might as well ask it now?
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I made that point very clear last year in December.   There is no way.   Even if I make The Ryder Cup, I will not play.   I've answered that question. 

Q.   Your thoughts on Fancourt as a golf course?   Imagine it's the first time you've been here.   How does it compare to other courses? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   First of all, I have to say that the practise facilities are fantastic.   The place is really beautiful.   As I said before, everything that has been said about the course is great.   In fact, we are using a bunch of the forward tees. 
I can't imagine how tough this golf course would be playing if we were using the back tees.   It's a fantastic test, and as I said before, if you play good shots, you get rewarded and if you miss them, it's tough.   I think that's fair. 
Well, if you ask me, I would recommend coming back here. 

Q.   You and Miguel had a fantastic moment on the 17th tee there for a minute; I assume you were hitting wedge? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, actually I hit a little 8 and Miguel hit a little 9.   We belong to the old age group.   These young kids who use pitching wedge and sand wedge on that hole‑‑ unfortunately we cannot get that speed through the ball. 
Yeah, it looked very good all the way and when I saw it bouncing, it looked really good. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   No, we try and well it had a good chance and just try.   Just lipped out. 
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Well done today.
