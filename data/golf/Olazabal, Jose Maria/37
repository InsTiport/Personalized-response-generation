 Q.   Disappointing end but thoughts overall?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, as you said, disappointing finish.   I had it going for a while.   I got it to 7‑under, and then I hit a few bad shots coming in that cost me two shots.   Just a shame.   
   
 Q.   How does the game feel?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, the game is inconsistent, let's put it that way.   I can hit good shots, but I missed too many shots and that's what I have to get rid of.   
   
 Q.   Are there more good bits than bad bits?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Good question.   To my liking?   
   
 Q.   Yes.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Too many bad.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   All bad.  
   
 Q.   But how good are the good?  
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   The bits are good.
