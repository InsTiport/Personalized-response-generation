 Q.   You began the afternoon session 8‑4 down; what does your team need to do this afternoon to get back into it?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Win this session.   That's all we need.   Nothing more, nothing less.   
Obviously we are four points behind and this session is crucial for us.   We need to do well.  
   
 Q.   What do you think the difference has been so far?   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well you can see the difference mainly around the greens.   Our boys are not making the putts.   And it's true that, you know, some of them haven't performed to their expectations.
