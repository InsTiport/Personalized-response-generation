 Q. How are you?
 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: I'm okay, a lot better than yesterday. Better than yesterday,
anyway. Yesterday I couldn't move at all. Today, I woke up, I walked a little bit. It's
better. It's not good, but it's better. Hopefully the situation will be improving so I
could play on Thursday morning. 
 
Q. Is this associated in any way with the problem you had with your feet?
 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: No, this is just -- I was hitting balls on Sunday morning, just
before teeing off, and I felt a sharp pain when hitting my first 3-wood on the driving
range and just couldn't move. It's just a soft-tissue problem, anyway. It's nothing to do
with the joints. 
 
Q. Jose, we heard that it was your first 3-wood after you had hit 60, 1-irons; why did
you hit 60, 1-irons?
 
 JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL: I didn't hit 60, 1-irons, I hit 60 balls up to that point. I
started with a sand wedge, I went up with the odd irons, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, and after that I
had changed to a 3-wood. With the 1-iron I would have hit around 10 balls; 10, 15 balls,
something like that.
