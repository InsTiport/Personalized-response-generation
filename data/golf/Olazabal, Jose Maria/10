  JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   We put some points on the board, and, you know, it was good.   It was a positive day. 

Q.   Accepting that the pairings worked very nicely together, you haven't changed things around? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Not really.   I like what I saw.   I think the players were comfortable playing with each other.   Most of them played really well.   You know, as they say, if it's not broken, don't fix it.   So the only thing I did was just change the order of play as to mix it a bit, but the pairings are staying the same for tomorrow. 

Q.   Purely just to mix it, to make it different? 
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, there's no particular reason for it to be honest.   As I said, I mean, they all played good today.   They realize that the matches are going to be close, so that's what we saw today except one match, the rest of the matches went to 17 or 18.   So there you go.   We said it early in the week, that the level of the game these days is very high, it's close, and it proved that today.
