  JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I mean, this one is for the whole of Europe, period.

Q.   You told me this morning that you felt Seve in the team room last night.   You felt that he could propel you guys to a victory today.   How was his presence felt this afternoon? 
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, Seve will always be present.   Seve will always be present with this team.   He was a big factor for this event, for the European side, and last night when we were having that meeting, I think the boys understood that believing was the most important thing, and I think they did. 

Q.   You've won a couple of major championships.   You told me earlier in the week that it was very difficult to watch the players play as opposed to being able to hit the shots the way you normally did in your career.   What was it like to go through this whole experience the last three days?
JOSE MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's been a tough week.   The first two days nothing went our way.   We struggled on the greens, and this morning I felt a little change in that regard, and we started to make a few putts.   The Americans just started to miss them.   And winning those few matches, that was key. 
You know, as you said, I've been under pressure hitting shots, but today tops that.
