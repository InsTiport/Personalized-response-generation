DANA VON LOUDA:  Congratulations on amazing third round, 10 under par, you had two eagles, six birdies and that's an 18 hole tournament record.  You went from just making the cut to a total of 8 under par.  If you'd like to just talk about today.
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   You know, yesterday I was very happy that I made the cut to go on in the tournament.  It always helps when you start better.  I made an eagle and then I went on and I had a feeling today that everything is going good and that's always an easy feeling to take off.  But yesterday I couldn't concentrate on any putt.  Today it was totally different, so I really enjoyed it.
Q.  Did you wake up with that feeling or did it start with the eagle?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   No, I think it's just the eagle, but I had a very good feeling just to get to play because I'm so happy that I made the cut.

Yesterday when I shoot 6 over, like when I had three holes to go, I was like, I'm not going to make the cut, that kind of thing.  I hate that feeling when I don't try my best.  I was so happy that I made the cut.
Q.  How many putts did you have yesterday?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   You know, I don't know but I think 40 maybe.
Q.  Is this the first time that you feel that you are on top of the world
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   No, I haven't, no.  I was hoping that I would play with some very good players in here like Annika, you know, some good players and that was my one goal, as well.  And now I hope that I can play with some good players.
Q.  Do you have expectations of winning the tournament or just to play  with the other players?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   No, I try to win.
Q.  Is there an expectation?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   No, of course you're always going to believe that you can play well and you want to believe that you're going to win a tournament, but it's not like that.  I want to just get the feeling that I'm enjoying the golf and that's the most important thing for me.
Q.  You won your last tournament you played two weeks ago, how does this round compare to that feeling ?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   You know, it's always nice to play good here because it's the biggest tournament.  But I think the most important thing is to play well and have the feeling, you know.  I'm 19, I have a lot of years to go and I just want to learn to play golf.  In Hungary (inaudible)I played very well and I had a good feeling and I just try to get that.
Q.  When you sunk your putt birdie putt on 18 did you know it was for the record?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Immediately , but then I didn't hit it on the green and I'm thinking     I was just nervous.  I'm thinking I am going to make par, but I would like to make birdie, just what I'm thinking.
Q.  Was it good to have your coach on the bag?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   It's good to have different kind of shots and it's good to have     inaudible    in your back.
Q.  Could you talk a little about yourself, when did you start playing golf?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I started when I was nine years old.
Q.  Did your parents play golf?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yes, they played, but     inaudible    nothing special.
Q.  When did you decide to play professional golf?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   When I was 13.

I went to my school.  I didn't go through that.  If you want to be a good player you have to choose, I had a chance to go to     but I think this was the best way to go.
Q.  When did you quit school?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Two years ago.
Q.  What were you doing last year?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Practicing in the wintertime and playing.
Q. Did you consider college?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   You know it was just an opportunity.  I didn't do that so well.  There's two ways to go, through the school or to skip the school if you want to be a good player.
Q.  What college in America did you consider?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   It was probably a couple of schools.  I still have to go to high school and one of the things, if I go to high school, and then from there, to university in USA.
Q.  Can you give us a tour of the logos on your shirt?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Oh, you want to know about these? .  These are Finnish companies.  This is the Finnish airlineÃ¢ï¿½ ¦ My manager is here; he handles things very well.
Q.  The prize money you've won already, what do you spend it on?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I save it. I want to buy a house when I have enough money.
Q.  Do you have a nickname?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Minni.
Q.  As in Minnie Mouse?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yeah, like that.
Q.  Where did you learn your English; it's very good?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I'm not good in English, no.  I'm very bad.  I have a coach in Arizona in the USA, and other coaches in Sweden, so I have to speak English with them.
Q.  And who is your coach     you say your coach is carrying your clubs?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yeah, he is from Finland.
Q.  What is his name?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Kalliala.
DANA VON LOUDA:  Let's go over your card.
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   1, driver, 3 wood and 30 meter putt.

4, I hit a 6 iron and it was maybe six meters.

9 iron and then I have like seven meters.

Driver on the green and two putts, maybe seven meter putt.  A driver up on the green like seven, eight meters.
Q.  So you had an eagle putt there?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yes.

10, I chip it in.  I had a driver and 5 iron and it was short, maybe 20 meters.

14, driver, 7 wood, lob wedge, seven meters.

16, 6 iron, five meters.

And the last, 20 meters.
Q.  Did you just have a par at the second?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I hit it in the rough and I had trouble, it was a little bit like this, so I just take a 4 iron that was 50 meters and then it was a little bit short.
Q.  Did you have two putts on the green?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   It was four meters.
Q.  Family watching?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I know, my family and a lot of people are coming out.
Q.  The other pars, were there any other birdie opportunities that you feel you missed?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yes, but I had a lot of long putts today.  Like I had a birdie chance on the sixth hole from five meters.  I had a lot of long putts today.
Q.  You said you had 40 putts yesterday.  Did you spend all night practicing?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I just had difficulty concentrating.  Yesterday on the ball I'm thinking, "ohhh";  my mind wasn't clear.  That's why I was putting three meters long and three meters short and it was awful.
Q.  You shot 62 two weeks ago, and this is your second 62?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:  This my third 62.  In March, I played in South Africa for a tournament there and I shoot myself 9 under there for 62.
Q.  If you take out yesterdayÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s 78, you may have a bit of a future (laughter)?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Yes, actually.
Q.  When you get continue to play well and get down to 5, 6 under par, and so forth, what was your reaction to that?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   If I'm 6 under?
Q.  Not just today, but when you are playing well and you get to, say, 3  or 4 under, do you expect that?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   In South Africa when I made 9 under, that was     now I don't feel any tightness.  I'm just going.
Q.  Now you can shoot 11 under.
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yes.  Well, when I started this year, I picked up my yardage book, and put a 58 on it, to help me remember that I'm going to be a little bit better than Annika.  (Laughter.)
Q.
Vision 54.
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yeah.
Q.  You get a chance to play with her on Monday; will you suggest sheÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ll need a bit of practice?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   No.  But now actually, like I was having nightmares about that, that I am going to be late off the tee and everything like that.  But now I'm thinking like I'm more comfortable to play against Annika on Monday and I'm more comfortable to play here.
Q.  Have you met Annika yet?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yeah, I have met just like this (handshake) because we have the same coach.
Q.  Do you have the same trainer, Kai Fusser, as Annika does?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Very well.  I have the same teacher/trainer but I have just met her once.
Q.  Will you have a difficult time sleeping tonight
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I can always sleep.
Q.  What are you doing next?
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Sweden Tour, Telia Tour, I am going to play that, a couple of tournaments there and then  and a couple of tournaments, and the LPGA Qualifying School.
Q.  You played in the Junior Solheim Cup; is that right?

Q.  So do you plan to play the senior Solheim Cup next year?
