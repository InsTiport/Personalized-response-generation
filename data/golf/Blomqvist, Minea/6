   DANA GROSS-RHODE:  You had a 3-under today.  How excited are you?  What was the situation last night when you found out?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Very, very happy, because you just want to play right now.  Just, you know, get on the course because, you know, I have at least three putts and one disqualify.  I'm so happy to play and then you learn, you know.   
 I've been talking a lot about my mental game.  I just wanted to get out and try.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Have you been working on your mental game in the off season?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  No.  More swing stuff.  I have a new coach.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  And how did everything go today?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  I was very patient.  I just tried to -- I'm a young player.  I think sometimes I try a little bit too hard and try to go to the pins.  When you play with a little bit older players that have experience, they play very patient game.  That's what I tried to do today.  Just tried to get myself in the right spot, jsut try for a birdie.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Did you have any highlight holes?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Yeah, I had one eagle.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Yeah, on 7.   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Right.  So I had like a 60 yard.  Then I made -- I don't remember.  Maybe I made one eagle when I was something like 16.  Yeah, in the Par 4.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  So what was your drive?  How long was your drive or what clubs did you use off the tee?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Driver.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  How far was it, do you know?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  I don't have that.  I had a 60-yard (indiscernible).   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  What did you use?   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Lob wedge.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Thank you.  You had a great round.   
 MINEA BLOMQVIST:  Yeah, thank you.
