 Q.   What was the best part of your game today?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   You know, just I actually didn't feel that good with my shots, but you know, I stayed calm and just got them going.   Actually at the end I got a little bit better shots, better feeling.   So patience.  
   
 Q.   So the best part was the putting?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Yeah, the putting was feeling good, but I just ‑‑ I missed a couple of good birdie opportunities on the Back 9.   But other than that, I think it was very good.   I made good birdies.  
   
 Q.   How do you feel with the round all in all, 4‑under?

 Q.   Do you feel like you can keep going now the next three days?

 Q.   Okay.   Anything special happening in your life at the moment?   You getting married?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   I'm getting married in two weeks.   So you know, that was a little bit like I came home on Friday morning with my son, and jet lag was going on, and then I got here, and I still ‑‑ there was so many things, you know, when I got back home, and two weeks just to the wedding.   
   
 Q.   And where from?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   From Orlando to Finland.   So on Saturday we had kind of like a wedding thing where all of us sit down.   
There are still so many things that you have to take care of, there was a few nights I didn't sleep that good, because I was thinking that thing, and I haven't got ahold of the band.   So I'm like, I wish they are coming.  
   
 Q.   What day are you getting married?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   On New Year's Eve.  
   
 Q.   In Finland?  
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   New Year's Eve in Finland.  
   
 Q.   Nice.   
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   And on Friday I went to try my dress on, and it didn't close, but they said they can make it a little bit bigger.   They made it too small.   That a little stressed me out, too.  
   
 Q.   So good luck with that, and we'll see you tomorrow.   
MINEA BLOMQVIST:   Thank you.
