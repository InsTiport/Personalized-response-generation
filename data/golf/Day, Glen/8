 Q.   Glen, I called it sort of a validation round today after the 66 yesterday.   Go out there and survive and put yourself in a position for the weekend?   
GLEN DAY:   Yeah.   It's a hard golf course.   You miss a couple of shots and you're going to have troubles.   I didn't hit the ball good at all today.   Made some good up and downs.   I made some good putts.   I made birdies when I hit it in the fairway.   But I've got to go to the range.  
   
 Q.   Speaking of figuring that out, I know that your back-9, the front-9 today started getting a little bit sideways, missing fairways and greens.   Was the golf course becoming more difficult as the sun came out today?   
GLEN DAY:   Not the sun.   The wind starting blowing.   On 7 I thought we had it downwind.   I hit a little punch 7-iron and came up ten yards short of the green.   It was into me.   Hit a good shot on 8 but 6, the wind caught my drive and I missed the fairway.   I don't know that I hit very many greens on my back-9.   I don't think I hit but a couple.  
   
 Q.   I think it was three.   
GLEN DAY:   All right.   Three greens, two birdies.   You know, I'll take that.   I'll take even par when you do that.  
   
 Q.   What are you working on on the range before the weekend?   
GLEN DAY:   I hit the ball great yesterday.   It's just timing, my sequence is not right.   I got to get my body and my hands moving at the same time.  
   
 Q.   Late tee time tomorrow, so good playing.   
GLEN DAY:   Thank you.
