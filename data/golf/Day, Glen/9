  Q. Obviously you're right there. Talked to you last night. You were tired and so forth but you got to feel good about your position, you finished up the third round today.  
 GLEN DAY: You know, I did. I was really disappointed on the last hole. I hit a good driver that landed in the fairway on the right-hand side. It kicked right and it rolled right up against the primary cut in the just the first cut of rough, and, you know, I thought I hit a good shot.   
 It squirted out to the right and hit the cart path twice and went out of bounce and made double. You know, other than that, I did good. I'm playing good. I am tired, which is hopefully will be to my benefit this afternoon. I'll just relax and swing and play.
