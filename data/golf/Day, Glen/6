Q. Another good round today, two good rounds.
GLEN DAY: Yesterday I didn't hit the ball well.  I putted good and scored great.  I got up and down.  Today I hit the ball a whole lot better and putted horrible.  I missed probably four putts inside of five feet, six, eight feet.  I hit two bad putts, and I misread some.
But all in all, you know, you get around even par, you're right in there.  You've got a chance.  I was expecting the greens to be a lot faster this morning.  They were smooth.  They were perfect.  I had it 15, 18 feet on the 1st hole, left it 5 feet short.  And all day long, I never had enough speed.
17, I had it dead in the throat uphill for birdie.  I leave it four feet short and miss it.  So I just never had the speed all day.
Q. Was the wind much of a factor today?  You guys played in those strong winds yesterday.  Maybe a little more wind this morning.
GLEN DAY: We played in it yesterday so I felt we knew it today.  So I was more comfortable with the wind.  The wind, I don't think, affected our group at all.  We had a great group.  Billy played really well.  Brandt played really well.  You're kind of feeding off each other.  Guys hitting good shots, getting up and down.  So it was a good day.
Q. You're 2 under heading into the weekend.  Your thoughts on that?
GLEN DAY: It all depends on the weather.  Nobody can predict it now.  Apparently, we're going to go early off of 1 and 10 to try to miss some of it.  Hopefully, we miss it.  If it softens up, the scores will go lower.  If somehow we miss it, the wind dries it out, they don't put a lot of water on it, shoot, 4, 5, 6, 7 under could win easy.  So it all depends on the weather really.
