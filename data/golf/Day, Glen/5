 Q.  So waiting around all day.  How did you spend the time?  
GLEN DAY: Well, we kind of hung out and had a little lunch, then we went and -- girls went shopping.  I went and had to get a passport photo made.  Of course, you know, we were using y'all's computer.  We did all that.   
So we just did little things to stay occupied, socialized.   
 Q.  Now, they're playing three days in a row, and now you're kind of just sitting around waiting.  How do you stay mentally prepared and ready?  
GLEN DAY: Mentally, you kind of laugh it off.  There's nothing you can do but keep going, you know.  I think it's going to help me because I hit it so bad the last two days.  So getting away from it for a day will be good.   
You know what?  There's nothing you can do.  Mother Nature's going to win every time.  So everybody's doing the best they can.  Staff's doing the best they can.  And the players know that.  There's nothing you can do about it.   
 Q.  So now all day off today, basically.  Are you hitting balls at all?  
GLEN DAY: I'm not.  I'm not going to do anything.  We checked out of our hotel, and we're worrying about plane tickets and everything else.  So I'm going to go back in, sit down for a minute, and get reorganized, and we'll go at 'em tomorrow.
