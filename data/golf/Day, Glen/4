 Q.  How did it look for you out there?  
GLEN DAY: Yeah, three-putted the last hole, so not very happy.  I missed too many putts.  Hit the ball really good, had a lot of opportunities.  I mean, it was a whole lot better that what I shot.  The number was the worst I could have done.   
 Q.  Sorry to catch up late, but you're in contention and you're in hailing distance.  
GLEN DAY: Yeah, we've got two more days.  We'll see.  It all depends how the course plays.  If it firms up, the scores will go down.  If it stays soft, the scores are going to keep being lower and lower and lower.  So you've got to make putts.   
 Q.  Do you like the golf course?  It suits you?  
GLEN DAY: I do.  It does.  I can play.  It's very playable.  I had the ball in the right places a lot today, and I misread three putts inside of four feet.  They just turned more than I thought.  That's the way it goes.   
 Q.  Later tee time, you can sleep in a little.  
GLEN DAY: That's good.
