NEAL REID:  Okay, let's go over your scorecard, I guess.  Real quick.  Birdies and bogeys. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Okay. 
LAURA NEAL:  A bogey on five? 
NEAL REID:  A bogey on five.

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Left it short in the front trap.  And didn't get up-and-down.  Hit it to about 7 feet and missed for par. 
NEAL REID:  6.

MICHELLE ELLIS:  6-iron, ran through the back and that was just off the edge and hit it down to about four feet and missed it coming back. 
NEAL REID:  Did you chip or putt that?

MICHELLE ELLIS:  No, I putted it down. 
NEAL REID:  Birdie on 7. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Birdie on 7.  I hit driver, a little 9-iron into about 15 feet. 
NEAL REID:  Birdie on 10. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Hit a big drive down there and I had like 110 total.  Hit a little wedge into about three feet and holed it. 
NEAL REID:  And bogey on 12. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  12 was I just pulled it left off the tee and I had to chip out. 
NEAL REID:  How far was your par putt there?

MICHELLE ELLIS:  The par putt there would have been, I don't know, 25, 30 feet. 
NEAL REID:  And bogey on 13. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Three putts.  That was from way left edge of the green.  Hit it down past about five feet and didn't make it coming back. 
NEAL REID:  You came back with a birdie on 17 though. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Yeah.  Hit a really not a very good shot in there and I got lucky it bounced to the front and went up to about, I don't know, 15 feet and holed it. 
NEAL REID:  What club did you hit in there?

MICHELLE ELLIS:  7. 
NEAL REID:  Well, you're still only three off the lead.  After being 1-over.  So you must feel pretty good going into tomorrow.

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Yeah, hopefully.  Like I said, I didn't time it as well as I would like to today.  But that's what happens under pressure and with the wind and that it's hard to keep your timing out there.  But hopefully tomorrow my timing comes back a little bit better. 
NEAL REID:  Questions? 
Q.  How bad was the wind today compared to yesterday?

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Not as bad as yesterday.  Just a little bit more swirling today.  Wasn't really coming from the one direction like yesterday. 
Q.  How are you going to go tomorrow?  Are you going to go on thinking you got to shoot a certain number or are you just going to let it happen?

MICHELLE ELLIS:  With the way I hit it today I would have to just goatee it up and let it happen.  I'm going to go and work on some timing on the range now.  But like I said, I didn't time it real well.  I'm just going to go out had there and play your own game around here.  Three shots so anybody within 7 shots of the lead has got a chance out here tomorrow.  If the wind gets up again, it's one of those golf courses.  And I'll be going out just to do my best. 
NEAL REID:  Okay.  Thank you very much. 

MICHELLE ELLIS:  Thank you.
