Q. Well played out there.  Can I get your thoughts on a 5-under 67 today?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, I'm very happy with 5-under today.  It was pretty tricky out there and the greens are getting firmer, as well, and the wind was picking up a little bit.  I'm happy with 5-under.
Q. A very eventful start, a bogey and four birdies.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, started off really good. Felt really good in the warm up this morning, and played well there in the beginning.   Doubled the second which was unfortunate.  Was hitting a palm tree on the second shot but otherwise, solid the first nine.
Q. Always really nice to finish on a birdie?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, that was real nice.  The second shot wasn't good at all, out to the right.  Managed to get it up-and-down from 50 meters out of the rough to the right.  So real nice.
Q. What were conditions like compared to the first two days?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Obviously the first day was a bit easier, so pretty much no wind.  It was pretty tough yesterday.  Similar to today.  But I would say the greens are getting a little bit firmer today than yesterday, so might be a little bit harder today.
Q. Would you have taken this position at the start of the week going into the final day?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Definitely.
