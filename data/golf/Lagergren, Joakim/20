 Q.  What happened today, did you feel good before you went out there?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Not really.  I've been struggling on the driving range, missing everything on the driving range.  Got a little bit better.  Played okay the front nine, just 2-under.  And then it's just, something happened.  Just started to make some birdies, holing some putts and hitting some good shots.  Just kept my momentum, and just keep on going.   
 Q.  Just built confident that you go onto every tee thinking that you're going to make birdie here?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Not really.  I was thinking make birdie here but I wasn't that confident.  I was still thinking a lot on a lot of stuff to make birdies.  It wasn't just, sometimes you go out there and play.  Today it wasn't a round like that.  It feels like I was fighting out there today, even though it was a really good score.   
 Q.  Puts you right up there in the individual and also in the team competition, I think you've gone to top or second?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: 27-under we are in team.   
 Q.  How is the team feeling?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: The team feeling is good.  We are performing good on the team.   
 Q.  Have you been getting on well?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  We are having a lot of fun out there.   
 Q.  If there are any highlights, difficult to pick with so many?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Definitely the birdie on 7.  I was hitting the driver like 30, 40 metres off-line off the tee way right, and hit out of a really difficult lie to six, seven metres and holed that one.  That was in the end of the round, as well, so that was really cool.
