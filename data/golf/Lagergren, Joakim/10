Q. Thoughts on a 69 today?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I'm happy with the score.  I fought a lot out there.  It wasn't pretty at all but the long game turned down on me today, and the short game came back to me.  So I'm happy with 3-under.
Q. It was a patient start to the round and then got it going on the back nine.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It never got going really.  I was, as I said, fighting a lot, but holed a few putts and was really good around the green today.
Q. One shot off the lead.  What's the game plan tomorrow?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Hopefully I will hit the ball better.  I have some work to do on the driving range today and hopefully get it back to where it was Thursday, Friday.
