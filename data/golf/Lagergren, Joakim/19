Q. Joakim, how did you get on today?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I played very well and was solid all day, I would say. I putted really well and made some great saves coming in on the last five or six holes.
Q. People say Carnoustie is the hardest of the three courses â are you glad to get it out of the way?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, especially with a good score as well. Iâve just got to keep on playing good on the slightly easier courses.
Q. You played really well here last year, do you feel like youâre set for another good year now?
That would be nice. To finish even better than fourth would be really nice.
