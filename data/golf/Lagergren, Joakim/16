Q. Your thoughts on a round of 64 here?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I guess it's pretty good.
Q. What have you done well?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Today I was really solid all day.  Yesterday I didn't putt very well, but played pretty good.  I guess the putts just dropped today and that's six shots better.
Q. So essentially the days are pretty similar but you've made the most of opportunities, today.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I would say so, yes.  As I said it was really solid out there and I had a lot of chances and holed a few putts, and that was nice.
Q. What was the best of those putts, the one that said, yeah, this is going to be a good day for me today?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: You never know, and this is a pretty tight track, as well.  You can easily score a few bogeys out there.  So you never know, really.  But when I was 5-under after nine holes, I felt, this is going pretty well.
Q. You said it's a tight track.  There are the opportunities, aren't there?  You shot a 64, Adrian Otaegui shot a 63; it makes it look easy, in a sense.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: If you hit the ball good, you're going to get a lot of opportunities.  But if you're a little bit off line, it's going to get hard.
Q. Are you feeling good as a result of the season that you're enjoying?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Of course, best season so far.  I'm enjoying it.
Q. Does it make it easier, nicer, at this end of the season when you're into The Final Series, knowing that you've got a lot of good things to look back on?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, that's very nice.  You just need to enjoy these last three tournaments and have fun out there.
Q. And apart from flies, I take it there's a lot to enjoy, being a resort course in the sunshine?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: This is a really great resort.  Love the hotel, love the course, love everything around here.  I think it's a great place for a Final Series event.
