Q. Top five finish, an amazing result. Do you feel you left a few out there?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Definitely. Putting myself in that position, to be able to win here Sunday afternoon, you always want to take that. But to finish off the way I did there, bogey 17, par 18, would have needed two better there to get into a playoff. But it's such a tough second shot there on 17. I did all I can do. Just didn't end up as I thought.
Q. What were the challenges on the back nine?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: The wind is a bit easier, I would say, for me, as a fader on the back nine. Can't say with the wind, but there's so many bunkers on the left and the middle all the way. Just need to stay on grass pretty much and obviously I hit it down in the bunker on 13, which cost me a shot, almost two in the end, but just so small margins on links courses.
Q. On a positive note, all around, a good week for you?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, third place, good.
