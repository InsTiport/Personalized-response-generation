Q. 1-over for today, but you may be a little bit disappointed.   Just assess how that went for you.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, I'm not very pleased with 1-over obviously, but it was a little tougher out there today, a little bit more wind.  So it's not the end of the world.  1-over is still a pretty okay score.  Obviously wanted a little bit more.
Q. Give us an insight into how the conditions made it tough out there.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: The wind was coming and going, swirling around a little bit.  It's really hard to take a decision on clubs into the greens when the greens are really firm and the wind is coming from everywhere.  So that was the tough part today.
Q. You're not too far off going into the weekend.  Are you excited by that prospect?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  It's always fun to be up there contending, so I'm looking forward to it.
