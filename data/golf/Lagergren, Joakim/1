Q. So you went into this morning thinking, okay, this is going to be a test, but then --
JOAKIM LAGERGREN:   Yeah, obviously first I'd say two and a half hours it was a war, a real battle out there.  I felt like I kept it going pretty well and made a few nice putts, as well.  I was 1-under after 10, and I felt like, that's really good.
Q. In your history of playing have you experienced much of links style golf or is it something that you like playing?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN:   Yeah, I mean, growing up not a lot of links.  Had no links courses in Sweden, I'd say, not proper links.  But since I got on Tour in 2012, I mean, got some links in since then, and been doing quite well.
Q. It's quite a test, isn't it.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN:   Yeah, you always need the weather to protect the course a little bit when you're playing links golf I would say.  If there's no wind, usually pretty easy at a links, but it was really tough this day, so yeah.
Q. It's a bit of a progression coming; you're rolling, playing some decent golf.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN:   Yeah, the last two events have been really good.  Played well at Valderrama, as well, didn't really quite finish as high up as I wanted, but played well.  The golf has been there the last month I would say.
Q. You've got a sequence of events now, which is great.  You had that period where you didn't play.  Playing a Rolex event, does it up the stakes even more?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN:   I don't really think about it in that way.  I'm in a tournament, going out, doing my best.
