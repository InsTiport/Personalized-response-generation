Q. It's been a long day, but ultimately a very good one.  You must be happy?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, it's been a good one.  I played really solid today.  Unfortunately I didn't hole any putts this round.  I think I made 17 greens -- and of them being birdies, eagle on the par 5.  Two 2-putts for a birdie and one tap-in for an eagle.
I wasn't close enough really, I hit a lot of greens, but I need to get a little bit closer and putt a little bit better to shoot a really low one.
Q. Kingsbarns is normally the most scorable but today the scoring didn't seem that long.  With the conditions, presumably quite tough?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It was a little windy and a little drizzle there on the front nine.  But it's pretty scorable anyway, I would say.  You get a few holes downwind where you can really take advantage of it.
Q. And on to St. Andrews tomorrow, looking forward to playing the Home of Golf?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, that's going to be great as usual.
Q. The junior amateur you were playing with, how did she do?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: She's doing good.  She's improving.  She was helping me by three shots today which was good.
Q. And your season overall, how do you feel it's gone for you?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It's better and better, I would say.  This autumn I've been playing better and better, so it feels pretty good.
Q. Peaking at the right time with some big tournaments coming up?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, we'll see.
