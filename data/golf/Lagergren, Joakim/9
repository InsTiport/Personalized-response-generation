 Q.  How pleased are you with that round?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I think that's a great round.  I mean, the course is really tough.  The greens are really severe.  So anything under par is good here.   
 Q.  3-under for the first five holes.  Must give you a lot of confidence going into the rest of the round?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  I holed a few good putts there on the first five holes.  It was a really good start.   
 Q.  What makes this golf course so difficult?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It's the green areas, I would say.  It's a great course from tee-to-green but once you come up to the green, it's just the slopes are so severe, you need to be on the right spots.   
 Q.  Perfect conditions out there today, as well, with no wind.  Did that play into your hands a little bit?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Well, obviously it did, I don't know, but yeah, perfect conditions.  It's really hot, as well.  So the ball went a little further than usual, I would say, so it was great conditions.   
 Q.  What's the game plan for tomorrow?  More of the same?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  Just stick to the game plan I have and do my best.
