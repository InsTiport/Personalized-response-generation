Q. Things got off to a good start on the front nine, three birdies but it all quieted down a little bit.  Was it the change in the weather conditions?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I think the conditions stayed great all day.  Played well on the back nine, as well, but feels like I left a lot of shots out there.  Didn't hole the putts.  It should have been a few better, I think.
Q. What were the main positives you take from today's round?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Still hitting the ball well.  Probably the best day today all week.  Yesterday didn't really get the putting going.
Q. Main thing is you've stayed in contention, you're 10-under par, four shots off the lead.  How will you approach the final round tomorrow?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Same stuff.  Just hole a few more putts.  I know I've got a low one in there.  Yeah, play some good golf.
Q. How is the atmosphere out there?  The crowds have been fantastic again today.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, it's always in Ireland.  Crowd are great here as Ireland.
Q. One down side, the football.  Did you know what was happening?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Well, I kept track on it out there.  Yeah, it's too bad.
