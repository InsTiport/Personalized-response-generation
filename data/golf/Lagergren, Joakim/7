Q. Describe how today went for you?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I was struggling out there today actually.  Didn't hit the ball great.  I was pretty wide off the tee.  I was fighting a lot there.
I mean, so hard, this course, if you're not finding the fairways.  So it was just a big fighting spirit there.
Q. Looks like you're going to come up just a couple of shots short but overall a very positive week for you.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  It's obviously going in the right direction.  I've been struggling a little bit lately, so there's plenty of positives to take with me.
Q. What's the goal now for the rest of the season?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Well, I'm still looking for my first win, so I really want that to happen as soon as possible.
