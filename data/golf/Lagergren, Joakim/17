 Q.  How would you reflect on a very, presumably, satisfying week here?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, I played good all four rounds, and did my best all week.  But not quite enough.   
 Q.  So there's disappointment there, as well as satisfaction?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Of course, you don't get too many going chances, and of course I wanted to win today, but did my best to play well but Tyrrell just was too good today.   
 Q.  Essentially there were so many good positives for you across the course of the week to maneuver into the position, weren't there?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  As I said, the game is right there, and I just need to keep on going with the momentum and then hopefully keep on playing good the rest of the year.   
 Q.  Given you were fourth at this event last year, and you've knocked on the door once again, is there something extra special about playing these venues?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I mean, it's obviously a lot of fun to come here.  It's a really nice place, and obviously links golf suits me pretty okay.   
 Q.  And the money, the points that are attached to it, that's important this week, isn't it?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It is.  I needed a jump to get into the Playoffs, so it's good.
