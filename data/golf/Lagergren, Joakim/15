 Q.  Good to finish in such style?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, it's really nice to finish with a birdie there.  Feels really good the at moment.   
 Q.  And the final round, after a double-bogey early on, boy, did you bounce back.  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, I didn't feel very well to start out like I did, but I made a birdie the hole after, so I was in the game again.   
 Q.  Did you fancy, what, a chase for second spot today?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely, yeah, but obviously the other guys played really well, as well.  I'm still happy with the result today, 4-under.   
 Q.  What do you think now when you look at that leaderboard and you find yourself in a very good position with good points and good prize money?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Feels nice.  Feels nice to keep on climbing up that Race to Dubai list, so I'm looking forward for the next two events.   
 Q.  Has it been a very good and almost rapid climb after an almost quiet spell?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, this fall has been really good.  Been playing some really great golf.  Feels fantastic.   
 Q.  I know we asked at the Dunhill but what made the difference?  Where was the transition?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: So hard to say, isn't it.  I can't really tell.   
 Q.  But it's improved in all aspects of the game, or are you just holing some more putts?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: No, I think overall, everything is a bit better which is really nice.  Working hard and finally it pays off.   
 Q.  Going on to South Africa?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, it's going to be nice.
