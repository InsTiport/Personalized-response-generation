Q. Pleased with your start?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Had fun out there.  Played with a good friend of mine, Kristoffer Broberg, and had a lot of fun out there.
Q. Is it always nice to play with someone that you know?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: It is, yeah.  Sometimes it helps to play a little better.
Q. Do you think it takes the pressure off when you can relax a bit more?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I don't know about that, but you're having a smile on your face instead of going there by yourself, so that was fun.
Q. Was there any particular stretch of holes today that you felt gave you momentum?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I started good.  Birdied the first and 3-under after five I think, so I got into the round good directly.  So that was nice.
Q. And it's a good day to get that low score, isn't it, with the wind not quite up yet?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: We had good conditions out there, so there's nothing to complain about weather-wise.  5-under, it's a good score, but it was pretty easy out there.
Q. I think that wind get up, going to get a lot harder?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Definitely, the rough is pretty thick and if the wind picks up a little bit, it's going to be hard to hit fairways.
