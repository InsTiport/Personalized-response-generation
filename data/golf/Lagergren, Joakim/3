 Q.  Well-played today. You must be delighted with your round?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely. Can't complain on a 62 at Kingsbarns. Delighted.   
 Q.  What clicked out there today?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Pretty much everything, I would say. Hitting it straight off the tee and iron shots were solid. So holed a few putts there, as well. Just good overall.   
 Q.  Good round on this course. You must wish you could play here for all four days?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Actually I just love the format, playing three different courses. Two rounds at St. Andrews, I think it's a great setup.   
 Q.  How enjoyable is the Pro-Am nature of tournament?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I like it a lot. Enjoy it a lot out there. Having a great playing partner this week. Been having that every year, so it's a lot of fun out there. Just a relaxed feeling to it.   
 Q.  Confident for the team competition?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: We'll do our best, absolutely.   
 Q.  What's the game plan, more of the same?  
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Well, it's a different course, so obviously that game plan for that course, but yeah, keep on playing good and it will work out itself.
