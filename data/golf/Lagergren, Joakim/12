Q. Talk us through your take on that final playoff hole.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, I was hitting a good drive out there.  I had like 225 to the pin downwind.  Hitting a 4-iron but didn't strike it well.  Thinned it a little bit down in the bunker and it's a tough shot from there.
Q. What about your notions as you were forced to wait in the scorer's hut watching a couple of players to see if 16-under was going to be good enough?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Yeah, it was good enough but I didn't think so when I holed out actually.  I thought 17 would be the mark.  But got into a playoff and the rest is history.
Q. Great week for you nonetheless, though.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely.  Can't complain about the second place, but obviously a lot of disappointment right now.
Q. Just come up short.  What are your thoughts today?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: I played really well today.  I would have taken 6-under before the day, definitely.  Played well.  Lost in a playoff.  Nothing to say about it really.  I knew before I was hitting -- before we went to the tee box there, you need to make birdie here to win it.  I was hitting 4-iron down in that bunker, so it's a tough shot from there.
Q. Conditions were really tough out there.  Your birdies really got that momentum going into the back nine, didn't it?
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely, yeah.  I think I made five in a row out there.  I played a lot of good golf, definitely.
Q. Game is clearly in very good shape.  You must be quite confident going into Dubai next week.
JOAKIM LAGERGREN: Absolutely, yeah.  We'll try to get the trophy there this time.
