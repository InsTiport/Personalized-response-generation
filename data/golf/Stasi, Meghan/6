Q. That was quite a match.  Tell me a little bit just overall thoughts about the match.
MEGHAN STASI: I knew it was going to be close.  It was a great start for me, but recently I've just -- last few years I've been up in the last few holes and decided to give it away.
I told myself from the start, just par is your friend, par is your friend.  You know, I didn't make par on 15, 16, or 17.  Gave it right back.
Q. I was going to say, she came storming back holes 15 be 16, 17.
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah.
Q. Were you like, Okay, Meghan...
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, exactly, so I don't know how I quite made that putt on 18, but I'm going to just...
Q. I was told it was 20-foot birdie putt.
MEGHAN STASI: Off the green and breaking, like a four-foot break.  O, yeah, who knows?  You just never know.
Q. So you squared it up on 18 with that birdie.  You guys went on and played, what, five more holes?
MEGHAN STASI: Yes, five.
Q. Walk me through that playoff.
MEGHAN STASI: Just had advantage on 1, 2, 3, 4.  You know, putting last I had a chance to make them all, and on the edge, on the edge, little short, little short.  Then she unfortunately made bogey.  Fortunately for me, but made bogey on the fifth playoff hole.
Q. And your par on that hole was two-putt par?
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, I still had to make it.  I left it six feet short, over the hill, so...
Q. This is a tournament I guess you think about all year every year.  Thoughts?  You got some more golf to play.
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, exactly.  I don't know what time it is, but I know I'm going off in 20 minutes.  Just looking forward to it.  I'm ready to go.
Q. Pleased to pull it out.
MEGHAN STASI: Yeah, exactly.
