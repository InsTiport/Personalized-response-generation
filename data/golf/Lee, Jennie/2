  RHONDA GLENN: Jennie Lee was the low amateur, tied for low amateur in this Women's Open Championship. 
 Jennie, just a few years ago Cristie Kerr was the low amateur in this Women's Open Championship.  And she now has a one stroke lead, so it bodes well for you to be low amateur in this. 
  JENNIE LEE: It's really exciting. I came here and there was a lot of amateurs out here and a lot of great players, but to finish as one of the top amateurs it's really, really exciting. 



 RHONDA GLENN:  You've had a very good season.  You're a USA Curtis Cup player, you played for the USA side on the Women's Amateur Team Championship.  Where does this rank with the things you've accomplished? 
  JENNIE LEE: I don't know. It's definitely one of the most -- top most proudest moments in my amateur career, and representing the country, my country in South Africa and also in Bandon was really, really exciting, but this is definitely up there, also. 



 RHONDA GLENN:  The professionals today are so very, very skilled.  The scores they shoot are incredibly low.  I believe Cristie had a 66 in the third round. 
 Why would an amateur come here to compete. 
  JENNIE LEE: For me, you know, just during this week I've really learned a lot about what I can improve in my game and just being able to play practice rounds with some of the professionals and even today I played with Sherri Steinhauer and she told me she's been out here for 22 years. 



 I really learned a lot from her today, just her being patient around the greens and just her composure all day long.  I think just us being able to come here we really, really learn a lot from a lot of the professionals. 
 RHONDA GLENN:  Sherri has been out here 22 years.  How old are you? 
 JENNIE LEE:  I'm 20. 
 RHONDA GLENN:  Jennie Lee, congratulations, again, and thanks so much for being with us.
