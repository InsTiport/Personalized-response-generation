 Q. How was your experience out there today?
 GREG BISCONTI: You know, basically my goal was just to get the last couple of holes, a shot at it. I don't know where we stand right now. But obviously we have an outside chance. But it felt good.

 Q. How does it feel to know that you could make your first cut after being so close at Medinah?
 GREG BISCONTI: I'm not going to get ahead of myself. I played well. And that's all I can hope for. Whatever happens is going to happen.

 Q. What have you learned here that you're going to take back to your folks back in New York?
 GREG BISCONTI: I've got an awesome short game. Took me about five minutes and I've got to say it was probably worth five or six shots this week. So there's obviously that. There's experiences I had with the two pros I played with today and yesterday as well as a couple of guys in the practice rounds. Things you see them do that you can certainly relay back to your membership.

 Q. Anything specific?
 GREG BISCONTI: I mean, obviously as teachers we always tell our students short game, short game. They all scoff at us and want to go to lesson two. But in talking to Charles Howe and asking him what was the first thing he did in 2000 when he came out on TOUR, it was all about short game. I watched Gonzalo and Brian with their wedges. They're phenomenal. It all comes down to short game. We all know that, but it's great to be able to reinforce that for them.
