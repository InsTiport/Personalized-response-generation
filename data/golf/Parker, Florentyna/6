 Q. Four birdies and an eagle all adds up to a rather nice day's work?  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: It was brilliant. After yesterday and on Monday I played a practice round and I thought, this is going to be so tough. I was so intimidated by the course and I kept saying to my friend, if I shoot under 80 today, I'm going to be thrilled. And then I was starting off, I was like, doing okay and kept it going.   
   
 Q. You've played this championship since 2009, so you've had a taste of some of the greatest courses around the United Kingdom. How does Turnberry compare for you?   
FLORENTYNA PARKER: This is the first course I had never played as an amateur, as well. I was warming up on the PlayStation a bit playing it a bit and that helped.   
Yeah, it's such a challenging course. We were lucky. The front nine was quite windy or there was a little breeze and then like the last few holes, it was absolutely nothing. I think we had a good draw and it's a tough course. The bunkers, if you're in them, it's like a shot gone.  
   
 Q. A great short and as a twoâ€‘time winner on the Ladies European Tour, what would it mean, not casting your mind ahead too far, but how significant is this championship for you as a homegrown player, as it were?   
FLORENTYNA PARKER: Well, I think for everyone, this is like the one to win. But first day, the first few groups I was out, so I'm not really thinking about that. I just need another good score tomorrow and the next few days.
