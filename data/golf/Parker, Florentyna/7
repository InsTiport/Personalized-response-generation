Q.   Were you expecting to come out and play that well on day one here? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Well, I've always had a good first round here and I love the course, I love Dubai.     I've been out here for two months, and I feel really good.   Had a great start. 

Q.   A little birdie told me that you have a relationship with Dubai.   Can you just elaborate on that?   I think some of your family spent time here?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     I have a cousin who is the pro at Al Badia Golf Club so I've been here the last two months practicing before China, after China, and so I spent a lot of time here in Dubai. 

Q.   And how did it help playing alongside Shanshan?   Did that drag you along, if you like? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     We had a fantastic group, I think we were like 16‑under par all together so we all played really well and had loads of birdies and it was a really enjoyable group.

Q.   What did you do particularly well?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     My putting was really good today.   I hit 14 greens, had 26 putts, so I rolled them in nicely and yeah, got off to a good start and had one bogey.   It was good. 

Q.   Obviously it's a strong field here but how confident are you of reproducing the next three days?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     I've all done well on this course and I enjoy it and I feel so comfortable here.   Yeah, my chances are quite good. 

Q.   I think it was last year or the year before, you were up at the top of the leaderboard, did that give you confidence heading in that you've done it before? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     The last two years, I've finished ninth and fourth, so I do usually do well on this course.   It suits me.   Yeah, I feel very comfortable here.   I've been here two months, and it's like home and I know the course really well. 

Q.   Do you think you can go ninth, fourth, do you think top three?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Yeah, my aim is always Top‑5 is always good and the field gets stronger each year.   So a Top‑10, Top‑5 is always good here.   Yeah, I started off nicely, I think this is my lowest round on this course, so yeah, I'm starting off in a great position.

Q.   And sustaining it through? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Yeah, obviously we have three more days and you never know what happens in golf.   But I'm hoping just to keep on playing like I have and finish the season quite well so far.   Hopefully a few more good rounds.

Q.   What about the conditions, how did you find them?   Obviously you'll know what it's like out here?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     I mean, the course is in good condition, and you know, the greens are perfect, the course is good and the scoring is quite low this year for the first round, the rough is not as high as it normally is, that might be it.   Might be pretty similar. 

Q.   Tomorrow you'll get an earlier tee off time; that an opportunity for people like yourself to make a move? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     It will be nice to stay in the rhythm, so a quick turnover, so it's good. 

Q.   Who is your caddie?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     My brother, Ben.

Q.   Who is here from your family?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Everyone, my mum and dad, my cousin who obviously lives here, a few group‑s. 

Q.   Is your brother from England? 
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Yeah.

Q.   And he's older than you?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     He is, he's on The Challenge Tour. 

Q.   What's his name?
FLORENTYNA PARKER:     Ben.
