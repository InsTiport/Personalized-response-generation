 Q.  It was a story of two nines in two days for you.  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: Yesterday I started so well.  I had seven birdies on the front nine and gave myself nine chances, basically.  I struggled here the last few years.   
The last three years I've missed the cut, and it's been very disappointing.  I was thinking back to 2010, I think I started with 5- or 6-under on the back nine, which was my front nine.  And I said, I need to get that feeling back and somehow do the same, and I can do it.   
Well, I went one or two better, so that it was really good, and then I struggled a bit this morning.  It's quite hard to find your way again, but it was good that I made back-to-back birdies, and obviously I struggled on the last two holes.   
It was horrible what happened.  Our thoughts are with the family, but it was the right decision to stop play and let us come back this morning.  Yeah, we have to still do our job and concentrate on golf this week but we'll be thinking of him, as well.
