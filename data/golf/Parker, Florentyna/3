 Q.  A very solid 71 for you today.  Are you happy with your position and the way you played?  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: I struggled on the front nine and was 2-over and I finished really well, so I was 3-under for the last five holes.  So that was really good.  I'm pleased and I'll take it.   
 Q.  A great finish to the year to finish tied third in Dubai.  Does that set you up for a nice Christmas break?  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: I'm going on holiday tomorrow, so that's perfect for me.  I've had a great year and eight Top-10s.  I'm really thrilled.   
 Q.  This year in general, it's been the best in your career, hasn't it.  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: Yeah, in 2010, I had eight Top-10s, but I did a bit better this year.   
 Q.  So you're happy?  
FLORENTYNA PARKER: I'm absolutely thrilled.
