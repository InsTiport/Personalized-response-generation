 Q.  Nice way to start this championship, indeed, to finish that round for 7-under.  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, it's a good opening score.  Started with a bogey on the first, and to get it back to 7-under, that means you've hit a lot of good shots, and I'm very happy with that.   
 Q.  Very controlled, putting it in the right places presumably?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, I think the key here is on hitting the greens, fairways and greens, staying out of the traps.  They are very deep and they will cost you a shot.   
So I just hit a lot of greens and I made some nice putts, and 65.   
 Q.  You've done pretty well around here in the past, haven't you?  
JOOST LUITEN: I had a couple decent finishes, but it's one of these courses if you play well, you can shoot a low score; and if you are struggling with your game, you struggle to score, as well.  It's a very tough and demanding golf course.   
 Q.  Nice to get Ireland out of the system?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, it was just a couple bad days and I didn't make any putts.  If those conditions, if you're not on top of your game, you're going to struggle, and that's what I did for a couple days.  Sometimes that happens, and that's golf.  That's why it's so tough.   
 Q.  But you're smiling when you see the sun shining here?  
JOOST LUITEN: I was happy with the sunshine.  You never know what it's going to be here, but today's been very pretty and I hopefully it stays like that the rest of the week.
