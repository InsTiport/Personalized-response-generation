 Q.   What are your thoughts on that?   
JOOST LUITEN:   It was a tough match and you leave yourself a nice test at the last.   Not really what you want to do but it went in and the point's in.   
   
 Q.   Tighter and tighter.   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it looked pretty good, 3â€‘up with three to go and then you basically give 16 away, that was a big mistake.   Yeah, it makes it very difficult to come down the last two holes with only one shot up.   But it's been a good win, a good day.  
   
 Q.   Gets the heart going, doesn't it, and I imagine the nerves play their part.   
JOOST LUITEN:   It's good.   I like it when it's tight like this.   It's a good learning experience and hopefully you can take that all with you on the course next tournament.  
   
 Q.   What is Miguel telling you in that kind of situation, and particularly if you're aware of how balanced the match is?   
JOOST LUITEN:   All I've heard him saying is, "Breathe, breathe ,"that's all he says.   He just tries to calm you down and there's nothing really you can say in those positions.   You just have to play and play the best shots that you can do.  
   
 Q.   Fancy some more of this come September?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Oh, yeah, it's great fun, the whole team behind and you it really gives that you extra boost that you need sometimes and it's great fun.
