Q.   Tell us how good that round was after two more modest rounds. 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it was really good, the difference between today and the first two days was that I kept the bogeys off the card and I made some nice putts.   Created a lot of birdie chances, and I let the putter do the work. 

Q.   So you had the sense that there were opportunities; that you could make a move? 
JOOST LUITEN:   If you hit the fairways, you could get to some pins.   And yeah, I had a good start with birdie, birdie, so that got me going.   And then some nice birdies on the back nine, as well. 

Q.   A lot can happen from here, but do you feel you're in a good position into Sunday?
JOOST LUITEN:   We have to see.   The guys have to play another nine or ten holes I think, so a lot can happen.   I think I've done some good business today and we'll see what happens tomorrow. 

Q.   Does it make Shanghai all the more worthwhile?
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, at the end of the day, I had to do that and it worked out fine for this week so far.   So we'll see if we can keep it going one more round and then take some time off. 

Q.   Shows your determination to get here, and I know in Turkey, having the injection, everything's worked out, and you're fit, healthy? 
JOOST LUITEN:   I don't feel the shoulder anymore, but that's because of the injection.   Doesn't mean the inflammation is gone.   That's why I need to give it some rest after this tournament.
