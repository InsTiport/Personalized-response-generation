  JOOST LUITEN:   It was tough, I didn't play that well.   I struggled a little bit with my iron play.   Missed really too many greens.   But to still shoot 2â€‘under par today, I think you can't really complain, so still in there and see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   How did you get there despite the trickiness? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, that was the thing for me today.   I didn't play well and I kept myself in there and I think that was a good sign for today.

Q.   It was always going to be hard to follow what happened on the second day?
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it's always tough to pull off but when you play, you don't really think about that stuff anymore.   You just try to focus on the shots that you have to play and that's what I did. 

Q.   Was it good playing in the final group with Tommy? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it's good.   I haven't played for a couple of weeks, so to be in the third day in the last group, feels good.   Like I said we have a chance for tomorrow.   We are in a good position.   Could have gone a few better if the putter was a bit warm today but I hope he saves everything for tomorrow.

Q.   I'm sure it's obvious but what is necessary come the final day?
JOOST LUITEN:   I think it's about keeping the mistakes off the card.   Par is pretty good around this course, and you've got some chances on the par 5s so I think if you can par the tough holes and try to make some birdies on the easier holes, I think you're going to do well.
