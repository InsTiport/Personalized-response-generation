 Q.  Thoughts on your position in the tournament after two rounds?  
JOOST LUITEN: I'm happy.  7-under after two days, and I think that's a good score.  I played some solid golf over the last two rounds.  No bogeys today.  I think the key was staying out of trouble here, hitting a lot of fairways, hitting a lot of greens and tried to make a couple putts.  Yeah, I'm happy.   
 Q.  The back end of last year, you weren't quite so happy with the way that the campaign had worked out, so is this a case of starting afresh and getting things back on track?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, I mean, last year wasn't my best year, so for me, the break came in the right time.  I just relaxed at home, worked on my game last week really hard in Dubai, and it's good to see that it's going in the right direction.  Golf is a funny game and little things can turn it around sometimes and hopefully the break has helped me.   
 Q.  What are the little things this time?  You've got a different caddie, but any other changes?  
JOOST LUITEN: I changed to a different ball, which is good.  It's still a Titleist ball but a slightly different one that's got a bit lower launch angle which helps me keep the flight down a bit.  Those little things can just help you a little bit.   
 Q.  I take it, it's always good to start the year in a place like this under, I was going to say, guaranteed sunshine, but you had a long delay this morning?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, it was a long delay but nothing you can do really.  It turned out to be nice in the afternoon.  This course is great and this tournament is great, so I always like to come here.
