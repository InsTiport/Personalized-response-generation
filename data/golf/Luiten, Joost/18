  JOOST LUITEN: It was a good finish, four birdies on the last six holes is always good, so I'm quite happy with that.Q. Were you feeling it was one of those days where it wouldn't quite click and yet stayed patient?JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, I think it was quite tough in the middle part from like 7 to 12.  Played really tough with a lot of crosswinds and into the wind, and then the last four or five playing downwind, so you know, maybe you can get some chances there.  That's what I did.Q. I take it this is what links golf is all about with the winds up like this?JOOST LUITEN: This is great.  The first two days it was a little bit of wind but nothing like today, and it's a good test.  A links course, they need a bit of wind, so it's good to play in it, and it's always good to do well in it.Q. Excited now, because at 10-under you're only one off the current lead?JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, there's a lot of guys out there, so we'll see what it brings us at the end of the day.  But, you know, you need to go out tomorrow and shoot a low score, because there definitely are some low scores out there.Q. Nice for the confidence to know you're competitive and nicely up there?JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, it's always good to know you're up there and always good to go into a Sunday having a chance.  It's a long way but just need to go out and shoot a low one again.
