Q.   How much more comfortable are right now than when you teed up here on Thursday?
JOOST LUITEN:   It always helps if you shoot a low score the first day, takes off a bit of pressure.   You don't really have to fight to make the cut, and you play a bit more freely.   I think that helps on a course like this.   If you're going to swing it, get any scared swings, it's going to bite you, this course, so you have to be‑‑ there's a lot of scary shots out there. 

Q.   Guys that play here all the time say you can birdie any hole or you can double bogey any hole. 
JOOST LUITEN:   Oh, yeah, you can do anything.   Just hit one bad shot in the wrong position and you're going to struggle, so you have to be focused all the time.   Yeah, today I didn't play my best golf, but it was a good fight.   I kept myself in there with some nice putts, and it was really good. 

Q.   You have the rest of the day to relax‑‑
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I'm just going to have some food now, maybe a little bit of putting or whatever, but there's no point in doing a lot of range work straight into the wind.   The swing feels pretty good, so just going to relax, take my rest and be ready for tomorrow.

Q.   Just curious when you look up at the board, knowing what you had for two days over 36 holes, Martin Kaymer, does it feel like you're playing the same tournament?
JOOST LUITEN:   Oh, I mean, I think we did today, but yesterday he did play a different course, I think.   But it shows that on this course if you're right on top of your game, you can make some birdies out there.   I think that's what he did yesterday, and today he just backed it up with a solid 69, I guess, so that's some really good golf here.
