 Q.  8-under par, very satisfied?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, I mean, I'll take it for two days.  Played pretty good today, left a couple out there but made a couple par saves, as well.  I think 5-under was a score I probably deserved today.   
 Q.  What's the story over two days, because you had wind to contend on day one, didn't you?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yes, it was tough in the afternoon.  Looks like it's going to be similar today.  The wind was picking up a little bit towards the end of our round, so I think it's pretty fair in the draw.  Definitely yesterday it was a bit tougher than in the morning.  You just have to make the best of it in the morning rounds I think.   
 Q.  You notice the nature of the course in the morning, as well?  
JOOST LUITEN: The course is in great shape.  The greens are pure in the morning.  I mean, they are pure all day, but in the morning, even better; they are fresh.  You just have to roll in a couple putts.   
 Q.  Like it here?  I think that almost goes without saying.  
JOOST LUITEN: It's a good place.  It's always a good tournament.  The setup is always nice, the way they prepare the course and the conditions of the course and the weather.  So what more do you want.   
 Q.  Speaking in the course of The Desert Swing, you said there are positives and the game is moving sweetly in the right direction?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, I've been playing well.  Fifth place in Abu Dhabi and 13th last week.  Those are good results, and see if we can do better this week.  My game is feeling very good, so hopefully we can have a good weekend and see what happens.   
 Q.  Positives to build on, aren't there, at the start of the season?  
JOOST LUITEN: That's what you want, so I'm happy.
