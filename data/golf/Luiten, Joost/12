 Q.  Thoughts on day two in tricky conditions again?  
JOOST LUITEN: The wind was up already early, so it was tough from the beginning.  But I played well, 2-under on my front nine, which is good.   
And then the back nine, I made a couple mistakes, didn't really need to do that but sometimes it happens.  And a bogey on 8, the par 3, which is a very tough hole.  I missed the green and then you're going to struggle to make par.  All in all, a good day.   
 Q.  Are the nines playing any different to each other?  
JOOST LUITEN: I feel like the back nine is playing a little bit easier because holes like 15, 16, 14, 18 are playing downwind so they are not really tough.  Playing into the wind, they become really, really tough.   
I feel like this is the wind that plays pretty much the easiest for this course, but there are still some tough holes like 17, 13, 12, but it's a good test.   
 Q.  Certainly some weeks, some tournaments we play, where we think that kind of score, it just stood still.  Here in a sense, that's a nice move, isn't it?  
JOOST LUITEN: Anything under par, you move, you pretty much move forward.  It's just a very tough, demanding golf course and it shows you again that today, I shot 1-under, and you basically keep your position.  A lot of guys yet to play and we'll see what happens at the end of the day.
