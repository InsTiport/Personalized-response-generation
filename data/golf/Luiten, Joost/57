 Q.   A lovely start?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Good score to start with, and, yeah, quite enjoyed it out there.   
   
 Q.   As the rain has fallen, it's been a little bit tricky?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It was a bit tricky, a bit rainy, a bit windy, but I think if you can avoid the bunkers on this course, yeah, you can make a decent score.   
   
 Q.   And that's what you've been doing, you've been finding the fairways, finding nice opportunities?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I hit some good drives, find the fairways and then from there, you can go for the pins.   Yeah, you have to take advantage of the holes that you've played down winds, and, yeah, I've made some nice birdies [].  
   
 Q.   You're too young to know what this course was like seven years ago but you can appreciate‑‑  
JOOST LUITEN:   I heard the stories from the other guys, but I wasn't here, so I mean, I think they have done a great job on preparing the course, and it plays nice and firm on the fairways, so you get some roll on the ball.  
   
 Q.   You have some roll on your form at the moment, one week to the next, it's easy?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I've been doing all right the last few weeks.   My game feels all right, and just try to make a good score every day I go out, and that's all you can do I think.
