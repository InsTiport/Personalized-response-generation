 Q.  Well-played, 5-under par, nice start. How do you feel about the opening day?  
JOOST LUITEN: I mean, I'm happy with the score. It's a very tough, demanding, long golf course, narrow. You've got to hit some shots out there. I I had a nice start, 3-under after five, and that gets me going. It was nice to make a couple more on the back nine.   
 Q.  What did you say after the start to try to keep that momentum and push on from there?  
JOOST LUITEN: Yeah, played a bit safe, so you've got to take it from the fairway, and then you can be aggressive. You've just got to create some chances and hopefully hole some putts.   
 Q.  It's a classic sort of tree-lined, parkland course. How high do you rate it?  
JOOST LUITEN: I think it's really good. It's one of these old school golf courses. They lengthened it a bit over the years, which makes it a really, really long golf course, as well. It's a lot of fun to play. You have to really maneuver the ball off the tee. I like it.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your season to this point, and obviously some big events upcoming?  
JOOST LUITEN: I had a good start of the season, and I got cold in the summertime. So hopefully we can have a hot, hot finish to the season. Some big tournaments coming up, if I just keep playing like I did today, I'll be fine.   
 Q.  Did you change your mentality at all for the Rolex events?  
JOOST LUITEN: No, you've got to take the course as it is. You've got to wait for your chances and you've got to play your game the way you see it, the golf course. That's what I've done today and I think that's what you need to do, but of course it's good to play well in a Rolex Series Event.
