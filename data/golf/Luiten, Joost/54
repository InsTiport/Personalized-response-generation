 Q.   Your thoughts on second place this week?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Well, all in all, a good week.   Second place is always good, but I mean, if you go in the last round as the leader, you want to have more, but sometimes you can't.   
And I think I need to be happy with a second place, so I am.   
   
 Q.   Hard work the final round, wasn't it?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it was really a battle against the elements.   Wind, rain, everything.   And then you need to stay patient.   I just didn't hole any putts.   
You have to stay patient, because if you're going to be impatient, you're going to make mistakes and then you'll be out of the tournament, so I thought I would just keep myself in there and hopefully I can finish it off with some birdies at the end.   The 3‑putt on 16 was a bit too much.   
   
 Q.   I daresay you saw the leaderboards and you knew what Paul Casey was doing?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, he had a great round going.   If you're in those conditions, I think he was 3‑ or 4‑under for the round.   That's unbelievable golf.   If he shoots 3‑ or 4‑under, he out played everybody; well done to him.
