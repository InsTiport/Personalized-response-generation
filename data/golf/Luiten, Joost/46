  JOOST LUITEN:   I think in the afternoon, we played pretty well.   We didn't make a lot of mistakes.   We made maybe one bogey, I can't even remember.   And we made some nice birdies, especially coming to the end and hit some unbelievable shots. 

Q.   One was a tap‑in for you‑‑
JOOST LUITEN:   It was a really important one to go 2‑up instead of only one coming down the stretch.   To hit that shot at that moment was unbelievable, yeah. 

Q.   What is it about the two of you that's worked so well, not only four‑ball, but foursomes when you've played the one ball? 
JOOST LUITEN:   I think our games are pretty similar as well.   We hit it about the same length and we both hit to hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and make a lot of putts.   I think that team, if we didn't play together, you don't play any other shots than you normally do, and I think that makes us a good team.
