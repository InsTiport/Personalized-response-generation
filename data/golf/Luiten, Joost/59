  JOOST LUITEN:   It's a good round today.   It was tough.   There was a lot of wind.   But I played solid, especially in the beginning, just made some pars, and then the putter got warm and I rolled in some nice birdie putts on the back nine and some nice par saves, as well. 
So 5‑under, yeah, I'm quite happy with that.   If I can keep that going, I'll sign for it today if I can sign for 6‑under.   But we'll see tomorrow, last day, and one more day to focus before we can take some time off.   So we'll see tomorrow. 

Q.   It does put you in a very nice position, doesn't it, and I suppose a 66 would have you top three, top five?
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I'm not really looking forward to what score I'm going to make.   I'm just going to go out and try to shoot the best score that I can and then we'll see tomorrow afternoon what that brings me. 
I mean, there's no point in counting on anything really.   It's just that you have to go out and play as good as you can. 

Q.   But it's good, isn't it, knowing that you're in this elite field, the final one of season and you're right in the mix with a chance on the final day.
JOOST LUITEN:   It feels good, really good, and hopefully we can take the feeling to the course.
