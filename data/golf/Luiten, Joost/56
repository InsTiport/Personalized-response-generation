 Q.   How did today compare to the opening day?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It was tough today.   Definitely a bit tougher today, more wind, slightly different direction, as well.   But again I played nicely and just made a few mistakes on the greens, that's all.     
   
 Q.   Little bit more of a sense of holding it together today?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Well, there are some really tough holes to play into the wind, and the downwind holes you can really make a good score on them.   
Yeah, into the wind, you have to make pars and downwind you can really create some birdie chances.   I mean, I think there's still some low scores out there today.  
   
 Q.   Nice to play with Peter Uihlein when you're both obviously in terrific form?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it's always fun to play with Peter.   He's been playing good lately, I've been playing all right, and we have done all right in the last two rounds.  
   
 Q.   Do you feed off each other in that circumstance?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Well, you try.   When you see somebody making birdies, you always try to feed off that.   Sometimes it's tough.   You still have to hit the shot yourself, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.   
   
 Q.   Give us an indication of where you are on that board and expectations with some maybe dodgy weather?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I'm 7â€‘under total at the moment.   I think the afternoon, it's maybe a little bit tougher than the morning round today, so slightly advantage there for the morning guys, but, it's only halfway, and there's a lot of golf to be played.   We'll see what happens in the weekend.
