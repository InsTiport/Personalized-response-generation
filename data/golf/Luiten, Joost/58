  JOOST LUITEN:   Quite happy, it was a good day.   Just a shame of a few mistakes out there today.   It could have been a really, really low score.   I think 5‑under today, it's been pretty good.

Q.   Concentrate on the positives, there were nine birdies out there. 
JOOST LUITEN:   Nine birdies.   I played well, hit it close and rolled in some nice putts, as well.   I played really good, so nine birdies is always good.   But double‑bogeys and two other bogeys were a bit unnecessary, but that's golf. 
It played a bit longer.   It was wet, greens were softer and a little bit slower.   But I think if you hit the fairways, you can still be very positive with the iron shots and try to hit them close.

Q.   We know the mantra in this game, you always have to stay in the present, but you could have back‑to‑back victories here?
JOOST LUITEN:   It's still far away.   We'll see what the other guys do on the course.   There are a few holes left for them.   But, good position to go into the Sunday I think.   Hopefully we can make nine birdies tomorrow. 

Q.   What is necessary, more of the same, just without the errors? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I think that's the plan.   Birdies are good, just keep the mistakes off the card.
