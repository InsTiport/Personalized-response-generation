 Q.   It's been an extremely long day, the disappointment of this morning somewhat tempered by finishing third?  
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, it was the best I could do this week.   Lost this morning, so then you want to get the most out of it so happy I won that game.  
   
 Q.   Wind blew a lot harder, didn't it?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It was tough.   Especially on the greens, I thought it was tough reading and trying to see how much the wind was going to affect the putt.   It was tricky and that's why I don't think there were as many birdies today as the other days.  
   
 Q.   Have you enjoyed the experience of being in match play?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I love it.   It's a great format and great experience to go all the way to Sunday and I learned a lot again and I'll be back in the future.   
   
 Q.   And of course we're he is enclosing in on The Race to Dubai, your thoughts as we head towards the season finale?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I think it's a good week for me on the Order of Merit and the World Rankings, so we'll see what happens.   Try to stay in the Topâ€‘10 and move up a couple spots.   Weeks like this help.
