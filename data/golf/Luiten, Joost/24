 Q.   27 birdies and an eagle in 64 holes.   I think you'd better explain yourself?  
JOOST LUITEN:   What can I say?   It's match play, you can be aggressive.   The course is playing soft so I think a lot of the boys out there are having a lot of birdies and you really have to make birdies to win holes.   A lot of times you make birdie and you only halve the hole.   You have to be aggressive and stay aggressive in this format and I've done that well in the last couple days.   
   
 Q.   Couple of big ones for you.   How valuable are they this week?  
JOOST LUITEN:   You want to play as little holes as you can.   The less, the better.   But at the end of the day it's match play and you can win a couple and lose them, as well.   You just try to keep the pressure on and keep hitting the right shots and hitting them close and try to make birdies and hopefully your match is over quick.   But you never know what happens.  
   
 Q.   You came into this event with a win and two top 5s in your last four starts.   Is that the best you've ever played in a consistent run?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I'm just playing really consistent.   I'm solid off the tee, hitting the fairways and then from there you can be aggressive to the pins, hitting my irons nicely, as well.   And making some putts.   That's what you have to do is make the putts and I've done that really good on these good greens here.  
   
 Q.   How excited to have a chance to win this iconic championship tomorrow?  
JOOST LUITEN:   First, another game tomorrow morning before you have you have a chance maybe in the afternoon.   Just take every game, you have to be focused and you have to hit the right shots and make birdies and hopefully we can do that in the morning and see what happens after that.
