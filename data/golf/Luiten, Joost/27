 Q.   Joost, describe your emotions for us coming through what was a very tight match in the end?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It was a tight match.   I was 1‑down with four to go and I think, well, just have to win two out of the last four, and it's always good when you do that and we were 1‑up on the 18th.   It's been just a good match.   
We had a good start.   I think I was like 5‑under after six and I was only 1‑up.   This format, you just have to make birdies or else you're not going to win your match.   He made a couple mistakes at the end, which basically helped me a little bit and it always good to win the first match.  
   
 Q.   You guys are used to pressure and cope with it very well; how does it feel here?   
JOOST LUITEN:   It feels good to go down those last two or three holes and play under pressure and pull off the shots.   It's a bit weird to do it on a Wednesday but the more you can play under pressure, the better player you are going to be.   So it's a good experience and that's why it's so much fun to play match play.   
   
 Q.   Your first time in this iconic event.   Is it one you've always wanted to play?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I love to play match play and we don't have many events we play match play in.   It's one of the tournaments that I really looked forward to play in and it's a good start of this week and hopefully can keep it going.
