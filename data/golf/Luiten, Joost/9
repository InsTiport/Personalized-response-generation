Q. You've made quite a few appearances in Morocco.  Is this a week you look forward to on the calendar?
JOOST LUITEN: Yes, especially on this course.  I love this track.  It's a very narrow, tree-lined golf course where every aspect of the game gets tested.  You've got to be driving the ball really well and you've got to be in position for going into the greens all the time, and it's just a very demanding golf course and I love coming here.
Q. You're in good form this year with a win already to your name in Oman.  Would be great to make it two, wouldn't it?
JOOST LUITEN: I would love it make it two.  I had a little rest.  I had a little injury with my wrist, so hopefully that's all good and I can look for the second win and this would be a nice week to do it.  This is a course that hopefully I can play my game and it should suit me.
Q. What's the biggest test around here?
JOOST LUITEN: I think driving.  If you hit the fairways, you can be pretty aggressive to the flags.  If you start missing flags, especially this year, new greens, firm greens, quite undulating greens, as well, you can be aggressive.  So you have to be in the fairway to attack the flags so hopefully we can hit some fairways this week.
Q. What's your goals for the rest of the year?
JOOST LUITEN: Looking for that second win and hopefully Ryder Cup is right there.  But I just take it week-by-week.  I want to play as good as I can every week.  If I can't win, I want to finish second.  But if I focus on that, the rest will take care of itself and hopefully I can go up the World Rankings a little bit and get back in the Top-50.  That's the goal.
