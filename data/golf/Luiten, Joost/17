  JOOST LUITEN: I started, I was 2-over after eight holes, so I had to catch up a little bit.  Luckily I made a couple birdies coming in.  But it felt like I left a couple out there early in the beginning.Q. It's a tricky old day in the winds.JOOST LUITEN: It was very tricky.  The course was tough. The wind was strong and a lot of crosswinds and stuff like that.  It was fairly tough.  I tried to stay patient and luckily that paid out a little bit on the back nine.  But what I said, I feel like I left a couple out there.Q. And you take pride staying in there, getting the patience going, especially with next week in mind?JOOST LUITEN: That was the case for today.  Stay patient and basically chances to play yourself into this tournament after plus one after the first day, you can't complain too much.  It was a good week and unfortunately I couldn't finish it today.Q. You played alongside Rickie Fowler.  What are your impressions of his shot in there at the last?JOOST LUITEN: He played some incredible golf out there today.  On the front nine, he didn't play great but his short game was very sharp.  And on the back nine, he just stepped up and he did it.  Finishing with a birdie like that on 18, that's how you win tournaments.
