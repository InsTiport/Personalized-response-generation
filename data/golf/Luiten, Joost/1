Q. A 65, 5-under. Quick start, birdie eagle many, how was that?
JOOST LUITEN: It was nice. I hit a long putt on 10 and then a chip-in for eagle on 11. That's the start you're hoping for. It gets you right in there and I played nicely today. The only two bogeys, that was a bit disappointing, but for the rest, a good round.
Q. With such a small field, not disparity with the starts, so everyone has the same conditions. How was it?
JOOST LUITEN: It was beautiful. This is the weather you want all day when you play golf: Not a whole lot of wind, 25 degrees, nice golf course, nice place, nice hotel. It's just a lovely place to come this time of year.
Q. What are the positives you're taking out of round one?
JOOST LUITEN: There are a lot of good things. I putted nicely. I drove the ball good. I hit some good iron shots, so a lot of positive things and I'm just trying to do the same tomorrow and see where that brings me.
