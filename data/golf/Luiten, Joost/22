 Q.   Joost, obviously bitterly disappointed to lose in a semifinal, took you to the 13th to get a first birdie today.   What was the difference out there?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I didn't make any putts.   I didn't really hit them close.   A little bit unlucky a couple times, like on 5, hit the pin and almost spin on the green and only making pars hitting it stiff.   Didn't make any putts coming down the stretch and Mikko made a couple nice ones and that was the difference today.   My game wasn't 100 per cent sharp.  
   
 Q.   Very close in the end, almost right down to the 18?  
JOOST LUITEN:   I think was 1‑up and five to go but gave 4 away with a 3‑putt from the edge of the green, and then he holes a good putt on 15 and I missed my birdie putt.   Those little things, they can turn around a game and that's what happened today for him.   
Yesterday that was my day and today just went his way and he hit some nice putts at the end and well done to him.   
   
 Q.   Is it an advantage going straight back out there to put right when went wrong this morning?  
JOOST LUITEN:   We'll see what happens.   Disappointed at the moment so we'll see.   Nothing to lose in the afternoon.   Third or fourth place, not the place you want to play for but it has to be done.   Go out and see what happens.
