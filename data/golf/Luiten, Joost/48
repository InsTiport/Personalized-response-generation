  GREGORY BOURDY:   It's going to be a good round for us, and we did the job.   We missed unfortunately a few putts maybe to win before, but that's golf and that's match play and they did the job at the end to almost share the match but I think we are happy to get another point today.

Q.   Do you feel the support here? 
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, I feel a bit‑‑ yeah, my families and friends and some people from Saint‑Nom‑la‑BretÃ¨che so I hope this week there will be more people to follow this great game. 

Q.   Is that helping you as well? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Of course, it always helps if you feel the crowd behind you and that was definitely the case the last two days so it's always good to play with a Frenchman here.
