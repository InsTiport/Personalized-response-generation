 Q.   Joost, 1‑down after five holes and you won five of the next six; is that the power of momentum?   
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, I went on a little run after that.   I birdied 6.   He bogeyed 7, so got two back there and then I made three about birdies from 9, 10, 11 and I won all three holes.   That's what you need to have sometimes in match play, go on a little run and win a couple holes and that's what I did today.  
   
 Q.   Your first time in this championship; what were your expectations coming in?  
JOOST LUITEN:   In match play it's always hard to have expectations.   You just take it day‑by‑day and make a lot of birdies in this format.   I've been playing well but if you play against somebody that makes nine or ten birdies, then you're out or you lose.   So you just have to go out and do your best and hopefully that's enough.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on Graeme McDowell tomorrow, defending champion?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It's a tough one.   He's one of the best match players I think at the moment.   But it's going to be a fun day.   I'm just going to go out there and try to make some birdies and hopefully I can beat him.
