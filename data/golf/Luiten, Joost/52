Q.   Nice fourth place finish in the end? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, fourth plays good, but if you look at how I played, especially the first nine today, I had some chances for birdie and I just didn't make my putts and that's why I stayed behind the leaders a bit, a bit too far for my liking, but fourth place at the end is a decent week.

Q.   Looks like you were getting there and just didn't quite make it happen, 11 straight pars. 
JOOST LUITEN:   That's the thing, I hit the ball pretty good today.   In this wind, it was tough, but you have to make the putts on the greens and I just didn't do that; fourth instead of higher up.

Q.   Frustrating but at the same time, you take it on the chin, move on. 
JOOST LUITEN:   Well, frustrating, especially when you're out there, you really want to make the putts now after the round, you think, well, it's been a decent week and have to move on and wait for my chances in another week, and this is just not my week, and then we'll move on.

Q.   And there are plenty of other weeks and plenty of good ones to come? 
JOOST LUITEN:   Yeah, there are plenty of good weeks coming up and some nice weeks I know I can play well in, as well.   We'll see what happens and if I can keep this good form and make some putts on the Sunday, then I'll be holding the trophy soon.

Q.   While it is a long, long way to go, you have some points on The Ryder Cup list. 
JOOST LUITEN:   Well, that's always good to have a good start, but, it's what you say, it's a long way, so we'll see and we just need to play good every week.
