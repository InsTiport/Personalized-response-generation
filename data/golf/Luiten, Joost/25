 Q.   Joost, 3‑down through eight holes against one of the formidable match‑play players in the world.   How does it feel to come through that one?  
JOOST LUITEN:   It's always hard when you're 3‑down after eight, but you know you have ten more holes and you just try to get back on your game and hit some good shots and win some holes back and luckily that happened for me today.  
   
 Q.   Always a turning point and key moment and seemed to us it was 15.   You hit a poor approach from 15 and holed a big putt to win the hole?  
JOOST LUITEN:   15 was the first par 5 I won.   I gave three par 5s away to him.   I thought just make a birdie and you win a hole, and it's always nice when a putt goes in.   I missed a short one on 14 before that.   Those points, sometimes you need them to go in and get some momentum going.   He missed a couple short ones on 16 and 17 and then the match is going your way.   
   
 Q.   I think you're playing Pablo LarrazÃ¡bal tomorrow, very complicated at this stage, but pretty sure you are.   
JOOST LUITEN:   Another match play day, anything can happen and I think that showed today.   You just have to go out there again and make some birdies and I think it will be an exciting match again.
