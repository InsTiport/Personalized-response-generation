 Q.  Take me through Mr. Romero's play on 18. 
  TOM DUDLEY: His tee shot landed in the fairway bunker to the right side of the drive zone. When he tried to hit out of there his stance was on the drain in the bunker, actually on the grass. 



 The drain itself was not in the hazard itself.  But because he was on the obstruction, he had a right to relief. 
 He took relief.  No closer to the hole.  He dropped it within a club length of the nearest point of relief.  It rolled closer to the hole twice, therefore he then placed it the second time where it first, it last hit the ground.  So under Rule 24-2 he took the relief there. 
 Then he hit his ball, skulled it kind of into the left fairway bunker. 
 And from there he hit it into the hazard, lateral water hazard in front of green and then he took relief from there with the one stroke penalty under 26-1 C.  Hit it on the green in five and 2-putted for a seven. 

 Q.  What were his options in terms of dropping within the boundaries of the hazard? 
  TOM DUDLEY: Okay, he cannot drop it. If you take relief from the hazard or a water hazard you have to take relief outside the hazard. His options would have been to play the ball as it is, to take the point where it last crossed the margin of the hazard and either go two club lengths on either side or go back as far as he wanted to. Or go back, stroke and distance, where it was in the bunker. 



 We didn't feel like there was an opposite margin under that rule that he could take it from there.  So he took the option that he would drop it at the point where it last crossed the margin of the hazard. 

 Q.  So dropped it outside the margin of the hazard? 
 TOM DUDLEY:  No, right, he dropped outside the hazard.
