 Q.   Good start right out of the gates.   
JASON DUFNER:   Always nice to birdie the first two holes, pretty solid day, hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.   Probably could have played the par 5s a little bit better but other than that pretty solid day.  
   
 Q.   Did the wind get you at No. 6, the par5?   
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, that was surprising, it was 230 to the front and hit a 3‑wood pretty solid.   In hindsight, you would like to maybe lay up there in that situation, but I was feeling good with how I was playing, probably cost me one or two shots, so a good bogey.   
   
 Q.   What is the mind‑set on the tee, are you just looking for the fairway every time?  
JASON DUFNER:   Yeah, right now I'm feeling really good with my swing.   I can hit whatever shots I need to, draw, low, high.   I'm hitting the ball pretty good off the tee.   
   
 Q.   We talked about it yesterday, the first two days are good days for you.   Now, what do you do different going into tomorrow, if anything?   
JASON DUFNER:   Probably about fourth or fifth time I've played the golf course, going into the weekend, the golf course will change a little bit and I know a little bit more what to expect.   
   
 Q.   We have known you for a few years now, are you churning inside?  
JASON DUFNER:   Maybe ail lit bit but not too much.   Just out there working, doing my job and staying in the moment and trying to hit good shots.   The excitement will come trying to win this tournament.   For me it's just out there working and being in the moment and try to focus on what I'm doing.
