 Q.  You played a really good round of golf today, but your journey to the LPGA hasn't been an easy one.  You were on the tour in 2015, didn't keep your card, went to Symetra.  What's going to be different this time around for you?  
MARISSA STEEN: I'm really more comfortable and confident out here.  Last time I was hurt to start in 2015.  Made a couple cuts early but had kind of a rough go after that and really lost a lot of confidence out on the golf course.   
So going back to Symetra last year really helped me regain that confidence back.  Now that I am out here again I know the ropes, what to expect week in and week out, so I feel so much more comfortable.   
 Q.  What about this type of golf course?  Playing in Ohio, from Memphis.  This isn't really your normal kind of course.  How is this different for you?  
MARISSA STEEN: Actually, this type of course reminds me a lot of the course I play back home.  Quite a bit elevation change a lot of carries, and some big greens.  So actually it does remind me a lot of Ohio golf, at least the part of Ohio that I'm from.   
The ball isn't going quite as far as last week, so that was that an adjustment.  The greens I play back home have quite a bit of poana in them as well, so I actually feel very comfortable out here.
