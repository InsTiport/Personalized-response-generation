 Q.  When you can have a 4-under round, especially three days in it, I would imagine a round like that at this point gets the ball rolling more so when you need it to.  
MARISSA STEEN: Yeah, for sure. I felt like the first round was kind of all over the place. I had an eagle, I had a triple. It just felt like kind of rusty even though it hasn't been that long since Dallas.   
And then yesterday was a lot more solid. Just didn't really hit many close; rolled it well. Today I felt like I put it all together, so that was good.   
 Q.  Is there maybe a little more emphasis on tomorrow being the last day before transitioning to a new course?  
MARISSA STEEN: I don't think so. I still view it like we have five rounds left, you know, with it being a running total and all. So, no.   
I definitely feel like I've been more comfortable with this course every day, so I'm excited for tomorrow.   
 Q.  That's good.  
MARISSA STEEN: Yeah.   
 Q.  What's the feel out here just among everybody?  
MARISSA STEEN: Actually I feel like it's been really chill, like super relaxed all week, which has been nice.   
Yeah, I mean, I felt really comfortable. Like I said, I love the golf course. I love Carolina's golf. I like the look of it. The course is in fantastic shape, so it's been good.
