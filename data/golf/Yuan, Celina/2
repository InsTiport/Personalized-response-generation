Q. What was working for you?
CELINA YUAN: I think my putting was pretty decent today compared to my other rounds.  Iron play, I only missed three greens, which is okay.  Yeah, that's about it.
Q. Do you know your stats, like how many putts and stuff like that?
CELINA YUAN: I don't know exact number of putts.
Q. It's the first time you've played this golf course?
CELINA YUAN: Yeah, I didn't have a practice round.  I flew in from Q-School where I played very badly, and I guess I just learned from my mistakes in that tournament and tried to get it right in this one.
Q. So you're only 17, right?
CELINA YUAN: 18.  Nearly 19.
Q. How has the year been going?  You haven't played that many events but have you been playing elsewhere or just on the LET?
CELINA YUAN: I've played a couple China tour events.  I've got a half-card there.  And I played a couple on the LET which didn't go so well for me this year.
Q. Yeah, why has it suddenly clicked for you here?
CELINA YUAN: I think hard work and a lot more experience.
Q. Any goals this week, like you could win here?
CELINA YUAN: Goals, I just want to play the best I can.  I'm not too worried about what number I'm at.  Just go as low as possible.
Q. Were you going to go back to Q-School or not?
CELINA YUAN: No, I won't be.  I'll most likely be playing on Symetra.  I got into the final stage and that pretty much guarantees you in Symetra full status.
Q. So you're planning to make in America next year?
CELINA YUAN: Yeah.
Q. What about your heritage, is it Chinese?
CELINA YUAN: Yeah, Chinese.
Q. So that's why you like playing in China, as well?  Do you speak Chinese?
CELINA YUAN: I can speak a little Chinese so I can get around there.
Q. Mandarin?
CELINA YUAN: Mandarin yeah.  Not great but I can get by.
