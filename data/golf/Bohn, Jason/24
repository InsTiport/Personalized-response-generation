  JASON BOHN:   I played really well, but playing with Roberto was just so simple.   I mean, he hit it a foot every hole it felt like, so you were like, well, I guess we can hit it close.   He showed‑‑ and it kind of rubbed off on us actually.   It kind of rubbed off on me.   I felt like I hit some good shots on the front nine and so made a few putts and it was great.  
   
 Q.   How did the golf course play out there?  
JASON BOHN:   You know, no wind, early tee time, a little softer.   I spun the first one off the green on No.10 with a wedge and I just was not expecting that.   So it was‑‑ I mean, we all said we're in trouble now, though; Roberto is shooting 63, they're going to suck the moisture out of these bad boys tonight.  
   
 Q.   The double on No.18, what turned it around for you?  
JASON BOHN:   The double at 18 wasn't‑‑ I hit a shot coming out of the rough, it ran across the green, rolled into the water and then I'm 90 feet away.   That's not an easy tough‑putt out here.   I didn't really hit a bad shot there, I just didn't hit any good ones, either.   So that kind of adds up.   
I hit a nice little shot into No.1, had about probably six feet, and that kind of just got my momentum going.   I really didn't play the par‑5s well today.   I only birdied one of them and I was in position in all of them.   So that's a little disappointing.
