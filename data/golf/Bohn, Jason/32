 Q. Long day, long week. We've talked a lot with you. Just your feelings as you're heading into not quite the final round yet, but finish the third round and then the final round? 
 JASON BOHN: Another long day. Yeah, it's going to be -- we're going to play, I think, I have 30 holes to play or something tomorrow. 
 So we've just got to stay patient. That is the thing. You have to wait for your opportunities out here. So another long day. Just got to keep your energy up and your spirits high for sure. 

 Q. You told us the other day that you like Sundays. It's kind of like sneaking up and so forth. So you've got to feel good about where you are coming into Sunday, not necessarily coming from behind but you've got to feel good about it. 
 JASON BOHN: Yeah, absolutely. I feel good the way I've played golf this two and a half days. So I've hit some good shots today. 
 Kind of the start of my third round I kind of hit a couple of loose shots. I think it's a little fatigue. It's a little I wasn't mentally focused on where I needed to be. So good night's rest, good meal, and I think tomorrow will be a completely different day. 
 If you can get it rolling, it's great. You can just restart, go right back out and keep hitting it, so, yeah. If I can get it going.
