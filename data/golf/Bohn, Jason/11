  JASON BOHN:   Go through the horseshoe bend and birdie all three of those.   I played very aggressive and I hit a lot of high-quality shots and I had some opportunities.   I didn't hit my best shots coming down the stretch so that was a little bit disappointing.   But I made a great putt on 18 to try to get to 12 and it just lipped out.   All in all, I'm thrilled, very pleased.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like your one hiccup came on 15.   If you can just take me through that?  
    JASON BOHN:   Yeah, I mean, to be honest, these bunkers are perfect with all the rain.   I was trying to push a fairly aggressive line with an 8-iron out of there and, I mean, a hundred percent honest, I didn't hit a good shot.   I hit it thin, I kind of grabbed onto it as I was coming into it so I choked.   I mean, really.   But then the next shot, I mean, the ball only went about two feet after it came back and rolled in front of me so that was probably a more difficult shot, but I took a much less aggressive line, just tried to suck it up, make my bogey and go on.  
   
 Q.   What can you draw from today, though?   To put together a 63 in a final round, you weren't doing much this week and then you finish just one shot out.  
    JASON BOHN:   Yeah, I actually played really well all week, believe it or not, for me.   I was hitting my ball in the fairway and I was hitting some good iron shots.   Yesterday coming in I hit some great golf shots and I just didn't capitalize on the putts.   But yeah, you can take a lot away from a round like this just knowing if you get kind of in contention that you're still giving yourself a chance.   I knew I had to put my foot on the pedal.   I knew nobody was going to back up.   It's playing fairly easy right now.
