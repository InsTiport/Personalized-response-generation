Q. You thought you had it there on 18?
JASON BOHN: I did, yeah.  I thought the putt was breaking right down into it.  I left myself -- I hit a very poor golf shot, and I stood over that golf shot and told myself just swing the golf club and I kind of gouged it back in there, you know, because you're thinking don't go left because you lose the tournament.
But I really wish I could stand back in the fairway and make one more swing firing at that flag.  I think I'd have a better chance.  But I hit the best putt I could possibly hit, and it almost went in, so it was good.
Q. All in all, how would you assess this week?
JASON BOHN: Yeah, great.  I played really well last week and kind of carried it over to this week.  To come around today, the golf course obviously wasn't playing as tough today as it was yesterday.  I think the flags were a little bit more accessible, and we saw some extremely low scores earlier today.  But I'm happy.  I'm happy where I am, so I'm going to take a week off and then get right back at it.
