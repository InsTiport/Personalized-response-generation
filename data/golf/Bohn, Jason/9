 Q.  You just point and shoot and go right at it.  Pretty solid striking today.  
JASON BOHN: Yeah, I hit the ball nicely today.  For me not being a long hitter, I'm hitting long irons into some of these par-4s.  It's a pretty good golf course for me.  Today was about as benign as you're going to see it.  There wasn't a lot of breeze.  So it's out there.   
 Q.  I think the big thing like at 8 where you're back there a ways, but you were all ready to throw it back to the flag stick with the conditions.  That would have been hard if it was firmer conditions.  
JASON BOHN: Yeah, normally I'd have to land something 20, 30 feet short of the hole and try to run it back in there.  I think you're going to see a phenomenal golf score this afternoon.   
 Q.  What do you think these guys that have played well, do you think someone can shoot 63, 62, I don't know about that.  The golf course is gettable, and it's set up nicely.  
JASON BOHN: It is gettable and it is set up very nicely.  You've got to hole some putts.  But I think it's possible to see that record be broken.
