 Q.  You played the front nine as your second nine and strung some birdies together, and a great way to start the tournament.  
JASON BOHN: Yeah, it was great.  I played really nice today.  And when I missed the greens, I missed them in the right spots and was able to get up and down.  I only made one bogey, and that's pretty good around this place.   
 Q.  Tell me how encouraging it is to go out and play such a solid initial round at this tournament?  
JASON BOHN: This is really pretty big for me.  I've been working pretty hard at things.  So just to see a little positive stuff in my game was awesome for me.  This is a big momentum booster for me, personally.   
 Q.  Talk about the first round.  You've got to be happy where you're sitting heading into tomorrow?  
JASON BOHN: Yeah, it's Round 1.  But to make five birdies and only one bogey, I played pretty nicely.  I missed my golfball in the right places and that's what it's all about here at Harbour Town.  I was able to get up and down when I missed greens and hit a lot of fairways, and hit a lot of quality golf shots.   
 Q.  The course changed a little bit because of the hurricane.  They added some trees, took away some trees.  Did you notice any difference out there?  
JASON BOHN: Well, this is the best shape I've ever seen Harbour Town in the last 15 years.  It's amazing.  I think some of the removal of the trees helped the quality of the turf.  I think they got some more sunlight, some more air flow.  Some of the marquee trees like on No. 9 and a couple of the trees on 10, we really did notice a significant difference.  So I think those two holes might play a shade easier than the past.  The rest of them, the trees are still out there.  Your ball can hit them.  We hit a few today.
