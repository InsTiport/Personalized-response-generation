JASON BOHN: I mean, I think.  I looked at my scorecard when I got done.  I made nine birdies, which is pretty good.   
I think the greens were a little bit more receptive today.  I'm giving my caddie a lot of credit.  He was phenomenal on the greens today.  He was just dead on and he didn't miss and he read every single putt dead right.  If I could hit if where he was telling me to hit it we were making putts.   
 Q.  Just a good, consistent day?  Nothing stood out?  
JASON BOHN: Yeah, no.  I drove my golf ball pretty good, which you have to do around this place, because you're not going to get very close to the hole out of the trees.   
I been kind of doing that all week, progressively getting a little bit better, little bit sharper, feeling a little bit more aggressive.   
 Q.  Last year was one of your best years out on tour, even though you didn't have the wi.  Do you feel like you're due?  
JASON BOHN: I don't know if you're ever due, but I feel like I just got to keep giving myself a chance to win.  If I have a chance on the back nine on Sunday, that's the goal at the start of the week.   
Then just, you know, as you get older your nerves get a little bit shoddier.  I feel very confident.  I'm just going to go swing the club freely and play tomorrow.   
 Q.  What do you think is going to happen tomorrow if the conditions are calm?  
JASON BOHN: Well, really depends.  Like today the greens held their moisture a little bit more.  I thought they were way more receptive.  If the greens get bouncy like yesterday afternoon, it's difficult to get the ball close, so you got to be really pinpoint on with your irons.   
There are a lot of wedges out here and opportunities to make birdies.  You got to be aggressive.
