Q.  On the final day of a major, with all the pressure that goes with it, do you change your game plan any or do you feel like you have nothing to lose?
JASON BOHN:  I've got absolutely nothing to lose.  If I can play a good solid round, shoot 2  or 3 under par tomorrow and see what happens, that's great.  I'm going to go out and keep smiling and have a lot of fun.
Q.  You're enjoying the experience?
JASON BOHN:  It's unbelievable.  I understand why guys work so hard to get to major championships.  It's been an amazing week so far.
Q.  You like these New York City area fans?
JASON BOHN:  Love them.  I think everybody has got something to say and I love the wittiness.  There's some witty people here.  Yeah, I've heard some great comments out there.
Q.  And the golf course, it must suit your game?
JASON BOHN:  The golf course is probably one of the best golf courses I've ever played in my life.  I mean, it's a major championship golf course.  I can see why they've had so many majors here.  I think you've just got to drive your golf ball really well here, and if you can do that and hole a few putts, you never know what can happen.
Q.  Appreciate your time.  Good luck tomorrow.
JASON BOHN:  Thank you.
