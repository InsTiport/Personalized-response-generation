PAUL ROVNAK:  
On a day like this, what do you do now the rest of the day?
NICOLE PERROT:  The rest of the day?
Q.  Yeah, because you have all this free time now.
NICOLE PERROT:  Relax.  I am going to go work out, running, with the weights, and see what's around the city, and then just relax.
Q.  Just hang out?
NICOLE PERROT:  For sure.
Q.  Did you play today?
NICOLE PERROT:  No, I didn't.  My tee time was at 12:44.
Q.  So are you happy you didn't have to go out in that?
NICOLE PERROT:  Yeah.  Actually I came out here in the morning.  When I came to have breakfast, I saw the weather was really bad and everything.  They surprised me that it wasn't suspended early.

I mean, I did have a hope that we are not going to play today.  So just I am going to work out and hang out and make other arrangements with friends and make other stuff for next week.
