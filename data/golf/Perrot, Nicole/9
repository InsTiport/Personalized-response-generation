NICOLE PERROT: Yes.

Q.  What has been the reaction?

ANDRES PRIETO:  I think golf in Chile is not a popular game, so people  -- there are a lot of people that even didn't know the game, but I mean, all the people that know the game they are very surprised because you know, it's the first person that maybe have played this tournament, I think, for sure in ladies, it's the first person.  I think they are going to be very surprised but they know that Nicole is a very good player, so, maybe they expect something like that.
