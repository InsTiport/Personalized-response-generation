Q.
Tell me a little bit about the match.  Did you take control from the beginning?
NICOLE PERROT:  Yes, I kind of started pretty solid on a couple of holes.  She made a couple of bogeys, and I was 3 up.

I then picked it up again on No. 9 and made a great putt.  I made birdie and she missed it, and I think I kind of picked it up again.  I was up all the time and I was tough, but I really started playing good, and I got her 4 up and she made a couple of bogeys; about that, I real pretty good.
Q.  Do you feel confident about tomorrow?
NICOLE PERROT:  Yeah, I feel pretty good, I want to practice and this and that, but for sure, feel good.
Q.  How was it with the course being wet?
NICOLE PERROT:  Today was wet, a little bit less than yesterday, the greens also were running better than yesterday.  It's not going to play in great condition, but if we get more rain, it will still be okay.
