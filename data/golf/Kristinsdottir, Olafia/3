Q. What are your thoughts on today?  Really solid round?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, thanks.  I always kept it in play and controlled the wind very well.  Yeah, it was definitely tough out there with the wind.  But yeah, we just did our best and it was really good.
Q. What do you like about playing links golf, and how do you manage to keep your calm under these conditions?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: You've just got to accept what you get, and I've had a lot of experience in bad weather in Iceland.  So it's definitely helpful.  Yeah, my coach is also from Scotland, so he gave me a few tips before playing here.
Q. Who is your coach?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: His name is Derrick Moore.  He's actually living in Iceland.
Q. What were some of the tips he gave you about playing in Scotland?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, so it's the shot I've been hitting all week.  It's like half a shot and keeping it low, and then the wind doesn't affect it as much.  It takes the spin off.  So that's been really good.
Q. And if you have a good week this week, you have a chance to play yourself into next week.  Is that something you've been thinking about at all?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, of course.  I unfortunately didn't fulfill the criteria to do the Monday qualifier, so this is my only shot.
Q. Any added motivation for you with that obviously?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, of course.
