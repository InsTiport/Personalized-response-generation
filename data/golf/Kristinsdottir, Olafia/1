Q. Talk to me about today's round.  2-under par.  First LPGA Tour Championship.
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, it was a good round.  I was hitting it really well.  I didn't have the most chances out there today.  I wasn't hitting it that close.  I hit it close a few times, and I took advantage of it and then I made one long putt.
So other than that it was just pretty simple:  fairways and greens.
Q. Was there any part of your game that was working for you in particular today?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I was really happy with my drivers today.  They were really straight and solid.
Q. You have any nerves?  What was the mentality coming into this week?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: So, yeah, I'm not here just to participate.  That's my goal.  I'm here to play well and do my best.
It's hard sometimes as a rookie to just go with it.  I'm here to do something good.
Q. Tell me about your last five or six holes there.  A little bit wild.  Few birdies and couple bogeys.  Anything stand out to you?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: So we were in between on, (indiscernible) like that four-footer what the break was going to do and it wasn't very decisive so I missed that putt.
Q. What hole?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: That was first bogey of the stretch, first bogey of the day.  So then I got a little bit angry or fired up and got two birdies in a row and almost the third one in a row.
Then I got another one, so it definitely helped me get started again to get a little -- wake up a little bit, get back on my toes.
Q. How much confidence does this 2-under round give you?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I'm positive.  Just got to keep on going like this.  Yeah.
Q. And then I guess where do you go from here after this weekend?  What are your plans?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I play in Sandra Gal's charity event and then I go to Iceland to get my Japanese visa fixed, because I have to go to Japan the next week after.
So that will be good.  That's my last event of the year.  Then I'll get some rest and do some physical work but take a little break from golf.
Q. What are you thought about your rookie year?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: It's been very nice.  A great experience and some good playing in there.
Q. What have you learned about playing on the tour this year that you can apply towards improving for next year?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: For example, I've never played so many events in one year, so I learned a lot about that and about reserving energy and those kind of things.
Just overall confidence.  In the beginning of the year I was in need of a little bit of confidence because everything is so new; now I have better confidence.
