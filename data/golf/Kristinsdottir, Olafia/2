Q. Well played out there.  You had a bit of everything:  Wind in the morning, a little bit of sun and then just a little bit of Scottish rain at the end.  But you've posted a 73 which is quite remarkable?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Thanks, it was definitely tough out there.  Especially the last few holes it was really windy, and then the rain started pouring down.  But the start of the round was pretty similar to the other days.
Q. I guess you're not too unused to these conditions growing up in Iceland.  It's only, what, a couple of hundred miles further north?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Yeah, it's definitely similar.  Reminds me of home.
Q. Does that help?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Definitely helps having experience playing in this kind of weather, so yeah.
Q. You're really well placed heading into the final day.  What are your expectations on yourself?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I'm just going to try to play tomorrow just like I played the other days, and it really is about being patient.  Yeah, I mean, anything can happen.
