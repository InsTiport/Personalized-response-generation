Q. Just kind of want to hear your thoughts on your rookie season so far this year.
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I think it's been pretty good.  Like it's been a learning experience.  It's always tough your first year on any tour.  Just adjusting.
I think I'm getting more and more used to it.  Hopefully just be upwards from here.
Q. How are you handling the 12-week stretch we're in right now?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: It's going to be tough because I also have to go to Iceland for some time just to arrange my visa.  So I'm going to have to squeeze that in somewhere, even if I have a tournament that week.
Q. Have you been to this tournament before?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: No.
Q. First time to Canada?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Second time.
Q. What do you think about the course out here?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: I like the layout.  It's cool.  I like the way the greens are rolling.  Yeah, it's a good challenge.
Q. Goals for the week?
OLAFIA KRISTINSDOTTIR: Like I said to him, just always improve, and hopefully improve my best this year.
