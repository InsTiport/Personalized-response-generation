Q. Well-played, great position moving into tomorrow. How would you assess your work out there?
ANDREA PAVAN: Yeah, it was good. Had a good start today. Played very nicely the front nine. Yeah, then I made a couple mistakes but managed to finish it off with a birdie.
Q. What's the key to going low around this golf course?
ANDREA PAVAN: I guess you have to hit it, I guess just like anywhere. You know, it's Darren course. It's got -- because it's pretty wide targets but at the end, you have to pick the right lines and give yourself decent angles into the greens. The greens are not as firm as usual, so you can really attack some of these pins.
The wind picked up a bit more today, so you had to control your ball flight, and then, yeah, just make the putts like usual I guess.
Q. How special is it playing St. Andrews at the Old Course?
ANDREA PAVAN: It's great. I just really enjoyed it today. We had a good time and the weather was nice, and then no rain, so yeah, we just -- hopefully tomorrow will be the same. I'm glad I made the cut with Chris, my partner. We're going to try to enjoy it as well tomorrow.
