Q. Big large here on Sunday, 6-under, 66.  Tell us your thoughts on that.
ANDREA PAVAN: Yeah, very pleased.  I was outside the cut line with nine holes to go on Friday and then had a strong finish, and then played solid yesterday.  Played solid again today.
My iron game was really good, and yeah, just very pleased.  I mean, again, you know, it's a tough course, so any time you go under par out here, it's good.  6-under on a Sunday, it's a great score.
Q. What positives can you take from the week overall?
ANDREA PAVAN: Positive for me, my driving's been good enough.  It's a tight course.  I've been struggling quite a few years now, and coming in this year, I started feeling much better and there's still always room for improvement, but yeah, with not that good of a putter this week, I managed to score under par on this golf course.  So it's very satisfying.
Q. What's the goal now for the rest of the season?
ANDREA PAVAN: Oh, just play week my week.  I mean, I've got Q-School started, so got a good rerank after last week, and just going to try to play every week.  Just give it the same importance and try to do as well as I can, and then, you know, can only control myself.
