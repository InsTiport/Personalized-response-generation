 Q.   Am I right to assume a very satisfied man with a score like that?   
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yes, of course, it was a very good weekend.   I would have taken it.   Today the conditions weren't as easy as yesterday, so to shoot 4‑under was pleasing.  
   
 Q.   The way you started, did you expect even better?   
ANDREA PAVAN:   I started well.   The scores, I made some birdies early on, and then in the middle of the round, I hit a bit of a rough patch.   
But luckily I ended up playing pretty well and hit it very close on 15 and holed like a 9‑footer for eagle, and towards the end, unfortunately I didn't hit it as well, and just walked off with three pars.   But satisfied with a week like this.   Unfortunately I didn't really make a run in the back nine but this is golf.  
   
 Q.   You came mightily close at the last.   
ANDREA PAVAN:   It was kind of an awkward yardage, especially if you don't get a chance to go in two on 18, then you need to lay up.   The lie is very tight and downhill, so I just thought I could get there and it spun back, but hit a really good putt, and needed half a roll to go in.   But that's okay.   
   
 Q.   I take it with your position on Race to Dubai, anything like this is good, another positive going forward?  
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yes, of course, I'm way behind, so I needed to make something happen, and luckily I played well this week.   Hopefully I can carry on this good form into the next four weeks.   Unfortunately last week I didn't have a good Sunday but bounced back this week, so that's pleasing.
