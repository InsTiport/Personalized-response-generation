 Q.   Talk about a good round here to start?  
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yeah it's a good day.   Obviously this course is not very long, but it's definitely tricky.   Greens are pretty firm and rolling nicely.   So I'm pleased.   5‑under, I think it's definitely a good score.  
   
 Q.   You seemed to get the measure of the course very early on with a nice load of birdies out there?  
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yeah, I started off well, hit it close a lot of times on my front nine, starting from 11.   
So I was 4‑under playing pretty flawless, and towards the end, made a few mistakes, but I managed to put a good round in, so I'm pleased.  
   
 Q.   I'm sure it's obvious, but good to be back out on The European Tour again?  
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yeah, obviously it's nice.   I had a tough season check in 2012, but I think it was good for me to go back.   And then worked hard and had a good year this year, and this end of the year, hopefully I can keep playing well.   
My game is pretty solid.   I think my short game is sharp right now, so you know, even if I don't hit as many good shots, I know I can get around the golf course well.   It's a nice feeling to have.   
   
 Q.   Presumably, the way you've played on The Challenge Tour, you're that much more confident and a better player all around.   
ANDREA PAVAN:   Yes, obviously, definitely had a good year, so that brings you confidence.   But you know, you want to always improve, and I know that I'm moving the right direction and you know, it's always nice, as I said, to play well and put some good scores out there.   Obviously it's just the first round, but it's nice to be in contention.
