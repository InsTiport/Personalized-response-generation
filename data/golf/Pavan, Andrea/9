 Q.  Your thoughts on the day?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Overall pleased.  I felt like I hit the ball pretty well.  Couldn't quite get it as close as yesterday but this course is just generally tougher.  So some things were a bit more tucked.  Yeah, overall, I'm pleased.  I mean, I didn't make many putts.  Felt like I rolled it nicely.  Just couldn't quite adjust to the speed.  I left a couple short.  A pity, but that's golf.   
 Q.  9-under yesterday, a fantastic 63.  Was that the difference today, just the putting?  
ANDREA PAVAN: No, not only that.  I mean, yesterday I was giving myself birdie chances from very close.  I hit a lot of shots within seven, eight feet.  But when you putt from 20, 30 feet, the chances of making the putts go drastically down.  But I felt like I was rolling it nicely.  So rolled a few on the lips and just didn't drop.   
Yeah, I missed a couple shots but I was really pleased with eagle on 12.  That was a really good hole.  There was some good positives today.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, strong winds are forecast.  They have changed the draw.  It's a shotgun start.  How is that going to affect your approach?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Yeah, I saw last night checking the weather, it was going to be windy in the afternoon.  But yeah, so this is a bit surprising.  I just read that.  I think I'll just, you know, approach it the same.  I'll figure out where I start, and we'll get the game plan.   
You know, it's pretty much similar as I played on Thursday I think.
