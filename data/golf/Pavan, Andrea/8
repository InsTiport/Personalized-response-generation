 Q.  How well did you play today, no dropped shots?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Yeah, it was very good.  The conditions weren't easy again today.  The wind was up and I started well, and really scrambled a couple of times for par.  But overall, I was very happy.  I was always in play and gave myself a lot of chances.   
 Q.  Carrying on the good form from last week?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Yes, definitely a little bit.  I've been playing pretty well, so yeah, I just told myself to be patient because first couple of days, I felt like I gave away a few shots around the greens.  I feel like most of the field is struggling.  The greens are very tricky and the wind makes it hard.  Yeah, just today was good.   
 Q.  This golf course, these conditions, just how tough can it get?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Yeah, it can get pretty tough.  I think it rained a bit last night again, so luckily the greens were pretty soft.  That makes it easier when hitting approaches.   
But again, the greens are very slopey and you've got some places you really cannot miss, and even just putting from above the hole, it gets very quick.  Yeah, just about getting around and I did a good job today.   
 Q.  First off today, you're going to be a bit later tomorrow.  Are you looking forward to that?  
ANDREA PAVAN: Yes, definitely.  That's what our game is.  Yeah, playing late on Sunday is great.  I look forward to that.
