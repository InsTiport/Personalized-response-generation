 Q.  66 for 15-under, wonderful total.  How do you rate its chances?  
ANDREA PAVAN: I think, I don't know, to be honest.  I just signed my card, and might be one shot.  I don't know what the leaders are doing, but I'm just happy I played solid with what I had.  I knew I had a chance, and I finished -- I gave myself chances, and, you know, I was aggressive on that eagle putt.  I thought 16 was a very good chance.   
I'm happy I made the little 6-footer back down the hill, because it was a tricky one.   
 Q.  What will you do now?  
ANDREA PAVAN: I don't know.  Just, you know, kind of look around and see what is going on, and I guess I have to maybe prepare for in case of a playoff.  I don't know, to be honest, what the leaders are doing; if it's still 15 or somebody made birdie or anything, but yeah.
