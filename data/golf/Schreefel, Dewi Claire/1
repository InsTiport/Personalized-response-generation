 Q.   Perfect hole to do it on.   
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   I know, perfect hole to do it.   I was walking out by 18 and I'm like Oh, my God I've wanted a car.   So it's great.   It's only my second one, so awesome.   
   
 Q.   Second one in life or second one out here?  
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   Yeah, second one in life.  
   
 Q.   Where was the other one?  
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   On the Futures Tour.   The event in Albany.   It was straight uphill so I never saw it.   It was over the green.  
This one I could see.   I hit a perfect shot and I was like, Oh, be good.   I think Suzann yelled, Get in, and then it was in.   It was awesome.  
   
 Q.   Great way to finish up a week?  
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   Definitely.   I mean, you just want to play well on Sunday, move up a little bit, and to take that home is great.  
   
 Q.   What did you hit there?  
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   7â€‘iron.  
   
 Q.   And exactly was your distance?  
DEWI CLAIR SCHREEFEL:   Pete, what was the yardage on 12?   157.  
   
 Q.   Nice.
