   KELLY THESIER: We'd like to welcome Dewi Claire Schreefel to the interview room. First off, congratulations, 5-under today.
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: Thank you. 
 KELLY THESIER: Can you just take me through the round a little bit, and some key holes for you that got you to tied for the lead? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: Started on the back nine, so just got off to a solid start and made, I think three birdies on that nine. Then on number 4, the real hole number 4, I made a really long putt for par, so that kind of kept me going. Then I holed out for the bunker on the next hole. 
 So instead of making a bogey and a par, you're going 1-under in those two holes, so that really accelerated the round. Just hit it pretty pure and made a lot of good putts and I missed a few short ones for birdie, too, so just solid rounds. 
 KELLY THESIER: People talk about what great condition this course is in. What have been your thoughts about the course so far, and what are your keys to succeeding on this golf course? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: The conditions are really good. I mean, the fairways are very tight. You get a lot of good lies. It's too bad that we get mud, but we play the ball up, so that's a good thing. 
 The greens roll really true. They might not be very fast, but you can get fast putts with the grain on the slopes. I think it's fair. 
 The key is to just pick your spots on fairways so you can get good angles into the greens because they have different sections. If you hit your drive where you want to be, you can attack the pins. It's always nice if you putt well, but that's everywhere.

 Q. Every part of your game working well today, tee shot, second shot? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: If you shoot 5-under, everything's got to be going well. I think I might have missed one fairway or two. I made a few really good up-and-downs to keep it going. Yeah, I mean, you're going to hit a few not as good shots, and I did that. So it wasn't a great day for my greens in regulation. But, yeah, I made some good putts. Yeah, was just solid.

 Q. On number 4, that was a good up and down?
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: Yeah, that's where I made the very long putt for par.

 Q. What kind of lie was that? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: It was a really bad lie. It was one of the fairways that I missed but it was in the bunker, but the rough caught it, and it was deep down in the Bermuda I think it is. Yeah, so I couldn't really advance, and it went in the bunker.

 Q. How many putts today? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: No idea. I'm for sure under 30, because I holed out from the bunker and I made a few good putts so, for sure under 30.

 Q. Do you have a game plan for tomorrow? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: No. I mean, it's Thursday. Three more rounds to go. All I can do is play my game. I'm not going to change it because somebody else is in front of me or behind me. I don't think that works well. So just going to play my game and see what tomorrow brings.

 Q. (Inaudible)?
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: Actually, I played 2002 World Amateur in Kuala Lumpur, too, but it's my second time. I like Malaysia.

 Q. (Inaudible) when did you turn pro? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: I turned pro the end of 2008. My first year as a professional was 2009.

 Q. Have you won? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: I won on the Duramed FUTURES Tour one time in 2009.

 Q. (Inaudible)?
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: It's quite hot. You've just got to prepare for it. You've got to drink enough the night before and during the rounds, because if you get dehydrated, it's very hard to get back in normal shape. So you have to just pay attention to your body and make sure you keep it hydrated and eat enough.

 Q. Is the hot weather good for you? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: I guess so. It worked well today. It's what I said, you've got to prepare for it. You've got to make sure you do the right things for the hot weather. Then I think you can just play your normal game. Doesn't matter where you come from.

 Q. Did you attend college in America? You speak American English?
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: Yes, I went to the University of Southern California and graduated. So I've been living in America for almost seven years now. I go back in the winter when I have time.

 Q. You played college golf in America? 
 DEWI CLAIRE SCHREEFEL: No, I only played the U.S. Amateur once, because in the Summers I would go back to Europe and play for the national team.
