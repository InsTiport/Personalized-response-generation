  COLIN CALLANDER: Good afternoon, we have Jin Young Ko, just shot a 69 for an 8‑under par total of 208, currently tied for the lead in the championship. 
Congratulations. You must be very pleased with your performance so far. 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, I hope to every time enjoy. So today is good score and with my caddie, he talk to me every time, to enjoy it. I really enjoyed today and I never really thought I was leading this tournament, but it's really kind of a bonus. But this is a big tournament, and leading right now‑‑ my caddie, Jeff, every shot, he told me just enjoy it and that really helped. 
COLIN CALLANDER: Your caddie, Jeff Brighton, is Scottish? When did they meet? When did they organise to play together? Did you meet him here? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes. 
COLIN CALLANDER: He's a good caddie? 
JIN YOUNG KO: He's really nice. We looked at a couple guys and we thought this is a good one‑‑ it came out really good. 
COLIN CALLANDER: I think I'm also right in saying you only one practise round; is that correct? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  On which day? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Wednesday. 

Q. How did your usual caddie feel that you were using somebody else?
JIN YOUNG KO: Every time, it's the same caddie in Korea. In South Korea I had my own caddie. For this tournament, special events, I just hire a new caddie just for this event. 

Q. The weather yesterday was quite bad when you finished. Have you experienced any weather like that in Korea?
JIN YOUNG KO:  I first time visit in Scotland. Scotland is many different seasons. It's sunny, rain, windy. It's fantastic. Caddie talks to me, this is Scotland. Enjoy this game. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  Many, many seasons all in one day. 

Q. But have you played in high wind in Korea? 
JIN YOUNG KO: No. First time yesterday. 

Q. So is it not difficult to play in that wind? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, really difficult. So windy, extra, is five clubs plus. Too tired yesterday. 

Q. Do you feel at all nervous leading the tournament, joint leader? 
JIN YOUNG KO: I feel nothing, not even nervous or anything. I didn't expect anything for this tournament. I'm just invited for this tournament because I'm in the top 30 rankings. That's why I got invited, so I didn't have that much expectations. I'm leading, but I'm not nervous or anything. I just feel kind of nothing. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  Are you enjoying it? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes. 

Q. How many times have you won in Korea?
JIN YOUNG KO: Four victories.
COLIN CALLANDER: Four wins, three this year. 

Q. In what way has your caddie helped you today and how many shots would you attribute to him? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Maybe two shots. He said for me Tuesday night, play tennis‑‑ so I want you to every time‑‑ (Inaudible.)

Q. Have other players on the KLPGA been an inspiration to you? 
JIN YOUNG KO: I saw Inbee playing well, and that's kind of additional like motivation for me to play better golf, and Hyo Jin (ph) as well because Ko (ph), we actually played together when I was young and still compete with each other till last year on the KLPGA. So that's another motivation for me to play better golf. 
Then Ko is in the same management company, and Inbee helped out a lot, to give me a lot of advice in being a better golfer. That's really kind of another thing that put me in this position.

Q. Is it possible you might talk to Inbee tonight ahead of tomorrow's round for advice about contending in a major; might they talk tonight? 
JIN YOUNG KO: I don't think so. (Laughter).

Q. When are you going to play for the LPGA? Are you planning to do it? And also, your putting stroke is kind of similar to Rickie Fowler. What do you think about that? 
JIN YOUNG KO: I haven't any plans for the LPGA yet, but I'll definitely play for the LPGA in the future. 
Putting stroke, I like the David Stockton (ph)‑‑ fundamentals. So whenever I it get a chance, I love to get a lesson from him. 

Q. Would you say that Inbee Park is your mentor, someone she has relied onto progress in your career? And can you talk about how life‑changing a win would be here? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Her ranking is No. 1. She is my‑‑ I like Inbee because Inbee is very good person and really good have a mentor. And putting, everything is to like, Inbee. If I win British Open, my life is maybe same. 

Q. With no true links experience over here, how do you explain playing as if you play it all the time?
JIN YOUNG KO: I don't think so. I play the regular just like I play on the Korean tour, same tempo. There is no changing at all. I just play as normal. That gives me better scores. 
COLIN CALLANDER:  Do you just use more club or less club? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, use more club or less club. Hit one‑shot pattern, which is just straight ball. 
COLIN CALLANDER: Thank you very much.
