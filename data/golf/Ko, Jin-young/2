  Q. Jin-Young Ko, 2-over 73 on Cypress Creek.  How do you feel you played today?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   Well, I had a couple missed shots on the front nine, so I had 2-over par front nine, but I had a good finish after the back nine, so I'm looking for three days more.
 Q. From your practice rounds, how do you feel moving to Jackrabbit for tomorrow?  Do you think it might be easier for you?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   I think not much different, just a little bit shorter than Cypress.  It's going to be fun.
 Q. How was the course conditions out there?  Did it play similarly to how it did in practice rounds?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   No, it's totally different a little bit because first three days, fairway was firm a little bit, but I don't know, today was a little bit softer, so driver distance were a little less.  But it was fine, yeah.
 Q. Why are the courses tough?  What's the one big challenge of these golf courses to you?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   Well, Cypress is a little longer than Jackrabbit.  But we have to play two different courses, first round and second round.  So I don't know.  It's the first time I have played maybe since 18 years, it's the first time.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
 Q. What was the longest club you hit into a par-4?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   Par-4?  6-iron.
