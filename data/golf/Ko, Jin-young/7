Q. Just a bit heavy on 16? 
JIN YOUNG KO: I was a little overâ€‘thinking, and then I was a little bit nervous. 

Q. Still pretty pleased with the way you finished this week?
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, well deserved I feel like on No. 15. But 18, had a little mistake. So far, overall, second finish is really well.

Q. If you were going to lose to anyone, would you want it to be to Inbee, your idol? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yeah, golf is not always fun for myself against someone. So yeah, I was really focused for myself. But on No. 16, I never, ever forget in my life. I made a mistake. But overall, second place is not bad for the first time. I played really, really well the last four days, and yeah, I just want to cheer up for myself and move off to the next round. 

Q. Did you look at the leaderboard? 
JIN YOUNG KO: Yes, I looked at my leaderboard and then I figured where I was.
