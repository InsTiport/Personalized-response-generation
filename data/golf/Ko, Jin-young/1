  Q. Jin-Young Ko, 68 today.  How was it out there today?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   It was cold out there.  I had rest time yesterday.  It was a little bit -- it was good to me.  I needed the rest.  I had a great round today.  I had a couple missed putts, but I finished good today.
 Q. Birdies on two of your last three.  Can you talk us through those?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   Yeah.  No. 16 and No. 18.  No. 16 was a little bit downhill and right to left break.  I wanted to make that putt, so I made it and I was happy.  No. 17 was par.  My 18th I started looking at the scoreboard.  Leader's score was 3-under, I am 1-under, but I have to finish strong.  I wanted to finish strong on the last hole, so I made it and I was happy.
 Today was the first time I hit 68, so I was happy.
 Q. What are your takeaways from the week?
 JIN-YOUNG KO:   Well, this week is my best finish at the U.S. Open, so I can play next week, as well.  I'm really thankful.  This season is too tough with coronavirus, so I want to say thanks to USGA and all the volunteers.
