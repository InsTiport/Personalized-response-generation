Q. You battled back from that bogey, double bogey on the back.  What was the biggest challenge out there for you today?
JIN-YOUNG KO: I tried to focus on my game.  I did it on the front nine, but the back nine was a little putts missed, but I had bogey and one double bogey, but I tried to finish strong, No. 16, 17, 18, and I got a birdie on 18.  It was a huge birdie.  Looking forward to the next three days.
Q. What do you say to yourself when you have those sorts of challenges to stick with it and battle back like you did?
JIN-YOUNG KO: I don't know, just -- this course is a little bit tough from tee shot.  Second shot, too.  So I want to play straight from the tee and then to the green.  A really important key is putting, yeah, I think.
Q. Coming off that win last week and now another major championship, how do you keep the momentum going?  I'm sure you have to be tired at this point.
JIN-YOUNG KO: I'm not tired yet.  I will do my best for this week, and then I had just great playing today, so I'm just happy.
