 Q.  Just kind of one unfortunate shot on the par-3 or you'd be tied for the lead?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I mean I didn't play my best today, which is kind of good news, to know that I'm still fourth up on the leader board.  Yeah, just really didn't start off that well with a bogey on the first and the double on the par-3.  But the rest of the day I kind of made some good up-and-downs.  If I had made a few more putts it would be a different story.  I'm still in a good position, two back going into tomorrow.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I just didn't hit it very solid, unfortunately.   
 Q.  How tough a grind was it to try to get back onto your game after that double?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It really was.  I did birdie on 7, and really helped.  And another birdie, I guess, on 16, it kind of helped save my round and a good par save on 17.  I made a lot of good shots, just kind of disappointed with the 2-over.   
 Q.  What is it about this course that really seems you can't get on a roll?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's a tough golf course.  You have to hit it almost perfect off the tee.  Every hole is pretty narrow.  And then the approach shots aren't that much easier.  The greens are pretty tiny.  If you miss the greens it's usually a difficult up and down.   
 Q.  The first two days they're chasing you, and now you have to chase someone.  How does your mindset change?  Does it change?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It does change.  The pressure is off me and more on the leaders.  I would rather be into that leading spot going into tomorrow.  But one day left.  And three people to climb over.   
 Q.  You have to tell yourself it's only two shots that keep you from the lead?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yes, especially on this golf course, two shots can happen on one hole.  So many birdies and a lot of others can happen, especially down the stretch.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  It's interesting.   
 Q.  Does it intimidate you that Lydia is the person in the lead?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Not really.  She's been up consistent.  You know she's going to put up a good number.  I just have to work a little harder.   
 Q.  Does the pace of play affect you all?  It's a five and a half hour round?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's very slow this week, but another thing that shows how tough this golf course is.  It started to get going there on the back nine little bit.  So hopefully it will be faster tomorrow.   
 Q.  Does this course particularly favor anybody, or are we finding out it just doesn't favor anybody, just favors whoever hits it well.  You would think with your length and Brittany would have an advantage off the tee.  Are we finding anything out in that regard?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I don't think so.  As long as you hit the fairways.  It just depends on who is on.  And like you said, who is hitting fairways.
