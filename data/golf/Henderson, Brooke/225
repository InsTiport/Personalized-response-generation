 Q.  What do you take away from this week?  BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a really fun week.  I learned a lot about myself and my game.  I really enjoyed myself this week.  I would have liked to have climbed up that leaderboard a little bit more today, but it was a steady day and I'll take 2-under on Sunday.   Q.  Just tough on those greens today?  Both you and Suzann looked like you were hitting the edges.  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think my putting was a little bit weaker this week than I would have liked.  I think it would have been maybe a little bit different story if I had rolled it better.  But it comes and goes, and I just have to work on it on my weeks off and try to get a little bit better. Like you said, Suzann was having trouble, too, so I wasn't the only one out there.  So I decided to stay patient today and I think I did a pretty good job of that.   Q.  You have to be happy with your ball-striking tee-to-green.  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's definitely the strength of my game and when it's on, I usually play pretty well, which is good, knock-on-wood.  So yeah, it was a great week.  I hit the ball pretty well.  I hit a lot of fairways and gave myself great opportunities for birdie and when I was able to take advantage of them, it was great.   Q.  You mentioned about learning about yourself this week.  What is something you'll take away from this week that you think will help you the next time you're in this kind of situation?  BROOKE HENDERSON: I think every time playing on the LPGA Tour, especially when I'm close to the top, I think I learn a lot about my tendencies and where I can improve to get a little bit better score the next time.  I've learned a lot the last couple weeks because I've been playing pretty well here and I don't think I have a lot of starts left this year on the Tour, but I think if I can take advantage of those, hopefully I'll be full-time out here next year.   Q.  I guess it makes the U.S. Open and Canadian Open so much bigger to try to pad the bank account for the Money List?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yes, it does and hopefully I'll get in a couple other money qualifiers but I'm not sure if those are going to fit in the schedule or not.  Hopefully I'll be able to make some cash and climb up the Money List.   Q.  Excited about the next couple of days back home?  Are you going to play in the Canadian Women's event on Tuesday and Wednesday?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, so a busy week this week.  Playing the Canadian event and having a Pro-Am tomorrow which will be a lot of fun and I'm excited for it.  Then I travel to South Bend, Illinois and playing in a Symetra tour event starting try day.  Very busy week but hopefully it all goes well.   Q.  The best thing you take away from this week?  BROOKE HENDERSON: I think just the experience.  It was awesome.  Like I said, I played pretty well.  Definitely things that I can improve on.  But overall it was a great week and I'm happy.   Q.  You had a Top-10 finish in the U.S. Open last year, top five finish here.  Can you describe how you are feeling right now?  BROOKE HENDERSON: It's great.  Like I said, today I was hoping to climb up that leaderboard a little bit more than I did.  But 2-under on Sunday at a major championship, I can't complain too much.  And tied fifth, that's pretty cool.  Definitely moving forward, I have a lot that I can take away and I'm hoping to do that.
