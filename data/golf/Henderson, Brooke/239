Q.   Give me just a little recap of how things have been since you declared pro.   I know you won last week. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.

Q.   So things have been going pretty well. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.

Q.   How has that transition been so far?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, it was super exciting, the day I turned pro, December 18.   It was a lot of fun.   I was with the Ottawa 67s ‑‑ no, the Senators, and we did a video and stuff like that.   It was just a really fun day, and then since then I've moved down to Florida, starting to practice and training with my sister every day.   My schedule this year will be a little bit up and down, but getting into this tournament this week is really exciting.

Q.   Where in Florida are you guys based?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Right now we're just outside Daytona Beach.   We're still looking for a permanent spot, but we like it there.

Q.   Plan for your schedule, just kind of getting into whatever you can get, Monday qualifying?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, so IMG is working hard on getting some sponsor's exemptions, both on Symetra Tour and LPGA, and I'll try and Monday qualify as much as possible. 

Q.   Now, take me through yesterday.   Have you been here before?   Was it the first look yesterday?   Take me through the day. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, this is my first time to the Bahamas.   My sister and I flew in on Saturday.   It was a really amazing experience just to see the ocean.   Awesome.   We played a practice round on Sunday and then Monday qualifier yesterday, and it was a really fun day.   I played with Brogan McKinnon, who I've known for a long time, also a Canadian, and my sister is on my bag this week, which is awesome.   I love having her there. 
Yesterday I hit the ball really well.   I missed a few putts on the back nine, otherwise I could have been a little bit better, but ‑4 in windy conditions, I'll take that.

Q.   Have you been working on anything just in terms of your practice?   Anything that you have been working on that worked well yesterday? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, I made a putter switch, so I'm all Ping clubs now, and new Ping putter, and it worked really well yesterday.   I'm really excited to be with Ping.   It's great people and great clubs.   It's a good fit.

Q.   What's the model? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   It's a Craz‑e.

Q.   Ping Craz‑e?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   And you've played in LPGA events, but does it feel different that you've earned your spot in this week?   Does it feel a little different now that you're like, I belong here and I'm a pro? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   A little bit.   I definitely think that playing LPGA events as an amateur has really helped, especially like in the big‑‑ like majors, U.S. Open, I played in the Kraft last year, too, so just getting used to the way the courses are set up, getting to know the players a little bit better.   Yeah, it's much more comfortable this week, but I know I still have a long way to go.

Q.   Do they all say hi to you? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.

Q.   Are you like, oh, they know me?   Has anybody said anything?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, definitely.   A lot of players I've played with before, they always say hi, and it's a cool feeling. 

Q.   The win last week, take me through that.   Was your sister playing?   Someone said you beat her out?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I beat her by one.   Yeah, I birdied the last hole to win by one.

Q.   Were you guys playing together?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah. 

Q.   Did you have a bet going on?   You've got to give me the details on this. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, it was pretty good, actually.   She took it pretty well.   We were battling pretty hard all day, and it was back and forth, the lead, since the 10th hole. 

Q.   Did it feel like it was just like a practice one day?   Was it just the two of you?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, and Maria ‑‑

Q.   But it was you and one other person?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.   You know who it is, Maria‑‑ she's from Sweden.

Q.   McBride.   She's married now, Maria Hjorth?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yes.

Q.   She's McBride now.   She got married. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I played with her and it was really cool, but like she was a great player, obviously, so it was really cool just to be able to watch her, too. 

Q.   Did she give you any advice or anything?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I didn't get to talk to her too much just because we were‑‑

Q.   Busy, right?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, but just being able to watch her and learn from her that way was really cool.

Q.   What did that win do for you?   Obviously coming down the stretch there was probably some nerves, and to close out like that.   You've won plenty enough before, but to be your first professional win, what did that do for your confidence?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, that was my first event as a pro, and to win it was pretty cool.

Q.   You're 1‑0. 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, exactly, which is a good track record to have.   But yeah, it really helped coming into this week, just a confidence booster knowing that I got a couple of solid rounds together last week, and coming into the Monday qualifier where you have to be playing your best because it's just 18 holes.
