 Q.  What was working really well for that closing stretch?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I started out really well.  I was 2-under first couple holes and then kind of got in a rough patch.   
I just kind of rebounded starting on I guess No. 13.  Things just started to turn around a little bit.  I was able to hit that green in two and two-putt for birdie.   
Made a really nice par save on the next hole.   
Then, you know, I kind of got my momentum back.  I was just trying to get back to where I was earlier in the day at minus-6.   
I'm happy I was able to climb up the leaderboard a little bit on the back.   
 Q.  You have to be very happy with your position going into the weekend, and on the back of consistent form in recent weeks.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I feel like my game is in a really good spot.  To be able to rebound like that mentally I think is really key.  On this golf course you got to stay patient, and I feel like we were able to do that even though it's very difficult at times.   
I'm really excited for the next few days, so we'll just see what happens.   
 Q.  Is this a course you've always liked, or is it one you've kind of grown to learn to play well?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I've kind of had some mix.  When I first came here I played well; last year not so great.  It's just kind of a balance.  I think this year is a going to be good.
