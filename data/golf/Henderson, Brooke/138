 Q.  A lot of "Go Canadas"?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: A little bit, "Happy Canada Days" a little bit over the course, which is good.   
 Q.  What does this day mean to you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, it's amazing, 150 years, and to be able to represent my country at the Olympics last year and then every time I'm out on the course all over the world.  I'm very proud to be Canadian, and it's also a special weekend.  The Fourth of July is coming up, too.  So big weekend for celebration.   
 Q.  If you weren't playing professional golf, what was a typical Canadian day for you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I would probably go to my cottage and watch fireworks at night.  Canadians are very proud to be Canadian, and this is a very special day back home.   
 Q.  How do you walk away from this round?  Looked like you were going to get up toward the top and then you faltered.  Do you walk away positive about your play?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I just saw the leaderboard and I'm still in fourth place, which is great.  It's Saturday, third day of a major championship, and any time you can see your name that close to the top is a really good feeling, especially when you know you have one day left.   
And it is disappointing.  I would have really liked to have 17 and 18 back.  They were very similar putts, and I just hit it through the break both times.  So you know, hopefully tomorrow, I can just make those kind of putts and put myself closer to the top.   
 Q.  Coming from behind last year, how does that experience help you now going into tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, with a major championship, really it comes down to the back nine on Sunday.  So as long as I can play solid and get myself into a good position coming down those final holes; and especially here with 17 playing so tough, 16 playing tough, and then 18, you almost have to make birdie or you fall behind the pack.   
I think it will be a really interesting finish and I'm just hoping that I'm a part of it.   
 Q.  Was that a 3-wood that you choked down on 17?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was a 3-wood.  It was 215 to the stick and straight into the wind.  I had carried it a couple holes before almost 225, so I didn't want it to go too far but I knew with that strong wind, I needed to hit it.   
 Q.  How much did it mean to pick up a win recently?  Did it give you some confidence?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  Any time you can win out here on the LPGA Tour against the best in the world, it gives you a lot of confidence.  And especially me, I didn't have the season, the results, that I was really looking for, but I knew my game was in a great place.   
To be able to hoist a trophy and get that win so close to coming here was really important for me.   
 Q.  Will what you did last year in this tournament always be with you as a reminder of what's possible?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Absolutely.  This was an incredible event.  It always is, but being the winner, being a Major Champion, and especially so young, at 18 years old, it really has boosted my career and changed a lot of things in my life, but all for the better.   
 Q.  How would you say your popularity has grown in the last year, given that, given playing in the Olympics?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: A lot.  I think people finally kind of knew who I was after I won last year, and then I've just kind of picked up fans all around the world since then.  I have a lot of fans out here today, which is great.   
 Q.  Do you go out feeling you need to be more aggressive tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, not really.  I think it will give me some extra motivation maybe to start a little bit faster and get a birdie in the first couple holes tomorrow and try and get it back as soon as I can.  But with this golf course, you need to play aggressive, but you've got to play really smart, and so if the opportunity is given to me, then hopefully I can make up for it.   
 Q.  Now that your round is done here, are you going to do something to celebrate Canada Day?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Probably not.  I'm very proud and very happy but it was a long day out on the course today, so hopefully go and relax a little bit and get ready for tomorrow.  And then if I win tomorrow, I think that would be the best present I could give them.
