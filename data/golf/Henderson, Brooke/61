 Q.  It was pretty hot out there.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  How were you able to stay cool?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, fortunately it was a bit of a cloud cover the first nine holes or so, and that was really nice.  Felt like I got to a really good start birdieing the 1st hole, 3-under through the front nine; and then it was a little up and down on the back nine, but happy to finish 6-under.   
 Q.  Awesome.  So you typically like to play in Thailand?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, last year I finished top 10 here and that was really fun.  The crowds are awesome, especially on 18.  It's such a great finishing hole.  It's like challenging but you can also make birdie.  It's just a lot the fun to play here, and I'm getting more used it the heat living in Florida now.   
 Q.  How are you going to prepare for tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I felt look I did a lot of things really well today.  Maybe just adjust the game plan a little bit going into tomorrow.  But I'm just going to rest and hopefully come out tomorrow and get a couple birdies early.
