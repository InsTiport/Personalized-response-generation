BROOKE HENDERSON: They're awesome people.
Q. There's a rumor that Ray Allen is the biggest trash talker in the field.  Is that true?
(Laughter.)
BROOKE HENDERSON: But, no, it was pretty cool to be able to play with all these celebrities and just see how good they are at golf.
Q. Now, it's different because it has more of a Pro-Am feel to it.  Was there a point where you said, wait a minute, I'm at a golf tournament.  I need to hunker down here.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I had to remind myself it wasn't Wednesday afternoon, it was Thursday, and I had to get a good score together.  I think that's when things kicked in on the front nine.  I started getting a couple of birdies to recover from that bogey, and then from there I was ready to go and made a lot of birdies.
Q. Actually playing in this event, you played well last year.  How much did that help this week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Playing this tournament two years in the past really helped out a lot.  I recognized a lot of the people.  They recognized me.  It's just something that makes me a little more comfortable out here.  And knowing that I played well out on this golf course also gives me some confidence, especially when we're playing up a little bit shorter too.  That's nice.  It gives me a little break.
So, yeah, I'm just happy with how today went.  Hopefully, I can just continue that tomorrow.
