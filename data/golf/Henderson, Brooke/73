Q. We talked about this perhaps being your sixth major.  Those who know you best say it's probably higher than that, certainly the one you've dreamt about the longest.  Does the reality live up to the dream?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's amazing, just surreal.  The crowds here have been so amazing all week, and to finish it off the way I did is really a dream come true.
Q. Has to be one of the more emotional wins of your career, not only because of what this tournament represents to you but also with what your family has been through.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  It's been a really tough year, so to get this for my family and just for the whole of Canada, I'm really happy.
