 Q.  Sum that round up for us.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, it was a little bit of a mixed day.  I hit the ball for the majority extremely well and just the putter kind of let me down at times.  One birdie, that's the real problem.  You can't go around this course and only have one birdie every day, and especially when you have holes like 7 and 13 that I did.  But you know, the crowds were amazing.  There was a lot of great things happening out there, and like I said, my ball-striking was awesome.  It was like right on, and just hopefully tomorrow I can make a couple more of those 10-footers, 15-footers, and then we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  What happened on 13?  Looked like maybe you were between clubs?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I was.  You know, just kind of the wind was right to left, and I didn't want to be chipping from that left side, and at the last second on my down swing I kind of changed my swing a little bit, which happens with me sometimes, but usually it turns out better than worse, so unfortunately that wasn't some of my best shot making there.  But it's going to happen, and I feel like I dealt with it pretty well, and the fans were right there behind me the whole way.   
 Q.  What did it feel like to step on the first tee today?  Was it any different than normally week in and week out?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, 8:00 a.m. there's not normally lining the fairways.  It was pretty special, and I can't thank them enough for coming out and supporting and just hopefully tomorrow I can play a little bit better for them.   
 Q.  What about the slow pace of play today?  Was it a problem for you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.  You know, it wasn't that slow.  A couple holes that we had to wait a little bit longer, it gave me a little bit more time to think and get my shot right, which I think is always good.  I'd rather be waiting a few more seconds than having to run and catch up after them.   
 Q.  Were the greens rolling a little bit faster than you've ever seen them before?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: They were super fast, yeah.  That's the fastest I've seen them here at the Hunt.  I heard this morning they were close to 13, and on downhillers, that's really quick.  I felt like most of the time I was putting down the hill, so I was trying to just really focus on pace, and then it's really difficult to get the line.  Tomorrow hopefully I'll give myself a little bit more uphill chances at it and see if I can be a little bit more aggressive.   
 Q.  Normally on Tour is it like 11 and a half, 12?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think so.  So it's definitely more like a major championship here this week.   
 Q.  Where are you emotionally right now?  Are you frustrated?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm a little bit frustrated for sure, but I think if I can just get a good night's rest tonight, maybe practice a little bit, tune in things a little bit more, and then go out tomorrow and hopefully just make a few more putts.  That's all it is, and hopefully make a few more birdies.   
 Q.  Now that the pro-am stuff is all over, do you just focus on the tournament itself now?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  After my pro-am yesterday, I tried to just kind of relax and focus on what I need to do.  I practiced really diligently yesterday afternoon, so I'll do the same this afternoon and just hopefully things turn out a little bit better and I'll play on the weekend.   
 Q.  What are you going to practice on most this afternoon?  What's the priority when you get there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Definitely putting.  Yeah, like I said, I hit the ball really well.  I hit a lot of fairways, gave myself a lot of opportunities for birdie, and they just didn't fall today.  That can happen, and just hopefully I can just be a little bit better.   
 Q.  Do you have a new putter in the bag this week?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, I switched to this putter I think in May maybe.  I've been using it.  I won with it, finished second at a major, so it works.  I just need to maybe teach it a lesson this afternoon.
