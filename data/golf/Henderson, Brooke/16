Q. You haven't had a lot of rest playing-wise.  What was the difference this week and even today?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, you know, I feel like the last few weeks I've been close, but just a little bit inconsistent.
So things really clicked today and even the last few days but I'm just giving myself a lot of good opportunities and it was nice to get off it a really fast start today.  Kind of relaxed, and unfortunately didn't get as many on the back as I would have liked but I'm definitely happy with the round and excited for tomorrow.
Q. Talked about the difference in the overseed and Bermuda.  What are the adjustments you've had to make this week?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's a totally different golf course than what we normally play in the springtime.  I was fortunate to go back to had I moment in Florida last week so I was able to practice on Bermuda.  Gave me a little bit of a heads upcoming here but definitely a different golf course.
Q. And different without the fans and excitement, what's that going to be like and what are the keys for you tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it is definitely different without the fans, especially with the walk up 18.  That's always very exciting.  Kind of get goosebumps, but still all the history and the tradition here, it's a special place and it's definitely a great opportunity tomorrow and hopefully I can go low.
