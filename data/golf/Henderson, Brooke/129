Q. What kind of distraction was it when you got to 15 green and with all that commotion in the box?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was really exciting.  I heard that.  It's really amazing that the president of the United States is here to watch us play golf and on a tremendous golf course.  I'm really excited and it was a great opportunity.
Q. How were the conditions out there compared to yesterday?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Definitely a lot softer.  A lot of rain the last two days.  It played a lot different than it did in the practice rounds and yesterday.
I feel like we, my sister and I, we adjusted really well to that.  We attacked maybe a little bit more.  We weren't as afraid of those run-off areas as I was previous just because I knew it was holding a little bit better.
Q. Was everything going on a distraction to you?  How in the world were you able to concentrate to hit a good golf shot on 16?
BROOKE HENDERSON: 16 is probably the hardest hole out here.  I have been thinking out it every night before I go to sleep to make sure I hit a good shot.  It is extremely difficult.  I hit a pretty decent shot there today and yesterday again.  If I can hit the green every single day there, I'll be really happy.
Q. So you can block out the noise?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I mean, it's just like any other hole, any other event.  Those generators are pretty loud back there.
Q. Over on 15, fans had their backs turned and were looking in the box.  Is that strange at all?
BROOKE HENDERSON: A lot of fans look at other groups when I'm playing.  It's just another thing that happens.  Like I said, I'm just here and I'm really excited to be playing the U.S. Women's Open.  It's just extra and like I said, it's a great opportunity.
Q. To have the American president here at the U.S. Women's Open, how cool is that as a player overall?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Like I said, it is amazing.  The U.S. president here watching us play golf, it's pretty incredible.  I never thought that would happen.  To be in my fifth U.S. Open and to have it happen is really cool.
Q. How do you feel about your position heading into the weekend?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I feel like I could have maybe got a little bit more out of today's round than I did.  Any time you are shooting under par in a major championship and putting -- I'm a few shots back.  Hopefully I can make that up quickly over the next two days and put myself in contention on Sunday.
