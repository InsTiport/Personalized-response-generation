 Q.   How did you feel about your round today?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   My ball‑striking was very good today.   I definitely could have‑‑ I took opportunity, had a couple chances out there, but today was not a bad score, and I had a lot of fun out there.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, actually I was reaching for it.   I thought it was in.   But a little testy coming back, too, but I was able to come away with bogey.  
   
 Q.   You played with Michelle last year in Waterloo, as well.   What did you guys talk about?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Different things, college, pro, stuff like that.   Definitely she's so nice and an awesome person to talk to about those kind of things.   It was just a pleasure to play with her.  
   
 Q.   Is she selling Stanford to you right now?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Not a lot.   
   
 Q.   She's a unique person to talk to because she's been in this exact situation.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I was asking her some questions about that.   But like I said, she's just an awesome person to play with.   
   
 Q.   Are you a little bit intimidated when you're playing with Michelle Wie?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I looked forward to it a lot.   Definitely playing with her in Waterloo, I knew what to expect today.   I'm getting more and more comfortable, which really helps.   
   
 Q.   You don't get the impression that this is particularly leaving you awestruck or anything.   You seem really comfortable already.   Is that what you're experiencing, or are we seeing an outward calm and inside things are going a little bit‑‑  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, it's just an awesome opportunity, but like I said, the more I'm out here the more comfortable I am.   I'm starting to know some of the girls a little better.   I was able to talk to them at the lunch table instead of sitting by myself.   But it's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Who are some of the girls you're getting more friendly with?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I've played with Morgan Pressel earlier in the year, so I've gotten to know her a little better, and Lorie Kane.   There's a couple others out there.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, not really.   Say hi, but that's about it.
