 Q.  That was a very un-Brooke Henderson like kind of round out there.  Tell us what happened out there today.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was close, just a couple mis-hit shots, kind of put me in the wrong positions and I didn't have a lot of green to work with a lot of times.   
The first couple of bogeys were good bogeys.  Basically I had to make a couple putts to save bogey, and then finishing the round with two bogeys is not really what I had planned.  I was hoping to get it back to even by the end of the day.  It was a rough round, but hopefully I can play better tomorrow.   
 Q.  How would you describe your emotions right now?  Are you frustrated, disappointed or just optimistic for tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: All of the above, I think.  Yeah, really disappointed with that round, but with that being said it wasn't far off being really good.  I make a few more putts, I have a more birdie opportunities on my back nine before the two bogeys.  Kind of do the same thing tomorrow, hopefully make a few putts and get a low score.   
 Q.  I know you were out here late last night, Wednesday night, working on the range.  You were the last person to leave the range.  Were you looking for something there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, leaving the range last night, I was hitting my driver a lot better.  Today I hit it pretty well with the exception of the last hole, which is something that I have been kind of working on, I guess, the last week or so, just not hitting it quite as well as I normally do.  Still good, but just not the way I like to see it.  I seemed to figure that out last night and felt pretty confident and pretty comfortable with it today..
