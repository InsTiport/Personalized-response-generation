Q. So, a close call, but you've still got to feel good about the way you played this week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  It's great to come back here and kind of put the last two years out of my mind and know that I can play really well here.  Third is awesome, so I'm really happy, another Top 10 for this year.
And it was great to kind of be in contention again and seeing your name at the top of the leaderboard gives you a lot of confidence going forward.  So hopefully I can take that going into the British in two weeks.
Q. How tough was it?  You take the lead with the birdie at 14, and down the stretch you kind of faltered.  What happened in those final few holes?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was sort of weird.  I hated that tee shot on 15 the last couple days, but I tried my best.  Sometimes golf is weird.  Sometimes it just doesn't go your way, and that was kind of me the last four holes.  The rest of the way I played really well, so I'm happy.
Q. When you're on 18 and you have the birdie putt, is it an approach from a competitor standpoint that this thing is going in?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I was disappointed with my third.  It really wasn't what I was looking for.  But I gave it a great putt.  Looked like it was going in the majority of the way, but it just kind of missed on the high side there.  So, like I said, I gave it a good effort, and unfortunately, it just wasn't my day to day.
Q. What's next for you?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm going home.  Then playing the British in two weeks.
