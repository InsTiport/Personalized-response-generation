 Q.  Great finish?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  Was kind of up-and-down a little bit today but I was steady.  Hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens.  Gave myself a lot of long putts, so hopefully tomorrow I can hit it a little bit closer to the pin and hopefully make some more birdies.   
 Q.  How did you find it out there today?  It's obviously not raining but a bit windier.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was a little bit windy.  I think conditions were easier for me than the last two days, being in that wave.  But I didn't capitalise as well as I would have liked to but I'm happy with 3-under and hopefully tomorrow I can just go out and play really well.   
 Q.  Do you like playing links golf?  Is it one of your favourite majors?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's really amazing and really challenging because it's so different from what I grew up playing on, so I do look forward to coming over here and playing in the RICOH Women's British Open.  I learn every year to play a bit better and I'm really happy with so far how I've played this year.   
 Q.  A lot of the girls say it's really tiring, thinking of the different shots.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, definitely, you have to think your whole way around and it is kind of mentally exhausting more than physically.  It's just all the conditions, the wind and the rain and everything.  It takes a lot out of you.
