Q.   Disappointed with today? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   You know, I hit it pretty well.   I made a couple of mistakes, and just a few putts on the back nine I wish I would have made.   But I'm still in a good position, and I didn't play that well today, and I'm still right in there.   I think I grinded it well, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   I would think if you would have shot even par today you would have thought you'd be more than one back heading into Sunday, right?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Definitely.   The course today definitely you could get a lot of birdies, but it was also playing pretty tough.   I hit it decent and didn't have that many birdie opportunities, so try and fix that tomorrow.

Q.   Is there less pressure going into the weekend where you're not leading?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I like where I am right now.   I would have liked the lead.   Can't go wrong with that.   But I think I really like the position one back and 18 holes.

Q.   What's it like, one back heading into a Sunday chasing two of the best in the game in Lexi and Inbee? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's definitely going to be a fun day.   Great players, amazing players, and definitely role models for me and everyone out here.   I've just got to play my game and see what happens.

Q.   Does it change your mindset at all with how bunched the leaderboard is and also knowing those two are probably not going to give away a lot of shots out there?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, and the leaderboard is bunched.   There's so many people within one, two, even three shots.   It's all packed.   I'm glad I'm right in there, and just got to play really well tomorrow.

Q.   Last week chasing Morgan and chasing Lydia on Sunday, this week playing with Juli Inkster, playing with Inbee Park, chasing Lexi tomorrow.   What is that like so quickly after turning professional?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's great to be able to play with these great players and be able to compete with them and be right beside them.   I've watched them on TV for the last couple years, now right beside them, and I'm learning a lot just by watching what they do around the golf course and how they behave and just their mannerisms.   It's a great experience, and like I said, I'm learning lots, and hopefully that'll help me.

Q.   Great second shot into 18, but disappointed with the three‑putt?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I mean, it was a long putt.   I can't complain too much.   My first one I would have liked to give it a chance to go in, get it past the hole, but to be honest, I thought that second putt was in.   I was already starting to walk it in, and it just missed on the high side.   So we'll see if we can hit it in two tomorrow and one‑putt or two‑putt.

Q.   What will you do tonight?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Not much different than what I do every night; I'll just go home.   I'll probably try to get to bed a little bit earlier tonight.   I was starting to feel a little tired on the back nine, so just get a good night's rest and see what happens.

Q.   How early will you get to the golf course?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I'm not sure of my tee time, but if it's in the afternoon I might come early and just maybe hit a few putts and then grab something to eat and then go warm up.

Q.   In your amateur career did more of your wins come from behind on Sunday or were they when you already held the lead coming in?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I had a mixture of both.   Early in my amateur career I won a lot just by having the lead going into it, then last summer I came from behind quite a few times, and even early in my pro career, just on the mini‑tours, I've come from behind twice to win, so I'm used to it.
