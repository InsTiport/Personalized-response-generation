 Q.   How was your play today?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   It started out a little rough.   Was able to come back on the back nine a little bit and make some birdies, but just a little bit of putting out there, missed a couple.  
   
 Q.   But you've been having a great season too?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's been so much fun this season.   I've been able to play the U.S. Open in Manulife, and this is my third LPGA Tour event this year, so it's been a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   What's it like, I mean, this year you're kind of the youngest person on the Tour, aren't you?   Pretty close.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I'm not sure.   Maybe.  
   
 Q.   What's that like for you?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   It's cool.   I get to look up to a lot of people.   Get to watch what they're doing and just gain a lot of experience from them.  
   
 Q.   Seeing Lydia Ko win this last year, where were you last year and how did that hit you?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   She's an amazing player.   She's definitely a person I look up to.   I like to watch when she's practicing.   She's a great player, and hopefully I can be like her someday.  
   
 Q.   For the hopes of Canadians, you know, where do you want to be and what do you want to prove to Canadians?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I'd love to play on the LPGA Tour in the future and have a good career out of it.   Definitely the Canadian game is growing a lot, and it would be great to see some up‑and‑coming stars do really well.  
   
 Q.   What inspired you or what inspires you?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I grew up watching my older sister, Brittany.   She was a huge role model for me.   I watched her play a lot of events, and just looking at these girls out here like Michelle and Becky who I played with today, they're just so good and I want to be like them.  
   
 Q.   You think 4 will hold up cut‑wise?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I'm not sure.   I was pushing it the last there trying to get a couple more.   We'll see.   I hope it does, fingers crossed.  
   
 Q.   I mean, that would be huge for you.   You've made cuts before, but this one, I think, this time would be pretty big?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, the Canadian Open is a pretty big deal to me.   It would be awesome to be able to play the weekend, but so far it's been a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   When do you start back in school?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   The 3rd of September.  
   
 Q.   What grade is that?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   11th.  
   
 Q.   Are you looking at colleges yet?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yep, I'm looking at a couple.  
   
 Q.   What is your plan, driving range or greens or just sort of wait it out?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I'll definitely practice.   Maybe some work on the greens.   But, yeah, hopefully, like I said, fingers crossed.   But playing conditions are pretty good out there so.  
   
 Q.   It's a lot different than yesterday morning with the scores?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.
