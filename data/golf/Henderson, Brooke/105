BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I played really well today, so I'm happy.  I got off to a really fast start on the front nine, three birdies, 7 through 9, which was exciting to get to 3-under making the turn.  Unfortunately, on the back, some putts didn't fall and things didn't go quite my way.  But I'm excited with the 2-under start, and hopefully it will continue on through the weekend.   
 Q.  Compared to earlier this week when the winds were up and more of the night conditions, was that more pressure on you to play a little better and score a little lower?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, today was perfect conditions.  Early in the morning things were holding a little better, no wind.  So I think that is kind of why I was hitting it so close, and so well in the front nine and got it to 3-under.  Maybe the conditions on the back nine were kind of similar to what they're going to face this afternoon.  I'm excited where I am.
