 Q.  Brooke, it wasn't the storybook ending you wanted.  What will be your best memory here this year?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was amazing.  The crowds were incredible, and to have that support behind me from the very start of the week, Monday, when they were out here following me and cheering me on, it was so amazing.  Today didn't go quite as well as I would have liked, but still having that support around me was amazing, and I'm going to remember this week forever.   
 Q.  What were the different emotions you might have felt this week as opposed to before?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I got off to a little bit of a shaky start, but the fans helped me stay in it.  I made the cut on the number, shot a great round yesterday.  Even par today wasn't too bad.  It was a little shaky at times, but to finish with a couple birdies on the back was really helpful.   
The golf course was in incredible condition.  It was just perfect weather, perfect week.  And I'm thankful to CP for everything they do as well.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I just can't wait for the day that hopefully I'm hoisting that trophy, and hopefully I can hear the applause a little bit louder.  But like I said, they were cheering me on the entire day and it was just amazing.
