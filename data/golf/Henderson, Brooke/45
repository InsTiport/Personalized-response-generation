Q. Bogey-free final round.  Got to be happy with the way you played this week, the back.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, the back was really nice.  But just playing with how today went, things weren't really rolling for me unfortunately.  To shoot 3-under on a Sunday and be that close to the leaderboard and know that you left some out there is a good thing.
So definitely just looking forward to the rest of the summer.  I think this was a good way to lead into the U.S. Open next week.
Q. Yeah.  How much confidence do you have in your game right now with the next major coming up in KPMG?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think it's really important coming into this stretch to kind of get it going.  That was one of my goals, so this is a nice way to start.  I feel really confident on the course right now.  I feel like I can make a lot of birdies, which is a great feeling.
If I can just continue to hit the ball in good spots and kind of just stay patient with myself, I think hopefully a win or top finishes will come soon.
