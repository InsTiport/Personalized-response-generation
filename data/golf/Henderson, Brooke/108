Q. Where do you live now? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: I live in Ottawa, but I also live in Naples, Florida.

Q. You live in Naples? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, much warmer than Ottawa. 

Q. So you played well again today. What was it like playing with Mark Mulder? Did you play with him yesterday too? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.

Q. What was it like playing with Mark Mulder and Troy Glaus? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was awesome. Troy and Mark, they both hit it so far. So I was hitting first most of the day, but it was really fun to see that kind of power in their game and really awesome players as well. They made a lot of birdies out there, which made me keep pushing to keep making birdies as well, which always makes the day fun. 
It was freezing cold out today, but hopefully‑‑ I don't think it's going to warm up tomorrow, but hopefully I'll be a little more used to it and go out there and do something similar as I did today.

Q. Right now you're five points back of the lead. Was that a goal of yours entering the week? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: I knew that with this format you had to make as many birdies as possible. So that's kind of been my mentality over the last two days. Hopefully tomorrow I'll make a bunch more birdies and maybe get closer to that lead in the first few holes. Yeah, it's exciting to be in this position, and hopefully I can just build on it tomorrow.

Q. Trying to make birdies, does that fit your natural style of play? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I like to be pretty aggressive. Last year I was second on the LPGA Tour in birdies. I feel like that's kind of where my strength is. So when everything's going well, I tend to make a lot of them. 

Q. Are you a sports fan overall? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, anything to do with‑‑

Q. Hockey, of course, right? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I love ice hockey. But any sport. The athleticism and everybody out here is really incredible and really inspiring to me as well.

Q. Who did you play with yesterday? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: I played with Reggie Jackson in the Pro‑Am.

Q. You did? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I did. And I played with John Cook and Mike Flaskey yesterday.

Q. Did you know who Reggie was, Mr. October? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Mr. October, yeah.

Q. You knew that? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I did. It was really cool. He still hits it really well. He's getting up there a little bit in age, but it was really cool. 

Q. These guys today, when you're saying how far they hit it, how far are they getting it past you? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: I don't know. Like a good ways.

Q. You hit 270, don't you? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, just less. They were crushing it, way over 300.

Q. What did they think of your long driver? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: I don't know. They didn't comment. 

Q. I mean, it's just very unique. You've talked about it a million times, but I always find it fascinating. 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's about three inches longer than normal. But it seems to work for me. I grip down on all my clubs, so it's probably about the same as if I was just gripping on a regular driver at the end, like a normal person. But for me, it works, and I tend to hit it just as accurate as I would a regular club.

Q. Last thing, ramping up for the season, how much does this help just kind of get the competitive juices flowing? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely. The mentality of trying to make birdies every hole, trying to be aggressive, trying to make things happen is exactly what I need to do on the LPGA Tour. So it's definitely a good prep tournament. My season starts in just less two weeks. So I'm really excited for that.

Q. What steps are you looking to take next season? I forget how you did. Did you win last year? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I won twice last year.

Q. You won twice. What steps‑‑ Majors, obviously, are the big thing, but where do you feel like you kind of fit in the picture? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: My world ranking slipped a little bit last year. I'd like to get that back down in the top ten. Just try to be a better person, better golfer every day. I'd like to win a few more times. Hopefully, that's in the cards.
