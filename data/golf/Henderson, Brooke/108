 Q.  So that was a round filled with lots of birdies, a couple of bogeys.  Talk me through a little bit.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, lots of birdies, which is really exciting.  Hopefully I can do that the next three days.  But I would also like to take care of some of those bogeys I had today, a little bit sloppy, some dumb mistakes.  But overall I feel like I'm hitting it really well and made some putts as well.   
 Q.  You started off really strong.  Do you really like this course?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I do.  I always really look forward to coming back here.  I always seem it play well in Singapore on the other course and this new one as of last year.  You know, I think it's really important to get off to a fast start, make a couple birdies through the first five holes.
