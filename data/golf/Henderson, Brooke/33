Q. I was tallying up all your scores from the previous four years you've been here. You're 54-under par now with today's 67. Describe the level of comfort you have when you come here.
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I love this golf course. Every tee box I just feel comfortable on, which is a great feeling, and obviously having won here twice in the past, I have a lot of confidence going around here, and almost every year I have a great memory. So even when I'm not playing my best, I can kind of reflect on that, and it kind of cheers me up a little bit.
It was nice to play today. Angel went really low, so that was fun, and I just tried to keep up.
Q. You got off to a little bit of a slow start, but I noticed that you just stayed really patient. Is that part of your game plan, just that you know you're going to turn a corner and start making some birdies?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, there's definitely tons of birdies out here, you just kind of have to ride out the rough patches, which is my first couple holes. It was not the best, but I just, like you said, tried to stay patient and knew that birdies were coming, and fortunately they did, and hopefully tomorrow I can make a few more.
Q. There can't be anyone out here that sees and reads these greens better than you. What is it like when you're on these putting surfaces because it sure looked like you were really relaxed on them today.
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, a lot of the putts I had today, I remembered them from previous years when I was in similar positions and I kind of remembered what they were doing, which is also a great feeling, and I think every year that I come back here, I just have more experiences that I can kind of lean back on, and Brit was really helping me out today a lot, as well, and it's nice to make some putts, and hopefully over the next three days I can make a ton more.
