Q. Good to see you smiling.  You played great and you did just about everything you could out there.  It's so hard to follow up a major championship and defend it.  How proud are you of yourself and this whole week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I played great all week.  Came so close, and it really came down to those last two holes birdieing to make it look really close.  I would have liked to make one or two more putts on the back nine, but like you said, it was a great week for me.
There was a little bit more pressure coming into this week, and knowing that I won last year, I really wanted to do it again.  I gave myself the best opportunity to do that, and unfortunately I just came up a little bit short.
And Danielle played great all week, so congratulations to her.
Q. What will you take away from this, because you seem so relaxed right now.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think I just know that I played the best that I could, and it just wasn't good enough this week.  It's such a big learning experience, coming out here, and finishing second after I won last year.
This tournament has been really good to me, T-5 two years ago, a win, and a second.  So maybe next year I can hold that trophy again.
Q. I know you're still 19, but you have to feel like more of a veteran player out here.  How do you think that that's going to change your approach to the game and to winning and what's in store for you?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I feel so much more relaxed in contention.  You know, coming up those final holes, I was chasing birdies and felt like I could get them, which was a little different from a few years ago where I was very nervous and trying to make pars and maybe the odd birdie coming in.  But now I really feel like I can trust my game, and it's good enough to make birdies down the stretch, which I did today.
