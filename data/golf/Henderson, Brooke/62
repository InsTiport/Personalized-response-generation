BROOKE HENDERSON: I think I can grind it out and a lot of my wins have come in windy conditions. I tend to play a little bit better. Hopefully things go my way, but itâs really cool to be in this position going into Sunday. I feel like I have a positive things to take. Hopefully do something similar tomorrow and hopefully the putts will drop.
