Q. Nice second round at the Lotte Championship.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Thanks.
Q. 4-under for the day.  How tough was it out there with the wind?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, the wind was a lot stronger than it was yesterday right off the bat even early this morning.  Took a little bit of adjusting to it.  Got a couple breaks and was hitting the ball in pretty good places, giving myself some birdie looks.  It was nice to make a few putts, especially the two par-3s on the back.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think so.  Sort of got lucky a little bit yesterday.  Yeah, the winds are going to blow here.  You just have to stay patient and, yeah, trust your lines off the tee especially.
Q. It's pretty early in the tournament.  Do you scoreboard watch?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I'm a player that usually looks at the scoreboard whether I'm playing well or not just see where I am at and what I need to do.
Q. When you see you and Nelly up there neck and neck does that focus you more or...
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, a little bit.  There is tons of golf to be played and the afternoon wave is just going off now, so I feel like there will be a couple more players right up there.
The leaderboard is pretty dense right now and there is a lot of talented players.  It's halfway through the event.  Just keep doing what I'm doing and make a lot of birdies and see what happens.
Q. Interesting that you guys played junior golf together.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.
Q. If you end up playing together, does that bring back some memories?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's pretty cool to have us both make it this far on tour.  Growing up playing junior events together I think this was both of our dreams, so it's pretty cool to come out here and have it be a reality every single day.
Q. Envision it.
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think so, yeah.
