 Q.  Great final round; how does it feel?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: That's pretty sweet.  Coming into this week, if you would have told me that, I would have been very excited.  I'm definitely in a good position heading into the final round, which is very exciting, and I feel like these crowds this week have been totally amazing, and I've been playing well for them, so I'm happy about that.  Hopefully I can just go out and get close to that 6-under round, not so close to this 2-under round that I had today.  But the conditions have changed a lot over the course of the week, and today it played really tough, and I think you can see that on the leaderboard, as well.  People were having some trouble with it.  Hopefully go out tomorrow, make a lot of birdies, and just kind of see what happens.   
 Q.  You can also rewrite the history if you win tomorrow --  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that would be pretty sweet.  It's definitely a long way from that.  There's like a million players within like five shots, so I definitely have to play my best and hopefully go low.   
 Q.  How would you classify your putting today?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was pretty good.  I made some putts, obviously left some out there, but overall I'm still very confident in it.  I feel like I'm reading putts really well, so hopefully I can just continue that, reading putts properly, and knock them in tomorrow.   
 Q.  Talk about your par save on 16, knowing you have that long putt in your bag?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that was really nice.  That really kind of helped my momentum a lot, coming off three birdies and then almost chipping in.  I'm really glad I hit the hole on 15.  But then to be able to get up-and-down when I kind of ran into a little bit of trouble there on 16 I think was really key and just kind of keeping my composure a little bit.  Unfortunately I dropped a shot at 17, but I haven't really figured that hole out yet this week, so hopefully tomorrow I can birdie there and make some money.   
 Q.  What's the next 12 hours going to be like for you as you get ready to tee off tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's pretty normal.  I mean, I'm always trying to play my best on Sundays, and I definitely played really well last Sunday in Indy, so kind of just try to match what I did last week.  But it's an amazing accomplishment to be this far, but I'm not done yet, so hopefully I can just have a great night, restful, sleep well, and then wake up tomorrow ready to go.   
 Q.  What do you know about Jocelyne Bourassa?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I don't know a ton, but she was an amazing golfer, and to win the national championship at home, it's truly amazing, especially in front of these crowds.  I definitely will hope to be somewhat like her tomorrow and be able to finish the job.   
 Q.  We heard from Alena Sharp that Brittany and her caddie were chatting a little bit.  What's the camaraderie like amongst the community at this event?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, Canadians kind of stick together.  I think that's a big part of playing on Canada's national team.  But Alena, she's quite a bit older than I am, but she's like one of my best friends on Tour.  She's really been a great friend to me since I joined the Tour, and her caddie Sarah (Bowman), as well, and if I ever need anything, they're probably the first ones that I go to.   
 Q.  You said you play a lot looser when you're up at the top of the leaderboard; would you agree with that?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think so.  It's a lot more fun, and I feel like I can kind of go off the crowd a little bit more.  It's just really exciting, and I feel like when I have a lot of confidence in my game, that's when I tend to make a lot of birdies and I tend to play really well.   
 Q.  There's so many young players watching you; what are you hoping your performance does to maybe inspire the next generation of golfers?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, this week, it's amazing to see all the little kids out here watching.  If I high five them or sign something for them, just their face kind of lights up, and it's a really cool feeling for me.  I remember being in their shoes, as well, and I know it's really meaningful when somebody like myself spends that little bit extra with them.  Hopefully I can inspire them to pick up the game or just kind of follow whatever their dreams might be.   
 Q.  With so many good players at the top of the leaderboard, do you think you're going to have to play aggressive tomorrow, and does that play right into your hands?  Do you play your best when you're aggressive?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I definitely do play better when I'm aggressive.  I play smart but aggressive, and when I'm kind of chasing birdies, I feel like that's kind of where I'm playing my best.  But just kind of depends on the conditions.  If it's similar to today, I think I'll probably have to shoot 4- or 5-under, but if it goes back to kind of the calm conditions that it was earlier in the week, then it will have to be a lot better than that.   
 Q.  It could be wet tomorrow here; what type of game do you have when it's sort of cool and rainy?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I won in New Zealand last year, and it was exactly that.  So I definitely have something to think back on.  But I think I'll just kind of have to grind it out tomorrow, just take whatever the course gives you.
