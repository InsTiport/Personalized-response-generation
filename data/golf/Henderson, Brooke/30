 Q.  Can you just sum up your week here? Nice to finish with a birdie on the last?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, overall it was a really good week. I've had a lot of different conditions out here. I felt like I played really well overall. It's just a couple holes that if I could play over again, that cost me a few shots but I'm happy, like you said, birdie the last hole.   
 Q.  Two weeks off before CME. What are you going to do and how will you prepare?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm actually going to Universal as soon as we go home, so that's nice, and just spend it in Naples getting ready for CME.   
 Q.  Anything in particular you're going to focus on?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think it's important to rest the first week a little bit, just to get your body and mind prepared, and then after that, just make sure your game is sharp and hopefully go low.
