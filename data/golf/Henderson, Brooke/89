 Q.  What did you think about your round, first of all?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm really happy with it.  Bunch of birdies out there; no bogeys.  Just kind of got off to a good start and was able to go 4-under on the back, which really helped.   
The course is in perfect condition.  It was really easy to score this afternoon.  The wind didn't get up too high and the greens were holding, which is always a bonus.   
 Q.  Before you went out were you seeing what others were doing on the course?  Is this what you were expecting then?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I didn't think minus-10 was out there; that's pretty impressive.  I knew it was going to take a lot of birdies.  I'm happy with my seven.   
Hopefully over tomorrow and the next couple days I can do something similar to that.   
 Q.  Talk about getting your feet square on 16 on the second at second.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was an awesome shot.  I'm really happy.  Just tried to get in there and be athletic, and that seemed to work out all right.   
 Q.  Seeing a lot of familiar faces from last year excelling again this year.  How much does your familiarity help you guys coming back?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, definitely seeing the golf course for the second year really helped me out a lot knowing where to hit the ball on my tee shots and knowing where some of the slopes are, as well.   
I think if you know how to play this course well it's definitely an advantage.  I think that's why you're seeing some of the same names up at the top.   
 Q.  How was it playing with Emma today?  Have you guys played together before?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, we have played together before.  She's really, really nice and she had a great day today as well.
