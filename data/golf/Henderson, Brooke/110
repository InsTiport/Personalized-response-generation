 Q. Last year Brittany Lincicome, Lexi Thompson played in this event, the following week went down to Bahamas and finished 1, 2. What do you think your chances are to keep up the tradition?   
BROOKE HENDERSON: That's a great tradition. I would love to keep that up. I feel like my game was really good this week. I feel really confident that way. Hopefully, I can make a few changes going into Bahamas and try to keep up that tradition.  
   
 Q. Does playing with the guys make any difference, as far as versus the ladies?   
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely. You really see the importance of making birdies and being aggressive, which is partly because of the format but also because you're playing with the men, and I feel like it's a really good wakeup call, and it's really exciting to be able to play in it.
