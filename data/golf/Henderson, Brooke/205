Q. It's hot out there.
BROOKE HENDERSON: It is very hot out there today.  Definitely enjoy some rest tonight before tomorrow's round.
Q. You played beautifully, it was a lovely round of golf, so to shoot 5-under par, what was particularly about good your game?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Everything was going pretty well today.  I was able to make a few putts early, which really helped and kept the momentum going.  On the back nine, I missed a lot of birdie opportunities.  It's kind of unfortunate but was able to get one on 18.
Q. We've been particularly interested in your driver you've been using this season.  It's 48 inches, the longest permitted under The Rules of Golf.  Tell us why you're choosing to use such a long driver?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I worked with the PING represent almost two months ago and just trying to get some extra distance out of me and decided to go with the 48-inch driver.  I may lose a little bit of accuracy, but I normally hit it pretty straight anyway.
Q. This is your first full year on the LPGA Tour.  You've played so brilliantly.  You're obviously finding the transition from being an amateur to a pro an easy one?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I think last year being a non-member and playing in a lot of LPGA Tour events really helped me, helped me get a feel for the atmosphere and players on Tour.  I just look forward to this year and being out here more often.
Q. And nice having your sister on the bag, as well.  Is she a calming influence?
BROOKE HENDERSON: She is on the bag this week and looks like she'll be on for another 30 weeks or so.  It's always a lot of fun having her there.
Q. 5-under, how is it out there?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a lot of fun.  I was able to.  Stay patient for the first couple holes, missed some birdie opportunities but was able to make some putts near the end of the first nine and able to carry that momentum forward.  5-under is a really good round today.
Q. In which areas are you hoping to be a little bit better tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I mean, on the back nine I was giving myself tons of birdie opportunities, so hopefully that will continue.  I think either just hit the ball a little bit closer or make a few more 10-footers.
Q. You seem to maintain control with your driver on the very, very narrow fairways.  Are you happy with the way you're driving the ball?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I think on this course you've really got to be careful on tee shots and play smart.  I think we did a really good job of that so far this week and if I can just continue to hit it straight, that always helps.
Q. Talk about the travel, two weeks in Australia, out here in Singapore; do you like traveling?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I do, I love it.  It's so much fun.  This is my first year on Tour, so really getting to see the globe for the first time.  It's really fun, and to be able to share it with my sister and do this journey together is really cool.
Q. And finally, you're only 18t.  I assume you're the youngest golfer here this week.  Do the others treat you differently?
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, not really.  It's pretty cool out here on the LPGA Tour, because people are kind of all different ages.  I'm right in the mix of a lot of young rookies and people that have been out here for a long time and that are close to my age, so it's good.
