BROOKE HENDERSON: I didn't have a birdie all day, which kind of cost me.  Four bogeys isn't that bad around this golf course, but if I could have made a couple birdies it would have made any feel a little bit.  It was really firm, the wind was extremely strong today.  I think I hit a 9-iron close to 160 or 170 today, so it was going pretty hard.  It was a really good group.  I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. You talked yesterday about the fact that you were putting, maybe having a trouble misreading the putts out there.  How was it today on the greens?
BROOKE HENDERSON: A little bit the same.  Today was kind of the opposite.  There was more break in there.  The pins were a little bit tougher, more slopes compared to the other days.  They had the course -- they changed a couple tee boxes.  They had the pins a little bit tougher.  They kind of changed it around on us a little bit, which was good, makes it interesting.  But definitely had to adjust to it.
Q. When you get such a difficult golf course out here, do you like the challenge?  Do you like to try and battle through and figure things out?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I didn't play my best today, but it was still pretty cool.  I'm trying to see slopes and use the wind.  I was trying to have fun out there, even though I wasn't too happy with how I was playing.  At the end of the day, it's just a game and today just wasn't my day.
