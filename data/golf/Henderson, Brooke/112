Q. Birdie, birdie finish, right?  Good way to end the round.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Uh-huh.
Q. Was it a tough day other than that, or you just kind of like...
BROOKE HENDERSON: Just really couldn't get anything going.  I bogeyed the 2nd hole again, same as yesterday.  That kind of killed the momentum a little bit.
I feel like I was struggling to get it back.  I was 3-up on the back nine; birdied 10.  I had a great crowd out there supporting me, a lot of Canadians, which is really cool.
I feel like after the birdie on 10 I found some more energy and tried to dig down deep.  You know, 17, 18 to finish birdie, birdie is really nice.  Before that I was a little bit down and now I'm back in good spirits.
Q. Is that something you recall, a bunch of Canadian fans out here?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  Yeah, there are a few places until the U.S. the Canadians seem to bunch together, and this is one of them.  It's really cool to have that many people down here in Naples supporting me and cheering me on.
Q. Is Race to the CME Globe back of your mind?  Top of my mind?  Not in your mind at all?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, kind of in the back of my mind.  Obviously I'm not in a great position right now, but there are still two days of golf left and a lot of things can change and happen.
My priority is just to go and shoot a good round tomorrow and see if I can put myself in a better position going into Sunday.
