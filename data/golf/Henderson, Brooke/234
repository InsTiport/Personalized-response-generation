 Q.   What was working for you today?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I hit a lot of good shots.   My putter was really working.   I had a lot of birdie opportunities, and I was able to make a lot.   I made a really long putt on 16, which really kept the momentum going, and it was lucky, too.   I hit it pretty hard and it hit the center of the cup and went in, and that's always nice.   On the back nine, my driver struggled a little bit, and I was able to hit some great shots out of trees and under limbs and everything and able to keep it going.  
   
 Q.   You actually hit more greens yesterday than today but you only had 25 putts today.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I was putting a lot better, and when I hit good shots, I hit really good shots today, and yesterday I hit a lot of greens, but sometimes I'd be 30 feet away, you know.  
   
 Q.   How long was the one on 16?   You said you made a pretty big snake there.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I'd say probably 40 feet, maybe just over.   Yeah, it was a good putt.  
   
 Q.   On that final hole, how long would you estimate the chip and then the putt?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   The chip?   I believe I counted just over 20 yards on the chip, and then the putt was probably six feet.   
   
 Q.   You said you scrambled pretty good on the back nine.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Can you kind of give me some examples there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, just a couple tee shots.   I hit them right on 7, the par‑5, No.1, the par‑4, even No.9 there was in the left rough.   But then on other holes I was right down the middle and hit it on and gave myself a good birdie opportunity.   It was sort of a mixture on the back.  
   
 Q.   How much confidence are you riding right now because you've had a pretty long stretch here of good golf.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Definitely.   Last week definitely helped out a lot, finishing solo third and having a chance to win on Sunday was a lot of fun, and I definitely learned a lot from it.   And then I had to Monday qualify earlier in the week, so I just sort of kept the momentum rolling.   
A decent round yesterday.   It could have been a little better, could have been a little worse, and then today‑‑ I'm happy with today's round, but there's a long way to go.   
   
 Q.   Now that you're a veteran of leading after two rounds, are you going to go through a checklist of what to do and don't compared from last week?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, I don't think so.   I mean, I learned a lot from last week, and I'm excited to be in the same position, and hopefully it will just turn out a little better.  
   
 Q.   What were some of the things you learned that you think you can apply here the next two days?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Just the way I feel around the golf course.   I'm very much a feel player, and I had like a lot of emotions, and I really don't know how to explain it, but just the way I feel.   I learned a lot from the atmosphere last week and just watching some of the other players.  
   
 Q.   You don't have to think tonight about the emotions and the nerves, either; you know what it feels like, right?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, exactly, where last week that was a very new experience to lead an LPGA event.   I have a little better idea of what it's going to feel like, but every day can be different.  
   
 Q.   How does this course set up for you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I really like this course a lot, yeah.   A couple tricky holes, but other than that, you hit it long and straight, and you're good to go.  
   
 Q.   Is this validation after last week to prove that you're back in the lead again, heading into the weekend?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I like it, yeah.   It's definitely a good spot to be.   Last week and this week is definitely a confidence booster, and like I say, I'm just going to give it my all the next two days and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Juli Inkster is up at the top there.   What do you think about that, going against her?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   That's really cool.   She's a legend for sure, and she's definitely a great player and world No.1 not too long ago.   Definitely would be a neat experience if I get to play with her, and I'd be very happy to do that.  
   
 Q.   What is it about the young players?   Lydia wins last week, her seventh win, now back‑to‑back times you're heading into the weekend with the lead, 35 years between the two of you together.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I don't know.   I think it's really cool what she's doing, and she's definitely been a role model for me, an incredible journey that she's been on the last couple years, and I hope to follow in her footsteps.  
   
 Q.   Did you expect this much this soon, back‑to‑back events before even June, before the summer, leading heading into a weekend?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I don't think you can really expect anything, but it's definitely something that I had in the back of my mind, and I'm excited to be here.  
   
 Q.   What happened to the Senators?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I don't know.   I don't really want to talk about it (laughter).  
   
 Q.   What's the coolest part of all the attention you've gotten the last two weeks?   Have there been any reach‑outs on Twitter or text messages?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, there's been texts, and it's a new experience, like I said.   I'm new to Twitter.   Only a couple months ago I got it.   So just the support that you get there, support from back home in Canada, support from family and friends is unbelievable.   
   
 Q.   You seem pretty grounded for being in this position.   How do you maintain that?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I think that's the key.   You've got to maintain it.   I'm not really sure how to or what to say, but I'm just going to keep going the way I am, and hopefully things turn out well.  
   
 Q.   Have you been able to have any fun around the area?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, last night I got to see some longhorns and got a tour of Southlake.   It was really fun.  
   
 Q.   You don't see that in Canada?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No.  
   
 Q.   Not a lot of longhorns in Canada?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, and I was in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots.   It was a lot of fun.
