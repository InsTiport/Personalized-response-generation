 Q.  Today really good front nine kind of got you back into the mix here.  What went well there?  Obviously ending with that birdie/eagle.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I just was giving myself a lot of great chances early and making putts when I could.   
You know, to get a birdie on 8 and follow up with an eagle on 9 was really exciting.  To be at -under through nine holes was a great start.   
Unfortunately bogeyed 10 and then couldn't really find anything after that.  Then coming in I missed couple short putts.  A little disappointed, but 4-under today, that's basically all I was looking for.  Hopefully just have a better round tomorrow.   
 Q.  How does it feel to get back out here and back to your game?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's really nice.  You know, it was very sad last week and everything, but I think it's really good for us to be back out here playing and enjoying what we love to do.   
 Q.  What's your schedule look like?  Obviously defending next week, right, at Meijer?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yep.   
 Q.  What have you got coming up?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Going to play Meijer.  Really excited to get back there.  A lot of the great memories from last year.  Hopefully I can do something similar again.   
I am going to take Arkansas off and do a few things at home, and then going to follow it up with KPMG the week after.  And actually I am going to play CVS Charity Classic in between there, too.  That will be a lot of fun.   
 Q.  Who are you playing with there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I believe Billy Andrade.  I think we're going to have the same team as last year, so Keegan as well, which will be really fun.  We won it last year, so hopefully two defending titles in a row.   
 Q.  You talk to those guys?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Billy I do.  He's a really great guy and always trying to keep in touch.   
 Q.  How do you feel about your game heading into next week?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, after a day like today when I hit the ball so well I'm feeling very confident.   
Like I said, just to go back to where there was so many great memories is really exciting.  You know, having a win early in the season already takes a lot of the pressure off me, but I would love to get another one here in the next couple weeks.   
 Q.  Sure.  How does a week when you are the defending champion feel?  Is it different than your average week?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's really exciting.  I think that's the best way to describe it.  I don't think there is any more pressure because every year is different; everybody is in different stages of their game throughout the year.   
Something clicked last year, and hopefully it does again.  I know it's going to be very difficult to repeat, so I'm not really going in with that mindset.  I'm just kind of excited to go back to where I played so well.   
 Q.  Last one.  What is your strategy on this golf course?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: This one, you know, you got to hit a lot of greens.  It really helps when you hit fairways because you can get into a lot of the trouble here as well.   
Just try to be safe the whole way around, and then when you give yourself birdie putts, you got to try and capitalize.
