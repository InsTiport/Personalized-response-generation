Q. How did it feel out there today, Brooke?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a little bit interesting, not exactly what I was looking for.  But you know, that birdie on my last hole kind of made me feel a lot better about the day, which is always nice, and 3-under par, I can't complain too much.
Q. How about the size of the crowds that follow you?  They seemed to get bigger as the day went on.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  Which is really cool.  I knew teeing off in the morning they might start off a little bit small, but it was incredible there at the end.  That finishing hole was awesome.  There was so much positive energy and positive support for me and the rest of the girls out here on the LPGA Tour, so it's really cool and I just hope they continue to grow over the weekend.
Q. It was kind of an up-and-down day.  Did you ever feel like you got on a roll at all during the round today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, that eagle on 12 I felt really well after that, and then I kind of missed a couple of birdie putts just on the edge following that, and I think if one or two of those would have dropped, it could have been a different day.  But that's just the way it goes sometimes.  So I tried to grind it out and stay in there, and I seemed to get a birdie on my back nine and then follow it up with a bogey.  That's kind of how it went today.  But that's okay.  Like I said, I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. I remember the disappointment on your face last year when you missed the cut.  Different story this year; right?  You're going to be around for the weekend.  What are some of the feelings knowing that you're going to be here?  It's only going to get bigger and better as the weekend goes on, Brooke.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  Definitely I hope I'm playing the weekend.  I shot the same score last year and I missed the cut.  So just the conditions I guess are a little bit different and a little bit tougher.  But yeah, like you said, the crowds are amazing, and I feel like my game is really close to being really good.  And so I think if I can get a couple of birdies together, maybe I can shoot some low scores.
Q. Someone was saying the pin placements were a lot more difficult today.  Is that something you saw as well or what were the challenges the course presented today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, the pins were a little bit tougher, a little bit more over bunkers, closer to corners, and the greens were very firm.  And then with the wind, even in the morning, which I wasn't really expecting, it played pretty tough.  And I was close to shooting 3, 4-under today, but I'm happy with the 1.
