Q. 10-under par heading into the weekend.  How was your round today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was just a little bit up and down today.  I made a lot of birdies and an eagle, which is awesome.  Although I made a couple bogeys that I would like to take off the card for the next few days.
Overall I feel like I have a solid game plan, and any time I'm in double digits after two days I'm really happy.  Just try and continue that trend over the next two days.
Q. Tell me about the hole-out on 11.
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was pretty cool.  It was a really tough shot, and to see it go in just made me really happy.  That kind of changed my day.
I was able to go I guess 4-under par after that point, which was really important and helped me get to 10-under par today.
Q. How was the course playing this afternoon compared to yesterday morning?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was really different.  It really started to dry out and it was running really firm and fast.  I felt like Brit and I did a really good job of kind of allowing for that off the tee shots and into the green as well.
I'm looking forward to kind of seeing what it's going to play the next two days.  If it's like today, I think you can expect the scores maybe not to be quite as low.
Q. Two-time defining champion; at the top of the leaderboard again heading into the week.  How does it feel then?  Do anything different tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, I think just keep everything the same.  Seems to be working so far.  I love this tournament and it's really been special to me.
Hopefully I can go out and make the next few days special, too.
