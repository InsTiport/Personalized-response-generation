BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a lot calmer today, especially on my back nine, which was kind of nice really.  Walking down I guess number 15 felt like there wasn't wind at all, which was kind of crazy compared to the last 27 holes.
No, we had a lot of the fun out there.  We had a great group and we all played pretty well today.
Q. You're from Ottawa, correct?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.
Q. What is it like trying to play golf there?  What window do you have as far as a kid growing up playing golf during the year?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You have like six, seven months where you can be outside playing golf.  The other months you're kind of inside hitting into domes or into nets, simulators, that kind of stuff.
When I was younger I played hockey, so I kind of spent my time that way.
Q. Compare the hockey mentality to the golf mentally.  A little bit different, isn't it?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it is a little bit different in a way.  Hockey is very much out there, where golf it's kind of more to yourself.  I think I learned a lot mentally and physically from hockey that I bring to the golf game.
Q. Hockey is a very physical game and you don't get to really do that out here too much, right?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that's right.  But I was a goalie, so a lot of the mental things from goaltending have really helped me, especially being new to the tour and just trying to prove myself out here.
Q. You have your sister out here as your caddie.  How much does that help you?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I love having her here.  She kind of put her game off to the side and is doing this for a year and just seeing how it goes.  I love having her there and she seems to enjoy it, too.
Q. Did she play hockey as well?
BROOKE HENDERSON: She didn't.  Just me.
