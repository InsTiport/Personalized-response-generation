  Q. (In progress. )
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   I feel like everything was kind of working today, which is really nice.  Hit a lot of fairways, gave myself a lot of great opportunities for looks at birdie, and was able to roll a few in, which is good.
 Definitely nice to get back closer to the top of the leaderboard, and hopefully do something similar tomorrow.
 Q. We had Commissioner Whan out earlier today and he talked about the challenges of getting this tour moving through a pandemic.  What was it like from a player's perspective?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   I definitely think the LPGA and Mike Whan have done an excellent job this year getting us opportunities and the opportunity to be out here to play, which I love.
 It's a very strange year, but it's been crazy for everybody.  I'm just grateful that I'm out here playing the Tour Championship and I have a chance to make some money tomorrow.
 Q. You fought really hard this week.  Tripled the 2nd hole and fought yourself back into contention.  What did it take to stay focus and keep grinding?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, definitely not the start I wanted on Thursday.  Like you said, I battled back really well and happy to make a lot of birdies today, so hopefully just keep the momentum for tomorrow.
