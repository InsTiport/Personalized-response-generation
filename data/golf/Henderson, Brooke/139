Q. How much have you played this course?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I actually played the South Course in the U.S. Junior a few years ago, and then the North Course, I guess my second time was today.  But beautiful golf course and a great venue.
Q. What's it say about the state of the game that you guys are playing on the same course that the men play majors on, as well?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think that's something so amazing about this major championship is that we play the best golf courses, and ones that the men have previously played.  Watching Jim Furyk win, maybe I'll have to go back and watch some highlights and see how he did it, but it's really amazing to be out here and have Phil Mickelson out today on the grounds and competing against him, the four of us, it was a lot of fun, and I think that the women's game is getting extremely strong each and every week, and the players are getting even better and better.
Q. There's a lot of kids out here in the stands today.  Why is it so important for kids to play the game of golf at a young age?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I started playing when I was three years old, and I didn't love it right away, but I fell in love with it, and I think it's such an amazing game because you can play it when you're three and you can play like my great grandmother when she was 90.  It's a game that's very social, you can build a lot of friendships, you can build a lot of confidence.  I feel like it's a great game for life and also a great game in terms of sports.
Q. How about what you had just this afternoon?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was fun.  You know, to have Stacy, Phil, Lydia, you know, the best players in the world, and just have some fun, showcase a little bit to these young kids and hopefully inspire them to be great, inspire them to pick up the game, and it was a pretty cool opportunity.  I never really thought when I was eight years old I would get an opportunity like this, so it's nice to take advantage of it.
Q. Having played the course a couple of times, is there a number in your head that would make you a repeat champion?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I mean, it's a tough golf course, especially if the wind picks up like this.  I guess they call it the windy city for a reason.  But it's not going to be super low scoring.  I think if you just get solid rounds under par each and every day, I think you'll definitely give yourself a chance.
