 Q.  Great finish here.  That had to feel pretty good heading into Sunday.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it did.  I was trying to find a birdie there on 18, but kind of mis-hit my approach shot there, but was able to come back with a nice chip-in and make the day feel a little bit better than it was.  I'm really close and my game is close to being really good, I just have to stay patient and keep doing what I'm doing.   
 Q.  You said your game is close to being good, but you have eight consecutive top-10 finishes.  What defines pretty good.  Is it a win?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think so.  I'm really happy with the top 10s.  I think every tournament, though, there's been a day or a couple shots that I'd like to get back, but everybody has those, so I think just continuing to be more consistent and continuing to be a little bit better.   
 Q.  Seems like the majority of the field is struggling to get something going today.  Did you feel that, as well?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: A little bit.  I made some really good up-and-downs to kind of save my round and kind of keep me going, which I think was really important, and my short game was really good all day, and even on 18, chipping in was really helpful.   
 Q.  Your sister was saying you're hitting perhaps maybe a little higher than you normally do.  Is that happening?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: A little bit, on some tee shots, and once you do that -- it's the wind here, and especially with the cold weather, you're kind of having a lot longer clubs in than you would like.  But maybe lower it a little bit tomorrow, but it hasn't hurt me too much.   
 Q.  Did you feel the wind more today than any other day?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yesterday was much stronger, but today on I'd say four or five holes it was kind of tunneling, and it was really strong.
