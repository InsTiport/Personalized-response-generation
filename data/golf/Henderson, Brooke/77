Q. Nice round.  Always good to have a good first round under your belt.  How are you feeling?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was really solid today.  I kind of got off to a little bit of a shaky start with a bogey on the 1st hole, but I made a ton of birdies today and that's always a really good sign.
I feel like I it hit the ball in good places and gave myself a lot have opportunities.  Just fortunately my putter was really working today.
So I'm happy to get 6-under, but as you can see, the leaderboard is full of under-par rounds.  Hopefully I can do something similar tomorrow.
Q. There weren't a lot of those under-par rounds in the afternoon.  You seemed to do well this afternoon.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I think the calm conditions really helped with that, particularly for me.  I watched some of the coverage this morning and saw some of the breaks on the greens and stuff so I kind of took advantage there.
But I am definitely looking forward to tomorrow morning where things will be a little bit softer.  I hear it's supposed to be windy, but hopefully a little bit calmer in the morning.
Q. Do you take heart the fact that you shot 66, yet you're still only one birdie on three par-5s in the back?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, par-5s you can definitely take advantage here, but as you can see with me, that was kind of my game plan and I just kind of ran into trouble a little bit on them.
But I think if I can capitalize on those over the next three days, then my score can be even a little bit lower.
Q. Great save on 17.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Thanks.  Yeah, I'm really happy about that.  That was really critical to kind of saving my round there.  Not really what I was looking for on a birdie hole to raise money for CP Has Heart, but I'm happy to come away with par there.
Q. You've golfed in front of so many Canadians before.  Was it any different today?  I think Regina saw what the Brooke Brigade is all about.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was pretty cool.  You know, when I first tee'd off this morning the fairway was lined and I wasn't necessarily expecting that.  It was really amazing.
The crowds just seemed to hang with me all day, even though it's late in the day right now.  Even walking up 18 there were tons people.
Really amazing crowds, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.
Q. That 1st hole we saw you sort of the take a deep breath before you today off.  Was it almost like, Jeez I didn't know there would be this many people?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, I didn't think there was going to be that many, no.  It was really important to me to have a great round today, and I thought that meant getting off to a fast start.  Bogey on the 1st hole, but I was able to calm down after that and got on a run where I birdied I think four hole in a row on the front nine.
That was really of nice, and I got my confidence back that way.
Q. With the wind supposed to becoming tomorrow, how are you going to adjust your game to deal with those tough conditions?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think this course is meant to be windy, so I think some holes can kind of play in your favor that way.  It's just going to be a challenge for the whole field.  Hopefully I still hit the ball in good places, give myself a lot of the birdie looks, and hopefully capitalize.
Q. Did those crowds distract you or did they fuel you and help you today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was awesome.  Once I started to get on a bit of a birdie run they got really excited, and that kind of gave me a little bit more momentum and a lot more confidence, which I think was great.
Yeah, really enjoyed playing in front of them.
Q. Brooke, what do you think you're capable of this week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, today was a great round. If I can do something like this over the next three days I think good things could happen.  I'm just taking it a shot at a time and day by day and hopefully climbing up the leaderboard a little bit every day.
Q. First time Saskatchewan has hosted a tournament like this.  How would you rate the course compared to some other Canadian Opens you've played?
BROOKE HENDERSON: This is amazing.  I was here for media day and I definitely saw a lot of damage that happened over the winter.  The groundscrew and everybody here put in so much effort to have it really in such amazing shape this week.
The crowds here are amazing.  I think that is probably part of the Rough Riders coming out, which is really cool.
You know, CP always does an amazing job at CP Women's Open, so I'm really grateful.
Q. Will the Brooke Brigade get watermelons this week, do you think?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Maybe.  That would be pretty funny.
Q. Did you feel like this was one of those rounds where momentum was on your side?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  I made a ton of birdies out there today, which is always a lot of fun.  I made a lot of putts and hit the ball in great places and was able to roll it in.
I felt like i kind of gained confidence as the round went on.  The crowds out here were amazing, so I kind of used them to fuel me, and hopefully over the next three days I can do something similar to today.
Q. Speaking of confidence, you're coming into this week off your best round of the season last week in Indy.  What does that do for your confidence, to come in and play here and have another good round?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I think that was huge momentum change for me to have that round on Sunday last week.  You know, coming in here I knew my game was in a good spot, and I'm just happy I was able to get a solid round off the bat on Thursday.
Hopefully tomorrow I can do something similar and then just kind of see what the weekend does.
Q. Did you see what kind of scores were being shot this morning before you tee'd off?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I was watching some of the coverage this morning and saw some people were like three through three holes and four through four holes, so it was pretty amazing to watch.
I knew that I would have to have a solid round to even compete.
Q. How important was it to get off to this kind of good start this week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think it's really huge for me.  I've never really played that well in the first round of CP Women's Open.  It's definitely momentum I feel like going into the next through days, and I'm just excited and looking forward to it.
Q. The fan support all day long.  They were deep on every hole.  How does that make you feel, just to know the crowds are fully behind you here?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that was amazing.  Stepping on to the first tee I didn't really expect that many people to be out.  The fairway was entirely lined, which was really, really cool.
You know, I think if I can just continue to play well I feel like the crowds will continue to grow and it will be a lot of fun.
