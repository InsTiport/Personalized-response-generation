Q. 1-under today, not the greatest memories from your first round at a course you said you like, but you stood over a putt on the final hole last week and seemed to zone in.  Walk us through what goes through your head in a situation like that.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was such a great putt, and I knew I had a great opportunity there, so I took a little extra time, made sure I got the pace on it, although I left it an inch short, so it didn't quite get there, so I got the line and I gave it a great chance to go in, and that's all you can really do.  Danielle played a great round of golf, solid all four rounds, and I was just trying to sneak in a little bit there and hoist that trophy that meant so much to me the year before.
Q. When you have clutch shots that matter the most in a tournament you're quickly developing a reputation for a player who is clutch in those moments.  What do you think it is about you that enables you to come through?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I think that's every golfer's dream is to be able to make those clutch shots and clutch putts when it really counts, and I take that as a compliment, and hopefully over the next few weeks when those moments arise, I can capitalize once again.
Q. When you come to an event like this, is there an emotional letdown?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, last week took a lot out of me being in contention, especially in that last round.  It drained a lot of energy, and I'm just trying to rebuild that this week, take a little bit more rest and maybe not practice quite as much and rebuild my energy so that next week at the U.S. Open I can go strong and hopefully make it count.
