 Q.  Well that was a lot of fun, wasn't it?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was. It kind of got? Off to a little bit of a rough start there early. After I did that I was just like, Let's just get back to even through the front nine. I was able to birdie 8 and 9 to do that.   
Then the back nine I just said, Let's just go and try to make as many birdies as you can, and that's exactly what happened.   
 Q.  Was there anything in particular after the 6th hole when you were 2-over for the day that flipped the switch for you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: 7 wasn't great either, you know.   
 Q.  True.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: So I was sort struggling there. Little boy kept giving me high fives starting on the 7th green. I think he really turned my day around.   
 Q.  You had that group behind the green on 16th also. Little bitty boys with great big heads of Brooke Henderson. That's got to kind of charge you.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Absolutely. The Brooke Brigade has been really awesome and all the fans that have been here supporting me since early Thursday morning. It's been surreal and an awesome week, and hopefully I can play well tomorrow.
