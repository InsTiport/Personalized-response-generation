Q. So solid week out there.  Likely another Top 5 finish.  What were your thoughts on the week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Good week.  You know, I kind of got off to a pretty solid start, 4-under, but I was really far behind right after the first day, so I was kind of clawing my way back and trying to get to the top of the leaderboard, and yesterday was an awesome day and today was another solid round.
Q. And what's it like out there when you're playing a really good round but you see someone else just going crazy?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  I looked up at the scoreboard a couple of times this week and I was like, wow, that's really good shooting.  And you just gotta focus on your own game and trying to, you know, the clichÃ©, hit every shot at a time and just try to focus on what you can do.
Q. And finally, this whole week with the Founders, what was that experience like for you with your first time being here?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  It was my first time and first time I got to meet the Founders and it was a really, really incredible experience, a true honor to meet Shirley and get to know her a little bit and then Marilynn watched me today which was really cool.  And yeah, you know, it's just an inspiration and I thank them for everything that they've done.
Q. Awesome.  Thanks so much, Brooke.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Thank you.
