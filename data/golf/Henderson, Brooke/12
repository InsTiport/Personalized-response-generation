  Q. Looked like you were fairly comfortable out there on the golf course.  What would you say some of the challenges are for the players this week?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   It's definitely a tricky golf course.  You got to be careful out there.  It can kind of jump up and bite you if you're not paying attention, and especially with how windy it was earlier today.  I feel like we really had to judge the conditions really well.
 The greens are tricky, so I feel like we did a solid job today; 2-under is a good round, and hopefully make a few more birdies tomorrow.
 Q. One hole there, the 13th, into the wind there, you had 5-wood in your hand and you were debating going to the 3-wood.  You kind of waited a bit, that wind dying down.  Did you feel hurried at all with the approach or did you just manage to time it perfectly?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, right when I was just about to hit it it felt like it really picked up and I just felt like maybe I didn't have enough club, so I was talking to Brit and just tried to wait it out a little bit to see if the wind did die down.  It did, I was able to hit a great shot in there considering it was a 7-wood.
