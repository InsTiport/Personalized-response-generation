Q. What a wonderful round.  You're making your debut approximate China.  Fair to say you're having a very nice time.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  It was an awesome day today, and to get the birdies to finish up on 17,18 were really nice.  Definitely a good start, so hopefully the next three days will go well.
Q. We all enjoy watching you play.  When you play you do grip down the club, and not just on the driver, but all the clubs in the bag.  Have you always done this?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, since I was a little girl starting to play the game at three years old I've always kind of gripped down on my clubs.  I'm just more comfortable that way and I find it a little bit more accurate.
Q. It's a very long driver that you have in the bag.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it is.  It's 48 inches, which is a lot longer than a lot of the clubs that people use.  Seems to work for me, and I'm hitting fairways and it hitting it a little bit longer.
Q. You're certainly hitting it beautifully.  This is the start of six events on the Asian swing.  The plan at the moment is you're playing all six.  Feeling fit enough?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I'm looking forward to being really in Asia for the first time.  I've visited a few other times, but this will really be the true taste of a bunch different countries and language and culture, so I am really looking forward to it.
Q. How special is it to have your sister on the bag?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's been an awesome year so far.  And to have her there caddying for me, traveling together, you know, she's my best friend and my sister, and I really enjoy it a lot.  Seems to be working out really well.
