Q. You said you wanted to be aggressive from the guess‑go. At what point did you finally start to enjoy it?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I was just trying to play my game the whole way through, and I think the last couple holes I started to think, 3‑wood off the tee on 17, I probably wouldn't have done that on a regular day, but I figured just hit it straight down the fairway and hit it on and ended up making birdie, which was even better. 
Down 18, again, I probably would have went for that on that bunker shot there, but just chipped out and tried to do the right thing. This is unbelievable, and I'm so excited.

Q. You should be excited. This is the first of many. What did you learn from the disappointments earlier this year that helped you today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think my attitude into today was a lot better than it was a couple months ago. I was just trying to keep going low and trying to push it to get even further under par, which I wouldn't have had that a couple months ago.

Q. Next week you get to go home and play in a huge event for you where there is going to be a lot of pressure on you. Are you expecting it to be a little bit of a celebration, as well?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I am, yeah, for sure. It'll be awesome to be back with the Canadian support. That was my first LPGA tournament three years ago, so it'll be nice to be there. Lots of great memories.
