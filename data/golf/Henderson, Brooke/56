Q. How was your round today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Much better today.  I didn't start off that well, but I was able to birdie the second hole, chip-in and that kind of changed my mood a little bit and momentum, and I was able to make a lot of birdies and have some fun, so it was nice.
Q. How tough is the course playing compared to the first couple rounds?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I guess I just wasn't used to this course playing so firm and windy.  Other years, it seemed to hold pretty well and it was pretty calm out here.
So it was a big adjustment, and I kind of had a couple holes that bit me but other than that, I was playing good golf, so it was nice to finally get everything together today.
