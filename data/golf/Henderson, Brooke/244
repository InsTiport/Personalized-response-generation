 Q.   Is it getting any easier?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Today was a little rough.   I mean, but I'm getting so much comfortable here on the big stage and playing against the best in the world.   
It was a lot of fun being able to play with Lexi today and also Jennifer.   I've played with her once before, but Lexi I've always looked up to.   I mean, she's definitely a big person in the women's game and someone that you can look up to and I definitely have.   It was nice to get to play with her.  
Just every week that I get to play out here, I'm getting more and more comfortable.   I mean, two or three years ago, when I was 14 out here, I was pretty nervous.   It's getting better.  
   
 Q.   You said earlier in the week your goal was to make goal.   Now that you've made the goal, what is your goal for the weekend?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Definitely coming in, to the make the cut; and then Saturday and Sunday, climb the leaderboard.   
Today 1‑under, I didn't back up, but I don't think I moved forward too much.   So tomorrow is going to be a big day.  
   
 Q.   You had a little work today.   Is it a learning experience when you have to focus all the time?   Here you lose your focus for a hold and you a wind up dropping a couple of shots.   Is that part of it?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.   I had 2‑under through 4 today, and I was really stead.   This golf course, it gives you a lot of opportunities to make birdies and to go deep.   You can see that with the leaders; they're really playing well.   
I mean, if you mess up just a little bit, the rough is so thick, if you miss fairways, you really need to just be careful and smart with your discuss.  
   
 Q.   One of the biggest galleries of the tournament has followed you around today.   Are you starting to get a sense of what it feels like to play at home?   People know who you are.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's very cool.   I've received a ton of support from a ton of Canadians and also a lot of family and friends drove up from Smiths Falls this week to watch me, which is a seven‑hour drive, which is quite a trek.   I'm really happy to be able to play for all these people.   I mean, this is some of the biggest crowds they get on the women's tour, and it's a lot of fun to be able to play for them.   
   
 Q.   You've got to make sure you come back next year and make the cut, of course, as they need the revenue.   No pressure though.   Have you noticed a difference between two years ago when you were here and the crowd support now, and imagine what it could be like next year or two years from now?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Definitely.   When I was 14, I had that little bit of, Oh, she's young and gets to play in this tournament.   Now people know my name a little bit more.   My name is out there.   
I had a great summer and I've played a lot in this area.   I've met a lot of friends and met a lot of people that have come out to watch me today, which is awesome.   If I continue to play well and continue to grow my support system, that would be great.  
   
 Q.   When you saw that you would be playing with Lexi today, what was your thought coming into today?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I was pretty excited.   Like I said, she is one of the best women in the game, she is young and one of my idols.   Just being able to watch her and learn a little bit from her, it was fun.  
   
 Q.   Did you get a chance to talk on the course or is she more focused on her game?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I talked to her a little bit today.   I asked her a few questions and got a few things answered that I wanted to know.   So it was a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   She probably didn't give away any trade secrets, mind you, but helped you out a bit, I guess?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Definitely.   Like everyone out here, they play every week and they are super supportive of young golfers coming up, like myself.   And they really‑‑ like they really help out.   
Lori, for example, she came to watch the last five holes for me today, and that means a lot coming from her.   She is a huge role model for me.   A lot of the women out here are like that.   They are really nice and they support young people.
