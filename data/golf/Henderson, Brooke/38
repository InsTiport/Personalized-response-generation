Q. Maybe not quite as simple as yesterday, but a clean card out there and good low score. How do you feel about that round?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, no bogeys is always great, so that's a good feeling. I feel like I played pretty solid. Like you said, maybe not quite as easy as yesterday. Not as many birdies, not as many good looks, but I still played pretty simple. I hit a lot fairways, a lot of greens, and made it pretty easy on myself.
When I needed to make a couple putts to save par, I was able to do that.
Q. You had a lot of long looks for par today. Was some of that you were playing away from some of the pins, or was it just not dialed in on the approaches?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, it was really windy out there today. Seemed to affect me a lot more than yesterday. I guess it was a little bit stronger.
You just kind of had to be careful about that a little bit. You know, unfortunately didn't get some of those closer looks for birdie like you're mentioning, but I still feel like I hit a lot of greens and my putting was good enough that I got good pace on the first putt there.
Q. What's the toughest part about this golf course now that you've played through two rounds?
BROOKE HENDERSON: If the wind stays up like this I think it's definitely a factor. I think you just got to make sure you're hitting it in the right places off the tee, the correct side of the fairways and then the correct side or correct places on the green to make it easier on yourself.
I feel I have a good strategy for around here. I think if we can just judge the wind a little bit better tomorrow maybe I can post another low round.
Q. What is the game plan for tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I'm happy with where I am, to be close to the lead and have -- know that I could have played a little bit better today.
Still a solid round. I feel confident going into tomorrow that I could get on a run and make a bunch of birdies, which is always a great feeling.
I'm excited it te it up.
Q. Your 10th hole, which is the 1st hole, you hit it off to the right. What happened there and what was your lie like in your second shot?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, actually, I did hit it a little too farther than what I wanted, but the wind actually seemed to take it right and I thought it was going to do the opposite. It was kind of there where as I was mentioning before I didn't judge the wind quite as well as maybe I should have. So it wasn't as bad as it looked I guess I'm trying to say.
And then the lie wasn't too bad. I was able to hit it I think to 15 feet; had a nice birdie look. So I think when I got into trouble I was able to scramble and get it back to make a bunch of pars today.
Like I said, tomorrow hopefully just hit it a little bit cleaner and make a few more birdies.
Q. The last hole, the chip Republic you had, just seemed to take a bounce to the left. Sometimes how it goes I guess, right?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah. I knew it was breaking pretty hard right to left. It didn't come out as clean as I would've wanted at contact. Then, yeah, just took the slope to the left.
So that was definitely a birdie hole and was kind of looking forward to that one, but that's all right. I'm still in good position.
Q. You talk about the par save on the 4th, your 14th, and how big that up and down was for your confidence for the rest of the back nine?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah. It was kind of funny. My group, we were sort of all over the place there and we all pretty much walked away with par. I guess Minjee made bogey, but it was pretty incredible to see all those up and downs happening.
It was just one of those things that it does save your round. It keeps your energy and your momentum going in the right direction. So that was good.
I feel like I made a lot of putts like that the first two days. Hopefully I keep this going.
Q. Obviously you were really focused and serious on the course today. I did see a few moments where you had interactions with some young fans. How important is it to be an ambassador of the sport even in the midst of an important round?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, this has been amazing so far. So many people early in to the morning, late at night. It's been awesome. It's pretty special to have all these people out there following you around and cheering you on.
Try to be interacting with them a little bit. Also just trying to make sure I get the job done and play well the next two days.
Q. Do those interactions help at all? Sort of a mental break?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, sometimes you just see a little kid smiling at you and wanting a high five, and it takes you on out of the moment for a second. I feel like that's good. Kind of brings you back to real life I guess you could say.
They just have so much belief in you, and I think that kind of inspires me a little bit.
Q. You really seem to be pounding the ball off the tee. Any feeling that you left a few out there, didn't take advantage of that as much as you could have?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I feel like tee shots have been great so far. This week I've lot fairways and seem to be giving myself a lot of good angles into the greens and pins.
I feel like on the par-5s maybe if I could get it up there -- it's more like my second shot, my 3-wood. If I could hit it a little bit cleaner I feel like I could hit more greens in two and make it easier to make birdie or eagle.
