 Q.  Chip-in, 15, spur you for the last four holes?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I kind of had a tough lie in the rough there on the left side of 15, and so I just kind of tried to hit it out to the right.   
I was thinking in my head, Try and get up and down and safe par and then try and make some birdies on the last three holes.  I was able to chip that one in; birdie 16; had a good chance on 17; birdied 18.   
It was really the ideal ending.   
 Q.  Did you think it was going in or were you, like, hit you the pin?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, hit the pin.  And then Brit was like -- I was just like, Sit.  Brit was like, Hit the pin, so I was like, Oh, maybe it does have a chance.  Then it went right in.  I was really happy.   
 Q.  What do you change about your shot making in these conditions?  Do you approach each shot individually or you're going to have to hit it low?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think every shot is a little bit different.  It's very windy out here so you really got to pay attention.   
Yeah, some shots I was hitting a little bit lower; some the wind was pulling it up for me.  It just depended on my lie and where I was on the fairway.
