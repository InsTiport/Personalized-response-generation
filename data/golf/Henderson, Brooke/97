 Q.  Nice finish.  If you would, just describe your day, compare it to yesterday.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know I was a little bit disappointed with the way yesterday went.  Got off to a pretty fast start.  Birdied my 3rd hole of the day.   
Front nine was kind of rocky.  Made some birdies, made some bogeys.  Then when I made the turn things kind of got hot.  Started with two birdies, 10 and 11.   
Was able to make a bunch more on the back nine.  I think five.  May have been six.  Five, I think.   
So it was a great day.  I'm happy to move up the leaderboard as much as I did today.   
 Q.  A lot of birdies today after just one yesterday.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Difference between the two rounds, what do you think it was?  Just making putts?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  I was a lot more determined today than yesterday.  Yesterday I was kind of finding it hard to stay focused and kind of find my groove.   
Today once I started to make a few putts and hit it close I felt like I could go really deep under par.  I wanted to climb that leaderboard, so I'm happy I was able to do that.   
 Q.  Is it just one of those days an athlete has when you come out and you're flat and just don't feel it and try to grind through and survive?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Pretty much.  Pretty much sums it up.  Yeah, you have those days which is unfortunate, but they happen to everybody.  So to come back today and be that much better is exciting.   
I'm looking forward to the weekend and hopefully putting two more rounds together similar to today.   
 Q.  And when you can go minus 1 on one of those days...  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Beats of heck out of (indiscernible) or such.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, like I said, just happy to get it going today.  Hopefully do something special on the weekend.   
 Q.  Speaking of something special, you have won in four consecutive seasons; building a record of consistent success.  How important is that?  Obviously you had success early, but then just to build on that and keep winning.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  It's really exciting.  There is so much talent out here on the LPGA Tour.  To be one of the top players and be able to win tournaments is really awesome.   
I'm just trying to enjoy every day.  It's a learning process.  Just trying to get better as a person and as a golfer.  Hopefully I'll win another one this season and keep that trend going the next few years.   
 Q.  You mentioned all the talent.  Seems like so much young talent.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  You used to be in that group.  (Indiscernible.)  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.   
 Q.  Do you see some of the younger players out here and just think, Wow, the future just continues to grow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.  I think every generation is just getting a little bit better.  You look at Laura Davies and Karrie Webb.  I saw Karrie up on the leaderboard.  I think if you're good, you're always kind of going to be good.   
And they're pretty awesome role models to look up to.  Yeah, I think you definitely see a lot of young talent coming out, graduating college and even not even going to college.  I think the tour is in good hands.   
 Q.  Is your sister still on the bag?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yep.   
 Q.  That's got to be pretty cool.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it is.  I love having her there.  She seems to like it all right, so I'm happy.
