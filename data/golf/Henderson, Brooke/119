 Q.  Brooke, nice round today.  Bogey-free.  What was the highlight of the round and what did you do well out there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I hit the ball really well.  The last few days I've been ball-striking extremely well, which is giving me a lot of great opportunities for birdie.  I've been able to capitalize quite a bit.   
Today making four birdies and no bogeys is huge around this golf course.  I think if you can just eliminate bogeys and try to hit your approach shots to certain parts of the green, that's kind of my game plan going into tomorrow, and hopefully it works out.   
 Q.  Is this a course that sets up well for you, do you think?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: This year I would say yes; last year I would say no.  So I don't know.  You have to be hitting the ball really well to shoot low scores here.  Fortunately I have been doing that.   
I think you can't count on your putter if you're putting over slopes all day, so making sure you hit it to the correct quadrant of the green is really important here.   
 Q.  You're only three off the lead at the moment.  Leaders have still got a few holes to go and a par-5 to finish.  That might change a bit.  Should you be three behind going into the final round, how would you assess your prospects?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: That's really exciting, you know, three shots.  There are a few people that I would have to climb over, but if I could go out and shoot an under-par round, minus 6 or something like that, and put some pressure on the leaders and kind of be the leader in the clubhouse, that's my goal.  I would like to do that.   
However, to shoot minus 6 around here you need everything to be working perfectly.   
 Q.  Final question:  You won on your last start in New Zealand, first time on the LPGA outside of North America.  How cool is the prospect of winning for the first time in Asia?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that's awesome.  I was really excited to get that win outside of North America a few weeks ago, and so to get one in Asia would be really cool, especially with all the fans that have been supporting us the past few days.
