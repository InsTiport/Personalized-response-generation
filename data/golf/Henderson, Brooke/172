Q. The spectacular finish, can you talk about that?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was a much better day today. I felt better right off the bat. I was 2‑under through my first nine holes, which was good, and I was hoping to get a few more birdies on the back nine, and I definitely was able to do that, especially my last six holes. I kind of got momentum and putts drained for me and I was able to hit some really good shots. I'm really happy with today and hopefully I'll do something similar tomorrow.

Q. Hitting it tight on 13, is that what kick‑started it there?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure. That was really nice. It looked pretty good in the air and I was hoping it hit right into the bank like it did and slowed it down, which was nice. So yeah, that definitely gave me a lot of confidence and got me closer to under par.

Q. What did you hit on 13?
BROOKE HENDERSON: 5‑iron.

Q. Would you go through for me, the big hole for you was 16, you were a little bit in trouble after your drive. Can you go through 16 starting with the drive?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, so I hit 3‑wood off the tee. I was hoping to maybe catch the front edge. But unfortunately just caught a slope and went into the bunker. It was kind of a tough shot on a green that was sloping away from me, so I kind of hit it to the safer side and I was able to stay on the green where I made, I think it was 21 feet, for birdie.

Q. Was it a tough shot from the bunker? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure, but I think I played it really smart though, which I'm really happy about. The putt looked good for me, like as soon as I looked at it, and then I was able to roll it in. Then that probably set up the putt on 17, as well, and then the putt on 18, too.

Q. You weren't going great on the LPGA Tour before you got here. You took time off, went to your cottage, chilled off a bit and went to Houston. Did you need that time off just to regroup?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I took a couple days and just kind of, like you said, hung out at my cottage. But then I also worked really hard those two weeks to try to get my game back to where I knew it could be. The weeks that I wasn't playing very well, I wasn't far away from being really good. It was just a few small things but I think I have it figured out now.

Q. How do you feel about your position now? You're right there.
BROOKE HENDERSON: There's still lots of golf left and lots of people around the leaderboard. I have a lot of work to do but so does everybody else here. So hopefully I'll have two more solid rounds of golf.

Q. Was one of your goals after yesterday's round to make this one a little less dramatic, and how were you able to do that and were the conditions helpful to you?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it seemed a little softer today and not quite as windy as I experienced yesterday, which was really nice. Other than five holes yesterday, I played awesome. 
So today, 18 holes were just a little bit more steady. I hit more fairways, hit more greens. Just kind of played a little bit smarter, and then when I could, I tried to make something happen.

Q. You were very impressive your course management today. It's part of your game and you're young; you could be more impulsive, but you seem not to be.
BROOKE HENDERSON: I feel Britt and I came up with a really good strategy for this course over the last week or so, along with Team Canada. I think so far, it's been pretty good. But like I say, there's still lots of golf left and hopefully I'll just continue to play smart but take advantage when I can.

Q. You've been at this format for a couple of days now. How are you finding the Olympic experience?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's a lot of fun. It's really exciting. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of other athletes. The Olympic Village is very cool. I've just been trying to enjoy myself and I'll be doing the same over the next three days that I'm here.

Q. What did you hit on 17 and 18?
BROOKE HENDERSON: 17 I just hit a knock‑down pitching wedge and a knock‑down pitching wedge again.

Q. Can you remember having such a strong finish?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think so. I tend to come on strong at the end. But no, that was definitely probably one of the better ones.

Q. Going on to the course as a major championship, do you feel different from last year? Do you feel more inner strength? Do you feel a bit more confidence?
BROOKE HENDERSON: For sure. Some days more than others but definitely I've gained a lot of confidence over the last 18 months. World Rankings has helped that and just more experience with the best players in the world on the LPGA. Yeah, I feel like I'm getting better and improving.

Q. Is it your sister on the bag?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yes.

Q. So do you guys get on really well? Is there any fighting on the way around?
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, we're pretty good. She's my best friend, my sister. She happens to be my caddie, as well. It works out really well. We'd better not get into any arguments because we're together 24/7, so so far, so good.

Q. Any interactions with other athletes in the village?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Not really. We're just kind of doing our own thing but enjoying seeing them around.
