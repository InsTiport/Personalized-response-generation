Q. So maybe not the best day out there on the golf course for you, but it's a beautiful day.  You've got great fans.  Tell us how things were going for you.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, the fans were unbelievable out there supporting me today.  I had a great group, along with Shanshan and May.  They played great.  It's always fun to watch.
I hit a lot of great shots today and just the putts didn't fall.  Hopefully few more putts drop tomorrow morning and I can climb up that leaderboard a little bit more.
Q. Any spots you can look back to today that you think you might be able to build on for tomorrow, any holes that stood out to you?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Birdie there on 9.  Always helps to finish off the round that way, to get it back under par.  Like I said, I hit a lot of really great shots and the putts just didn't drop today.
Hopefully I can switch things around tomorrow and everything will be good.
