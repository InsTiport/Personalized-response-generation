Q. 3-under par first round.  Brooke, before we get to today's round, talk about the reception back home after last week's victory tying with Sandra Post, Mike Weir, and George Knudsen.  What have the messages from home been like?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's been amazing support from Canada, family, friends, all over the place.  Really just happy for me and our support team that has worked really hard for this.  I'm just really excited for the opportunity to have tied them.  Hopefully I can get a win here in the near future.
Q. When you do, you'll be the most record setting Canadian golfer in history.  It was a year ago here you met the most famous Canadian athlete in Wayne Gretzky, and you had a chance to spend some time with him yesterday.  What are those exchanges like?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Again, just so amazing.  To be in the same room or same presence as him is unreal.  To have him come up and congratulate me and say it was fun to watch is really cool to me.
Just to see him out here enjoying the game of golf too is cool.
Q. After the amount of mental and physical energy it takes to compete and win like you did last week, how do you gear up for the next week?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, you know, I try to take it easy.  Easter Sunday, Easter Monday just tried to get a lot of rest in.  I feel like my game is in really good shape.  Mentally if I can perform as well as I did last year I feel can put myself in contention this week.
Looking forward to that opportunity.
