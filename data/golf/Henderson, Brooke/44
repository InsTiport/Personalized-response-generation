 Q.  Solid opening round for you.  Are you happy with the way you played out there?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think solid is a good way to describe it.  Nothing was really happening too much the first, I guess, 14 holes or so.  I was just sort of making some key saves when I needed them, but just hitting the ball in good places and giving myself some looks, and it was really nice to finish with two birdies at 15 and 16 and kind of get my round to -3, and I feel like that's a good position going into the next three days.   
 Q.  How has the course been playing today?  It's kind of been different conditions every day.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was so soft.  You can really attack pins out here, which is sort of weird for me, even in the fairways.  It's firming up maybe a little bit, but still really soft.  It's a lot of drivers, which is good for me.   
 Q.  And playing a tree-lined course like you see all the time, you really like those types of courses, so were you really excited to see The Open come back here this year?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: For sure.  Yeah, I'm very happy to see the tee-lined courses.  I played solid, and hopefully I can just improve a little bit over the next couple days.   
 Q.  What was the atmosphere like out there today?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was awesome.  Playing with Georgia, the crowds were amazing right from the start, and it was really cool to play with her in that kind of atmosphere.
