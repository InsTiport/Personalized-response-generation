 Q.  How tough was the wind?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was really tough.  The wind has been my big challenge.  But it was a lot of fun.  Going into today I just wanted to see the wind as something exciting and something to really play well in, and I did that so far.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, definitely trajectory of your shots you need to pay attention to, and just where you're landing on the green it is really important.  Even putts today were (indiscernible)  I was playing on a couple breaks, and you just really have to pay attention.   
 Q.  First round like today, do you look at the leaderboard to see how the other players are playing in the tough conditions?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I definitely was today because I thought I was playing pretty well to shoot minus 3, and I see scores better than I am up there.  I know these girls are really good and conditions like this don't bother them too much.   
 Q.  We heard all last week at the Masters in windy conditions that the secret to playing well in the wind oftentimes is hitting the ball solid.  You're known to be a ball-striking.  Do you think that's an asset as this progresses?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I definitely think so.  You know, I'm really excited to be in the position I'm in right now and really looking forward to the next three days.   
 Q.  Happy with that?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I am.  I am pretty happy with that today.  I thought I played pretty well.  There was a couple loose shots on my back nine that maybe I would like to clear up on the range later today.   
But for the most part, hit it pretty well and I'm happy.   
 Q.  How much of a challenge was the wind?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was really windy today.  Even on putts I was mentioning I was playing with a break that wasn't really there just because of the wind.   
Yeah, just trying to pay attention to all the conditions and hit good shots.   
 Q.  You have to control the ball in the air and on the greens when it's blowing like this.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I think Brit and I did a really good job today of calculating wind and knowing where to land the ball.  I think if can just we continue to do that, be a good next three days.   
 Q.  (Question regarding clubs. )  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, like I said, I think we did a pretty good job of picking the right clubs and landing it in the right spots.   
 Q.  You touched upon playing the qualifier last year.  Did you adjust your approach as far as how you want to attack this course?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Not really.  It was pretty quick last year when I was here, so this year I wanted to get here kind of early and get to see the golf course a couple more times just to come up with a solid game plan.   
Last year in the qualifier it wasn't that windy, so coming here this year it was kind of a little bit of a shock to see how windy it actually is.   
But, yeah.  (Laughing.)   
 Q.  Couple bogeys early in the round but you steadied yourself out there.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, and I made a lot of good putts to save par or to make birdie.  You know, bogeys are going to come this week, and you just have to prepare for them.  I wanted to get out front early so if I made a few mistakes it wouldn't hurt me too much.   
That kind of happened today with the three birdies on the front nine.
