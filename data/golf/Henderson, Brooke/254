 Q.   How you doing?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   All right.  
   
 Q.   Can you sum up the day for yourself?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I missed a lot (Indiscernible); I made one birdie, so that was a huge factor.   I three‑putted twice so putter wasn't working as well as I wanted it to, but I still had some good holes in there.   At times I felt good, but bogey on the last doesn't help.  
   
 Q.   What happened on the last?   You looked like you were in pretty good shape?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it just was faster than I thought.   Just a little down at the end, and it (No Audio).  
   
 Q.   Were you trying to be safe there though, or were you looking at a birdie at that point?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I wouldn't have minded a birdie, but par was sort of ‑‑  
   
 Q.   Overall, where you sit right now, don't know whether you're in or not, but are you sort of happy with where you're at right now?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I wish I had played a little better today.   That would have helped a lot.   But I have a chance to make the cut and that was my goal.  
   
 Q.   Was it a tough stretch after you started off good?   You had some pars and then you ran into some sand trouble?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I had a couple of wrong club choices there that got me into trouble.   Still the sand traps weren't too difficult but just didn't get up‑and‑down.  
   
 Q.   You looked like you were having fun though even when stuff was going bad there you and Brittany were having fun a couple times like on the second tee and stuff.   It was fun?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, yeah, definitely it's a lot of fun out there.   It's a beautiful golf course, and it's just a pleasure to be out here, so it's good.  
   
 Q.   Was there an ongoing joke or was it something‑‑ like it was on the second tee?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I don't know.   There are a few things going on.  
   
 Q.   Funny faces in the crowd or anything?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, no, none of that.  
   
 Q.   Just the whole start time today, getting up, what time did you get up?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   5:00.  
   
 Q.   Was that tough or did you bounce right out of bed?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   It wasn't too bad.   I've had some early tee times the last month or so, so I'm getting used to it.   But we're done pretty early now.   What time is it?   
   
 Q.   It's like noon, I think?  
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's perfect, get some practice in.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to practice?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Oh, I'll practice for a little bit.  
   
 Q.   Do you have to get something to eat, I guess, in your system?   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I had breakfast this morning.  
   
 Q.   Okay.   
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Then I just tried to eat throughout the round.
