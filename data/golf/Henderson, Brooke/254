Q.   How did it feel? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   It was a little rough.   Struggled on the greens today, but hopefully I'll get on the putting green and be more aware of the slopes.   Pretty fast on some of them.

Q.   Was the speed that really confounded you? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, a little bit.   My pace was off today.   So I'll see if I can straighten it up for tomorrow.

Q.   Keeping it below the hole is sort of the name of the game on a lot of these greens?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   For sure, especially on the front nine.   You have four or five that you have to stay below the hole to give yourself a chance.   I did that pretty well.   I was seeing the ball pretty well, but the putting just wasn't there.

Q.   On 9 you hit a pretty good shot.   You were above the hole there too, weren't you?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Exactly.   I ended up three‑putting from 15 feet, so that's not very good.

Q.   Did you feel like you had a lot of support out there? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.   I had two members from my club that flew up to watch this week.   My aunt and uncle and my mom and dad, so lot of family support and a lot of support from the fans, for sure. 
It was an amazing experience overall.

Q.   So what is the mindset for tomorrow's second round now? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I don't know.   I just want to see if I can play better.   I hit the ball well, just want to make a few more putts.

Q.   Were you nervous?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Was I or am I? 

Q.   Are you nervous; were you nervous? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, a little bit.   I was just really excited and really looking forward to today.   On the first tee I was a little bit, but then I was calming down a little bit.

Q.   Are you surprised by all the attention you've been getting or did you know it was coming? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, a couple people back home mentioned it to me.   It's all right.

Q.   How was it playing with Alena? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Oh, it was so much fun.   She's so nice and a great player too.   I'm glad I got my first LPGA event playing with her and Mo Martin.   It was awesome.

Q.   You were talking to A.J. a bit out there too.   Did that help to calm you down at all? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.   She is a great player and still is.   She was on the bag today, but she's amazing.   I want to be able to learn from her and take tips from her for sure.

Q.   There were some shots and putts that you didn't like.   Were there any shots that you did like that you remember? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.   On the par‑5, I was hitting the ball pretty well.   On the front nine I got pretty close.   Missed both, actually, but I missed the one that was pretty short, but that's okay.

Q.   Do you feel like you belong? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, there are definitely things that I can learn from them.   Definitely I'm going to take this experience so I can feel more comfortable in later years.

Q.   You seem to be intense out there.   I only saw you crack a few smiles.   I wonder is that intensity from your parents or is that something you've always had? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I don't know.   I think it was just today.   I'm usually not that intense.

Q.   Because you wanted to do so well on a big stage like this? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I just wanted to play well.   A few putts got away from me.   But, no, it was a lot of fun.   I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   You finished early, what is the plan for the rest of the day, practice? 
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, practice a little bit, and maybe rest a little while.
