Q. Brooke, what are your off-season plans?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Nothing too much.  I have some sponsor days to do.  I'll do some charity events and just kind of relax and get ready for next year.
Q. Stay down here.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yep, stay down here.
Q. What do you want to work on?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I mean, every off-season you got to try to sit down and realize where some of your weaknesses are and where you want to get better for next year.
For me, I think just consistency.  My driver and long game has been really good.  That's kind of my strengths for sure.  But around the greens I want to improve a little bit, so I'll work with my dad and my sister to try to get that a little bit better.
