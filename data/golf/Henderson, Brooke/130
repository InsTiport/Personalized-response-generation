Q. How was it out there?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was really good.  Any time you can shoot 2-under in the first round of a major championship, that's great.
I had great playing partners.  I felt like we were all playing well.  We were having opportunities at different holes.  I feel like we fed off each other a little bit.
The scores, some were really low out there.  I imagine some are not so low.  It's a really tough golf course.  I'm happy with 2-under and hopefully I can repeat that tomorrow.
Q. Did the course toughen up as the morning went on?  Some people got really low and then they just stopped.
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a little bit soften in the morning.  The wind kicked in near the end of my back nine.  All those factors kind of make the scores go a little bit higher.  With it being so hot today, I think the rest of the afternoon groups might have that factor to deal with, as well.
Q. Conditions change very much from practice rounds to today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I didn't find it too much.  The greens I found were faster.  But they were the little bit softer just because I was playing so early in the morning.  It all evens out really well.
Amazing golf course.  Extremely difficult.  As long as you hit it in the right places of the tee and the right places on the green, you give yourself a good opportunity to shoot a decent score.
Q. What part of your game are you happiest with right now?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I'm hitting the ball really well.  I feel like my lag putting has really kicked in to be a lot better than it was at the beginning of the year.  With those two combinations, I feel like I'm confident on longer par-4s and par 3s, which is always a good feeling.
