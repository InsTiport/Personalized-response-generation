Q. Well played today.  The highlight of your front nine had to be that par-5.  What did you hit into 7?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I had 6-iron in there.  I was able to hit it just a few feet and tap it in for eagle.  That was really momentum for me to just get my round to 6-under.
Going into today I just wanted to make a lot of birdies and try to make a climb up the leaderboard, and I was able to do that.
Q. You've got a new driver in the bag that's given you a few extra yards, which certainly helps around this track.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  I feel like long hitters here's, and when you're hitting it straight, you definitely have an advantage.  I've been trying to do that this week, and so far so good.
Q. How much longer are you hitting it?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, just a few more yards, but I'm getting closer to 250 carry.  I'm really happy with that.  Hopefully over the next few years gain a little bit more.
Q. Playing very well.  Going into the final round, you will likely be on the front page of the leaderboard.  There are plenty of birdies and eagles to be happy, but have to get off to a fast start looking at how well everybody else is playing?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  There are lots of birdies out here.  Winners are always near the 20s.  Trying to just get a fast start and birdie the 1st hole tomorrow and see what happens.
Q. It's only 2:15.  What's the plan?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Foot massage.  Pretty excited about that.  Dinner, rest, and get ready for tomorrow.
