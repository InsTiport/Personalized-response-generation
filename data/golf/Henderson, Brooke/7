  THE MODERATOR:   Brooke, nice 6-under 66 on moving day.  You really like moving day.  Take me through just the day with seven birdies.
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it was a much better day today.  I felt like everything was kind of working for me.  It was really nice to see some putts go in.
 I was 4-under through the first seven holes so thought it would be something really special.  Had one bogey there.  Kind of set me back for a few holes, but was happy to finish with 6-under.
 Just really excited to be back closer to the top of the leaderboard and look forward to tomorrow.
 Q. Was there a birdie that stood out when you look back on it?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   I feel like just right I was making some putts, like 15, 20-footers, and that's just a really nice way to get some momentum, especially I feel like when my putter is rolling I can really climb the leaderboard, which makes it really fun.
 Q. What is it about this course specifically really has your eye?  You seem to do well here obviously.
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   I feel like every year I get a little bit more comfortable out here, learn the course a little bit more, which is good.  And working hard with Brit, my caddie, and also my dad, my coach, is usually out here, too.  Just trying to get a better plan and strategize our way around here.
 I just -- every hole I feel like there is opportunity for birdie, so that makes it really exciting when you step up to every tee.
 Q. With no fans this year you've been asked that question, but when you walk up 18 and you don't have the grandstand and the entourage, how many different is it from your vantage point?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, it's very strange not to see the big stands.  Normally there is a lot the snowbirds, Canadians following me around all four days, so it's definitely been strange.
 I really miss the energy and the little bit of adrenaline that the fans bring, but at the end of the day it's just a competitive round and you're just trying to do the best you can.
 Q. Sei Young is up five now.  She's still got some work left.  Is it good not to be in final group, and will that help you focus on just trying to take a shot or a hole at a time and maybe check the leaderboard on the back and see if you chipped away at it?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, for sure.  Sei Young has been playing great the last few months especially and sort of running away with some events.  Sort of looks like it's going to happen again.
 At the same time, just got to do all I can.  Hit fairways, greens, and try to make as many birdies and try to maybe make her nervous by creeping up behind her.
 No, she's playing great and it's fun to watch.
 Q. Can you make Sei Young nervous?
 BROOKE HENDERSON:   (Laughter.)  Here's hoping.  I have no idea though.  No, she's just been on a roll playing so great and it's really cool.
