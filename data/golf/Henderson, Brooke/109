Q. Here with Brooke Henderson out at Diamond Resorts Invitational. Playing amazing today. Tied for fifth. How much fun was that out there playing alongside Mike Flaskey and John Cook? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was awesome. Such great guys, both John and Mike. They played well at times, and they were making some birdies out there, which is always great. I felt like my game was in a good spot, and I was trying to make as many birdies as I could. Left a couple putts dead in the center and just a little bit short. So hopefully, I'll fix that for tomorrow. 

Q. When we talked earlier this week, you mentioned how long this course is playing. How tough of a challenge is it out there for you this week? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure. There's no roll. So the 6,600 that we're playing, it plays very long. I felt like I played pretty well in it today. With the wind, some of the holes were extremely downwind and some were extremely into the wind. I think it's supposed to be a little calmer tomorrow. So it should be good.

Q. All the other girls are playing with celebrities, but you are grouped with one of the PGA Champions Tour players in John Cook. What was that like playing alongside another pro? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: That was really cool. I feel like I learned a lot from him. I respect him. I respect everybody out here, but especially a Champions Tour player with all the wins that he's had on the PGA TOUR and the Champions Tour. So that was really fun for me. And Mike as well, the CEO of Diamond Resorts. He's had such an impact on this event, and so amazing. I'm just glad I'm a part of it.

Q. You're off to a great start over here. What's your game plan for the weekend? 
BROOKE HENDERSON: Just keep doing what I'm doing. Hopefully make a few more putts tomorrow and see what happens.
