Q. A round of 64, were you aware that you were 8-under par on 17?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I had a great day going and made a lot of birdies. It was a lot of fun. Felt like Britt and I were judging the wind really well and hitting great shots, which is always great. To finish out making a few putts was really nice.
Q. Do you get nervous? You've shot 64 a number of times before, but were you thinking you had the chance to go really low?
BROOKE HENDERSON: No, you know, I love seeing my name near the top of the leaderboard and trying to chase down the leaders, I was trying to go low today and make something happen. Just trying to chase some birdies.
17 tee wasn't nice to me yesterday so I was trying to make a better shot there and was able to do that maybe that was the only tee shot that give me a little bit of nerves coming down the stretch.
Q. You and your sister worked really close and she helped you with your putts?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, she's already reading putts for me, which is really helpful. Even tee shots and approach shots, we're always talking through all the different factors and just trying to get the right club and the right number. So I'm really grateful that I have her by my side.
Q. Being on the golf course for five hours at a time, you can't be concentrating all the time. What do you guys talk about?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I don't even know but it's just so nice to have somebody that knows you so well, and you can kind of just talk about whatever. She also know when is not to say anything, which I think is really key.
Q. The details on the eagle, what were they?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Tee shot in the fairway, hit 3-wood to the green. I think it was 225 pin into the wind. Went to like five feet, which is really nice.
Q. This is your third week in Asia. Have you been enjoying your time and are you holding up okay?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it's been really awesome. It's really fun and it's such an amazing experience to come over here to China and Korea and here in Taiwan. Been able to sight see a little bit, too, which is really cool. We're excited to go back to Florida next week, but we've really enjoyed it. It would be really nice to finish off strong this week.
