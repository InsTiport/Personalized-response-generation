Q. How fun was that to battle with MJ all day, and Shanshan?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was definitely -- I think the lead switched many times out there.  5-under is a solid round for me and I'm happy with that.  I would've liked to have finished with a few more birdies.  Left one on 17 and kind of gave 18 away.
MJ played awesome, and so did Shanshan.  So, yeah, it's always a lot of fun to be right in the mix like that and have really good competitors right there, too.
Q. I guess talk about the finish.  Lipped out on 17 and then 18 in the bunker.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, definitely not the finish this I was looking for.  Yeah, kind of let them both slip away.  I guess that's what tomorrow is for.  Hopefully get a couple quick birdies and get back in.
Q. Does that make you excited to get back out there?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.  I think when you finish like that it does give you a little bit more excitement looking forward to tomorrow.  Especially being the final round.  Really looking forward to it.
Q. What do you think have to do to be in the winners' circle?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think the winner tomorrow is going to shoot a really low score.  I don't think anybody is going to run away with it necessarily.  I think it'll be really tight right down until the end.  So making lots of birdies and playing smart all the way around.
