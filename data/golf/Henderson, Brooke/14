Q. I don't know if there's ever been a player in the history of golf, period, who's gone from their first missed cut in a major to a T2 finish.  Truly awesome week for you overall.  How does it feel?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I definitely played really well this week, which is definitely a really nice feeling and definitely gives me confidence moving forward.  Mirim played great today and so did Nelly.  It was fun.  You're playing against the best in the world out there, and it's tough to lose that way.
I felt like I missed a lot of putts, especially those final rounds where I feel like maybe it could have been a different story, but Mirim and Nelly played great, and I really fought my way around, so I'm happy.
