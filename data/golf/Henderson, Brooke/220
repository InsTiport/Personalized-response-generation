 Q. How do you feel about your round out there today?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a lot of fun, and I hit the ball really well. A couple shots I didn't hit that well, I got some lucky breaks. I had a great group, and on a beautiful golf course, I can't complain too much.  
   
 Q. You had a one‑shot lead coming into today, and even at the turn you were still just leading by one. Now you have a five‑stroke lead heading into Sunday. Was that kind of a plan of yours to stay aggressive and try and increase your lead as much as possible?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, exactly. The bigger the lead, probably the better for me. I'm really excited. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, and I was trying to get it pretty deep under par today, and hopefully, like I said, I can do something tomorrow.  
   
 Q. You were in a similar position earlier this year at Swinging Skirts and it looks like you're actually going to be paired with Morgan Pressel there again, someone that you've talked about looking up to. Do you think you'll be more comfortable having that experience, now being paired with her again, or does it kind of make you nervous?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm definitely a lot more comfortable this time around. I have looked up to her since I was a young girl, so I think in San Francisco I was a little bit more nervous, but this time I'm ready to go.  
   
 Q. Do you have a game plan for tomorrow?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I do. I think all week I've been doing good things, and the 68 in the Monday qualifier a couple days ago, and if I can, just stick to my game plan and keep hitting good shots.
