Q. 6-under on your closing nine, which was the front nine, a big putt on the last hole of the day.  How much momentum can you carry into tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Oh, yeah, my front nine was a little bit rough, but I was happy to get a lot of birdies on the back nine and get myself back into it.  It was a lot of fun.  I just feel like I was hitting the ball great and making a lot of putts, so hopefully waking up early tomorrow morning and getting the next round started, it'll carry on.
Q. You just recently made a putter change.  I guess gradually you would think you would build some confidence.  How confident are you now?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I love it.  It was great today.  I felt very confident with it, felt like I could make good strokes, and I felt like I was seeing the line well, too, which all those things are great things to see it well.
Q. This is a golf course that's playing a little bit longer not only because of the distance but also the soft conditions.  A lot of the players on the front page of the leaderboard like you are long hitters.  How much do you feel like that helps you today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I feel like that was really beneficial.  None of the par-5s I can really get to in two, but there's some long par-4s out here, and having a few shorter clubs than my competitors I feel like is a big advantage, and I can take some bunkers out of play, too, which makes the fairway a lot wider, which is a good thing.
Q. What was the story of the day?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it was kind of a rough start, two bogeys right off the bat, and then I just kind of fought my way back, made a birdie on my ninth hole of the day.  I got it to 1-over, and I just tried to make a lot of birdies on my back nine, and I was able to do that.  I shot a 30 on the back nine, which gives me a lot of confidence and momentum going into tomorrow, which is nice.
Q. What was the turning point?  Did you say something to yourself?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I was just trying to have a really good, solid score today, and with starting the first two holes like that, it kind of dropped your momentum a little bit, but Brit helped me through it a little bit, and we just started grinding away on my front nine, then slowly things started to turn around, started to hit it a little bit better, was able to roll in a putt on my ninth hole right there, and then I felt like from here on in, something good could happen, and I started to hit it really close and was able to make a few putts.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
BROOKE HENDERSON: I did miss the fairway on the first hole, and I guess missed both greens, but then the rest of the day, I think I hit almost every green.
Q. So what did Brit say to you to fire you up or --
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I think that's one thing about having my sister on the bag is she always knows the right thing to say.  I don't really remember anything specifically, but just kind of getting me to calm down and relax a little bit and just to believe that I could finish strong.
Q. How long was the putt on the last hole?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was 16 paces, so it was really long.
Q. How many mud balls?
BROOKE HENDERSON: A lot.  Like every hole.
Q. Everybody has been talking about that.  How difficult is it to stay patient when you see mud on the golf ball and you're not 100 percent sure where it's going to go?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, fortunately it wasn't huge pieces.  They didn't seem to affect it too much, but just following the general rules; if it's on the right side, you're going to hit it left, and vice versa.
Q. You talked about the putter change; when did you change, and what's your new model?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I changed it on Monday for the CVS Health Charity Classic, and it seemed to work out all right there playing with Billy and Keegan, and I think just playing with the men, it's really exciting, and it kind of makes you have to make a lot of birdies and kind of puts a lot of -- not pressure on your game but just makes you want to play a little bit better.  So I think coming into this event, it kind of gave me that little bit of extra boost, and to see all those putts going in on the back nine was really cool.
Q. You did that last year where you won and kind of carried that momentum into this tournament.  Do you feel like that helped again this year, that you're working on some momentum from that?
BROOKE HENDERSON: From CVS?
Q. Yeah.
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.  The first year I played in it, I won Portland the next week, I won Meijer the week previous to playing in it last year.  So I don't know, maybe something good will happen in the next couple weeks.
Q. What's the difference between the two putters?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, one was a blade and this one is a mallet, so it's a pretty big change.  I think this one actually might be an inch or two longer and a different grip.  So it's like basically everything is different, which I think is a good thing.
