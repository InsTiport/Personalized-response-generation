Q. Eight birdies, 7-under total.  What was different for you out there today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, I started hitting the ball really well right after the bat.  Birdie on the first hole, which is always nice and then I just kind of got momentum and kept riding it the rest of the day, which is really cool.
My front nine was awesome.  My back nine, not as great.  Would have liked to maybe finish with one or two more but overall I'm happy.
Q. How was today different from playing in the cold and wind the first two rounds?
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was a nice break from the freezing cold and really windy.  I think you'll notice the leaderboard, there's a lot lower scores, and you had to shoot a good number just to hold your position.
So I feel like I capitalized today really well, so yeah, hopefully I'll just do something similar tomorrow.
Q. What is your strategy going into tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, if the weather is like this, just to make a lot of birdies and see if I can climb up the leaderboard a little bit more.
Q. How are you feeling about just the start of the fall Asia Swing?  It's a lot of time.
BROOKE HENDERSON: It's always a lot of fun.  Everything's very different.  I mean, travelling to all these different countries and experiencing so many amazing things.  Britt and I just try to treat it as like a mini-vacation, but to get some good rounds in play this week is really important, and I'm just excited for the next upcoming weeks.
Q. How do you manage to adapt to the time difference and different types of food and cuisines and things like that?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I think the time change thing is always a work-in-progress.  I don't think there's really a key to it.  I think we've done a good job this week just forcing ourselves to stay awake till a good time and then trying to sleep through the night.  So far, feeling good.
