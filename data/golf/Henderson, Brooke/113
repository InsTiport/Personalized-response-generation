Q. A little bit of a difficult start, but you steadied things out.  How did you feel about your round today?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, the first four holes are really tough on this golf course, so if you can get through them okay you can make birdies coming in.
I was 1-over but didn't panic too much.  I had a couple par-5s I knew I could reach.  You know, 2-under it's a solid day.  I would've liked to be a little better, but can't complain too much.
Just hopefully I'll play a little better the next three days.
Q. When you're in the position that you're in given everything that's at stake if you win, do you find it difficult not to sort of have looks at the leaderboard or is it too early to think about that?
BROOKE HENDERSON: I leaderboard watch all the time if I'm in contention or not, so I was always looking at it throughout the day.  It's just the first round.  There are three days left.  If I can make a few more putts, few more birdies, I think good things will come my way.
Q. What kind of improvements do you think you need to make?
BROOKE HENDERSON: Just small things.  Couple miss-hit shots.  You know, on the par-5, 17 I was pin high like 28 feet for eagle.  Came away with par.  Little things like that could have changed my day.
That's what I'm hoping to do starting tomorrow.
