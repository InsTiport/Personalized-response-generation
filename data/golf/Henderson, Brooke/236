  MODERATOR:   Happy to be joined in the media center by leader after three rounds, Brooke Henderson, sitting at 9‑under.
    How was it out there today? 
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   You know, it was a great day out there.   It was really tough conditions and I was able to play really well.   Couple times my short game needed to bail me out, and it was able to do that, especially the first 16 holes. 
    The last two, unfortunately I dropped two shots.   Overall it was a great day, and I'm really happy to be where I am.   If someone told me at the beginning of the week I would be leading going into the final round, I would've taken it. 
    MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, off the tee I just hit it a little bit left.   Thought it was still going to be okay.   Actually, when I got down there I was pretty happy because it was pretty flat considering that fairway really slopes downhill. 
    With that lie, right before I hit the shot I was like, Just hit it into the front left bunker, because if I miss this just a little bit short right, it's coming back 70 yards away from the green. 
    In my mind it was just like, Get it up into that front left bunker, and I came up a little bit short.
    That chip, you know, I didn't see it when I was going up to the chip and I didn't see it in my swing, but there was something really hard right behind it, so I couldn't get great contact on the ball.
    And then up and down the second try I did a really good job, because that wasn't an easy pitch shot either.
    I think on the clock did have a little bit to do with it.   I was a little bit quicker than I would've been otherwise.   But it was just bad lie fairway which really caused it. 

Q.   What happened on 18?   Seemed like you laid up pretty well to your number.   Did you just pull that?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   From the fairway I thought it was going to be a pretty good shot.   Once I saw it clear the hill just in front of the green I thought, Okay, this is going to be good.   I didn't hear any claps from the side of the green, so I like uh‑oh. 
    Then Bunk turned to me and said it might be a little bit long.   It was a dumb mistake on my part, but as soon as I hit it I thought it was going to be okay. 

Q.   There was some talk earlier in this room about how younger players, yourself, Lydia, may be naive to pressure.   Lydia said that's not true.   She feels the pressure almost every shot.   How do you deal with it?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I agree with her for sure.   Obviously I'm not in the same boat as she is and had the great success she is, but very similar.
    Back home in Canada I have received a lot of pressure from Canada for the last couple years.   If you have pressure it means you're doing something right.   I try and use it to my advantage and try and use it to help me get better. 

Q.   How close are you with Morgan Pressel?   She was in your and Lydia's shoes almost a decade ago.   Has she given you any advice?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Growing up she was my biggest role model other than my sister.   I always looked up to her.   I met her probably when I was around eight years old.   That was so cool.   She spent a little extra time with me than the other girls, which I thought was really neat. 
    The playing with her in the U.S. Women's Open in 2013 was an amazing experience.   I made the cut for the first time on the LPGA, and she was my playing partner on the Saturday.
    Ever since then she's been very kind to me.   I've still always been a little nervous around her because I've looked up to her my whole life, but I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   Where was that eight‑year‑old meeting?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Ottawa, Canada. 

Q.   On your third shot on 17, how was that lie? 
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   I didn't see it until I hit my shot, but right when I made contact there was something hard just under the heel of the club so I couldn't get clean contact on the ball.
    Sort of went low left and ran to the green.

Q.   Kind of on a broader question, what was your disappointment level when you didn't get the age‑limit waiver?   Do you think that will change if you win tomorrow?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   I mean, a rule is a rule.   Everything happens for a reason.   It just wasn't my time and it wasn't meant to be.
    I respect that decision by the commissioner and I respect everybody that had a say in it.   But I'm hoping to play out here on the LPGA someday, and hopefully sooner than later.

Q.   What was your decision on when you decided to turn pro?   Since you didn't get the waiver, why turn pro in December?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Well, I knew I was going to be in the U.S. Women's Open, and I thought I could get a couple more sponsors exemptions and Monday qualify.   So I thought I could have a pretty full schedule just mixture of tours and traveling around.
    And being the No. 1 amateur position, I thought I was ready to go to the next stage.   I thought I could compete out here, and I'm really glad I made that decision. 

Q.   Lastly, do you feel 17?   Does Morgan seem 26 to you?
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   No, I definitely don't feel 17.   I love still hanging with my friends and talking to them.   I don't feel like any of us are 17.   Age isn't really a thing I think about, and I don't really think it's a factor in anything. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Older. 
    MODERATOR:   Appreciate the time.   Best of luck tomorrow. 
    BROOKE HENDERSON:   Thank you.
