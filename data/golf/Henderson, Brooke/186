 Q.  What happened on the double bogey for you?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I just didn't really take my time too much on the tee shot.  You know, kind of -- I set my target and then just didn't really commit to it, which is a problem for anybody, but especially for me.   
So I just mishit it.  Unfortunately hit the bank and bounced back in.  Would've been nice to get up and down there, but after that, you know, double is definitely in the question.   
So I just tried to regroup a little bit after that and was able to make one more birdie coming in.   
 Q.  That was on 16, right?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  When you hit the pin there a little.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah.   
 Q.  Golf guts helped you out there a little?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure.   
 Q.  Do you think the ball would've gone over if you(indiscernible)?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I mean, that first hop was huge.  It landed like six yards short of the pin.  I am very fortunate to hit the pin and stop there.  Making the putts was really big.   
But the course has just changed so much since Friday morning and even the beginning of the week.  It's so firm and really fast right now, so I think somebody that plays the conditions really well tomorrow will play well.   
 Q.  Were you pretty happy overall with your round or were there things you would like to tighten up?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.  I played pretty awful today.  Definitely want to play better tomorrow.  I mean, I hit a lot of good shots.  I just didn't capitalize on my chances.  That was the first 12 holes for me.   
And then just really that one bad hole kind of changed things around a little bit.  You know, get off to a fast start tomorrow and see what happens.   
 Q.  Given the firmness of the course and two-shot lead, do you play a little more sort of more par golf?  What kind of approach do you take?  Feel like you still have to put the pedal to the metal?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I still like my game plan right now.  I think there are definitely holes where par is good; just kind of get in and out.   
There are definitely still a lot of birdie opportunities out there.  If you're hitting the ball well and hitting it in the right spots you can definitely still shoot a low score.  You just got to be careful of the conditions.   
 Q.  Was today more the course, or do you think it was the three of you?  Sometimes when you're battling and everybody is up there, you kind of...  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.   
 Q.  Nobody did lots.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, nobody was really playing well, and sometimes that does affect you in a way.  But at the end of the day, we just didn't have our best games.  Hopefully tomorrow all three of us will.   
 Q.  If you shoot 70 tomorrow, what do you think your chances are?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: No.  It would have to be pretty far under par, I would think.  I haven't looked at the scoreboard.  I know I'm two shots ahead of one person, but after that I have no idea.  I think at this point there are still a lot of people that could win.  Just have to go out and post a good score.
