 Q.  Yesterday for today you said make better decisions, move up the leaderboard. Seems like you checked all the boxes today.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure. Sort of a slow front nine, wasn't really getting anything rolling too much, but the back nine I'm really pleased with. Shot 4 under, I guess, and a lot of them came in the last few holes there. I was trying to make something happen there in the back nine. I'm happy with how I finished. Would have liked to make maybe a few more putts, but overall it's a great start to the year.   
 Q.  How long was that putt on 16 for the eagle?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Eight paces so --   
 Q.  24, 25 feet?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yes.   
 Q.  How far did you hit it in there? It says 330 on the sign.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Oh, I hit smoke driver (laughter). Yeah, yesterday it was 270 to the front, and I think today we were back a little bit from that. It was a good strike. I was happy.   
 Q.  To come out of a long time away from tournament golf and to finish in the top five, what does that do to you kind of mentally to say, hey, the things I worked on in the off-season clicked, at least for this week?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, for sure. I had three really solid rounds. One not so good, but overall a lot of good things to take away. A lot of momentum going into this week as well. I feel like my game's in a really good spot. I feel like ball striking was really good for me this week. If it wasn't for a few mental errors and a few putts, it could have been a different story for sure.   
 Q.  The driving was outstanding, really kind of set everything up for you. Did you change anything over the off-season or just status quo?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I just tried to get a little bit stronger, and I feel like it actually has helped me become more consistent. It's really nice. I feel like just putting in some hard work before this week, it paid off in the ball striking area for sure. Cleaned some things up around the greens, and I think this will be a good year.   
 Q.  At what point in the round did you kind of feel like, oh, I could win? I could win all of a sudden.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I saw Inbee had fallen back to 11 early, and I was like, wow, the door is sort of wide open. Nothing really seemed to fall right away, but just tried to keep pushing and keep fighting and to make some putts, make some birdies. Luckily, the par 5s were really good to me today. I was able to capitalize on those.   
 Q.  So what would it have been, like around 13 or so?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm trying to think.   
 Q.  You got within two. You had the birdie putt on 15 as well, which I think would have got you within one.  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, right in there, I knew I was right in it. I just needed to make something. They just seemed to be missing pretty close, actually. They looked to be really good putts. So I was just trying to push and make some putts. Unfortunately, it didn't happen. Like I said, I'm happy with this week, and hopefully just be a little better next week.
