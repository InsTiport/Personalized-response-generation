Q. Brooke, what a great round today.  May I ask was anything different today than the previous two days?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I just hit the ball a little bit closer today, so putting was a lot easier on me.  I had a few tap-ins, which is nice, and gave me a lot of momentum.
Tough to make par on 17 thereafter hitting the green.  Generally and overall I'm really happy how today went.  Definitely a lot better than yesterday, and hopefully I will do something similar tomorrow.
Q. Is the game plan going to stick for tomorrow?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I think so.  After all the rain today it was a little bit softer, which definitely proved to be better scoring conditions.  So going into tomorrow I think we can attack a little bit more.
Q. Some players didn't expect the rain at all.  Did you expect the weather to be like it is today?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   No.  Brit told me around 1:00 and it was like raining when I first walked on onto the range this morning.
So wasn't expecting it, but like I said, it kind of made the course more scorable and more birdie opportunities.
Q. I don't know if you realize it, but you're kind of a bad weather player.
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah.
Q. Every time we've had miserable weather you shine.  What is it about that?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Just probably just growing up in Canada.  You get all kinds of different weather.  And I feel like I know that I've played well in the past in poor conditions, like New Zealand for example.  Maybe the worst I've played and I ended up winning that event.
I feel like I have some confidence knowing I can perform well.  Also, I just try to grind it out a little bit and see if I can move up the leaderboard.
Q. Does it help again that the greens soften up?  I know you like to throw it at flags and you're able to do that when it's softer.
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, absolutely.  This is perfect weather to be able to attack pins.  That made it really fun today, and I was definitely was able to take advantage on a few holes.
Q. Do you feel like was the biggest challenge last year in 2020?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I think for me, I went back home to Canada right when the pandemic was first hit the United States.  It was just the uncertainty of if we were going to play at all last year.
And just seeing how much the world was suffering, it was really difficult to see and still so many challenges people have right now.  I feel like I'm so grateful to be out here playing and to have an opportunity to play an event, make money, play with my friends.
Hopefully this COVID passes within like the next year or so and we can get back to some sort of normalcy.
Q. With the weird schedule last year, almost two years since your last win.  How have you dealt with that over the last almost two years?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, feels like a long time, so definitely looking forward to when I'm back in contention and able to hoist another trophy.  Yeah, feels like long time, so hopefully I can end that soon.
Q. How much do you dislike losing?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, I don't like it very much.  But at the same time, so talented out here and so deep that if you're getting Top 10s and in contention on the weekend, that's all you can really ask for.
Hopefully you get a couple breaks and are able to make a few putts down the stretch to make it a different story and hopefully hoist that trophy, but any time that my world ranking is where it is and putting myself in good spots, I'm happy.
Q. When you're going low like today, at any point out there did you catch a leaderboard, and is it disheartening to see the leader playing so well?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Going into today I knew I was a lot of shots back, so I kind of just had the mindset of climbing the leaderboard as much as I could, try to make as many birdies as I could.
They were definitely playing well and that's good to see, and hopefully I can get a little bit closer to them tomorrow.
Q. When you see that, is it disheartening at all?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   I mean, it was really scorable today, so you kind of have to expect them to make birdies and go low.  Like I said, I was just trying to make a move myself and I was able to climb a little bit, which was nice.
If I can go out tomorrow and make a few more birdies and maybe get a little bit closer to them, I'll be happy.
Q. What are going to do to relax for tomorrow's round, especially because today is just so damp?
BROOKE HENDERSON:   Yeah, normally I do a little practice afterwards, but I'm going to skip that today and just go home and get dry and maybe read a book.
