 Q.  Brooke Henderson, 7-under for the week here at the Evian Championship.  What are your thoughts on your play?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: You know, coming into the week I wanted to finish at minus 10, so a few shots back from where I wanted, but it played really difficult this week.  The conditions were really tough with the winds a little bit today and the rain and the wet seasons.  You really had to be careful, and this is a hard golf course to begin with.   
But to finish at minus 7 and to see my name up there on the leaderboard again is really a cool feeling, and I'm excited for the Asia Swing.   
 Q.  Another top 10 in a major championship.  That's three this year including your first major win at the KPMG Women's PGA.  What does that mean to you in your first full season on the LPGA that you were able to play so well at the biggest events?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, that's amazing.  That's really cool to hear, and I've had a really good season so far, two wins, including a major championship, and then to have two more top 10s on top of that in majors is awesome.  It definitely gives me a lot of confidence moving forward.  I definitely would have liked to hoist that Rolex Annika Major Award, but maybe next year.
