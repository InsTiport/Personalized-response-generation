 Q.  Have you played with Lexi before?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I have, yeah.   
 Q.  How many times have you played with her before, and what are your impressions of her game?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Probably three or four times, three for sure.  You know, she's an amazing player for sure and can hit the ball a long way, so it's always a lot of fun to play with her.   
 Q.  You were driving it right along with her today, past her a couple times.  How does that feel to be able to keep up with her?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it is pretty cool.  I definitely gained some distance over the off-season, which is always a good thing, and I was pretty accurate all day, too, it was just those last three I kind of got loose and a little bit tired, as well.  But like you said, I was keeping right up, and it was a lot of fun to be up with the big boys.   
 Q.  You're both long hitters and you've gotten a little longer.  I know you don't want to get into a game of long drives, but are you kind of comparing how long you are?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, Lexi is known for the long drives, so to see my ball right up close, it's like, okay, good job, but no, it's just focus on the next shot.   
 Q.  You played with Spurrier yesterday; what was that like?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It was really cool.  He's a legend definitely in this area.  He had a lot of fans, and it might have been the most fun I've had in a pro-am, playing alongside Randy Coates, as well.   
 Q.  Did he talk much?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: He was pretty quiet, but he did talk a little bit more near the end.  Everything he had to say was good.   
 Q.  Someone said you hadn't heard of him?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Well, I was a big University of Florida fan, so I'm sure I've heard of him at some point, but I definitely got a briefing and really realized how amazing he really is.   
 Q.  And you took an official visit there, right?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Unofficial, but I was committed to the University of Florida.   
 Q.  When was that?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I committed in grade 11 and then decommitted right before I turned pro.  I guess we went twice.  Grade 11 year in the winter, so I was 14.
