  BROOKE HENDERSON: Definitely.  I'd say I'm pretty much a hundred percent now.  Really good.  My score today was a little disappointing, considering I was back to even early after yesterday's round. But I feel really good and I think my game is really good.  Hopefully I'll make the cut and make a climb up the leaderboard tomorrow.   Q.  Do you have any pain at all?  BROOKE HENDERSON: No, not at all, which is awesome.   Q.  You kind of laid around for a few days and didn't do anything?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I rested up a little bit, I just wanted to make sure this being such a big week and really important.  I wanted to make sure I was ready to go before I hit balls again.   Q.  Could you mention again what the problem is with your leg?  BROOKE HENDERSON: It was just like bruising, swelling, little scratches, cuts, just like that.   Q.  Have you driven again?  BROOKE HENDERSON: I haven't yet, but I'll be again.   Q.  Left or right?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Left.   Q.  Greens just weren't giving up much today.  You left yourself with so many good looks.  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, I had a lot of great opportunities, especially early and I was able to capitalize on two of them.  But I hit a lot of great shots, and even chip shots, like the one on 1, and even the one on 18 that I thought were going to be perfect.  But I had mud on my ball so it didn't release as much as I thought and I didn't know that when I hit it.  So unfortunately three bogeys on the back nine put me at 3-over.  But like I said, hopefully I'll climb up the leader board a little bit more.   Q.  How much do you feel you're a different player this week than you were last year at this time at the championship?  BROOKE HENDERSON: I'm definitely a lot more solid all around in my game, which is awesome.  And mentally I've become a lot stronger.  I know that I can compete here with a couple of good finishes this year, a third in San Francisco and then T-5 in a major a couple of weeks ago.  I know I can compete here, and I know I have to stay patient and keep working on the things I'm working on and hopeful.   Q.  How special is it your friends made it out and I know you raised a lot of money, as well.  Talk about your relationship?  BROOKE HENDERSON: It's really cool.  They're both my best friends, and I didn't know they were coming, so they sort of surprised me today.  I didn't see them until 17.  They've been out here all day.  It means a lot for both of them to be here.   Q.  Are they both in your class?  BROOKE HENDERSON: They were, yep.   Q.  What are their names?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Allisha Nicholson and Neal Duff.   Q.  For people who don't know, what happened to, was it Neal, I guess was he the one in the accident?  BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, he was playing for Canada's national hockey team out in Saskatchewan in the world juniors and got hit behind the net and unfortunately was very seriously injured.  But he's doing really well right now and recovering very nicely.
