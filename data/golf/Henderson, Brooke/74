 Q.  Two-time champion of the Cambia Portland Classic, off to a great start.  What a quick turnaround from your last week's win from at the CP Women's Open.  How did you feel out there today Brooke?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I felt really awesome, actually.  3-under on the front nine, and I could see the scores were really low today, so I wanted to go low on the back nine.  And I was able to get five birdies and finish at 8-under par today.  I'm really happy with this round and hopefully I can do something similar tomorrow and look forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  The ladies were posting really low scores in the morning.  Did you have a number in mind or any other goals?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: I didn't think that they were going to go that low.  So I kind of had to do some readjusting, I knew that the birdies were out there.  I felt like the pins were in places where you could attack, but you also had to play smart.  And I felt like I did a good job of hitting to the wide parts of the greens and giving ourselves good birdie looks.   
 Q.  We know that you love this golf course.  You've had so much success here, lots of great memories.  Was there anything different or anything that's changed from years past?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Some of the trees aren't as bushy as they were before, so it kind of opens up some sides of the fairways and things.  So I feel a little bit more comfortable over some of the tee shots just because it is such a narrow course.  Overall it's just such an amazing feeling to be back here and just looking forward to the next two days.
