 Q.  A little ways back of the lead, but making the cut, priority No. 1 to try to get something done on the weekend.  How much, when you're playing a tournament before a major, is the next week on your mind like this one?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: It definitely is.  I'm very excited for next week.  Just kind of using this week as a steppingstone and like you said, making the cut was really a big deal today.  I was kind of close to the cut line yesterday after a 1-over round.   
Solid day today, and just a few more putts to hopefully drop on the weekend and moving forward to next week.   
 Q.  What does it say to you and how special to you that your sister, Brittany, has put her playing career on hold to caddie for you this year in an Olympic year and so much more on the line?  
BROOKE HENDERSON: Yeah, it means a lot to me that she's on the bag every single week.  She works really hard and does a really awesome job.  I love having her there and her support means so much.  She's my best friend, my caddie, my sister; she kind of is it all and we have a lot of fun.
