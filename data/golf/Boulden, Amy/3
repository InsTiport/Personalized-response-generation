Q.   How does it feel to be the 2014 Rookie of the Year?
AMY BOULDEN:   Yeah, I'm really thrilled.   It's been a fantastic year for me, and to have captured that title now is a great relief, too. 

Q.   And how do you assess your season overall? 
AMY BOULDEN:   Yeah, it's been fantastic.   My first year on Tour, and not having a full card and starting the year, I'm really pleased.

Q.   What about your OMEGA Dubai Ladies Masters tournament?
AMY BOULDEN:   Yeah, I'm quite pleased.   I finished I think tied 24th in the end and managed to finish 3â€‘under par total. 
So yeah, I'm overall happy with that.   I know there's a lot of pressure coming into this week, so just trying to stay patient and not get too far ahead of myself was the plan.

Q.   And what are your plans for Christmas and the new year now?
AMY BOULDEN:   Some time off with friends and family and then back to some practise in the new year.
