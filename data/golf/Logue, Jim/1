  Q. Well, it was strange. Yesterday on the front nine you were even, today it was your killer. And yesterday the back nine killed you and today you tore it up.   
 JIM LOGUE: It was just one of those things, you're going to play good, you're going to play bad, but the key thing is driving the ball in the fairway.   
 And I was playing, I played pretty well today, I 3-putted the 13th hole and I made 7 on the second or the 8th hole. And other than that I played okay. You hit the ball in the rough, you're just done. I mean, if you hit it in the rough, you couldn't move it. It goes right to the bottom.   
  
  Q. You played a lot of difficult courses in your life and how would you rate this as far as difficulty?  
 JIM LOGUE: Well this, is very fair. I don't think this is brutal like you heard about at Winged Foot, the massacre at Winged Foot or any of those things, but it's very fair, but it's just if you don't hit the shot you're trying to hit -- like on my 35th hole, it was the old second hole, which we're playing as eight, I hit the best tee shot, I just stood there posing and the ball rolls one foot in the rough and I got no swing, I can't move it a hundred yards.   
  
  Q. Oh, man, that's brutal.   
 JIM LOGUE: Yeah, it's just -- it's just part of golf.   
  
  Q. You learn to accept it, I guess at this point.   
 JIM LOGUE: At my age you just plan on it. You know you're not going to beat anybody any more, so.   
  
  Q. Well, but you remain a good competitor.   
 JIM LOGUE: Yeah, I've had some fun, yeah. I had a real good winter and just didn't play very well this week.   
  
  Q. Are you going to play in the Ohio Open?  
 JIM LOGUE: I don't know yet. I'm not sure. I think I plan to, but I'm not positive.
