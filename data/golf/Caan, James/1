   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Christina and James, thanks for coming in and joining us today. We have on the leaderboard here you're the leader in the clubhouse. Looks like a great round out there.
 CHRISTINA KIM: That's through 17 holes. Go check the scoreboard and come back to me. I'm not lying. Wait three minutes until it updates, because I ain't going to say what I did.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Maybe your Pro-Am partner can take us through that.
 JAMES CAAN: She'll knock me out. I ain't telling. First, I started out by hitting a ball out of bounds off 18. So I know we were 7-under and then --
 CHRISTINA KIM: -- weren't.
 JAMES CAAN: And then she hit one off the cart -- her she second shot was an incredible shot off the cart path standing above it. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: And then I hit six more. Not quite so incredible.
 JAMES CAAN: Then she had a lie like this. Just one of those things.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Excuses, excuses.
 JAMES CAAN: Excuses? You didn't miss a ball all day, which made me miss everything. (Laughter.) 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Everyone was commenting. We were watching it on TV, and it certainly looked like it was the James Caan and Christina Kim Show. (Laughter.) 
 CHRISTINA KIM: I'm so glad they cut the camera off on the last hole.
 JAMES CAAN: She said, Get away from me, you son of a bitch.
 CHRISTINA KIM: I never said that. 
 JAMES CAAN: She never. She put up with a lot today, I'll tell you what.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Don't be silly.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Christina, could you walk us through your scorecard, birdies and bogeys.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Do I have to? 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: We need the details, the nitty gritty. Started off with a birdie on the first hole.
 CHRISTINA KIM: First hole I hit it close and made the putt. It was -- God, what was the first hole? 
 JAMES CAAN: 10.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yeah, the original 10. Seriously, it was over six hours ago. My memory cuts off at five and a half. So I hit -- I don't remember what club I had. It was probably a 52 degree or something.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: To three feet? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yeah, it was about three feet. And the third hole I hit a 9-iron. It was 132, 1344 yards. I hit a 9-iron to about five, six feet or so. 
 No. 5, I don't know. Hmm, most of my birdie putts were really close. I mean, No. 5 was -- I need to look at the book. I can't remember. That was seriously like four hours ago. I have like no recollection whatsoever what happened. I'm still pissed off about No. 18. I'm seeing red right now. 
 Let's see, I would say it was -- I mean, it was probably a 52-degree again, I think.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Okay. To how close? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: No. Actually, you know what? It was a pitching wedge and I hit that one to, what, about eight feet or so I think. Something like that, unless I've got my holes mistaken.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Birdie on 6, the Par 5.
 CHRISTINA KIM: No. 6, I don't know. Oh, okay. I hit a 7-iron from like 190 yards, and then I chipped it to about five feet. Made the putt for birdie. 
 Bogey on 7. I hit a 5-iron into the left-hand trap and then just failed to get up and down from there. 
 And then No. 8, I hit, I believe it was a 56-degree. Was it a 56 -- degree? No. No. 8 I think it was a pitching wedge. Yes, I hit a pitching wedge from like 120 yards or something like that to about -- that one was actually probably about 20 feet or so. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Wow. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Made the putt for birdie there.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Can you tell us about 18.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Sucked. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: A little more description than that.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Umm, really sucked. 
 JAMES CAAN: Really sucked. (Laughter.) 
 CHRISTINA KIM: I could have chosen another word.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: No, "really" was good.
 CHRISTINA KIM: No, I hit -- my drive went left and I had to hit a shot off a cart path into a sidehill slope. From there, hit into the water; from there, hit into the bunker; from there, two-putted. Sucked. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: That was a double.
 JAMES CAAN: Triple. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: James, your scorecard.
 JAMES CAAN: I don't have one.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: I'm just kidding.
 CHRISTINA KIM: He made a birdie on No. 2. Yeah. I made a par and he made a birdie. He got a stroke on that, so he made a net eagle, which was great. He made a great par on 16. 
 No. 5, yes. I already birdied though so it didn't really matter.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Questions for Christina and James? 
 JAMES CAAN: But I got a stroke there. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yes, you did. But you made par.
 JAMES CAAN: Oh, that's right.

 Q. You're not used to six-hour rounds -- and I know you're not used to making excuses -- but how much does what happened on 18 play into it late in the round when you've been out there for an incredibly long time? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Just a brain fart. I'm not going to make excuses for it. It was just one of those shots where it was between my 110 yard club versus my 130, and then there's water short and there's water long and it's a sidehill lie. 
 The ball didn't come back the way that I wanted it to for my third shot, simply stated. It was about knee high, which really surprised me. So I had no chance of even -- you know, it was not going to carry, you know, an extra ten yards further to carry the bunker and then roll up the hill and stop two feet from the hole, so... 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CHRISTINA KIM: Well, I had Jimmy here to entertain me, so it breezed by. Those were the fastest six hours and God knows how many minutes I have ever played. No, it was actually a lot of the fun though. 
 I mean, before we even teed off we had seen the first group come in. They made the turn in two hours and 45 minutes, and that's the first group. They're not two of our slow players, so it was one of those things where it's like, okay, there's a threesome of pros and we've four golfers, still in ten-minute intervals, with a lot of Par 5s that are very accessible. 
 So there was just a lot of -- we just knew right off the bat that it wasn't going to be our typical four-and-a-half, five-hour round. No, it was great. I had such a fun time. I'm actually quite pleased with -- with the exception of what actually occurred through the first 17 holes versus the last hole, you know, walking off with 1-under isn't a bad day at all. 
 Especially with the winds whipping upwards of 25 miles an hour out there. I had a deal with this guy, the other guy, the other guy, the caddies. No, I'm kidding. 
 No, I'm quite pleased with the overall outcome. It just sucks royally that it didn't end pretty. I think the last hole probably took close to six hours for me anyway. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CHRISTINA KIM: Oh, really? Great. Okay that's somewhat comforting. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 CHRISTINA KIM: Oh, absolutely. You know...
 JAMES CAAN: She played brilliantly.
 CHRISTINA KIM: It was great, because we get to see what they do. They just kind of squirrel around the greens. No, no. This is one of those golf courses, I know how much Don Soffer has put into it. $100 million dollars for the renovation of this complex. 
 And the facilities, you know, the last three year he and Raymond Floyd redid the entire golf course. It's in absolute, hands down, spectacular condition. Without question. 
 I don't know, maybe the Mafia used these greens to bury a couple people or something, because every hole tends to have a couple of mounds in them. It doesn't matter in the amateurs -- it does matter -- they still would have put the pins where they did. 
 I'm actually quite pleased, because in my opinion they were more forgiving than I thought they would, because out normal Pro-Am pins are like that. 
 So I think they were fairly accessible. Just a matter of being able to determine what the wind is going to do to your ball and if you're going to make good contact, if you're in the first cut, the rough, fairway, firm fairway, soft fairway, chip shot, you know, club -- there's so many factors involved that it's just kind of, you know. 
 But I think it was fairly -- it was fair. The Par 5s, a couple of them were somewhat reachable, which kind of made up for like the 194-yard Par 3 that we had on 16. 
 But, I mean, if you want to ask about fairness of the golf course I would ask Jimmy that. I just think 18 is unfair, but that's just because I'm pouting. 

 Q. James, the first tee, were you as nervous as you thought you would be? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: He made me nervous. Oh, my God. 
 JAMES CAAN: I smoked that ball. I killed a bass. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: His caddie lined him up improperly on the first hole. He should have known he had tendency to kind of pull it a little bit.
 JAMES CAAN: Pull it.
 CHRISTINA KIM: That's all right. That's what the best golfers do. I hit it way right and pull my shots, so you're among good company here. 
 JAMES CAAN: Oh, God.

 Q. What was it like?
 JAMES CAAN: Without her I would have called 911 and just left. I mean, she just kept me smiling. I wanted to commit suicide. But tomorrow I think we're --
 CHRISTINA KIM: We'll be on the Miller course. Every thinking is different. Yeah. 
 JAMES CAAN: The bus is rolling is what we say. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Exactly. 
 JAMES CAAN: Of course I'm going to be out there until they chase me off tonight. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: No. You're gonna go and soak in the tub or go down to the river and have a few beers. Just chill. Don't... 
 JAMES CAAN: Okay, boss.
 CHRISTINA KIM: There you go. You got to relax. You're too tense. I'll be the one hitting balls all night. Can't have both of us there.

 Q. For either of you I guess, 18 notwithstanding, when the round starts passing five hours and all of that, and you played very well through 17, how much did maybe James being able to keep you loose and some chemistry help with that? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Keep me loose? He's got these big broad shoulders that are way up here. He's like the tightest person I've ever met. Keep me loose? 
 No, it was great having him out there. He kept me laughing and we were laughing at certain people that we saw come across the golf course, not going to name names or anything like that. 
 But we had a great time. It was just, you know, I mean, the -- with the exception of the 18th hole we had a great round together. He was sitting there and moaning the entire round. I think it's because he's a - you know, the Hollywood type. Bit of a perfectionist.
 JAMES CAAN: Yeah.

 Q. In that sense, did that help your round, 18 notwithstanding? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I think it really did. As much as it is, you know, the final round ends up being a professional's only round, with the exception of that, this is still a team event. Seeing that he didn't necessarily hit the ball, you know, where he wanted to sometimes, kind of made me sort of feel like, Hey, I should try and, you know, every now and then try and help out with the team. 
 He was sitting there carrying me the whole time. I felt like I should have contributed a couple times. I think I contributed a few times.
 JAMES CAAN: I think a couple. She got to be a big load. I couldn't carry her anymore. I got weak. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Stop it.

 Q. James, the second hole, what club did you hit, the one that you hit close there? 
 JAMES CAAN: I -- you know what --
 CHRISTINA KIM: Probably a wedge of some sort, I would say. It was a wedge.
 JAMES CAAN: No, actually, I think I hit a -- I hit real good shot out of a sand trap. That was the one, wasn't it? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: No. The Par 5, the second hole. You hit --I forget where your drive went, but you hit your second shot -- it was where the water came in. I think you actually hit like -- I think it was a rescue. 

 Q. I was there. I was just wondering what club it was. 
 JAMES CAAN: No, I don't remember. I can't even remember the hole.
 CHRISTINA KIM: It was the second hole, the Par 5. 

 Q. You made birdie. 
 JAMES CAAN: Is that where I made birdie? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: Yeah.
 JAMES CAAN: Wasn't that where I hit the shot out of that sand trap? No? 
 CHRISTINA KIM: No. The sand trap was a different hole. The pin was front right, and I think because you cleared the water on the right side just --
 JAMES CAAN: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I hit something close. I forgot what the heck I hit.
 CHRISTINA KIM: Something. It was a wedge. Who cares? 
 JAMES CAAN: No, no. I think it was pretty far back. I this it was 3-wood wedge. I think that's what it was. 
 CHRISTINA KIM: I think it was a rescue club.
 JAMES CAAN: Rescue club, sorry.
 CHRISTINA KIM: It had a nice ping because he hit that rescue club so well.
 JAMES CAAN: Yeah. That one and a wedge. And then the shoe putter. (Laughter.)
