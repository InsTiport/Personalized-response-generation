Q. Great round today.  That was a great way to close out 36 holes, a nice eagle on 18.  Holed out from the middle of the fairway, it looked like.
SU OH: Yeah, I like flared my drive to the right a little bit, but it's howling off the left, but whatever.  I got there and my ball has honestly made a crater, and it's just water.  So I had to take a casual water drop, but trying to like find where to drop, so I dropped it and kind of hit 5-wood.  I had a 9-iron in, a little longer than expected when the tees are a lot more forward.
I was like, yeah, just hit -- it was 125 to the pin and a 130 shot because it was just into off the left a little bit.  Just tried to hit it clean because I hit a few shots fat out there today, and it's not going far.
Q. Still a great way to cap off 36 holes, and not under the best conditions, but you have to feel good about where you sit going into the next two rounds?
SU OH: Yeah, for sure.  Even yesterday, I hit the ball really well.  I just missed a lot of putts.  But today, just things went a little my way.  I chipped in twice and hit a few close shots.  Yeah, just didn't make too many mistakes out there.
