SU OH: I played well. Just nothing was going for me. Like long, short, and just holed nothing. Then, yeah, still finished strong, which I'm happy with.   
I didn't get myself -- you know, I didn't lose any strokes, so I'm pretty happy with how I played.   
Just I wish I got a couple more, but it was just one of those rounds that nothing was happening and I just had to stay in it. Made some birdies on the way in, so hopefully it's good momentum for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You said yesterday that you were getting used to the green out here and putting. How do you think you did well on that today?  
SU OH: Yeah, I'm still like guessing. I mean, I think everybody is half guessing, but at least here it's like you know for sure, whereas sometimes it's very unsure.   
But because it's so strong here that you can tell...   
 Q.  You're guessing less here?  
SU OH: Sorry?   
 Q.  You're guessing less here?  
SU OH: No. Like everybody is guessing about the green, but here it's quite obvious because it's really shiny or dark.   
So in that sense it's quite obvious. You just of to allow for it a lot. But, yeah, one more round.   
 Q.  What's it going to take?  
SU OH: Like 59. (Laughter.)   
 Q.  Good answer. I like that. Yeah. (Indiscernible.)  
SU OH: I hope so. Let's go with a yes. Let's get as close to it. Make lots of birdies. I think I have to forget about the score and just try make lots of birdies out there.   
You keep counting birdies and you're never going to get there, so...
