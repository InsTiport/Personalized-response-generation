 Q.  68 on day one here in Canada. Five birdies, one bogey. How would you describe the day?  
SU OH: Yeah, just played really solid out there. I thought starting on the back nine with a week off was a little bit tougher. Like the course is playing a bit tougher on the back nine. But I just didn't capitalize on the par-5s.   
But overall I played really well. Putted well today. Yeah, just made birdies when I had the chance.   
 Q.  You're a little under the weather today. How are you feeling? Feel like that kind of took some of the expectations off?  
SU OH: No, I actually sound worse than I feel. Like I feel all right. Just a sore throat and just coughing. Trying not to cough at the bad time. When someone is hitting, I'm just like, Hold it, hold it. It's okay. Runny nose is a bit annoying, but I feel all right.   
 Q.  You finished T13 your last start at the Ladies Scottish Open. What do you feel like has come together for you these last few weeks?  
SU OH: I've been hitting the ball really well last few weeks. Scotland was really tough. I was on the wrong side of the draw, but that happens. You'd think it's happened in the British, but Scottish is always happens.   
Yeah, no, I've been hitting the ball really well. Just scoring really well. Sometimes you can hit the ball well but not score. I think I'm just taking advantage of the chances that I put myself in.   
A lot of putts inside 20 feet is always good. Give yourself lots of opportunities.
