Q. You just finished a 5-under 67. You're 11-under overall. How was your round today? Looked pretty steady for you out there.
SU OH: Yeah, I definitely did. Like last couple days, didn't putt as well because I left a lot out there. I had 35, 34 putts yesterday, still shot 2-under, and hit the ball good today and rolled some putts in the hole this time. So that sort of kept my round going. Some really good par saves.
I think I still left a couple out there like coming in. I think the nerves got there a little bit. I was trying to like make some putts but I still made some good par saves, and overall I played pretty well.
Q. What has the atmosphere been like this week?
SU OH: I was actually thinking about that on the golf course. It kind of feels like you're playing with like so many people with you. Like you hit a good shot and they are really, like they are so passionate. It's a really cool atmosphere. I really enjoy it. Most everybody has been like so supportive. So that's pretty cool.
Q. Do you find yourself feeding off an atmosphere like that, or do you tend to put that to the side?
SU OH: Oh, no, it's definitely nice. I think it's a lot nicer that I have like family here, so they all came out to watch. I can tell where they are always. So it's been really nice and it's just been giving me food. Yeah, so that's been good.
Q. You're going to be playing late tomorrow. What's the game plan going into the final round?
SU OH: It's been a while since I've been only like a couple shots back. I think same game plan. I think go out there; it's not going to be easy. I think it was nice to play the last few holes with a little bit of nerve to sort of see how it feels, because at the start, I was like nowhere near it.
Tomorrow I think it's just going to be the same. Hopefully keep the nerves under control and see how it goes.
