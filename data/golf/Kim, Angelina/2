 Q.  If I was reading right, you guys had seven birdies today?  
ANGELINA KIM: We did.  I even counted.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I knew we had five birdies on the back, which is pretty amazing.  Yes, we had seven birdies today.   
 Q.  The partners you were playing didn't have any bogies either, all birdies.  So that was quite a hard match out there.  How do you feel with that win?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: It was amazing because they were really good.  They were probably the toughest opponents we had these matches out of everything, and it was a really nice win to know that we've come this far.  Because it wasn't our goal mainly, but now that we're here, might as well try and win it.   
 Q.  So I know you guys were never behind, but they were able to pull all-square a couple times, and then you had three birdies in four holes on the back nine?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
ANGELINA KIM: Yeah.   
 Q.  What could you tell me about those birdies?  
ANGELINA KIM: The back nine, she made most of the birdies, but --   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I was just going to be aggressive.  Like there is nothing to lose.  It's match play.  Anything can happen, so I just kept trying to stick my shots, and then I made the putts.   
ANGELINA KIM: I think our team work was really good.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
ANGELINA KIM: Like when you were tired, but we tried not to think about it and tried to go aggressive on the holes where we knew we could make birdie.  So one of us would go save to make par, and one of us would go aggressive to make birdie.   
 Q.  Did you make all three of those birdies, Brianna?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yes.   
 Q.  Awesome.  About how far were those putts, do you remember?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: They range from two feet to ten feet.   
 Q.  Okay.  So you had a couple nice close ones then?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yes, I did.   
 Q.  Did you stick those close ones in or how did those go?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: What do you mean?   
 Q.  Your approach shots.  Did you roll it in or did you land it firm?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: It rolled.  I used a couple of the angles to help it.  But they went as planned, so that's good.   
 Q.  So you guys, both 13, have you played together in any sort of event like this before, or how did your partnership come together?  
ANGELINA KIM: We first met at our SCPGA Tour Southern California and we had a lot of tournaments together, and then we became friends.  Then we had a Challenge Cup together, it was So Cal versus North Cal, and then we worked together, so that made our team work good.   
 Q.  Do you guys do anything fun prior to the championship or maybe anything planned afterwards since you're kind of down here in the Orlando-Tampa area with all the amusement parks?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: We want to go to Disney World.  Because our main goal was to go to Magic Land (sic).  If we lost, at least we knew that we passed a goal.  But since we figured we're this far, we might as well figure that the holes are Disney World rides.  That's what we made it.  So each birdie was a ride, so we went on seven rides today.   
 Q.  Seven rides today.  Any particular rides at Disney World?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Splash Mountain.   
ANGELINA KIM: Splash Mountain.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones.   
ANGELINA KIM: The Tea Cups.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Those are to name a few.   
 Q.  My favorite is Everest at Animal Kingdom.  You'll like that one.  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Really?   
 Q.  You guys have probably been to Disneyland, I'm sure.  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah, I have.   
ANGELINA KIM: Yes.   
 Q.  When this is over, are you going to do anything in Orlando before you go home?  Is there any talk of maybe making a side trip to Disney World or universal?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Hopefully, because our --   
ANGELINA KIM: Our flight's like right after the tournament.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I guess making it to the finals is more meaningful.  I'd rather hold the trophy than go to Disney World.   
 Q.  Are those your dads caddying for you?  
ANGELINA KIM: Yeah.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
 Q.  And mom too over there?  
ANGELINA KIM: Mom's supportive.   
 Q.  Are both of your mom's here or just one?  
ANGELINA KIM: Just hers.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Mine, just one.   
 Q.  What's it like having the family together?  
ANGELINA KIM: It's more comfortable.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
ANGELINA KIM: And he's my dad, so he'll understand me more than like a caddie, so I can tell him how I feel.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: It's a hard relationship dad and daughter, but I guess you make it at the end.  You just know you're there for each other.   
 Q.  You guys don't seem nervous at all.  I mean, you guys just seem like you're having a good old time out here.  I mean, you're playing for a National Championship, but it outwardly doesn't look like you guys are dealing with any type of pressure?  
ANGELINA KIM: I feel like when I'm on the tee I feel like I'm playing another practice round or like a normal round of golf with my friend.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: I guess experience is one of them.  After many years or how long have you been playing, we get used to it.   
ANGELINA KIM: But it's definitely one of the biggest tournaments we've been in.   
 Q.  But experience?  You guys are 13.  You haven't experienced much in this world at such a young age (laughing).  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
 Q.  Are you enjoying your week down here though?  
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: Yeah.   
ANGELINA KIM: Yes.   
BRIANNA NAVARROSA: A little tired of the heat, but we got used to it.  So it's nice.  I like it down here.
