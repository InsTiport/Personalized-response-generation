Q.  Talk about your round today.
R. W. EAKS:  First eight holes, I couldn't get the ball in the fairway.  I hit some good shots from the rough, but not very many.  I just happened to eagle 18.  I hit a 6 iron in there about 15 feet and eagled 18.  It got me rolling.

I hit it in the rough on 1, just an awful lie.  I left it short of the bunker and chipped it in.  And from then on I played really solid until the last hole.  And I made some birdies and got a great break on 8, the par 3.  Pulled it way left of the green, hit the tree and bounced to about 12 feet away.  I didn't make it, but it was a great break.  Probably the best one I've had in a year.  All in all it was a great day.

Q.  Happen to look at the leaderboard?
R. W. EAKS:  I did a couple times.  But it's too early.  I was just happy to see that I was in red figures, instead of those black ones for awhile.

Q.  What are you going to do the rest of the day?
R. W. EAKS:  Go practice a little bit.  My wife wants to go shopping for my new grandson.

Q.  How new?
R. W. EAKS:  A week old now.

Q.  Congratulations.  Name?
R. W. EAKS:  Actually, well, it's Ryder Williams, but it's R. W, as far as I'm concerned.  So we have a second in the family now.  So I'm looking forward to seeing him.  I haven't seen him yet.

Q.  How was the course playing today after all the rain?
R. W. EAKS:  This golf course is in great shape.  I don't know how they do it.  It drains just perfectly.  It's not even wet out there.

The warmer it gets, it feels like it's maybe getting a little soggier, but it's in fantastic shape.

Q.  Did it play any differently than it did in the practice round?
R. W. EAKS:  The wind came up.  There was no wind in the practice round.  So you have to deal with that.  But it's going to help the golf course out, to dry it all out.

Q.  (Inaudible.)
R. W. EAKS:  It's a hard golf course.  We have had a lot of wonderful tournaments here.  It's a very respectable golf course.  So the scores are going to be high.
