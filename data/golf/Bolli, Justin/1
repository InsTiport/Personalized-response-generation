Q.   Justin, round of the day, 65, not a bogey on the card.   You saved your best for last. 
JUSTIN BOLLI:   My short game was on today.   There were a couple of spots where I hit it in bad places and managed to get up and down, kind of like on 18, made a 35â€‘yard bunker shot. 

Q.   Walk me through that bunker shot.   Did you know how important that up and down was? 
JUSTIN BOLLI:   Yeah, I knew it was an important up and down, and it was a really hard shot, and to be honest, long bunker shots are not my forte. 
So I wasn't exactly licking my chops there, but it just came off perfect and it almost went in, I guess.   It was as good of a shot as I could hit, for sure. 

Q.   We'll wait around and see what that number is going to end up doing today but 150 FedExCup points coming in has got to feel pretty sweet. 
JUSTIN BOLLI:   Yeah, it will probably get me in a couple more tournaments now and I can plan my schedule more and moving up, so that's great. 

Q.   Talk about this week as a whole, Justin.
JUSTIN BOLLI:   My game kept getting better and better each day.   Some weeks you come in on Tuesday and you are feeling great and the game kinds deteriorates.   This week I wasn't feeling that great on Tuesday and every day my game felt better and better.   I'd never had any history of success here, I think I missed the cut the previous three times, so it wasn't like the course was set up great for me, I just played really well and, like I said, just kept playing better and better.
