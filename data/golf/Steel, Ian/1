 Q. Tell us about the hole in one?
 IAN STEEL: It was a four iron from 189 yards. I just hit it towards the pin. I was happy that it was going to the right level of the green and 10 yards after walking off the tee, I heard the screaming and shouting. I didn't see it go in but I was happy.

 Q. Would have been nicer if that was done on the weekend to win the Rolex watch and Johnnie Walker King George V?
 IAN STEEL: Oh yes, maybe they can give me a link or something from the watch! Maybe they'll find sympathy in me. This was my eighth hole in hole. The last one was at the Maekyung Open in Korea (in 2006) where I won a BMW car.

 Q. Happy with how you played?
 IAN STEEL: It was shabby. Putting wasn't good. Apart from the hole in one, I made a lot of birdies and a lot of bogeys. It was up and down. It's just a matter of getting into the right position on the greens. You've got to always give yourself a chance for an uphill putt. I found that difficult to do today.
