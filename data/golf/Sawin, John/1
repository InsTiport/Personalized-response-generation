Q. John Sawin, the Director of Golf here at Pebble Beach.  You played marker for Justin Walters from South Africa.  When did you find out you were going to play?
JOHN SAWIN: Last night.  I knew I was on deck and wasn't official until an odd number made the cut and that was around 8 p.m. last night.
Q. You've played this course many, many, many times?
JOHN SAWIN: I've only played it 20 times, believe it or not.  This is about the 21st time.  I took this job about a year and a half ago, so there you go.
Q. Have you played it since they really set it up for The Open?
JOHN SAWIN: I did.  I played it -- I was the last person to run around before sunset on Friday night and the USGA took it over on Saturday.  Before that I hadn't played it in six weeks.  I spent a lot of time on the golf course, but not with my full set of clubs.
Q. How do you think the course has evolved here the last six weeks since the last time you played it and watching the rough grow, watching the greens?
JOHN SAWIN: It's been so much fun setting out a game plan and then to see Mother Nature cooperate and for the golf course to evolve exactly on that game plan.  We have it exactly where we want it.  It's playing spectacular today.  It's certainly not easy despite some cloud cover and very little wind.  It will be fun to see how the guys do out there today.
Q. I know you tried to qualify to play here?
JOHN SAWIN: Yeah.
Q. And you got to sectional?
JOHN SAWIN: That's right.
Q. And didn't quite get through sectional, but now you've got a chance to play?
JOHN SAWIN: I don't know how many people have missed the cut at sectional but played the weekend at The Open.  That's a pretty cool distinction.
