Q. Happy about that?
SAM SAUNDERS: Yeah, it's nice to get off to a solid start, especially not really having my best stuff both days.  I just haven't felt super comfortable over the golf ball, but I putted really nicely and managed my attitude out there.  So I feel like with some good ball-striking this weekend, I've given myself a chance to win hopefully.
Q. Speaking of managing attitude, when you look at your FedExCup position and what you need to do, do you see it as go hard or go home?
SAM SAUNDERS: Yeah, literally there's absolutely nothing to lose.  Worst-case scenario, I come out here, play terrible, miss the cut, take four weeks off and go to Napa.  It wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world.
I was really feeling confident about what I was doing, and my goal is to see how far I can go.  The points are so magnified out here that with a good finish this week and you get hot, you never know.  See if I can make it to THE TOUR Championship.
Q. Frees you up mentally in a way?
SAM SAUNDERS: It does in a way for sure.  But you know, the pressures are all still there.  You're still trying your best on every shot, and most importantly, I feel like I still want to try to give myself a chance to win.  If that's your focus every tournament, then you know, hopefully if it's not your best week, then maybe I'll take care of business and get in where I need to be next week.
With the position I'm in now, that's not an unreasonable thought to think, go out there tomorrow, have another good, solid round, and give myself a chance on Sunday.
Q. I know it's charity golf, but course record on Monday?
SAM SAUNDERS: I'm going to clean that up.  Pro-Am, I slapped a couple par putts.  I probably shot 63.  They said I got 62.  I can't claim that.  I played nicely.  Played with a great group of guys, and more importantly, was able to be a part of Morgan Hoffmann's event there which raised a ton of money.  He did an incredible job.  He's one of those guys that makes you feel inadequate because he's so passionate about what he's doing and he's incredible.  He's an incredible person.
Q. Brings perspective to all of this?
SAM SAUNDERS: Yeah, this guy right here, I might just wear this forever.  I always want to think about him while I'm out there, and with Morgan and what he's going through, we're out here playing a game, but you know, people are dealing with really hard things.  We are very fortunate to get to do this and also very fortunate to get to help raise money for playing this great sport.
