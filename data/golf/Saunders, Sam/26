  SAM SAUNDERS:   I played well.   Little disappointed today, the greens were a lot faster.   I never adjusted.   You know, it is what it is.   Missed out on an opportunity. 
My goal -- I knew winning was kind of out of reach today, obviously, with the scores going like they are but my goal was to Top-10 so I could play in San Antonio next week because I'm not in.   As it stands right now because we don't reshuffle, you know, missed out on that but hopefully I can find a way to make it to San Antonio tonight so I can try to do a Monday ballfire.   Not I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

Q.   What does a week like this do for your season? 
SAM SAUNDERS:   You know, at this point in my season and in my, you know, first full year out here, every dollar really does count so, you know, it's more FedExCup Points, more money and it's just -- it improves my position a little bit.   Not as much as I would have liked but still a decent week and anytime you're playing on the weekend and up near the top and have a chance, you got to just take that as a big positive.
