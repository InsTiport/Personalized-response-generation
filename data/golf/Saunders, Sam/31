Q.   So I know that's probably one of those moments you're going to be thinking about the rest of your life.
SAM SAUNDERS:   Yeah.

Q.   How do you feel?
SAM SAUNDERS:   Yeah.   I mean I really felt like I hit a pretty good putt there.   It went right on me and I was playing it inside the hole.   It is what it is.   I'm still proud, I had a great week, and you know, just good things going forward.   Happy for Alex.   You know, he's been out here so long, and he's been a great player for a long time.   He deserves it.   I'm very happy for him, and hopefully I have more chances like this.

Q.   With Doral going on this week, people don't realize all the story lines going on, from guys who are starting, guys who have played for the TOUR so many years and then back to Web.com.   Tell me a little bit about your story this week and being here.
SAM SAUNDERS:   It's great.   If people don't think this is every bit as tough a tournament to win as maybe the one in Doral, they're wrong.   There's so many good players here, and 140‑something guys. 
You know, it's a great tournament, on a good golf course, and the conditions were tough this week.   So you know, certainly whoever‑‑ you know, Alex winning this week, you can't fake it out here.   He played a lot of good golf.   So just a great week, and excited about everything.
