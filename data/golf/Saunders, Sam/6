 Q.  Sam, talk us through the two eagles on the back nine.  
SAM SAUNDERS: Well, I was just trying to ride on the coattails of Andrew a little bit.  He was making it look easy out there, just playing great golf, making a bunch of birdies.  I was playing fine but just having one of those slow days where nothing was going in.  In this format you've got to not let that upset you.  I did a good job of staying patient and fortunately made the eagle on 13 there and followed it up with a nice birdie on 14, and obviously nice to get that last one there.   
 Q.  Andrew, you're 55th in the FedExCup standings in such a great spot.  With being that comfortable, how much did that play into how well you played today?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Well, I told my wife and my parents this week is just a vacation week, just hanging out at the lake.  So I feel like that's made this our time to relax, and there's been some good golf.   
 Q.  What's the biggest key for you tomorrow?  
ANDREW PUTNAM: Well, the putter was working really well today, so I think the long game just needs to be a little bit tighter, and if the putter keeps doing how it was doing, we'll be good.
