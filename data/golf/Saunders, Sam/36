 Q. 3-over, 73 today. Couple minor hiccups out there. Talk about the experience of being here with the history and so forth?
 SAM SAUNDERS: It's great. Happy to be playing here. Played terrible today, so that's kind of disappointing. 
 Hopefully turn it around tomorrow and have a good day.

 Q. Your granddad, is he out?
 SAM SAUNDERS: He is. I saw him out there. He came and watched a little bit, so that's nice. 
 Hopefully I can do a little better tomorrow.
