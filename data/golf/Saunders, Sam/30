 Q.   That was a quality up and down on the 9th hole there to stay alive.   It was not looking good at the back of the green in the heavy rough.  
SAM SAUNDERS:   Those are some of the toughest shots when you have a lot of green to work with and you're in the deep rough and right up against the green.   It's hard to make a big enough swing to get it to the hole.   You know, I hit an okay shot but made a good putt and certainly a nice way to finish it.  
   
 Q.   Yeah.   2-under for your 1st round.   You got to feel extra comfortable coming to this place which is special to you.  
SAM SAUNDERS:   Yeah.   I feel good.   A little disappointed with my ball striking off the tee.   Didn't hit the ball particularly well but my wedges and irons were really sharp which made up for some ugly tee shots.   I'll get it straightened out and feel good for the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   You've had great success here.   Made the cut three out of five years.   Is it possible to put into words what this week means for you and to be part of the PGA TOUR on event?  
SAM SAUNDERS:   Every week being part of the PGA TOUR means a lot to me because I've earned it and had to kind of go through the whole process and, you know, being here at the course I grew up at just makes it that much more special and, you know, to be able to hopefully play well and give myself a chance to win would be, you know, even more special.  
   
 Q.   I'm going to guess your grandfather is relatively pleased with your 1st round play.  
SAM SAUNDERS:   I'm sure he'll give me some heat.   "Why didn't you shoot 5 or 6?"   It was a solid round.   Little disappointed.   Good start to a long four days.
