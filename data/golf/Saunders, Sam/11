Q. What was the secret today?
SAM SAUNDERS: The ball striking was really good for the last three rounds.  First day I struggled a bit, but I just hit it really solid all week and today was probably the best of the week.  I struggled on the greens a little bit yesterday, but today obviously got a few putts to drop and that's always what makes, it turns a 68 into a 64.
Q. Let's look at one of the putts at the 7th hole here.  Describe this one for us.
SAM SAUNDERS: Yeah, I hit a good wedge shot in here.  It didn't spin back for me at all, so a slick putt here.  But really kind of right down the fall line and I had gotten a great read from James Hahn and that one went right in the middle.
Q. Here's the 9th hole.  What was the difference in your game this week?
SAM SAUNDERS: I think my game's come a long way, I've always been extremely uncomfortable here for some reason.  I love the desert, but I just never played well here.  I came into the week hitting the ball really well, so I felt like even though I've never even come close to making a cut here, it's been just a disaster for me, I just felt like I can't not play well this week, so I was glad to see it come to fruition.
Q. Describe the 18th hole for us.
SAM SAUNDERS: The 18th hole here as you can see from this tee shot is incredibly intimidating off the tee.  I hit a 3-wood there today and I hit it right at my target, but you still get scared when you see it taking off that close to the water.  Very intimidating.  You're seeing a lot of balls in the right rough there.  Then the second shot is equally as hard.  With the pin today tucked over on the left you'll see a lot of balls short right here.  It just takes two really solid golf shots and if you bail right off the tee you could have all kinds of trouble.
