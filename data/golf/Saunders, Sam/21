Q. General thoughts on how it went out there for you.
SAM SAUNDERS: Obviously, I'm disappointed.  I didn't hit the ball as well today as I did yesterday, I actually played a lot better yesterday.  But I hung in there and I gave it everything I had and unlikely, but we'll see what happens.  There's still a outside chance that cut could move to 4-over.  It's not easy out there, even with the little bit of wind we have now, the greens are so difficult and fast.  I don't want anybody to play poorly, but, gosh, if 4-over, if the cut could move to 4-over, I would be pretty happy.
Q. When you're that close to the cut line, just how much more stressful for you is it?
SAM SAUNDERS: I'm far too used to it.  I've been doing it far too often throughout my career.  I seem to whoever right around that cut.  Thursdays and Fridays are never great days for me, I always seem to just, I don't know, I've got a monkey on my back there where I just always seem to work my way towards that cut number and think about it too much, so, you know, but it's all part of the learning experience and just got to get better.
