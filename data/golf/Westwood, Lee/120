  LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, played well.   Started off strongly.   Finished it off strongly.   I think 70 a good score, especially in the afternoon when the wind picked up.   Golf course doesn't get any easier today. 

Q.   What does it mean to be the first guy to have played in 50 World Golf Championships? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   I didn't realize until somebody told me until Wednesday or Thursday.   I know I've played in a lot.   It just shows I've been playing a high level of golf for more years than I can remember.   That's obviously great if you can stay at a top level for all that time.

Q.   That position off and on 4 looked like it could yield two hole‑in‑ones‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   Has it‑‑

Q.   In the span of 30 minutes?
LEE WESTWOOD:   I have no plans at going at that flag whatsoever.   I suggest if you ask them, they probably pushed it. 

Q.   How, if at all, does this course help you in your preparation for Augusta? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I think it's mentally a very stern challenge.   So that's probably the key place where it will help. 

Q.   Have you heard that they fished Rory's club out? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Did they? 

Q.   They sent a diver down. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   I said to him on the range this morning, I was impressed with his follow through, really good with the position, nice full release and good extension down the line (laughter).   I've felt like that very often.
