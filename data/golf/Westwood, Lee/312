 Q. Big eagle putt on the 18th there that didn't quite go in... general assessment on the how you played today?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I didn't play very well - that's the reason I needed to eagle the last...

 Q. So what do you put it down to?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's early season rust, I think. That's it. I'm going to go on the range the next couple of days and try to get into some kind of rhythm.

 Q. Dubai Desert Classic next week. Comparing the two courses - Dubai and Doha - do you think next week's is going to suit you more?
 LEE WESTWOOD. No, I think this suits me more - it just depends on how you are hitting it...
