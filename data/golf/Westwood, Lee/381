  Q. You've been in contention in Majors before, but it seems that you're playing with a different sense of confidence, not only in your game, but also in the surroundings. Is that accurate and are you ready to win a Major Championship?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think I'm ready. You're certainly right, I felt very calm out there today. Comfortable in what I was doing, every aspect of my game felt good. If I missed the green then my short game was reliable and I holed some nice putts which you need to do around here and I felt my way around well.  
  
  Q. You were going around well and then you had the bogey at the 12th, your only bogey of the day and then the roars started; so what was going through your mind during all of that and was it difficult to concentrate?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, they started a little bit earlier than that, they started when we are on the 11th, but that didn't affect the way I was playing.   
 The only thing can I control is myself. What Phil was doing up in front really is of no importance to my game. All I can do is stick to my game plan, which I formulated over the last couple of weeks of coming in, and try and execute that properly.  
  
  Q. So does your game plan change at all for tomorrow with the lead going into the final round of the Masters?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, I don't think so because I found the way I think you need to play the golf course which suits me the best so I don't see any reason in veering from that.
