   LEE WESTWOOD:  I played okay.  Just couldn't get any momentum.  Chances on the first two holes and dropped one at 5 which was a bit disappointing.  Pitched up to eight, about five feet and birdied 15 from about 12 feet, and five feet from 16. 

 Q.  Were those conditions anymore tricky this afternoon? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  I think it's pretty even all around really the first two days.  The scoring is fairly representative that have and I don't think either side of the draw has had it easy either way.  I felt like the course played a little bit harder today because the wind was more hard right off 18 and 9 so harder to get to in two.  Playing a little bit harder today but not much. 

 Q.  You're still in that fine position for the weekends? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, and if nothing goes for you, you can't be disappointed.  70 is a good score in these conditions.  There's not that many people shooting that and it's there or thereabouts, two behind going into the weekend which is a side better than last week. 

 Q.  Are you in favour of this wind? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Unfortunately I have no control of that and it's probably the only defence the golf course has got this week with the rough not being so thick.  It doesn't really matter. 

 Q.  Just touching on, HSBC, you came on very strong over the course of the weekend and you're now right in touch, what difference is that for you? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Right in touch, like you said, and just play to a normal game plan and not have to press too hard really.  Playing very solidly, made one bogey in two days, which is pretty good.
