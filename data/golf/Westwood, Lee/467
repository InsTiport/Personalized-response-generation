  Q. You've got a great record and unfortunately it's just come to an end but lovely tie to have with Arnold Palmer. What are your thoughts on the match today?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: It was more about winning points for the team than an individual record. You know, The Ryder Cup is not about individuals. It's about the team.   
 While it's nice to be tied with Arnold, it's disappointing to have not won a point.  
  
  Q. Did you and SÃ¸ren feel you could turn it around at any stage?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, absolutely. I thought we were going to turn it around.   
  
  Q. What about the crowd today and your opponents you faced yesterday, in particular, Boo Weekley, what was it like today?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: It was fine. He do it in between the shots like he did yesterday, so he's obviously learned. He apologized last night, which is the kind of man he is. He's a nice guy. We get on really well.   
  
  Q. Looking forward to the singles?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, still many points to play for, so it's going to be a long, hard day.
