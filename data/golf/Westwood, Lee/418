 Q. A little bit up-and-down. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, doubled the first, shot a horrible shot, made double. Two good shots the next, three-putted, and couldn't hit close. Longest putt was on the third from about 15 feet, then hit it like that on 4, that on 6, that on 7 and that on 8. 

 Q. Mad. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Crazy.

 Q. Mad game. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Then dropped a few around 9 and finished with some birdie putts. Any time you walk off here with seven birdies you would expect to be in the 60s.
