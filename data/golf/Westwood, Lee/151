Q.   Solid? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was solid.   Only got out of position a couple of times.   One of them I holed on 5, somehow. 
Just didn't play the par 5s well enough again.   Didn't play them well enough yesterday.   I made eight 5s and that's where you need to make your scores.   Need to make a few birdies on them over the weekend and I'll be right in there, I think.

Q.   Any particular reason why you've struggled on the 5s? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   I keep missing for 4.   Outside of that, can't find a reason. 
No, hit two good shots to the front of the 2nd today and couldn't get up‑and‑down.   A bit unlucky, chipped it and it dug in on me and missed from about ten feet.
8 was just short right of the green.   Tried to get too cut with a chip shot. 
13, I was going with 5‑iron but out of the pine straw, and there was a lot of pine straw behind it.   Caught it and went in the ditch and ended up making a 5. 
Hit two good shots at 15, and lovely bunker shot to five feet and missed that. 
So could have made three birdies on them, but didn't, and that's why I took 71 instead of 68.

Q.   You seem serene‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm always pretty comfortable and relaxed and calm on this golf course, yeah. 

Q.   So even though you're six back or seven back, it's not‑‑ everything can change so quickly. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, the golf course is just getting harder.   There's good scores if you play well and there's disasters if you hit wild shots.

Q.   Did you find anything calming about today?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Calming? 

Q.   You said you're calm around this golf course‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, in general, not just today.   I'm comfortable out there.   I can see a way around it.   I know where to hit it and where not to hit it. 

Q.   Why is it you come to the Masters and things click‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   Starting to see shots‑‑ I've driven the ball pretty good the first two days, and I'm starting to feel positions in the golf swing that I haven't felt for a couple of years really, so just keep working on that.   My distance control has been good. 

Q.   Is it a coincidence that it just happens at this place? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, they say horses for courses, don't they?   But I think there's a slight coincidence there, as well. 

Q.   In the process with Mike, where would you say you are?   Are you to the point where‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   Building.   No, I can't just go out there and swing it and hit it as hard as I want and it will come out straight.   I've got a couple of swing thoughts going on, but they are swing thoughts I can play with. 

Q.   How many more putts would it take you to make‑‑
LEE WESTWOOD:   I've never seen the flag there before so I don't think I'll need to hit a putt ever again‑‑ I've always wondered, because it's a really good flag on the front edge and they have never used it.   It's just typical that I hit it on the top when it's down there. 

Q.   What, 15 steps? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it's like a 20‑second putt. 

Q.   Langer said he's been here 31 years and there were hole locations he's never been here before. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I haven't been here 31 years, but I've never seen the one on 5. 
16 is a long way back, more than usual. 
14 is just the hardest flag you're ever going to see on that green.   Got a massive round of applause for hitting it 20 feet behind the hole. 

Q.   Just trying to protect the course? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I don't know.   I think somebody is 7‑ or 8‑under, so it's doable.   You can shoot a good score.   I think the course is playing perfectly. 

Q.   And you're in position? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, Bubba's 7, but it's going to be around about ten or even par I would say at the end of today, so it's not going to get any easier.   A chance to push on from there and shoot a couple of good scores over the weekend and see where that gets me. 

Q.   What was it like playing with Harris and Russell? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Intimidating.   No, they are good players, both of them.   They hit it a long way.   You know, the modern game, they are the epitome of the modern game, really.   They hit it a long way and great on the greens, very aggressive on the greens.
