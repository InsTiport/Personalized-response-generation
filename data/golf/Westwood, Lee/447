   LEE WESTWOOD: I just struggled with my swing all day and didn't feel under control at any point. I was pleased to be in a play-off as I felt I really hung in there. 28 holes today was no excuse. I just couldn't feel my swing. I hit a lot of poor iron shots and when Gonzo chipped in on the par three 12th I think the writing was on the wall.

 Q. When you started the third round with three consecutive bogeys I guess you never thought you would be in a play-off?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Three bogeys is not the way to start the weekend but I played my way out of it. I enjoy playing the Belfry and it seems to suit me. I plugged away and kept hanging around and tried to graft it out. 

 Q. A rest lined up yet?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Dunhill next week which will be six hour rounds, no doubt, and a week off after that. I am looking forward to that.

 Q. The play-off holes and that last shot?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just another bad iron shot. I had hit bad iron shots all day. Lot of sloppy shots and didn't feel under control. I was happy to be in a play-off. It was getting a bit dark at the end but my swing didn't feel good today and I paid for it.

 Q. How do you reflect on the week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I felt I am at the end of my tether and running on empty to get in a play-off was good.

 Q. And a good cheque for the Order of Merit?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It made some inroads for the Order of Merit but I am still missing a win this year. Everyone else has won and they are the really big cheques so that shows the consistency I am at.

 Q. How tough to get the spirits up this week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really as when you play not your best golf and get in a play-off you take positives from that.
