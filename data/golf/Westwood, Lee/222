 Q.   You guys were going at it pretty good.   Can you just sum up the day for us, what it was like out there playing with Rory?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I think we both played well.   I think that sums it up.   
   
 Q.   Can you talk about the kind of player he is?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, he's a talent, yeah.   I played with him when he was 13, and you could see it then.   He's just maturing all the time, as he will do.   And he's a very, very good player.   
   
 Q.   Is it good to have him as a teammate coming up?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, yeah, I was going to say, if he needs a partner, I don't mind.   
   
 Q.   He could play with anyone, couldn't he?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Could he?   I think we probably both could, so it's an option that JosÃ© MarÃ­a has got.   
   
 Q.   What's made the difference in him in the last year or year and a half?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just maturing, isn't he.   
   
 Q.   For yourself today, was there a point when you felt like you had to make it happen, and it didn't there toward the end?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   You know, I didn't know.   I was hitting good shots, I was inside Rory a lot of the day pretty much on the greens.   I got a bit unlucky at 14 with the lie in the fairway, conducive to a bit of a hook, and just turned over a little bit too much, and when I got up there, it pitched, come out of its plug mark, had to play it where it was and made bogey.   Then got in between clubs at the next, between a 3‑iron and a 5‑wood, and then 16, I hit a great shot in, and I hit a great putt which I thought was in.   And then I played the last two holes solid.  
   
 Q.   Is there a different feeling playing with the all‑star cast on the marquee, or is it just another golf tournament?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, it's certainly not just another golf tournament.   I would say that the FedExCup events are higher profile, aren't they.   
   
 Q.   Yeah, but I'm just talking about all the heavyweights on the board.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I think it's good for everybody to see a top‑quality leaderboard in tournaments.   I guess the people coming, the players playing, everybody wants to see the big names at the top.   It only makes sense.  
   
 Q.   Were you watching the scores today?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it's the first time I've played the FedExCup.   
   
 Q.   Were you watching it last year?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I was sitting home thinking I'd like a crack at that, yeah.  
   
 Q.   When is the last time you had that good of a leaderboard?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I don't know.   (Indiscernible.)  
   
 Q.   I don't think enjoyed playing today more than you did.   That had to be a lot of fun early on the back nine with Rory back and forth.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was a good day out on the golf course.   I played rather well, and yeah, it was a fun day out there.  
   
 Q.   The game was there all day, just couldn't get a decent run of putts to drop, could you?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I made one on the par‑5s today.   But other than that, I hit it really close.   I had a nice one on 13, which kind of got me going a little bit, but then I bogeyed the next, just got a rough lie next to the green.  
   
 Q.   You're going to the TOUR Championship for the first time.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm quite amped up.   I'm in good position for it, so hopefully come back in two weeks' time and try and win.
