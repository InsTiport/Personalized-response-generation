Q.   Talk about what you did today?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I got a bit greedy with the first, tried to hit it a bit low and snagged it on the grass in front of me but then played a great third shot.  I punched it out about six feet and just missed it.

I mean, I made a good birdie at 16 and a good birdie at 17.  Four 69s, probably would have taken that to start the week.  It's never an easy golf course.  If you keep it in play     I haven't kept it in play as well as I would have liked, but I actually got it around.
Q.   (Inaudible).
LEE WESTWOOD:  Who knows?  A lot can happen next week.  Different people are playing well at different times.  Alex Cejka has played well again this week, played well two weeks ago.  Luke Donald is obviously playing very well, so, you know     no idea whatsoever as to what Bernhard is thinking.  I suppose a Ryder Cup     if you had asked me whether or not I think the Ryder Cup team would be stronger with Colin, obviously it would be stronger with Colin in it.
