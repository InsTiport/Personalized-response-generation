Q. 6 birdies today.  A great score.  How are you feeling?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, good.  It was nice to shoot a low score the first round of the tournament and get right in there.  You just take it one day at a time, obviously.
It was not the greatest of starts, 1-over through 4 on the downwind holes.  But then I had three birdies in a row and got right into it and played solidly from there on in and a great finish.  Two of the toughest holes on 16 and 18.
Q. What was it you've done particularly well today?
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit the ball well off the tee.  I controlled my iron shots well.  I putted well.  I didn't put myself under too much pressure.  I gave myself a lot of birdie chances.  Not too much stress out there.  I was more aggressive on the greens.  Rolled the ball at the hole well on the greens and gave it a run a lot of times.
So, yeah, I was pleased with all of my game.
Q. When you left Carnoustie last year we knew it was going to be a sellout.  Has it lived up to the expectation today and have you fed off that feeling?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, it's a brilliant atmosphere out there, and the course couldn't be better.  It's every bit as good as I remember when I played the Amateur championship here in 1993.  And Darren has obviously raved about it over the years.  And the two new holes blend in nicely and the rest of the golf course is just spectacular.
It's a joy to play this one.
Q. How much did the conditions change over your round?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, there were scores coming through and the wind was picking up and dropping in.  So you've got to be on your guard a little bit.  And constantly adapting.  But I think we did have a break with the weather, for sure.
Q. How tough is that when the wind is blowing?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's tricky.  When it blows across a lot of the holes it's awkward.
So, yeah, as I say, I think we had a good result with the weather this afternoon.  Still not easy, obviously.  If you play well then you've got a good score, which is really all you can ask of a great championship links.
Q. Is it one of those courses you can shoot high?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, there's plenty of trouble out there.  You get out of position and it will bite you, yeah, for sure.
Q. You seem relaxed out there.
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm playing in The Open Championship for the 25th consecutive year, I've seen all this before.  I'm just out there enjoying myself and trying to do as good as I can on each hole.  And if it's good enough at the end of the day, it's good enough.
Come out again, try my hardest tomorrow, and if it goes my way, it goes my way, it would be great.
