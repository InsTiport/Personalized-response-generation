Q. How difficult was that ending? 
  LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's sickening not to be in the playoff tomorrow, but all in all I played pretty good all week and if somebody said you're going to have a chance from 20 feet for a playoff on Monday then I would have probably taken that at the start of the week. 
 
   
So while I'm disappointed, I'm pleased with myself and I think that  
I've proved to myself and a few others that I think there is a Major  
Championship in me.  
   
   
Q. That playoff tomorrow, it's obviously going to be exciting.  
   
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm struggling to even think who is in the  
playoff. It's not really in the front of my mind, to be brutally  
honest.  
   
   
Q. What happened on 13? 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: I tried to hit a 3-wood too hard. I hooked  
it into the hazard there. And Tiger followed me.  
   
   
Q. Was that a surprise that he followed you in? 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really, he's obviously struggling with his  
knee and maybe not on his game, so these things can happen.  
   
   
Q. Certainly he's struggling with his knee, how impressive was  
it to watch him play? 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: The impressive thing about Tiger is when he's not  
playing well, he still finds a way to get around and that is what good  
players do.  
   
   
Q. Did you find your ball on 13? 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: No.  
   
   
Q. (Inaudible.) 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, like it always is playing with Tiger.  
You're probably not going to lose a golf ball. Although we  
managed to off the 13th.  
   
(Laughter.)  
   
   
Q. (Inaudible.) 
  LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was good. The crowds were great. You got a few people shouting odd comments, but that is the absolute minority. In general they were absolutely fantastic and I got cheered on all day. I was quite surprised really there were a lot of, "Come on, Lee", so no complaints. 
   
   
Q. (Inaudible.) 
  LEE WESTWOOD: Only the last sort of four or five holes. I was aware I had the lead after nine or ten or nine, I guess. But I saw Rocco made a couple of birdies, but I could have played my way out of it completely after 10, 12, 13, but a lot of strange things happen the last few holes of Major Championships, as they did today. And made a good birdie at 14 and just failed to make birdie at the last. So it's a bit disappointing. I'm optimistic for the future. 
   
   
Q. Were you surprised the wedge shot on 18 didn't spin back a  
little more? 
  LEE WESTWOOD: Not really. I got a little bit too close to the green and I was caught between sand iron and lob wedge and I don't really want to hit a lob wedge hard, because getting anything coming back fast down that green and it's in the drink. So it was a wedge. 
   
These fairway traps have been difficult all week to play out of and  
you really need to take them absolutely clean and sometimes you catch  
them a bit thin as I did on 10 and as I did on the last and it went  
just a little bit further. I was looking for like 96, 97 yards  
to the front and I got 100 or I got about 88, so.  
   
   
Q. Were you going to go for it on 14 no matter what or were you  
basing it on where you were in the championship? 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: I was going to evaluate the situation when I got  
to it. 
   
   
Q. (Inaudible.) 
   
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit 3-wood, so. 
   
(Laughter.)
