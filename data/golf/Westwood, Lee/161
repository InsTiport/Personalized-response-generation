 Q.   How would you characterize your round?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I played well again, not really dissimilar to yesterday.   There wasn't a lot in it.   Just on this golf course it's fine margins.   Got off to a nice start.   Obviously in the afternoon it's a little bit trickier than in the morning.   The greens aren't quite as good; a couple of putts I hit today wobbled around a little bit, but that's to be expected in the afternoon.   I three‑putted the 13th and then missed the 14th by six inches and really couldn't advance it onto the green and didn't get it up‑and‑down, so that's why I was 1‑over through 5, and then played pretty solidly.   Hit a lot of good shots.   Didn't really think I got the reward from the good shots.  
I played a lot better than 71, so I'm pleased with the way I played again.   
   
 Q.   Comment about Martin's 12‑under.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   It's obviously a really good score.   He's done the majority of his damage around the back nine yesterday afternoon, but you can do that around this golf course.   If you start hitting some fairways you see birdie chances on nearly every hole.   It does give you a chance, the golf course.   
   
 Q.   Are you pleased with your position going into the weekend?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm pleased with position.   I'm going to have a late tee‑off time, so anything can happen.   Here at the weekend the golf course generally gets firmer; whether they'll allow it to do that, I don't know, but it generally toughens up, but there's still always a good score out there.  
   
 Q.   Would you be bothered if it toughened up?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I'm not bothered.   I'd be quite happy if it kept on playing the way it's playing.   I think it's very fair at the moment, and if you play well you can get a good score, and if you don't, then it punishes you.
