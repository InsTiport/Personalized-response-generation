 Q.  Best round of the week, assess your play so far this week.  
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm starting to hit the ball a little bit better.  Striking it a little bit better.  The driving is okay.  It's very difficult to hole putts on these greens.  They are very soft because of all the rain, and that's really the main defense of the golf course.   
Albeit, it is quite tight in places, as well, the greens are quite undulating and they have been quite hard to play this week.  It's been difficult to make putts.   
 Q.  Looking at your chip at 7, is this a demonstration of the undulation and how awkward it makes it around the green when it gets in the wrong spot?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, yeah, that one was sat into the grain and it took off a little bit on me.  Didn't check quite like I thought it would.  I thought it would check into the grain and it released out, but luckily it caught the hole and made.   
That.  Certainly if you miss greens, it's quite difficult to get up-and-down.  You don't want to leave yourself 5-, 6-footers all day.   
 Q.  This is your 14th British Masters and you won the title back in 2007, different venue.  How much are you enjoying the fact that you're back playing in this great championship and also the support you're getting?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It's great to be playing the British Masters again.  It's not been around for a long time and very good to see it back.  It's great to play in front of the crowds in England, and Woburn, as well.  Woburn is an historic place for English and British golf, and the crowds always come out.  The British public like to come out and watch golf.
