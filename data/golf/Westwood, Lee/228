  LEE WESTWOOD:   I was struggling in this thing at little bit at the moment, and the start sort of was a bit of a lie, really.   It was nice to birdie the first two holes, but I don't feel in control of the ball at the moment.   And you get found out pretty quickly around an Open Championship golf course, no matter what the conditions are like.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I've been working on it for three or four weeks now since the U.S. Open.   I didn't feel like I hit it that great there.   Just sort of got away with a lot.   Just one of those things.   You can't have great form all the time.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I am at a point now where it goes left or right.   I'm not often straight.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, you know, it happened in France.   I had a destructive shot, and I made double bogeys and a few bogeys in space of a few holes, and that's what happens when you're on tight golf courses.   If you can't pick a point and shape it off of it, as Bubba did all day, and eliminate one side of the golf course, you're going to struggle.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, you're going to make a few birdies out there.   Just happened to be the first two holes.   I hit a good shot at the 1st although a little bit thin and a little too far left, but a nice little kick‑in to about three feet and a couple of good shots down the second.   But sooner or later you'll get found out.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not really, no.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I've been working on it a few weeks and it's not clicked.  
   
 Q.   Did that hole spook you?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   No.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I saw it.   It nearly hit me.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I mean, you know, no, any golf course is intimidating if you can't pick a point and shape it off it left‑to‑right or right‑to‑left.   You haven't got anywhere to aim.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, that's going to happen.   Unfortunately that was one way I aimed at that trap and was just trying to fade off of it and it just managed to hit a tree.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I practise it all the time, left‑handed there out of the bunker, yeah.   What a stupid question (laughter).   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Can't remember the last time I had to play a left‑handed shot, never mind out of the bunker.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   3?   It was a 5‑iron, trying to hit it right of the flag and got in front of it which I did most of the day and blocked it out right.   I blocked it out right second shot on 4, tee shot on 5, second shot on 7, tee shot off 8.   And it happened pretty much most of the day, getting in front of it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, you're thinking it's a great start but you're just concentrating on the third hole.   That's it.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I need to play better than I played today.   I'm not going to make up any shots playing like that.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Probably both.   Going to have a cup of tea and then go out on the range.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, I don't think so.   I won't work on my game for long on the range.   It's straight downwind, so it's not the best wind to practice in.   So I'll just go and work on a few things and see if I can find something out.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, I don't think so.   I know what it is.   I have an idea.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   What?   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not really, no.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I don't know.   I'll have to go on the range and try and narrow it down to know.
