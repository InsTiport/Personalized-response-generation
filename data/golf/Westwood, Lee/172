Q.   Rounds of 70 and 71, what's pleased you most about your play?
LEE WESTWOOD:   My short game's been red hot.   I played some nice pitches, even Ernie said, walking off the back of the 12th green, I pitched that shot to about four feet and he said, "Bit of a short game wizard now," in a South African accent, obviously.   And I played some nice‑‑ just getting up‑and‑down on 18 after hitting it in the hazard. 
Those sorts of things can make a big difference to your week and going into the weekend with momentum.   I'm much happier coming off hitting 3‑under than I would have been two. 

Q.   How much does your attitude change walking up to a chip?   Are you thinking:   I'm looking forward to this?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not just that, though, a hundred yards in, that's what I've been working on.   I pitch it close from a hundred yards in more regularly now and it can take pressure off a lot of things, your putting, your long game.   You hit one off‑line, you don't look for the magical shot to get it on the green.   You look for where you might be able to get it up‑and‑down from around the green. 

Q.   It's been announced as your only weakness in your game and now it seems to be becoming a strength; how dangerous is Lee Westwood going to be it year?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Obviously very dangerous.   Nice thing about today was I ran a few putts to the hole that burned the edges.   A couple of them, I don't know how they missed.   My long game's not been that good recently.   It was iffy at the Masters, and didn't hit how I wanted at THE PLAYERS but okay at Quail Hollow and gave myself a good chance there.   If my long game starts to come together, I could be dangerous.

Q.   Back in England for the first time since October, other than family, what do you miss most? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Miss the weather obviously.   I miss a lot of things, friends and family.   I miss hills.   I had a day up at Close House last Friday and stood up there, and you miss the green sort of rolling land.   I miss the green, miss how everything is.   But it's green for a reason and today is that reason.   It's pretty wet and pretty cold out there, so I'm not regretting the move right now.
