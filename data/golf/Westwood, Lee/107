 Q. You two seemed to be feeding off of each other coming down the stretch?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It was great. Yeah, we both played well. Danny played really well, controlled his nerves.  
   
 Q. Where would you rank that round from Danny, given the circumstances?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was right there. He hit very few poor shots. I guess he hit it pretty much the way he wanted to all day.   
   
 Q. Tell us about your round a little bit, especially leading up to the chip on 15?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It was a bit scrappy. I got away with a few shots. I made a good par on 11. On 13, it went through the trees and I ended up making four. I played a nice chip on 15. Not many people hole that one under that kind of pressure. You come out and contend in the first major of the year, obviously I must be doing something right.  
   
 Q. When you started to contend were you expecting more?  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. Just continue to do what I've been doing. IÂ’ve been feeling edgy on the greens for a couple of years now. You get under pressure in Augusta and the greens are running 16, 17 on the Stimp, you're going to start feeling a little bit nervous, which I did. But I still made some nice putts coming in, nice putt on 17, nice putt on 18.  
   
 Q. When did you realize what was going on with Spieth, and what was your mindset to try to finish it off there?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I wasn't really paying that much attention to it. I saw the leaderboard when I chipped in on 15. I hadn't really looked much until that stage.  
   
 Q. What about for the Europeans?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Hopefully we'll start seeing European winners again.
