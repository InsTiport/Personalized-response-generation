Q.  Did you know that putt was to retain the Cup?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, but I had a fair idea the way everybody was biting their nails over there.
Q.  What was the key for you to play so well?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Two good partners.  I had two great partners in Sergio and Darren.  Never got down on myself and it's been a great team effort.
Q.  Did you know that putt was to retain the Cup?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I had no idea, actually.  I knew it was fairly big, because everybody was biting their nails on the side of the green.  They looked a bit panicked, especially when Kenny rolled his 15-footer in.  So, it was, obvious.
Q.  What a scrap you had and what a week you had.
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, me and Kenny had a great game today.  I didn't really give him anything, a lot of good shots went in, but two great putts on the last.

It's been a great week.
