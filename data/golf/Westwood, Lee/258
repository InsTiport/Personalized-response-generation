 Q. Thoughts and feelings, Lee Westwood? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not hitting it that great. Not really striking it proper. Putting feels a bit better. I hit a lot of good putts today that haven't gone in, so pleased with the way my putting is going. 

 Q. The last three months, feel it's improving, improving, improving?
 LEE WESTWOOD: The last couple of weeks really. I think I've started this year -- even though they are not going in, a lot more are close.

 Q. How much work have you done in the two weeks, can you quantify in hours? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not so much the amount, it's the amount that's working. 

 Q. Too far back? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know.
