Q.
How do you feel with a 72?
LEE WESTWOOD:  It's not too bad.  I think you take it around this golf course in these conditions.  Start of the day, a bit of an ambivalence in the middle of the round, great 6 I made and rolled it together the last few holes.  16 I got unlucky to make bogey there.  I hit a good shot at 17.  Nice to get up and down at the last to stay within one.
Q.  Some say they have never known the golf course to play more difficult, would you agree with that?
LEE WESTWOOD:  There's been the odd round it's been very difficult.  I remember a few years ago it was very hard and the greens were firm it made it nearly impossible.  Over a period of three days, this is as hard as it's ever played consistently over a period of time.
Q.  You seem to be driving the ball pretty well.
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I've driven it all right.  Not quite happy with the way I swung it today.  I didn't swing it as good as the first day and yesterday I didn't swing it as got first day.  I'll go to the range and just tune it up a bit.  Quite happy with my short game and my putting is good.  I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, 16 and 15.  Sort a few things out and just keep plugging away.  That's what you've got to do on this golf course and not make any silly mistakes.
Q.  How important is experience in the last round?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I would imagine it would be very important.  It's one of those golf courses where if you play really well you can shoot 65.  But very easy to lose your head out there and shoot 75.

Just hit as many fairways as I can, keep hitting good iron shots, make a few putts really.  It's the same as you would on any golf course.  It's nice to be in contention, I've played well recently and no reason why I shouldn't play well tomorrow.
