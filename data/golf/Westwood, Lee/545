Q.
Are you happy with the way you played?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, fairly happy.  Yesterday wasn't too bad, but today was very checky, a day for scrambling.  The wind was swirling a little bit, it changed directions a little bit in all the big trees and it was quite strong, as well, and the course was playing very long.  The fact that the fairways are saturated, and it's sand, as well, you can't compress the ball with your iron shots, so I found that my irons were going quite a bit shorter, so that was quite a problem out there.
Q.  You were putting nicely?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I'm putting the ball well.  I'm carrying on from the Ryder Cup, I putted well there, but you've got to put yourself in position to putt the ball well.  My short game has been fairly good this week.  When I missed the green, I did what I needed to do with the conditions like this.
Q.  You haven't won this season yet.  Is this one of your major goals for the year, or does it really not matter to you, just playing some good golf?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I just happen to be playing well.  I had a chance to win the European Open, but I didn't start too well in the last round.  Obviously I played well at the Open Championship, and I feel like I'm playing much more consistently well.  After a couple of bad years playing there and then coming back last year and winning twice straight off, I thought I might go straight back into winning three or four times a year, but it's not as easy as that, and I'm just happy to be enjoying my golf and getting in contention a bit.
Q.  Thanks for your time.  Keep it going.
LEE WESTWOOD:  Thank you.
