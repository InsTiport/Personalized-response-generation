 Q. This our flagship event Lee and it's obviously a big one for the players too?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's a massive event and one I look forward to all year round. Wentworth is a great play and a special place for The European Tour with the headquarters being here. The course is always in fantastic condition and the greenkeeper always makes sure of that and it is somewhere that I have always enjoyed playing. I think the course suits me well. 

 Q. What would it mean to win here this week Lee? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: It would mean a lot to me to win here this week. Outside of The Majors it is important. It is our flagship event and obviously the most prestigious one on the calendar.

 Q. How do you feel you are playing ahead of the Championship? 
 LEE WESTWOOD I'm playing well I fell. I'm starting to hit the ball well again and feeling good so I'm looking forward to this week a lot.

 Q. Look like we're going to have good weather too? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I hope so. I think the event deserves it. Over the last few years we haven't had that warm sunny weather. This course plays a lot differently when it's hard and bouncy to when it's soft. It'll be tricky this week and, if the wind doesn't get up too much, as it dries out it'll just get harder. 

 Q. It's another very competitive field again this year isn't it? 
 LEE WESTWOOD It's a great field again and it's good for the event too. It's great that the players are supporting it, especially the players that are over in the United States coming over. It lifts the profile of the tournament when people like Vijay Singh and others come over.
