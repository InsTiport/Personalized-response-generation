   RODDY WILLIAMS:  Great start and the momentum keeps going. 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, it seems to be.  I played very well again today.  Started off a little bit iffy, missed a few greens at the start but got it together.  Birdied 15 which was my sixth hole.  I missed from 2 1/2 feet on 16 for birdie.  And then got it going really.  A good drive on 18 and 3-wood from about 290 through the back there, chipped and putted. 
 Driver, 3-wood just on the front on the next.  Made birdie. 
 And a good chance at 2.  Left it in the middle in the hole on 3, good chance which at 4 and 6, birdied 7 from about five feet.  And driver, 3-wood in the short left trap on 9. 
 All in all, it was pretty solid day's work.  I was quite pleased. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Confidence is obviously very high for you at the moment. 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, confidence is good obviously.  I think ten Top 10's in the last 11 events, so, you know, can't help but be confident. 
 You're always a bit mindful when you have a long break, but in the middle of that long break, I finished fourth in Tiger's event and last week came out and started slowly, felt a little rusty especially on the greens but got it going on Saturday and got into the tournament and had a chance on Sunday. 

 Q.  What is the difference, you just seem sharper, in terms of how you're feeling. 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Confidence sort of -- obviously comes into play but you go out with expectations of playing well.  So you're always thinking -- 

 Q.  When you first came out on Tour, what distance were you hitting a three wood - would you take on a 300 yard shot with a three wood? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  No, but the technology has come a long way.  I used to hit 3-wood probably flat-out 240.  That would be a good one.  Now, with the wind, you get it turning over, you know, 270 now, I suppose. 

 Q.  The ninth at 690 yards and you can hit it? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Downwind, for me, sure, but modern technology has obviously helped a lot.  But I think if you looked at the golfers in general up and down the range, I think we're a damn sight fitter than players in the past. 
 Me and Michael were talking about it out there.  Martin, he's 23 years old and we've obviously been on Tour -- I've been on Tour for 15 years now since '94.  When we came out, the gym was empty but we've both been in the gym this week, and it's full this week.  If you go at 5:00 in the evening, you can't get in there.  It used to be for Swedes but now it's for everyone.  (Laughter). 

 Q.  Did you talk to Martin about last Sunday?  Have you spoken to him? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  No, not really.  Not at all.  Obviously said well done to him a few times but no.  I think it's nice to be congratulated when you've won a golf tournament but it's nice also -- you have to forget about it when the next week comes around. 
 I remember when I won my first tournament, it was nearly impossible to concentrate the following week.  I can just about remember, 11 years ago.  So I'm not surprised that he shot a couple over today or whatever he shot.  He looks a very, very strong player.  You know, he's got to enjoy his win for a couple of weeks I think.  It kind of looked like that. 

 Q.  Is this the best start you have ever made to a sason? 
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I'm definitely a slow starter.  It's all to do with my fitness.  I usually come out a bit lethargic and the muscles not really working, but I do a lot in the gym with the muscles on the golf swing and feel very strong and everything feels all right. 

 Q.  In terms of looking back at Sunday, you had a chance to play again immediately after the result -- 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  You mean today? 

 Q.  Yeah, in terms of Martin and beating him by eight shots today? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, but I'm used to it, being in contention.  He's not used to being in contention yet.  I'm used to -- don't want to sound big headed; but I've won golf tournaments and I've won them back-to-back, and I know how to approach the following week when you've played well. 
 He's very much on the learning curve where, 23 years old, he's won his first tournament last week, he's probably still on a high, the adrenaline is still high and he's probably still thinking about how he won last week. 
 But you learn to do that and he'll win many more tournaments. 

 Q.  Any highlights today? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  3-wood, 8-iron into 12 feet on 18 and made that putt. 
 3-wood on the front edge of the next and 3-putted. 
 Driver, 3-wood just through the back, four, five yards I guess on 18, chipped back to three feet. 
 Drive, 3-wood, three or four yards short of the front edge on 1 and chipped it.  It was a tough chip and chipped it eight feet past and made it coming back. 
 Good drive up 7.  Nice, knock-down wedge to about five feet.  Tapped that one in. 
 Leaned into one on the last, and then a 3-wood. 

 Q.  Would you be disappointed if you didn't win one of these three weeks? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  I would hope to win over the next three weeks, yeah. 

 Q.  Are you playing the Indian Masters? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  No. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Thank you very much.
