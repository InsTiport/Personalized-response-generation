  Q. 3-over par through the first seven holes, not going to plan, 6-under the last 11; what changed?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I shot 1-under yesterday and made four bogeys after seven holes and figured if I can make a few birdies -- but this is that kind of golf course. Other times, you don't have to hit too bad of a shot and you can make a bogey. You just have to keep plugging away and grinding and be patient, and good things happen if you play well.  
  
  Q. Tell us about the birdie at 17. Did that look quite special?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. That was my fault really. I was wanting to hit 6-iron in there, hit a sand iron in there. Had to get the 3-wood in there, and hit a terrible shot. Went for all three of the par 5s in two today and missed every one left.   
 So go on the range and have a look at my 3-wood but a good one down the last to make birdie; I hit 3-wood off the tee.  
  
  Q. Wayne Riley was following you around, and thought you were playing aggressively?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just the way I play to be perfectly honest. I've never been one that lays things up, which you do really do need to do around here but I feel on quite good form and I feel like I can be aggressive.  
 The two greens I missed around the back nine were where it went straight over the flag and I was 12, 15 feet from the hole on 14 and straight over the flag on 16.   
  
  Q. Obviously you need to win this tournament to have a chance to win the Order of Merit, it's not impacting on your thinking at all, is it just playing the regular event, trying to win anyway?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, it's quite simple for me. My golf has completely narrowed down to one thing, and that's to win the tournament, and I've played that way my whole career.   
  
  Q. When you hit a shot like the one on 17, and it just avoided the water, do things flash through your mind, that things are going all right?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really. I played the wrong shot and got lucky and got away with it and made four.   
 The key to it was, playing a good chip afterwards and not playing a bad chip and I could have easily hit it in the water from there. And then I made the 15-footer, and then the birdie on the last to capitalise on it even more.   
  
  Q. What were the clubs on the last?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: 3-wood 9-iron to five feet.   
  
  Q. Very good shape.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, well, chances are I'm going to be in the final group going into the third round, and if you'd given me that right before the tournament started, I would have taken it. That's where you want to be if you're trying to win the tournament, playing in the last group.  
  
  Q. When were you last in hospital?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Never had an operation in my life. Never had a stitch. It will be a different experience.   
  
  Q. Do you know that much about it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I believe they put you out, or I hope they do. It's just one of those things, it's got to happen. In the long term, it's going to benefit me a lot.  
  
  Q. How many attacks of tonsilitis have you had?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's been getting on between 15 and 20 in 3 1/2 years.   
  
  Q. Detriment of your golf, you have you felt?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I've been in with chances and caught it and had to miss out on tournaments when I've had it, three times this year.   
 It's time it happened.
