 Q. Lee, so that announcement gives it more weight, that 54 holes was the right decision, would you agree with that?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I think if you haven't finished the second round by 7.00 on Saturday night, and then you're up against it, aren't you. You just have to make do what you can and do your best. At least everybody tomorrow will know that it's the final round. It's not like it's going to be 54 holes and then cut off and whoever is leading. Whoever plays tomorrow's final round will play under pressure knowing that it is in effect the last round. So you just have to take a lot of things into account, don't you. 
 I think it's a unique and exceptional circumstance. 

 Q. Have you ever seen weather like this at a Scottish Open? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: In Singapore or Jakarta I have. 

 Q. Monsoon stuff. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: But not in Scotland. I think it's a shame for everybody. It's a shame for Barclays. It's a shame for Castle Stuart. It's a shame for everybody involved with setting the tournament up. I'm sure Mike's doing the best he can, and unfortunately he's not in control of what comes out of the sky.
