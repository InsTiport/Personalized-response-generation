Q.
So when you turned at 4 under, did you have something better in mind?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Well, no, I hit it okay.  I wouldn't say I hit it great.  I was a lot happier with putting, I hit one poor putt all day on the last green, that was the only putt all day    shot it close on the back nine.

And the front nine was good, I had quite a lot of chances.  Just not quite sharp to shoot 64.  Hitting good on the range    inaudible    the last five years, I learn to accept it.  Just go out there with no expectations.
Q.  Now that you have a few round under your belt
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, working with a few different things on the greens and it's nice to see    left a couple short, a couple hanging right on the edge.  So at the end of the day, could have shot 65, 64.
Q.  That's what Ernie said.
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, Ernie's hitting it good but made nothing.
