 Q.  Talk about your day.  
LEE WESTWOOD: It's not too bad a round of golf.  Got off to a bad start.  Bogeyed the first two holes.  Six holes to play.  4 was playing tough, I bogeyed that.  And I hit a poor shot on 7.  Birdied 8.  And 9 was playing tough today.  All in all good, just a few too many sloppy shots, that's why.  I'm hitting the good shots, and making birdies, but too many bogeys.   
 Q.  Did it get tougher as it went on?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, the front nine was certainly tougher.  You're looking for a quick start and in two or three holes I was 2-over.  So it was bit of a fight.   
 Q.  Is that what you take from this, is you fought your way to be near the top?  
LEE WESTWOOD: 2-over after 2 isn't too bad.  I made a lot of good shots, just hit one or two poor ones.  I'm making some nice putts out there.  I just need to sharpen up on a bit and it should be fine the next three days.
