 Q. Lee, a very good day at the office would it be fair to say?
 LEE WESTWOOD: From the outside looking in, yeah, but I really didn't hit it very well today. I struggled with my swing. Wasn't very consistent. I hit I think three fairways. You normally won't score very well doing, that but probably one of best 67s I've ever shot. 
 I putted nicely. I missed a couple that I should have made, but I'm rolling some nice ones in, 15-, 20-footers, which I haven't been making for the most part of the year, so I'm really pleased with that.

 Q. Is that kind of the biggest thing that you can get out of this week, knowing how much work you've been putting in of late on that particular department of your game? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, well, I've been working hard on the putting just recently and it's becoming more and more comfortable and I'm starting to roll more putts in so I'm very pleased with that.

 Q. You must be very pleased to be right in the mix heading into the final round?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I'm going to have a chance to win the tournament. That's all you ever ask at any tournament. 

 Q. I was just going to say, obviously we know you were at the thing last night --
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, but I've had an ear infection for two weeks and I couldn't hear a lot of what was going on, so it would be wrong for me to comment on anything.
