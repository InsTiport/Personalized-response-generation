   LEE WESTWOOD: Gone from frustration to sickness, now. Yeah. It was a tricky two-putt at the last. I figured -- I thought I'd have to hole it, to be perfectly honest. I didn't see Tom bogeying the last, since he's such an experienced player. But he obviously got a bogey there.

 Q. Did you realise your ball was in the bunker at the last? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I thought it had actually gone down the fairway. It must have gone back and curled back in there. I hit a great shot out of the trap but didn't finish it off. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, no, at any stage. It was one of those kind of days where you couldn't think, yeah, I've got this. You were just trying to get it in. I figured 3-under might be pretty good, and it's going to be good.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: I played great all week. Third place is not to be sniffed at in a major championship. But disappointment, really.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, no point during the day when I felt that, no. I was pretty happy with the way I played all day, hit lovely shots. I made some good up-and-downs when I needed to. The putts on 16 and 17 I thought I'd made. And the biggest disappointment is, you know, obviously, three-putting the last.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean, I hit two good shots, gave myself a nice uphill putt. But the birdie on the previous hole was a nice birdie, too.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I was pretty calm and collected all week. And I felt good in my game and still do. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Both are pretty sickening, but obviously this is The Open Championship and it's the one that means the most to me. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Oh, yeah, I've had disasters out there when I've been doing well. They can happen, and they generally do when it matters the most. 

 Q. Talk about Tom Watson. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: He's still got it, obviously. Don't need me to tell you that. And this is the kind of golf course and links golf is the format of golf that age isn't a factor and you can still compete because it's played mainly on the ground, and golf courses such as this enable you to do that, you know, because you can't try and rip them to shreds.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, hopefully about four weeks.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, you've just got to keep working. You know, I'm putting in the hard work at the moment, and it's obviously paying off because I'm getting closer.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I didn't feel like -- yeah, it nearly hit the flag on 15. You know, it could so easily have been different. But if ifs and buts were putts sometimes.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, that's just it, you know. I mainly avoided it. I haven't made too many mistakes, but I bogeyed three of the last four when you look at it.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, they were only an hour away. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, yeah, before, I'd hit my putt, I figured he had hit the middle of the fairway, so I thought he was going to make 4 from there, but I shouldn't have got ahead of myself, really.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just that I needed to hole it. I thought I needed to hole it. 

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I'm very pleased with my week's work. I played very solidly and had a chance to win The Open Championship. I had a great chance.
