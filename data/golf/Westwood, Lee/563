Q.  Tell me how you felt over that putt at 18.
LEE WESTWOOD:  A lot more uncomfortable than if Kenny had have missed his putt.  Obviously after Kenny's putt, I was under a lot of pressure with that 15-footer for par.

We had a great match all day.  I think it was a fitting way to end on the last under a lot of pressure.
Q.  How do you sum up the team spirit on the European Team?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Everybody is pleased for each other.  Everybody is delighted for Bernhard.  The vice captains, Joakim Haeggman and Thomas Bjorn have done a fantastic job.  Bernhard has masterminded the whole thing.
Q.  Did you seeÃ  the four-balls yesterday as being the decisive turning point?
LEE WESTWOOD:  At one stage in the morning we looked like we were 4-down, and all of the sudden we come out and we're 2 1/2Ã  - 1 1/2; it's like winning the morning session.  And with that point from the two rookies, as well, was massive.
