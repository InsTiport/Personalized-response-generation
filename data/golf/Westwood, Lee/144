Q. You were looking good today.LEE WESTWOOD: All in all I played pretty good.Q. (Inaudible.)LEE WESTWOOD: I wouldn't say really low.  I was a little surprised with the scoring.  I think this is as easy as the golf course is ever going to play.  That shocked me a little bit.  I thought it was a really low one out there for somebody, especially this morning.Q. Did the wind get up on the back nine?LEE WESTWOOD: They said it was going to be tougher in the afternoon.  Links courses the wind picks up.Q. Was the afternoon tougher?LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, 71 this afternoon is better than 71 this morning, sure.  I'm pleased about that.Q. Has your practice changed since the Scottish Open?LEE WESTWOOD: Just to try and get better, really.  I still didn't drive it very well today and didn't hit many fairways, but managed my game well.  So it's a work in progress.  It's an old fault.  It's going to be hard to get out of it.Q. (Inaudible.)LEE WESTWOOD: Is it?  Good.  Great.Q. The winds coming in tomorrow do you welcome it?LEE WESTWOOD: You learn to just adapt to whatever links conditions throw at you.  If it's windy, it's windy.  It's just one of those things that you -- sometimes you have to grind it out.  I'd expect to play The Open, it would be windy at some stage.Q. Does it give you an advantage?LEE WESTWOOD: Certainly helps.  Certainly helps to be playing your 20th Open instead of your first, I would imagine, yeah.
