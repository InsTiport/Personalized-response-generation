Q. You told us pre tournament you couldn't wait to get going, and 3-under 69, happy with how you started?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was solid stuff.  I hit the ball quite nicely.  Pleased with it.  Rolled the ball well on the greens.  A bit unlucky on the greens I thought.  Hit a lot of good putt that didn't go in.  Played the par 5s, 1-over for the par 5s, you're really looking for 2- or 3-under on those the way they are scoring.  So 69 is a good start.
Q. First competitive round since being crowned The Race to Dubai champion.  What pleased you most that you can build on for the rest of the tournament?
LEE WESTWOOD:   I'd be happy if I'm hitting it like that.  Working on a couple things on my swing to shorten my arm swing.  Feels uncomfortable on the 3-woods in the fairway and hit a couple of poor ones which cost me having birdie chances on a couple of the par 5s.  So just go back to the range and keep working on that and it will gradually integrate itself.
Q. Normal day for you, playing with Rory and Justin Thomas, but pretty good golfing company; enjoy yourself?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Played behind them.  Wasn't playing with them most of the day.  What a shock that is.  I kept hitting it 215 and 220 and that's not long enough for these lads.  These lads are getting out 240, 250.  They are nice to watch.  Not only do they hit it a long way but they hit it a long way straight.  There should be an advantage to that.  They are both great drivers of the golf ball and fun to watch.
