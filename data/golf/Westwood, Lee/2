  Q. Congratulations on the win, closing out Tyrrell here on 15.  I know he probably didn't have his best stuff, but 6-under on your round through 15 holes.  You played really well.
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I played really solidly.  I didn't make a bogey, five birdies, one was conceded, I think, but yeah, I played well today, gave myself a lot of chances, and some solid stuff.
 Q. Did the course play a little more like it did Wednesday than yesterday?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, a little bit less blowy, and yeah, I think it was more like the first day, scoring a little bit easier.  Yesterday was tricky obviously.  With a bit more wind around here, it becomes a little bit tighter and a bit tougher proposition.
 Q. You need Matt Wallace to knock off Sergio, just going to go back and see how that plays out?  Will you root against your buddy?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, you lose the first day it's out of your hands, so you need results to go your way in the other matches, but the only way to get into this situation was by winning the second and third matches that I played and I managed to do that.  I played a lot better today than I did the first two days, and we'll just have to see.  We'll know in an hour whether I'm getting on a plane tonight or -- I might still be getting on a plane tonight, you never know, playoffs.
