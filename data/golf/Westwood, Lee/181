 Q.   (No Microphone.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, the flags are really difficult.   17 was amazing today.   But finished with four birdies, which is good.   I got to 10â€‘over par and then I battled back to 6.   So it sets me up for a good round tomorrow and who knows.  
   
 Q.   I was going to ask you, what do you think of your chances for your first Major?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Right now?   Slim.   But you never know what's going to happen in a Major Championship, so just go out tomorrow and try and shoot something mid 60s.   It's been done before.   And see what happens.
