Q.   How would you assess your play? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I played all right this week.   Putted really nicely.   Short game was good, as well.   I don't think I've had a three‑putt all week, which is quite an achievement on this golf course.   Just didn't play the par‑5s well enough.   You've got to do your scoring on the par‑5s, and I played them in 4‑under par.   Didn't birdie any of them the second day, even par on the third day and only 1‑under today and hit great drives down all of them today, so a bit disappointing.
I had a chance to get off to a really hot start and get right into it and missed from sort of 15 feet at the first and then had four feet for eagle on 2, good chance on 5, birdied 7 and didn't birdie 8 from the middle of the fairway.   I could have been 5‑, 6‑under through eight holes and in with a real shot.   I thought the course was set up perfectly today considering the conditions.   If you didn't hit it well it was tricky, as Augusta always is, and if you hit it well there were a few pins in bowls and collecting, and it gave you a chance to shoot a low score.

Q.   How much does the weather affect things out there?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not really.   The toughest part was adapting to the speed of the greens.   The greens slowed quite considerably.   They were drying out as the week went on and got really fast and slick yesterday, and then today you could really run the ball to the hole.   I'll bet you're seeing a lot of putts left short, and obviously the more water gets on them the more they'll start to hold.
