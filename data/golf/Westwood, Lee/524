Q.  Tell me about your round today.
LEE WESTWOOD:  I started slow again, 2 over after four, obviously two or three shots behind everybody else in the first four holes.  Played pretty solidly.  Hit a lot of good shots, a couple of bad ones, made triple on 13, and that killed the score card.

So 73 is not too bad.  Made five birdies I guess.  Making a lot of birdies.  Making a few too many silly mistakes.
Q.  Is the course playing different than yesterday?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I suppose it's playing a little harder with the wind.  It's not really a wind; it's more just a breeze.  I wouldn't even call it a club wind.
Q.  What do you wish you could have done a little different today to make your performance in the tournament a little better?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I wish could have done a lot of things.
