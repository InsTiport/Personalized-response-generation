 Q.   How hard was it to get anything going today?   The back nine is all pars, that's where you want to get something going.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I just didn't make it up on the par‑5s.   Didn't hit a good drive down 2 and only parred it.   Only parred all of them.   
But I hit a good drive on 13, only had 6‑iron, didn't birdie that one.   
Didn't birdie 15 from the middle of the fairway.   
Had good chance on 12 for birdie as well.   
It's a 73 that could have been a 70, but still feel like I'm going to have a chance tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   When you get the birdie on 9 to make the turn, do you think that's giving you the momentum going into the back nine that you needed?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah.   I would have liked to have birdied 8.   That was the easiest flag of the week on that hole.   But didn't.   
Then made a nice birdie at 9 and had good chances at 10, 12, and I didn't birdie 13 and 15.   
So I had a few chances out there, but I don't think 73 is going to do an awful lot of damage.   I'm only going to be maybe four behind.   
   
 Q.   They're at 7 right now.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   If you can catch it around anywhere, it's around this golf course.
