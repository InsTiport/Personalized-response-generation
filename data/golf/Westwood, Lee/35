 Q.  Thoughts on that 68?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Tricky. The wind was up, which you don't normally get here at Sun City. A couple of the flags were tucked away. There's a couple of Sunday pins. So thought it played tricky.   
I played well. Controlled the ball flight. Could have hit a few more fairways. Would have made it a little easier. I was rough too often. No bogeys and 68 was a great start.   
 Q.  How helpful was the local knowledge, experience?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It's always useful, especially when the conditions are slightly tricky. So yeah, all-around game was great, so no complaints.   
 Q.  Club selection when the wind is gusting like that, makes it tricky to commit to and stay with something?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, would have been easier out of the fairways. I hit a lot of fairways, but was just off the edge of a few which can make all the difference around here. You want as few variables as possible when you have flying lies and temperature, altitude and the breeze. It becomes tricky if you're not playing out of the fairway.   
 Q.  Anything you do to rectify that to find a few more tomorrow?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It was mostly the left, so aim for the right.   
 Q.  As far as tomorrow is concerned, you've given yourself a great chance to defend your title. Can you just build on this?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, you can't win this tournament on the first day. So you know, anything under 70 always feels like a great start to this tournament.
