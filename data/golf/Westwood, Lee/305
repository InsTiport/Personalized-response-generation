 Q. Tell us how you played. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's never easy when you are playing somebody you get on with well. At match play (indiscernible) obviously it's always going to be a tough match. He's a bit of a false 65 in the world. When he's on his game, he's the Top 10 in the world. I knew going out there it was going to be a tough game. It wasn't the highest quality game on the front 9. I don't think the golf course and the pin positions and the wind was really helping. I made four birdies around the back nine which is going to win you a few holes. 
 I'm delighted to be through and tie my record for the game, as well. I'm not packing on a Thursday night so I'm delighted.

 Q. How far are you going to go this week? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I have no idea. Every day is a bonus. See how it goes. I'm pretty pragmatic about it after ten years. I think it will be a bonus. 

 Q. Golf course seems very tricky. Players were walking past me all afternoon shaking their heads, saying I couldn't pick the wind, I couldn't pick the altitude. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: We have got a lot of variables out there. You have got the altitude, you have got breeze, you have got the slopeyness -- out there on the 7, you know, there are a lot of variables and it was tough. You just have to get your mindset that sometimes you are not going to need to shoot 5- or 6-under to win.

 Q. So it's a question of being smart or aggressive?
 LEE WESTWOOD: At times out there I didn't feel I could be aggressive at all, even on the putt. I'd get it to 20 feet and have kind of a hog's back in the way and it could break either left or right. You are playing a bit cagey out there and try not to give too much away.
