 Q. Your thoughts on a day which didn't turn out as you hoped? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty happy with the week. Obviously not at my best physically, woke up this morning and it was hurting more than the other days. So all in all, I don't suppose 7-under is too bad, is it.

 Q. What's your current thinking about when you play again?
 LEE WESTWOOD: At the earliest probably HSBC, maybe Dubai.

 Q. Is it something that's worrying you long term or that you have to get it fixed and well fixed? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I haven't had a chance to get it healed. Tried my hardest to get back to The Ryder Cup fully fit last week and got back to 80 per cent which I thought was good enough for The Ryder Cup with the adrenaline and all that, and that was a tough week back and this is not an easy week, six hour rounds and only two days off between finishing The Ryder Cup and starting here. Never going to be right, and it just got progressively more agitated and achy as the week's gone on.

 Q. Playing with Johann Rupert, if it had not been the Dunhill, would you have pulled out?
 LEE WESTWOOD: If it had not been Johann or the Dunhill, I probably would not even have bothered coming.

 Q. With No. 1 looming, how difficult is it to keep your patience, knowing you're playing so well and you just can't get a chance to play? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I haven't been playing so well because I haven't been able to putt in the proper practise sessions till the week before the French Open. You don't expect to maintain the same level and improve if you don't practise, and I haven't been able to do that. So you won't see me coming back until I can practise fully and do myself justice out here. 

 Q. I'm sure you wanted to go grab being No. 1 by winning a tournament --
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'll take it anyway. I've had a great year up until getting injured. Look at all of the World Ranking points I've won, I was leading the World Ranking points for this year by a mile before I got my injury. So, no, not at all.

 Q. Will you pause when it does officially come out in the newspapers worldwide and reflect on how far you've come? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not allowing myself to think about it until it happens. It's something I've always dreamed of and it would be great if it happened. 

 Q. Considering where you were a decade ago, how would you describe the road back? How do you think you were able to get this done? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: A lot of guts, determination, a lot of soul searching at times, taking responsibility for my own golf swing and finding and listening to just one person.

 Q. And that person would be? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Me. 

 Q. When you do show up to play the HSBC, the world's best will be there, Tiger and Phil and half a dozen of your Ryder Cup mates, you'll look around and see pretty quickly, you're going to need to play to hold onto No. 1. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: You have to play well to be world No. 1. I'm not really sort of thinking about it. I'm just hoping I can get some rest and get this right and come out and play as I would like to do.

 Q. This is a great run for Martin Kaymer. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: He's a fine player and he's had a great year. He's good down the stretch. He's a lot like Bernhard Langer, he's mentally very strong.

 Q. What does this mean for European golf, if you do go to No. 1, what does this say about European golf right now?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It just shows the strength of European golf. We've had some fantastic accomplishments from players in majors this year from Louis, Martin, Graeme, I finished second a couple of times in them, as well, so there have been some brilliant performances and it's no wonder the top of the World Rankings are stacked with Europeans.
