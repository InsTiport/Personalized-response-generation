LEE WESTWOOD: I think everybody has played well this week and obviously contributed.  That's why the score line has ended up as it is.   
 Q.  Satisfied with your part you played in it, as well?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I didn't hit many balls over the winter break there.  But still felt I did a bit of gym work and still felt I was going to come out and carry on from Thailand, and I did that.  Hit the ball pretty well this week and obviously won three points, so it's nice to contribute.   
 Q.  You don't like this phrase, elder statesmen, but people have been looking up to you.  Have you enjoyed that responsibility?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I do.  You can't help getting a bit older, can you.  There's young lads on this team and ones that are going to be playing in The Ryder Cup obviously later on in the year.  This is going to be a great experience for them, just feeding them into team golf gradually.  And I'm sure they will benefit from this week.  Nothing but positives to come out.   
 Q.  I gather Darren said I would be happy to take all 12 of you, which is saying something for Europe over the whole anyway, isn't it?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, well, it's obviously not going to be this 12 because there's a lot of other great European golfers, but I know what he means.  This is a very strong European side we sent over trying to win this, knowing Asia would put up a stiff sort of defense on their home turf, and it was a strong side and we've all played well.  I'm sure Darren's delighted.   
 Q.  From a personal point of view, good to start of year in this kind of fashion?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, last year was a bit disappointing.  I didn't play as well as I would have liked but I feel like the swing is coming along all the time and I'm starting to hit it like I feel I can hit it and rolling in a few putts, as well, which is always necessary.  Looking forward to getting going in Abu Dhabi next week.
