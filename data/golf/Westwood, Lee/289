   MICHAEL GIBBONS: Lee thanks very much for coming in.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: You're very welcome.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: For a man who got lost a couple of times on the golf course, 7-under is not a bad score.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, it's a good score. I played well. It was a good round of golf. Nice way to start to the next two weeks hopefully.  
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: Tell us about your lack of direction.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I couldn't find a couple of tees, lost direction, so there was a nice naivete to my play out there today. There's a couple of greens, just got a bit lost.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: Obviously a good start.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, a great start. You're never quite sure what to expect when you come to a golf course that you've never played before, and I managed to play ten holes and practise it, and miserable conditions yesterday, as well. So you spent most of the day walking around. And you know, today I hit a lot of good shots, hit a lot of fairways, made some nice putts.   
  
  Q. Did you spend your time well --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Played great -- since the Masters, and now -- pretty good. Did some nice work last week on the range. So got a bit more work in the wind on the ball flight, down a bit for that. Hit a lot of shots out there that probably couldn't have hit two or three weeks ago.   
  
  Q. You had a bit of a fan out there on the side of the third green, Alex Ferguson. The point is, Monty didn't see him at all --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: You know what a big Man United fan I am, couldn't miss him --  
  
  Q. Inaudible.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I like playing the week before a Major Championship because I like being competitive and the aggression of making putts when you can make them, and it's even better if you're in contention, and in the position I want to be in it a week on Sunday. The more pressure I'm under this week the better I think.  
  
  Q. If your score holds up to the end of the day --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Course record. I look more to the fact that 65 is a good round of golf and in contention for the tournament. It's not much about course record, it's about getting into position and carrying that the next few days and winning the Barclays Scottish Open.   
  
  Q. Your form -- have you been on a streak like this --  
LEE WESTWOOD: I think I play at a level now, you can't have many bad weeks and be No. 1 in the world, No. 3 in the world, but I'm at quite a high level now that I've had a bad week. As I said, when I play well, I'm in contention. When I don't play so well, it seems to be that I finish Top-20. I said just after the U.S. Open that my bad golf was very good now, and I just needed to make sure that my good golf is up to the level of my bad golf in relation --when I've played well this year, it's not been -- I need to play really well more often.   
  
  Q. Where would you rank this spell compared to other spells you've had in your career?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't do a lot of ranking anymore. (Laughter). Oh, you're disgusting. I've only just got that. Pervert.   
 You know, there's no point to it, ranking. I'm just a bit care-free now and I just go out and try and play as well as I can, and whatever happens, happens. There's no point in ranking against how I played in 2000 and how I played major championships, because when I played well back in 2000, I didn't win a Major Championship, so why even bother? Just work with what I've got, improve that and hopefully I'll just keep improving as a player.   
  
  Q. Apart from not -- on adjustment, what you said about more work, how much of an adjustment did you have to make to all parts of your game?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not much of an adjustment. It's more of a synchronisation thing. In the backswing, I like to -- when I am swinging really well, I like to feel like the club seems to go and everything else kind of follows. I get that wrong when I'm not swinging the golf club so good. Get it high at the top of the backswing. When I get it high -- hit every shot from there and control my ball flight a lot easier.   
  
  Q. Can you give us the best example of a linksy-type shot you saw and pulled off today?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I hit driver, second shot into 12 today to about 12 feet which was pretty impressive. But all day -- hit a nice 9-iron into 9. Hit nice little knock-down shot, 120 yards. But holding against the wind, like the second shot on 6, par 5, gave me -- and the second shot on 18, 2-iron against the wind and then -- they are not easy.   
  
  Q. About the only major that you have not finished in the top three recently was where you won the previous week. Is that just a coincidence or are there other things that you can put into practise next week? Is that by coincidence or --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I just think it's a coincidence. I made all right at Pebble, but you know, I could easily have finished Top-5. In fact, I got into position for Top-5 -- I would rather win than not.  
  
  Q. If you were to continue this performance and win on Sunday, would you deserve to be favoured next week?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: A thousand to one, put a few quid on myself (laughter). That has no bearing or relevance.   
 No, I don't think so. I don't have a bad putt -- winning three or four grand, playing for a million quid. (Laughter) By the by really, isn't it.   
 You know I'm a gambling man, so you know I'll see the odds. No, carry on.   
  
  Q. You read what we write?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I read everything you write, yeah. Every, single, last, bit, apart from Facey.   
 I think Birkdale I was joint favoured with Tiger that year. Didn't really know what was going on in 1998. Had not really got into contention in the major championships. I blocked that out.   
 MICHAEL GIBBONS: Lee, thank you very much.
