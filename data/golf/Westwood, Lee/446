  Q. The numbers on the scorecard suggested you played very well?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I did play well. I was five under par and could have been a little better than that but Prayad played well and hung in there all day and started to come back at me on the back nine. I hit a great shot into 16 which sort of closed the game out - an eight iron to 18 inches which put me two up with two to play and I managed to halve 17.  
  
  Q. New venue - how did it play today?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: The greens are very undulating and if you get the wrong side of them it is very tough to get up and down. If you get the wrong side of them it is tough to get up and down. Par is a good score and you are not likely to see a ten under round against a seven under winnign two and one or whatever. It's nice and pars are difficult out there on occasions.  
  
  Q. You have been working hard on your short game and feel that will help this week?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes but a lot of the shots I have practising bumping into a bank and check on the second bounce. The greens are very undulating and you have to pitch up some steep slopes, there are run offs and it is tight and a good short game will stand you in good stead.  
  
  Q. You were in Perth last week so where is your body clock?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I am not too sure. I know I have not slept for more than three hours in a row for two weeks. It is part of professional golf. We play all over the world now and you have to be able to adapt to time change. I am a pretty good sleeper and only woke a couple of times last night but it was a bonus being first out this morning as I have been up at 5am anyway and there was almost no need to set an alarm clock.
