   LEE WESTWOOD: I played all right again. I had a nice finish. Could have bogeyed the last six holes, but didn't, 68, pretty good score.

 Q. Nice work-in-progress?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, there or thereabouts, I'm only four behind, which I was more than that with a few holes today. Well within touching distance. There's a lower score out there.

 Q. Keegan Bradley was saying it's good playing alongside yourself, and you were spurring each other on out there. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's easy to get momentum. We were all having a lot of birdie putts out there and playing quite nicely.

 Q. Plenty of chances? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, lots of chances. The two birdies I made on the front nine, I pitched it stiff on 3 and pitched it stiff on 7, but I had a few good chances and rolled a nice one in on 13, a nice one in on 15 and a nice one on 17. 

 Q. What do you sense is necessary for the weekend? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I don't know. I'll just go out and try and play a bit better than I played. I've not hit it great but I've not hit it all right and obviously make a few more putts.
