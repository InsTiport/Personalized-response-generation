  Q. Well that's your best round here at Augusta for quite some time, for nine years. How comfortable were you, especially having to close it out practically in the dark?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I was pretty comfortable all day. Made a lot of good shots, made a lot of birdies. Could have made three eagles quite easily, I was within 15 feet of the flag on three of the par-5s. And hit one in two. So that was a treat for the round, really.   
 But to finish in the dark, I just wanted to get it over and done with and know what I'm doing tomorrow morning. Sometimes it's easier to have a downhill left-to-right 3-footer in the dark on these greens than when you can see.   
  
  Q. But the bogey on 17, was that partly to do with the failing light?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, no. It took me by surprise, that putt. The first one it took me by surprise how quick it was. And then I don't know, on the next one it broke left-to-right up the hill and then didn't break right-to-left going back down the hill. So and I missed that as well.   
  
  Q. You did have eagle putts on all the par-5s today. What were you happiest about your game?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I drove the ball very well. I bombed my drive on the last one, really. And I got away with that a little bit.   
 But my iron shots were good, right where I wanted to hit them. Right below the hole most of the time. And I played the par-5s well.   
  
  Q. Ever had a later finish than this?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I had some late finishes. Later than this on the clock, but not as dark as this, I don't think.   
  
  Q. Sleep well.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Thank you.   
  
  Q. Were you playing faster than normal on the back nine?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, we were out there pretty much -- we had to wait on the 17th and 18th green.  
  
  Q. You weren't walking any quicker or trying to push to get it done?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No.   
  
  Q. Did you discuss finishing it at all?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: We didn't really want to come back in the morning. I didn't want to play the 18th. You know, they bring you back, I don't know what time they're going to bring you back, 8, 9 o'clock, it's going to be quite cool and 18 could play driver, 3-iron for us in the morning. It was just a driver, 6-iron then. So that was the main reason for me carrying on.  
  
  Q. So you're in good shape, aren't you?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I have always been a slow starter at this tournament pretty much. So it's nice to get off to a good start and just try and get in position for Sunday afternoon to try and get into a good position there.
