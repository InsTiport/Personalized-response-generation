Q.  So you finished strongly in Ireland, suggests that the game is just about there at the moment?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, playing a lot better.  Obviously got quite a lot of confidence, so I'm looking forward to this week.
Q.  Was there one particular element that stopped you getting right up there last week?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Just got off to a slow start.  I didn't sort of do too much the first few holes and that was the difference.  I could have holed a lot more putts.  Still missed a few short putts.
Q.  It was that type of course, wasn't it.
LEE WESTWOOD:  The greens, I'm sure the guys that were there thereabouts didn't miss many from two feet and I missed quite a lot.
Q.  How do you compare this week with the pace?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Pace is quicker, maybe not quite as true but that's just the grass, it's the seed in the grass, it does wander around a bit, but certainly the golf course is in as good condition as I've ever seen it.
Q.  Good to see you in good health this time around.  How bad was it that day at the final, because your eyes were streaming?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I didn't feel so good.  Just one of those things, it took me a while to shake it off.
Q.  Is there anything you can put your finger on why you've won The Match Play and you were in the final last year, is it just because the course is different?  Does it suit you better in October, or is it just a quirk of fate?
LEE WESTWOOD:  It's a quirk.  I finished second in the PGA, so I've played well in the spring as well.

You know, I've had some good results, just not played very well the last three years.
Q.  And how do you feel about the way the BMW Championship looks at the moment?  It's a good, quality field.
LEE WESTWOOD:  They have got the field of a big tournament, they have got a great field.  It's right where it should be and a great sponsor.
