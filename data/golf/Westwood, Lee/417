 Q. What was the key to your lowest round of the week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well I just kept playing the way I had been playing all week. I hit a lot of good shots, hit it close a lot and was unlucky not to make hole in one at the 12th, it just lipped out and I left it on the edge. But the key was that I made a couple more putts, that is what has been lacking this week. The first day I came out, and that was really where I let myself down this week. I made seven birdies that day and only shot one under par. That was sloppy golf but I tend to do that when I have had a couple of weeks off and a break, I get a bit jaded and I didn't make enough of all those birdies on the opening day. That is why I am only five under par at the end of the week.

 Q. Give us a sense of playing conditions out there?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It is a little bit trickier with the wind but if you are hitting it well enough then some of the flags are accessible and if you play well enough there is a good score out there.

 Q. Tiger has started incredibly well and now Padraig is one behind, what will his mindset be now?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I am sure Padraig will keep telling himself that he is doing nothing wrong. Five pars to start the day is by no means a poor start but we all know that Tiger is capable of shooting silly scores, especially round here because he obviously likes the place and reads the greens very well. But Padraig needs to just keep plugging away because Tiger is just as capable of making bogeys as much as anybody else.

 Q. How are you feeling about your chances for next week, pretty good I'd imagine?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, I have got better as this week has gone on so I am looking forward to next week. It is the last Major of the year and having come so close at The Open Championship, I will try and put that right next week and get the 'W' as they say over here.
