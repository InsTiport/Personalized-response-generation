Q. How have you managed to shoot a 67?  What have you done out there today?
LEE WESTWOOD: I played well.  Got off to a nice start.  Was 3-under through five.  There's going to be some tough holes out there but at the same time there's going to be a few birdie chances.
I had a good break on 15 when I pushed my second shot; pushed it to four feet, but looked a good shot but it was ten yards right of where I was aiming.  But just played solidly.
Q. Breezy conditions continuing and cool out there first thing in the morning?
LEE WESTWOOD: Ball is not flying very far first thing and it's a bit breezier today.  The wind's changed slightly so it's not giving you quite as much help down 15 and 18.  I think all in all, it's a really good round.  I'd be surprised if anybody shoots any lower today than 67.
Q. We've often seen players come from off the pace, particularly at this course and give themselves opportunity as the winds pick up in the afternoon; are you that player this weekend?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, hopefully.  On my 10th hole yesterday, I holed from about ten feet to not go 6-over par.  You can change it pretty quickly by hitting some good shots and playing well around here.  Now I'm 2-under and 5-under is leading and who knows what it will be at the end of the day.  Maybe the wind will pick up this afternoon with a bit of luck and the leaders won't get too far away from me.
Q. Do you feel involved?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah.  I don't think any lead's comfortable around this golf course.  There's danger and trouble everywhere.
