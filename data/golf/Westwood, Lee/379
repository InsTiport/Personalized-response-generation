  Q. When you said yesterday that (indiscernible), do you feel that you accomplished that today?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean, not entirely pleased with the round. I didn't get off to a fast enough start. I didn't drive the ball quite as well today as I had driven it in the first three rounds.   
 But no, I had some good shots coming down the stretch there. I got a bit unlucky at 14; the ball didn't feed down the hill there; and 15 I had two great shots and then felt I played a good chip and it didn't release on me, and I had a spike mark on my line; and then 16 hit a great shot in there, didn't make birdie; 17 made birdie and then 18 hit two great shots. When I needed to put a bit of pressure on Phil I did do, but he played nicely on the back nine when he needed to, and the second shot into 13 was incredible.   
  
  Q. Are you getting to a point where it's a bit frustrating to be so close and not quite there?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: It would be frustrating if it was like seven years ago and I was 260th in the world. That would be frustrating, and not knowing which end of the club to hold. I try and take the positives out of everything, and I finished third, third, second in the last few major championships. I can't be too disappointed. I'm getting closer.   
 And Phil and I were talking in the scoring tent, and he thinks I'm playing the best golf out of anyone in the world recently, and he's been that man where it's been hard to get over the finishing line and win that first major and he knows exactly how I'm feeling and just to keep plugging away.  
  
  Q. Is there anything you take away from this to prepare for the rest of the year?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, just the way I've played and how close I came to winning the Masters. It's been nothing but positives, really.  
  
  Q. This is by far your best Masters. Are you pleased with it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I would say if I was analyzing, I would say at the start of the year the Masters would have been the tournament that suited me the least really. I would say Pebble, I've played well there in the past; St. Andrews, I'm getting the hang of that; and Whistling Straits I like. I'm delighted that I finished second. If you would have given me that at the start of the week, I probably would have taken it. But obviously slightly disappointed because I came so close.  
  
  Q. Why such a good result here?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm getting better. I've got less weaknesses in my game, my short game is improving, my longer play is improving, I'm much calmer out on the golf course than I used to be, I think. And just enjoying golf, and I put a little bit of extra preparation getting in early for this year's Masters. I think that paid off.
