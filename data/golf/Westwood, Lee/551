Q. Bad start and difficult to get back into the match?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Well yes that's right. I'm not very comfortable with my swing at the moment, it is not feeling very good but I played all right yesterday, just struggled a bit today. But Davis played great. He hits it a long way and a long way through the air, hits it very straight, the course is perfect for him, he is putting nicely so I don't see any reason why he shouldn't go all the way to be honest. He was something like seven under par for 12 holes so, hopefully they keep shortening the par fours so he can knock it on, like they did to the sixth today. He hit a lovely shot there to about eight feet and that sort of summed today up really. That is how he is driving the ball and it all looked under control.
Q. What is the problem with the swing?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I just feel a bit trapped on the way down and have got into a bad position on the backswing but it is not something I haven't encountered before. But I'm not unhappy about going home, I'm not too disappointed.
Q. Are you going to Dubai now?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, I am going home tonight and I will have about two and a half days at home and then will go out to Dubai on Monday evening. There is a silver lining to every cloud.
