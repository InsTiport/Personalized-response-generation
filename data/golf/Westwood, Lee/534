Q.
Nice way to end out the day right there.  How do you feel about your round today?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I played well all day.  I hit a lot of good shots, kept the momentum going when I needed to and missed it in the right place when I missed the greens.  Two bloops were missing from about two and a half, three feet on the last and three-putting 16 for par.

Other than those two, it was a pretty solid day.
Q.  How are the greens playing for you?
LEE WESTWOOD:  They're a nice pace.  They're not as quick as I've ever seen, and they're certainly softer than they have been in previous years when I've played here.  I shouldn't imagine they'd be rushing to put water on the next few days.  They'll probably firm up and the course will get harder.
Q.  Do you expect the wind will help it out, maybe firm it up some?
LEE WESTWOOD:  The wind wasn't too strong today, it was kind of bearable out there, but I don't know what the forecast is.  I've heard there's showers in the forecast, but we'll just have to see.

Whichever way the course plays, it always plays fair and it's a great golf course and you get exactly what you deserve on it.
Q.  How do you feel about going into the second round tomorrow where you are right now?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I'm in a good position.  This is the best start I've ever had to this tournament.  I've played well here in the past, finished top six a couple of times, so it's a course I've always felt fairly comfortable on and it seems to suit my game, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow because today is about as good as I've played in quite some time.

Thanks.
