   LEE WESTWOOD: I was pleased with the way I played.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, he wishes it was a buck.

 Q. Really good pairing. Talk about that. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, we've both been playing very well, and a lot of the English lads are for that matter. Paul has been playing well and lost in the final of the Match Play. And that's why we're all headed up there towards the top of the World Rankings. I don't think English golf has looked this good for quite some time.

 Q. Did the course play tougher today? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: It felt a little bit tougher, yeah. You know, it's drying out slightly. The flags were the main difference. There were some real sneaky ones in there. You just have to have a lot of patience like you always do around this golf course. 

 Q. What's the plan for the tomorrow and Sunday? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just to carry on doing what I'm doing, really. I think I've got my game plan pretty well sorted out. Even the scores have proved that. And I'll just try and stick to that. Nothing is going to change. Just try to minimize the mistakes and maximize the opportunities.

 Q. Are you pleased with the way you're striking the ball? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm delighted with the way I'm striking the ball. I'm hitting the ball really good, driven it well, all but a couple of drives, and rolling a few putts in when I've missed greens. I've made some nice chip shots and bunker shots.
