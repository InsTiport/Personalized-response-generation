 Q.   Five birdies, no bogeys, very nice start.   Talk about it, please.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I played really well.   I got off to a nice start.   Hit the fairway at the first and then hit a U wedge to a foot and a half.   
Hit two good shots to the second and chipped it to about this distance.   So 2â€‘under after 2.   
Then got a bit of momentum, hit it good all day, hit it in the fairway a lot, missed two fairways, just in the semi rough.   Hit a lot of good iron shots.   So it was a really solid 67.   Couldn't have really done any worse.   
   
 Q.   Did you find something in Malaysia?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I found it in Malaysia, but lost it at Quail Hollow.   No, it's not like that.   I'm walking with Mike Walker on certain aspects of the swing and when you are making changes, some weeks and some days it feels like you can do it and other times it doesn't.   
So I just, once I lost it a little bit at Quail Hollow, I went back to Mike and he took me on the range and gave me the feelings again on Monday.   And then the things I'm working on are not alien to me, they're things I worked on in the past and I'm able to take them on to the golf course.  
   
 Q.   What kind of things?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just certain swing moves and feelings and swing mechanic things to make me hit it straighter and distance control and strike more consistent.   
It was good today.
