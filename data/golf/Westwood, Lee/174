Q.   Well done.   4â€‘back, what will you hope to do now this afternoon? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just to play the way I played the first two days, hopefully.   I got off to a bad start yesterday hitting the ball on the first two holes.   So it was nice to come out and make a couple of birdies straightaway this morning.   Unfortunately, I bogeyed the last.

Q.   Your game's been pretty sharp this week?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, all of my game has been pretty sharp, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the day.

Q.   (Indiscernible)?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, if there's any course to catch up on, you can catch up on this one.   It throws out a lot of birdies if you play well.   It obviously penalizes you if you don't and you get out of position.

Q.   Is it softer with the rain?   Can you be more aggressive? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   It doesn't seem that much softer out there.   The greens seem firm.   I only played three of them, but they'll get firmer as the day goes on, depending on the weather, of course, because today's forecast is much like yesterday.
