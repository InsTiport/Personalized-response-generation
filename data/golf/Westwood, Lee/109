Q. Thoughts on the day?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's a good start.  Played solid.  Made a couple sloppy bogeys.  At the par 3, 6th, hit 9-iron and then -- right into 10.  Other than that, played really well.  Putted nicely, hit a lot of fairways.  Under par on what wasn't the easiest day.
Q. Are you a big fan of Donald Ross courses?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I am, when they are set up like this, as well.  There's penalties for missing the fairways.  Fantastic condition.  Yeah, obviously Barclays is a great sponsor of golf and they have been for many years, and all around it's a great tournament and a great golf course.
Q. Goes without saying, just how important is that start to get to the weekend in New Jersey?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, good finish this week -- very volatile in the Playoffs, you can move up very quickly if you play well.  I haven't played that well all year, so it would be nice to start here.
