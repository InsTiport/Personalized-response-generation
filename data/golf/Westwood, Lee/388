   MARK WILLIAMS: Lee Westwood, thanks for joining us. Second round, 6-under, 68 to be 7-under. Little bit of an up-and-down round, but probably glad to be done and then after the morning session.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes. It was a bit breezier than I thought it was going to be this morning. The wind got up a little earlier, and at times out there I was a bit undisciplined.   
 I went for a couple flags I shouldn't have gone for. I played overconfident, tried to play a couple of secret shots. I should have just aimed 30 feet left or right of the hole. All in all it was pretty good.   
 Could have made two hole in ones in the last three holes on 7, to about 18 inches, must have lipped out and 9, grazed the hole as well. Missed that one. It was a solidish day. Probably 13 greens in there in regulation.   
 When I did hit greens, I hit it close. And I'm pleased with the position I'm in for the weekend.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Let's have some questions for Lee.  
  
  Q. Lee, when you said it must have lipped out, could you see it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I didn't -- from where it finished and where it landed, it must have come really close because the crowd saw it and jumped. Like oh. Then at 9 it was all over the flag. It must have just grazed the hole.   
 But no. With about five holes to play, the wind was starting to pick up and it looked like it would go in. If I get in at 1-under from there, and 2-under from there, 7-under. Have a little pat on the back, I suppose.  
  
  Q. You said you were a bit undisciplined and got overconfident on your swing. Is that a sort of wake-up call for next week as well?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think so. Tried to do too much on the third hole. Tried a low cut with a 9-iron. Missed it in the right trap which was dead. 16, tried to do the same, tried to hit a hard cut with a 5 and should have been aiming 20 feet left of the hole.   
 And 13, I dropped a shot there, tried to hit a hard hook with a 3-wood, and just got a bit in front of it and bit steep and hit it high right and made bogey at 13.   
 They were the three undisciplined moments of the day. Other than that, I hit it close a lot. And when I was disciplined, I hit it exactly where I was aiming. I was never in too much trouble.  
  
  Q. Lee, you're playing so well at the moment. Can you remember when you were last playing poorly? Does it seem like a long time ago?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Playing poorly?  
  
  Q. When you were playing poorly, it seems you've never played well. Do you get that --  
LEE WESTWOOD: You try not to remember when you're playing poorly when you're playing well. No. I've had off weeks, but I wouldn't say -- you know Abu Dhabi, I didn't play great, but there were reasons for that. Lot of variables.   
 Other than that, you know, snapped out of that pretty quickly and went third in the playoff the next two weeks. You know, I think if you fall from the World, you have to have a level of consistency that's hard. You can't afford to play poorly.  
  
  Q. Twelve years without win in America, how does that start with regard to your ambitions for the season?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's a priority to win here again, for sure. I've given myself a few chances over the last couple years, and, you know, be nice to not -- get in the tournament in Hawaii the first time, because I didn't get a chance to play the time I did win here, and so --  
Q. Baby reasons.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Got married. Yeah, good excuse. Obviously the main priorities is a Major Championship this year. That's really what I put my main focus on, when I came close to the PGA Championship last year.  
  
  Q. Just below those winning again in America.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: A Major Championship is what I'm gearing the year around, the Majors, and obviously I'd like to defend the money list, but closely on the heels of those is winning here again.  
  
  Q. Lee, were you talking about being maybe a little overconfident. It certainly beats the alternative, doesn't it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. It's good to be overconfident. You should be confident and disciplined. This is the kind of golf course that requires a lot of discipline. It's severe if you start -- in the wrong place and missing flags -- with the flags in the wrong place, much like a Major Championship might be. The penalties are there for all to see with lakes and runoffs and traps.   
 I like it. It's a nice golf course. I've tackled it fairly well and had a good game plan over the first couple of days, which I intend to stick to.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Your victory 12 years ago here was the week before the Masters. Do you think that's a good omen? You getting any vibes from that?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I haven't really thought about it too much until I was talking to the press yesterday. But certainly -- it almost feels like a similar golf course to New Orleans where I won where the wind picks up in the afternoons and greens are very thick. Another golf course you have to be disciplined. I can feed off that as well.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Okay. Anything else for Lee?  
  
  Q. Speaking to some players, you get the impression they think they might have to win a Major, maybe play -- move their game up a level or play at a different level. Do you feel you can just play your own game and win a Major?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No. I made that mistake in 2000, was looking for another level when I was four in the World and there wasn't really one to.   
 It's about fine-tuning and sharpening everything up just a little bit. Lots of little things make big improvements. I think my game -- I've proved over last couple of years, my game is good enough to win a Major Championship if I just do a couple of things -- certainly my short game is better now than it was even six months ago.   
 And if I just do the right things at the right times, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't win a Major Championship. I drive it well enough, hit my irons well enough. Short game is coming up to a standard where it's starting to look like I ought to contend week in and week out, really.  
 MARK WILLIAMS: Thanks for making the time to visit with us, Lee. Good luck on the weekend.
