LEE WESTWOOD:  I don't know, I'm going to hit some balls.

It's just difficult to sum it up.  Nothing really went right.  I hit a lot of good shots, not particularly    if I would have walked off with a 68, I would have thought, yeah, I played good.  But to shoot a bit less than 68, not bad.

I didn't hole any putts.  I hit some poorly from long distance, three putted the 1st and then 6 and then 14, 15.  All in all, I was quite pleased with the way I played.
Q.  Hope tomorrow is better?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I finished off strong.  I just stripped the ball well.  I was kind of surprised I walked off with 73.
Q.  It must have been different for you to go out with a full set of clubs.  These days you've been just going out with a putter, right?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, it was (laughter).  Nice one, Scott.
Q.  No conducting a wave?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Not enough people there for a wave today.
