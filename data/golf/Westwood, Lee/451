 Q. Has anybody leapt in front of you saying "Boo" this week thinking it would be funny?
 LEE WESTWOOD: A couple of caddies. 

 Q. How are you feeling? Still feeling knackered? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Shattered, yeah, quite flat. I'm sure you feel the same. 

 Q. If you were not the defending champion, would you be taking the week off? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I might have done, yeah, I have to say. You know how draining The Ryder Cup week is. But I also think after last week, it's good to get straight back into it quick, especially this is obviously a big week, and next week is a big week as far as where the Order of Merit is concerned. If I can have a couple of good weeks, I can get right in there. 

 Q. Padraig is not sure about playing next week, either. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well if he wants to take the week off, he can feel free. (Laughter).

 Q. Looking back on The Ryder Cup now and how the dust has settled, what are your thoughts on it? Any change in the singles list on the Sunday? You spoke about it as well. Things could have been differently? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. I think we had to have -- I don't want to say strong players, because anybody that plays in The Ryder Cup is a strong player. If it gets close with an hour to go or half an hour to go, and you need somebody out there to hole a 4-footer, do you want somebody who has never played in The Ryder Cup before, or somebody that's holed a putt like myself to retain it like we did in Detroit and played in front of American galleries before and got the experience, and like Padraig, as well, in the last match; I know if it all came down to the last match, there's no better man than Padraig at the moment to close it out.

 Q. Especially the way he was putting on Friday. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I didn't see. 

 Q. What about missing out on the Saturday, as well, when you heard you were not playing on Friday, how did that affect things? Seemed like a bizarre time to tell you. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, when you've played 25 times out of 25 times, there's no good time to tell somebody they are dropped for a session. I wouldn't use that as -- at the end of the day, Nick was the captain and he had to do what he thought was right, and if he looked at me and thought I looked tired, you know, I told him I wasn't, but you know, it's like I suppose Brian Higgs turning around to Fergie, and Fergie said at the end of the day -- so Alex is on the team, same with the England manager. 
 So whoever is in charge makes that final decision and he has to decide what he thinks is right. 

 Q. How about next time, would you be opposed --
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not ready for captaincy.

 Q. I thought you might make the short list --
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm part Welsh. 

 Q. Are you? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. 

 Q. You've just gone up in my estimation. What about playing captain? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I think you saw last week, playing is not enough, especially nowadays. Don't think there will ever be a playing captain, not with all of the decisions to be made and stuff like that. 

 Q. What about the captain for next time, because a lot of the blokes have ruled themselves out. Ollie says he still thinks he can play for it and Paul said the same thing, that he says he will play and make the team and Monty said the same. Doesn't seem an obvious candidate other than Woosie? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I think the 7 to 1 was great. I would be pleased to see Woosie get the captaincy again. Obviously he's got a massive advantage over everybody else that he's Welsh, and even bigger advantage over everybody else that he's been a captain before and knows what to expect. 
 I'm sure even though he won by a record margin in Ireland, he probably looks at it, if I were captain, I'd do something different or change it. 

 Q. Just a little bit on the tournament, so you feel a bit flat, but do you expect the adrenaline to kick in? Does it kick in more so when you are the defending champion?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Absolutely. You know, it helps I'm defending champion. It helps I like the golf course. It helps I'm playing an hour from where I live. So there's going to be lots of home support. 
 You know, you've got the goal of trying to win the Order of Merit in my sights, as well, and a lot of the people that are not -- that are up there to try and win it are not here this year and I think there's only really, if you look at the top man, McDowell, so there's a lot of things this week to get up for, and I'm sure after I've got a good night's sleep tonight, an afternoon tee off tomorrow, I'll be ready to go and feeling a bit fresher than I am right now.
