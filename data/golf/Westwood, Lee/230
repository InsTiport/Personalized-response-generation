Q.   You got it back to even. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I made a couple bad bogeys.   Bad bogey at 9, missed a short one left.   And then bogeyed 12 and 13, which were a couple of bad bogeys there.   One of them you're trying to birdie, obviously the 13th, and the 12th is the easiest flag.   So I didn't quite hit it as well today.   And my distance control, I wasn't striking it properly.   I hit it short, so that makes this golf course tough.   All in all, it was a good scramble to get around in 72. 

Q.   Do you think you've got a bit of momentum going for tomorrow?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm only five back.   It's not as close as I'd like to be, but there's a chance if I can get a score going, make a few birdies and then go a few under on the back nine. 

Q.   Charl made all those birdies to finish last year.   Anything is possible around here. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Oh, absolutely.   This golf course gives you a chance if you're playing well.   You've got the par‑5s, especially the par‑5s on the back nine.   They've got the flags set so you can make a couple of eagles.
