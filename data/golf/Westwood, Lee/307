  Q. 72, you haven't really knocked yourself out of the tournament.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, 5-under is leading. 72 is in contention. So, yeah, you can't really do too much damage with being far down at the end of the first day -- hopefully, anyway.   
  
  Q. It's a situation where it's a new golf course for everyone, no one know what is to expect. What were you looking for out there today?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just to play like I played for the first 15 holes really. I played very nicely and gave myself a lot of chances without really making any putts. I hit a lot of good putts, but the greens are firm very different to what we putt on week-in and week-out. They are quite slow. You end up bashing them so it's hard to get the ball rolling in the hole.   
  
  Q. When you feel like you have to hit it that extra bit hard, it's difficult to keep it online sometimes?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it can affect your stroke, can't it. We are used to putting at about 11 on the Stimp and these are probably Stimping at about 8. It's tricky and it's one of those things. Greens are firm very slopey this week, and maybe they can't cut them down as short as they would like, I don't know.  
  
  Q. World No. 1 for the first time fall, you lost it for a while and got it back with a win last week which has to be extra special. Does it feel different getting No. 1 the second time?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: A little bit. You know what to expect obviously if you've been in that situation before. You sort of take it in your stride a little bit more I guess.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like there's more pressure being No. 1 than otherwise?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really. You have less time in the day for yourself, more media and stuff like that. No more pressure, maybe the first time around there's a little bit more, but you've reached kind of the pinnacle and you know it's something you've always dreamed of and you try and live up to that.   
 Then the second time around, you tell yourself in your mind that you've got there, so you should just enjoy it while you're there really.  
  
  Q. As far as the second round, you going to do anything this afternoon to practise or just say, you know what, I didn't really have the feel of the greens and take it easy or do you go out and do a bunch of work?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'll probably hit a few putts. I won't hit any balls. On the greens is really where you win and lose a tournament so, need to get used to the speed of them a bit more I guess.
