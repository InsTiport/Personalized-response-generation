Q. Tough finish. 
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, brutally hard out there. I think the scores probably suggest that, don't they? It would have been nice to par the last three holes and get in at level par, but 2‑over par might not be that far behind and we know what can happen at the weekend at Augusta, so hopefully going into Sunday back nine I might have a chance. 

Q. Was it nice to spend that time with Tom Watson at the end of his career?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's been great. I thought when the draw came up it was going to be a privilege to play with him in his final Masters. And I enjoyed that moment, probably not as much as he did, but I certainly enjoyed it.

Q. Did you say anything in particular to him?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, we chatted it up, yeah, the two days. I asked him going down 15 if he remembered the first time we ever played and it would have been 1996 in the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan and he didn't remember that.
(Laughter.) I can't believe it. I can't believe a big moment like playing with me for the first time had slipped his mind. 

Q. What struck you about the moment coming up 18 with him and just what did you feel about that?
LEE WESTWOOD: It wasn't just the moment coming up 18, it was just how much he's loved here by all the patrons and the players as well, I think. 

Q. How about his read on 18. 
LEE WESTWOOD: That's an easy one to make there. No, you get it to the top of that hill and it should go in. I said to him as he walked by, I said, "I can't believe you missed that." 
(Laughter.)

Q. Is this what separates golf from other sports is that you have that generational aspect that's always coming up?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I suppose so, yeah. I mean, what other sport would you ‑‑ and look, Tom nearly won a Major seven years ago at Turnberry and you don't get that in any other sport.
