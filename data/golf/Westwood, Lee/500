  Q.  What was going through your mind on the playoff?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Well, I knew everybody else was going to have a go, but unfortunately got into the semi-rough, and I had to dig for it a bit and it just came out and didn't quite carry.  I had a great line, right on the flag.   
 You've got to play these things when you've got a chance and sometimes they pay off and sometimes they don't.  But having said that, 12 behind with nine holes to go, you don't really think you're in there.   
  
  Q.  Lucky to be in the playoff?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Well, I didn't even imagine, even when I had one hole to play, that I would ever be in a playoff.  So, one of those things.  I'm not disappointed at all.   
  
  Q.  Did you see the ball go into the water on the second hole?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah.  And really in the grand scheme of things was the two fantastic putts on the last two holes in regulation play.  But you know, they should have finished better because they made a mess of 18 the first time around.  Funny tournament, strange things happened.   
  
  Q.  Do you feel for Ross?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  I don't really feel for Ross at all.  Bad shot at the wrong time and you get penalised.
