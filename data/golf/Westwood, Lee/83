 Q.  Good start; good finish.  What's your verdict?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Hit a lot of good shots out there.  Gave myself a lot of chances.  You know, could have been a bit lower, but 69 is a good score around this golf course.  Hit a lot of nice shots, so I was pleased with that.   
 Q.  That's the ideal start, isn't it?  Birdie, eagle; you think anything can happen?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, roll in from 18 feet on the first can and then chipped in on the second for eagle.  It was a nice way to start the day.   
 Q.  Talk me through the last hole.  That approach was beautiful, wasn't it?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I had a good yardage for 3-wood.  I just had to cut one up and it landed in the perfect shot and went up the hill and rolled down close.  Just struggled to read the green a little bit.  I couldn't see anywhere near as much break as it had on it.  Looked right lip and it was probably outside right.   
 Q.  With the light, is there a satisfaction or relief to get things done?  It's pretty gloomy.  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it gets dark quick, and I'm not a morning person, so I'm very pleased I haven't got to get up early and come back for a shot.   
 Q.  You will be one of the later starters as you have been throughout the week.  What are your thoughts into the final day?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I'm 11-under par, 13 is leading, so I've got a good chance.  That's what we were talking about after the first day, 66.  Yeah, it's a good position to be in.   
 Q.  You've got a very good chance, haven't you, I presume that there's nothing but positives to carry into the final round?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, absolutely.  Really looking forward to tomorrow and hopefully getting off to as fast as a start as I did today.
