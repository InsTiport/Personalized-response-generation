 Q.     4â€‘under for the championship?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I did all right today.   I played pretty well.   I think the golf course gave me a lot.   Started off, 17 is playing really tough, unreachable.   Tim Clark had to lay up on three par 4s today, 17, 18 and 9.   So it was playing long.   
   
 Q.   Is it set up poorly then?   They knew the rain was coming.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   That's not really for me to say.   
   
 Q.   Talk about how the golf course did play and how the rain has affected how you could take it on?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, the ball was flying nowhere and it's playing really long.   It's picking up mud, as well.   There's a lot of other things to contend with out there today.  
   
 Q.   Obviously disappointed the way you finished, but still playing well, you must feel you have a chance in this tournament, get out there tomorrow and post a decent number?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, obviously I'd like to finish par, par or better, but red figures going into the weekend, still have a chance.
