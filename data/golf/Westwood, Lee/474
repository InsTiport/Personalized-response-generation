 Q. You must be feeling really good about things. You played pretty good. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I played pretty good all day. Didn't hit any bad shots, really. On the greens it's very difficult. Has been all week. My putting has been pathetic. Pace control on long ones is poor. 
 Started off with a 3-putt from 30 feet on the first. And had a lot of chances around the front nine. Two birdies, three birdies I made were all tap-ins. Gave me a great chance on nine to be 5-under. 
 And then just not holing the putts at 11 for par and then 3-putting 12, from five feet on 13, and 3-putting on 14 from 15 feet.
 And then the last I hit two lovely shots and they just weren't checking. They ran through the green and then I played a perfect chip which missed the green.

 Q. So it fritters away, doesn't it, if you don't get the putts in?
 LEE WESTWOOD: To be honest I got about all I deserved. There's nobody really to blame but me. I played average I think all year and I just want to get it sorted out because it's costing me tournaments. Instead of 1-under I should be in double figures.
