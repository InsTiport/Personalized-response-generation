  Q. How would you assess that round?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Anyway, level par today, that would be a good score. 72 is a little bit. I'm a little bit disappointed to make 5 at 17. The greens get tricky at the end of the day and you dribble it and take a chance or bash it and take a chance. I just bashed that one. I got a big lip out of the second one. The tee shot was playing just about right. So roundabout made a good putt on 16.   
 I'm going to another major.  
  
  Q. You said yesterday it was a struggle to get these going. Was it the same case today?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really. I was playing well, but I was 2-over to 8 and it was difficult. The wind was blowing really hard. It was difficult to get it close to the flag. Once you got it close to the flag as I did on the 5th hole, hit it to about three feet and missed it. The putts are moving about all over the place and doing strange things. It's a difficult day on the golf course.   
  
  Q. Great stretch of birdies from the 9th hole. The 16th was a real grind.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was. It's a tough hole. If you miss the fairway, you'll start to shovel down that hole and the wind comes in. And I had a shot and then the second one out of the hazard. I've been working a lot on my short game and pitching it. And it was one of the best shots I laid up.  
  
  Q. You're still well in it. Critical today. How well do you feel you're swinging the club?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm swinging it pretty well. And it's been some time now, and all I wanted to do was give myself another chance when it comes to the Open Championship. Still have a lot of confidence. I've actually got myself in for another major.
