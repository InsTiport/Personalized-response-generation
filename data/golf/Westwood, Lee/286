  Q. Considering this start then, are you pleased with this round?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it could have been a lot worse. 3-over through five holes is a poor start, and you don't want to be chasing in major championships.  
  
  Q. The English generally started on a good day.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I've just come off the golf course. I have no idea what anybody shot.   
  
  Q. Do you think it's time to have an English champion?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I have no idea. Hopefully.   
  
  Q. Does it surprise you when an amateur comes in and shoots --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, not really. The state of amateur golf now, the really good ones, they're not amateurs in the sense of when I was an amateur. They've played professional tournaments, and they've traveled the world and experienced difficult golf courses. They're just not amateurs anymore; they're semi-professional.  
  
  Q. Is it a slightly misleading term?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. I doubt any of them have got jobs.   
  
  Q. Talk about your game.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: My game was pretty good today. I hit a lot of good shots. Like I say, on the greens I didn't capitalise on it. What I thought were a few good putts they didn't go in. There were three or four that I thought I made a foot short or two foot short that turned away, and that's the difference between a 71 and a 67.  
  
  Q. Do you feel the components are there?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, the game is in pretty good shape. Just got to get off to a quickish start in the morning. Just carry on the way I've been playing and hopefully roll a few in now, go on the putting green, practise there a bit and get it right.  
  
  Q. Do you think you're going to get the better half of the draw again tomorrow?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, we've been lucky. There's a definite split there, isn't there?
