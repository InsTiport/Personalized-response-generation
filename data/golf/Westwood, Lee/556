LEE WESTWOOD:  I resumed on the 12th tee. Hit a good drive and three iron and Todd missed the green right and hit it in the bunker and I two putted for the win to go four up. Lost the 13th. Made five. At the 15th he hit in the right semi-final. I hit a seven iron to 40 feet and rolled it in.

Always, difficult in a stop/start match like that. The turning point came last night. Todd birdied the sixth and seventh -- two good birdies there -- and was 12 feet away at the eighth and I hit it to 30 feet and holed it for a 3 and he followed me in. It felt like a win rather than a half and it seemed to be the turning point because he three putted the ninth and I made a solid par and holed a couple of good ones from 20 feet at the 10th and 11th.

Good way to finish the day and it was always difficult for him to come back from there.
