Q.   It goes down as a good day's work I would imagine?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was.   Obviously I shot 3‑under and birdied three of the last four holes but played really well the first 14 holes and it was quite frustrating out there.   I missed a couple of good chances.   I had a chance to get off to a really good start, missed from four feet on the first, three‑putted the second and if I had been 2‑under after 2 I could have really built on from that. 
But it was one of those days where I had to be patient, had a lot of looks at birdie and missed them all, really, even though I hit a lot of good putts.   It was just a round where I couldn't really get going, get a lot of momentum, but I managed to do it on the 15th, hit a couple of good shots into 15 foot and then 16 made a nice birdie off a poor tee shot, and then on the last hit two nice shots, 3‑wood at 18 to about five feet.   3‑under is a really good score, I think, the first day.   The wind got up as the day went on obviously as it does every day, being so close to the sea, and it got a little bit trickier, and chasing 9‑under on the leaderboard this morning, it was always going to be difficult to go out there and look at the round realistically without looking at the board and thinking, wow, 9‑under.   Didn't seem possible in the afternoon.   But I was happy with the round and it's put me in a good position for the next few days.

Q.   When you see a score posted like that in perfect morning conditions and then obviously you've got much trickier conditions, just keeping that patience going, especially when the putts aren't dropping on the front nine, that must feel very satisfying obviously?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, well, this golf course is a course that's all about patience, playing to certain areas, not being too aggressive when you shouldn't be and being aggressive when you should.   It tests you mentally, the golf course, and I think that's why I've always done pretty well round it.   I'm fairly well disciplined out there with my game.

Q.   Form is really solid at the moment, isn't it?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm playing well.   All parts of my game are good.   When I missed greens today I got it up‑and‑down.   Like I said, I made some nice putts in the last three, four holes there, so hit the ball well tee to green, so I'm happy with the way things are going, come out tomorrow morning and hopefully make the best of the better conditions.

Q.   You've got an ideal platform now to really build?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm obviously not going to come out tomorrow morning and be too aggressive, just play the game that I've been playing, tick the holes off and try and pick up some birdies early and then build from there.
