   LEE WESTWOOD: I think I just need to ice it. It doesn't hurt when I swing, not -- I guess a little bit on the way through, but it's the walking. It doesn't really feel very nice on hills, short, sharp hills and there's a lot around here it seems. But the one up to the 7th tee finished it off for the day, although I managed to get in 1-under from there. So I'll just go and get it iced.  
  
  Q. Did the second get up in the wind a bit?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: It should have gone downwind. If it did go up in the wind, that would have been good. The wind just switched around on us a bit. It was switching around all day.   
  
  Q. The weighted shoes Fred Couples was talking about at Augusta, would you consider that? Would that help?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't think FootJoy would be too impressed with that, would they.   
  
  Q. Well, they could make some.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Nothing to do with the shoes. It's not the shoes.   
  
  Q. Happy generally?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Played all right. Slip-up, 3-putt on 17 and hit in the water on 2 but overall thought I played all right, pretty good. Shot 66, didn't get many breaks out there. Made birdies when I hit it stiff or holed from ten feet. All in all, pretty good.   
  
  Q. Is it just icing, is that all they can do?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'll go and have some treatment on it. Didn't seem to know what it was the other day.   
  
  Q. Still not sure?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I haven't been back in. I haven't had a chance I've been icing it.  
  
  Q. Has this happened before, similar?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I've had a sore Achilles --  
  
  Q. For how long?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Seven months and it's as I've been going down hills. But the swelling around my ankle is new.
