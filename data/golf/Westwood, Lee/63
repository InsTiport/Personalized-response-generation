 Q.  Give us your thoughts on a seven birdie 66, if you will?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It was good.  Hit the ball nicely.  Missed a few fairways on the back nine but drove it really well until -- just missed a couple of fairways on the back nine.  This course, I think you need to be in the fairway.   
 Q.  I was just confirming that you that you came in sixth in 197 and you said you didn't think you had been here before.  Can you remember it?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I was about to say it's a good first round considering I've only seen the course once in the Pro-Am yesterday and didn't have a practise round.  It's 21 years ago.   
 Q.  You told me last week you were surprised, having an extended break from the game, to feel as sharp as you did.  Does it feel even better this week?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's gradually coming on each week and I hit a lot of good shots today, a lot of good iron shots, gave myself a lot of chances at birdies.  I was pleased with the way today went.   
 Q.  I saw you working with Phil Kenyon on the putting green, he's coaching so many of the players.  How has he helped you?  
LEE WESTWOOD: We're just trying to work on using as little shoulders as little possible, which I'm finding difficult because I always use the shoulders a lot, they get the putter moving at weird ankles and putting spin on it.  So trying to get rid of my shoulders in the stroke.   
But greens are a bit slower and it was difficult to get the ball rolling up some of the hills.  I couldn't get it to the hole.  There was a nice one from about 15 feet on the last, straight downhill that one.  Put a good stroke on it.   
 Q.  Second Rolex Series Event of the year, 5-under par.  You must be pleased with that?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, really good.  It was a nice way to start the tournament and played very solidly, made four birdies in a row on the front nine there.  Just played well all day, really.   
 Q.  Was there a feeling last week that your play didn't show in the finishing position, if you like, but you must have taken quite a few positives from last week?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I played well last week, and just didn't get firing on the last day and moved back down the field.  You know, each week, you're getting better and I'm happy with the way the swing is feeling and the way the whole game is feeling.   
 Q.  23 wins on The European Tour and this is one you have not won.  How nice would it be to add this to the C.V., being a Rolex Series tournament, as well.  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I've won 19 different tournaments and one of them is not Italy, so it would be nice to get to 20.
