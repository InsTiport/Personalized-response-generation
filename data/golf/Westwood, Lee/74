LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's a different course obviously and it looks good.  It looks quite tight.  It's in great condition.  Great facilities here.  Weather looks great for the week, so it's a good tournament and I'm looking forward to playing.
Q. How does it compare to last year?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not sure.  I've not played it yet.
Q. In terms of appearance it looks very similar but we are told about heathland and playing a little bit differently?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm sure it does play slightly differently.  I mean, the greens look a lot different.  And like I said, I've had a look at a few holes and it looks quite tight but I would still expect scoring to be quite low.
Q. Simply the resort, nature of it?
LEE WESTWOOD: And it looks pretty good weather, not too much breeze for the week.
Q. How are you coming from China and getting acclimatised?
LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty good.  Good flight over and feeling in pretty good fettle.  Feeling healthy and not too jet-lagged.  I should be ready to go on Thursday.
Q. Was there any doubt of coming here?
LEE WESTWOOD: Not for me really, no.  I don't think the media do Turkey any favours.  I think they blow a lot of things out of proportion.  Once you get here, you see that it's fantastic.  Everybody's so friendly here and it's a fantastic resort we're playing on, and you know, everybody's relaxed and easygoing and looking forward to having a world-class golf tournament.
Q. I know with your connections with ISM, you're bound to be very much in the pro camp.  But can you see the development of golf in this area and the reason why it should be supported?
LEE WESTWOOD: I don't see as it can do any harm.  Certainly golf in the area, with regard to attracting golf tourism to the area, I think that's all got to help.
Q. And it is a lovely part of the world, as you say.  You're treated like royalty this week, aren't you?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's a fantastic hotel.  I've come for four years now.  This might be my fifth.  The first time I came here was for a match play event, which Justin Rose beat me in the final of that week, and ever since, I've had great time here.
Q. How do you look to the end of the season, the way things are going?
LEE WESTWOOD: I've got three big tournaments.  I'm finding a bit of form.  I played well at the British Masters and played okay last week with just one poor round on the Saturday.
But this is a big tournament, Dubai is, and I'm looking forward to playing the World Cup with Danny for my final event of the year.  It's an event I've played in before, and it should be a real treat to play Kingston Heath.
