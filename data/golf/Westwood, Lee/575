Lee Westwood withdrew after his second round after sustaining an injury to his left wrist on the 13th tee.  Westwood jarred his wrist, and although he completed the round, went straight to the physio unit, where his wrist was strapped and ligament damage was diagnosed.   The early diagnosis suggests that he may be out of action in the short term, and he has now flown home to England.
