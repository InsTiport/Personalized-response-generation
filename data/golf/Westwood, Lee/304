 Q. It was a tough match out there. How did you feel? Neither one of you got a lot going?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know about that. Nick shot 5-under and I shot 4-under. So that's pretty good golf. 
 I didn't putt particularly well, certainly not well enough. 16 was poor. 

 Q. So the putting was the difference today?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think we were pretty even tee to green, Nick just holed a few more putts than me. 
 But that's the way match play goes, you have to take chances.
