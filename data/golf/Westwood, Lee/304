  Q. Did you have a number in mind before you went out today?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really a number but I wanted to try to go out there to shoot the best round of the day, the afternoon. I don't know whether 67 is but it feels pretty good. Billy said to me to keep going, he said 11-under would have a chance, so that was the figure we were going for.  
  
  Q. So you would have been happy with 67 to start the day?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I would have been delighted. It's tricky out there, it's a difficult golf course because it kind of goes around the hills all the time and it's difficult to pick the wind up so it swirls a lot. Clubbing is quite hard to commit to.   
  
  Q. Watching you it's even more impressive; you left quite a few out there on the back nine that I saw, got around in 33, easily could have been 30 in some very tough conditions. Have you played much better than this as far as from tee-to-green the way you're hitting it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, I'm pleased with the way I'm striking it. I was having a chat with Billy out there and he just said, you know, you're hitting it straight, and either comes up a few short or a few feet long.   
 Like you said I'm giving myself a lot of chances and now getting a few to go in. Was tricky, the greens are firm a bit on the slow side this week because of the undulations on them. It was tough to get the ball to roll in the hole.
