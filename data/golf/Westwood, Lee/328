  Q. Lee, you gave us some drama we probably weren't expecting?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, that wasn't drama. That was rubbish. Didn't play very well on the back nine, made a couple of mistakes and made a couple of bogeys. Hopefully be here for the weekend, and two competitive rounds won't do me any arm.  
  
  Q. Just early season rust?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think so. I've not practised or hit any balls for six weeks, so you can't really expect anything else.  
  
  Q. Conditions, you don't expect these sort of conditions in the desert, do you?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, the world's weather has gone mad, hasn't it. Now getting downpours in the desert. Don't know what to make of that.  
  
  Q. So what will you do now?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Go back to the hotel room and dry off I think.
