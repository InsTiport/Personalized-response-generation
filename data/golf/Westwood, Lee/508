Q.  Your round started in the worst possible way, tell us about the tee shot off the 10th.
LEE WESTWOOD:  I hit a couple strange shots yesterday afternoon with the driver and I kept looking at it, on the 10th tee it went straight left, and I looked down and there was a big crack down the face of the driver.  Probably not best start to the day and not the way I pictured it last night.  But I managed to right the ship.  Felt sort of lethargic all day, so the balance is all over the place, which I had expected.  Just not feeling so good.
Q.  Inaudible?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Hit a few balls on the range to get used to    I think I only hit about four drives with it.
Q.  Overall one blemish, over two rounds on this course the way it's set up?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I've just been trying to get around and fight it out with the way I've been feeling.  But I suppose short game has been pretty good and I holed out well until the last hole there, the putt was going right straightaway.  You know, to be honest    inaudible    the new driver when it came out, gave myself a few chances and just didn't take all of them today.
Q.  Are you feeling any better today?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I'm feeling a bit better.  Just feeling very drained.
Q.  Fancy your chances for the weekend?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Well, hopefully.  Depends on how many people get in front.
Q.  Best part of 24 hours off, that be will good?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, it will be nice to relax and go to bed and hopefully get a good night's sleep.
Q.  You said you were not be here if it were not for the Ryder Cup?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, certainly if this were not my last Ryder Cup chance, I would be home in bed trying to get ready for next week.  So, you know, I feel like I'm playing on a bonus.
