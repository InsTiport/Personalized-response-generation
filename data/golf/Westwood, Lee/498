 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I played all right.  Played pretty good.  Disappointing to not make anything on the par 5s.  You know, that's where you score around this golf course.  I made four 5s. 
 Didn't drop any shots.  Didn't make a bogey.  I birdied a couple of hard holes, hit some good iron shots.  Hit the flag at the first with a 5-iron.  Hit it close on 11 and 12 with 6-irons.  So I need to hit it closer with the wedges and make some of the par 5s and get a low one I think. 

 Q.  Greens are pretty slick here this week, is that right? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  No, just a nice pace.  I wouldn't say they are overly fast.  Some of them are soft, some of them are firm. 

 Q.  Feel a lot stronger after having that tournament last week and coming here this week? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I was rusty last week.  It's a course I've always found difficult last week.  I feel a lot more comfortable on this one. 

 Q.  This one suit your eye? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  I've always liked playing it.  It's a lovely golf course. 

 Q.  You're an ambassador for golf in Dubai, what does that entail? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Tell everybody how good it is.  Not a lot to tell really.  It sells itself. 

 Q.  How long have you been doing that? 
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Started this year.
