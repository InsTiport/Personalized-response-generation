Q.   Got yourself in a position after ten holes, and then the back nine, you started to wobble a bit.   What was the story?
LEE WESTWOOD:   I hit too many crap shots in too short a space of time, really.   I hit it straight left off 12.   Got put off a bit there.   But my fault, really.   Then I hit a bad tee shot on 13.   Poor chip on 14, tried to get too cute.   Poor tee shot on 15 and then got it together for the last few holes.   But it's that kind of golf course.   You don't have to be far off. 

Q.   It's a course that's playing soft after the rain and we are expecting a little bit more rain tomorrow.   Is it a golf course that you feel as though you can go out and go low? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I think if you hit it straight, then there's a low score out there.   It gives you chances.   You know, I'm only 1â€‘over par, which is only seven behind Marcel and five behind second.   So   would liked to have played a bit better coming in but I'm not out of it.   I think that's the nature of the golf course; if you look at the leaderboards, that's why it's so bunched.
