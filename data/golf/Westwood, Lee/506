LEE WESTWOOD:  Double bogeyed the sixth.  Made a couple bogeys early and then came straight back with a couple birdies and bogeyed 7 and birdied 9 to turn at level par and made a push at the back nine.

Seemed like nothing was going in, and then the last four holes they did.
Q.  Four birdies in the last four; feeling better?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Feel better.  Throat feels more like it normally does and energy levels are gradually building up, and just feel a bit run down I suppose, mentally more than physically.  There's a lot going on this week.  It's bound to be draining.
Q.  Thomas said he can't keep the Ryder Cup out of his mind, how about you?
LEE WESTWOOD:  It's impossible to I think, but, you know, finishing with four birdies in the last four holes, I think is winning the tournament back on the tee, I'm going to try to block Ryder Cup out of my mind tomorrow and try to win the tournament.
Q.  You look so laid back about it; are you?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I'm laid back about everything.  If I get in, I get in.  If I don't, I don't.  There's nothing more in the world I want than to play in the Ryder Cup.  It's fantastic to represent your family, friends, country, continent and the other 11 people on the team and the captain.  Anybody that tells you that not thinking about playing in the Ryder Cup is talking out of the wrong end of their body.
