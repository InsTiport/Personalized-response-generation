  Q. Great up to the last two holes.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I played pretty good all day. A couple of poor shots with 5-irons, one on 9 and one on 16. Lost them both right. Pretty much the only couple of bad shots I hit all day but cost me bogeys. Greens got a bit chopped in the afternoon. Missed a couple of putts because of spike marks. Missed one on 10 from four feet, a massive volcano. And it was hard to get the pace. They were very slow I thought.   
 But five behind with two rounds to go, not a bad position.   
  
  Q. What's the biggest you've ever made it?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I've come back from seven shots in the last round. I was, what, ten behind with nine holes to go in the HSBC a couple of years ago and got in the playoff.   
  
  Q. Is that your genius or someone else's?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: A bit of both. Anything is possible.   
  
  Q. Have you heard about the 17th at St. Andrews, moving the tee back, 35 yards.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Oh, I heard that, yeah.   
  
  Q. Thoughts?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Why change an already great hole.
