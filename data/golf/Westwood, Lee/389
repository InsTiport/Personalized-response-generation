 Q. Give us your thoughts Lee please?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just a bit rusty really. There were a lot of variables this week. Billy (Foster) was pointing it out going round when he said, 'what a time to have to change your clubs when you are playing your best golf.' The way I've driven it today, I flushed it off the tee, I just need to do some work with my irons. I don't know if they've put the wrong shafts in or whatever, they just don't feel right and they don't feel the same.
 
 Q. Uncomfortable?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, they just don't feel like they're kicking in at the right time and certainly not when the others used to kick in and that is just too much to get used to, especially after six weeks off and not playing. It just wasn't sharp.
 
 Q. How many have you had changed?
 LEE WESTWOOD: We've had to have them all changed. The sand iron is miles out and that was really the start today. I drove it miles down the first and was going in with a sand iron. I am used to hitting my sand iron about 118/119 yards so I just took a bit off it for a 109 shot and it flew 98 yards. But you can only find that out when you start to get competitive and shake off the rust. I just need to reshaft them all or something - I'll get another couple of sets made up. I know Ping have been struggling as much as the other manufacturers to actually understand the rules and get the clubs out on time for the new season.
 
 Q. Is this a reality check for you that the game is actually not as easy as you made it seem towards the end of last year or are you able just to shrug this off?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It is not at all a reality check. In fact that is a stupid question because I know as well as anybody what the game of golf can do to you. I would almost take offence to you asking me that.
 
 Q. Will you get some new clubs flown out for Qatar next week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes I will probably get a new set sent out and reshaft this lot over the weekend to see if that does any good. I just don't know if they haven't been tipped properly.
 
 Q. You weren't happy with your round yesterday, were you?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yesterday was just a really good 69, it could easily have been 77 the way I played. I got away with murder yesterday and today I didn't.
 
 Q. What was it you said about your clubs not being tipped?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes they normally tip my irons by cutting off that end instead of the other end so it stiffens them up in the tip because they feel all over the place when I'm coming into the ball at the moment. They feel like fishing rods. I don't think it's much to do with the grooves - I just haven't had a chance to go out there and do any testing because I've been so busy.
