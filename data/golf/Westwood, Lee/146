 Q.  Quite an atmosphere down here, you're sent out first to get the momentum as you were yesterday and you've done it again.  Describe the sense of satisfaction.  LEE WESTWOOD: Well, a huge amount of satisfaction.  There's no easy games out here and it's tough to win a point at The Ryder Cup. Jamie played great again today.  We played good all day but we were solid and I think we made one bogey, which is pretty good golf in foursomes.   Q.  5-under par for 17 holes, pretty good golf.  How much pressure are you feeling over that chip at 17, because you know if you don't get it up-and-down going up the last, anything can happen.  JAMIE DONALDSON: Wasn't too bad.  I mean, the ball was plugged in the bank and the lie wasn't too bad.  ^  But knowing that your partner just holes out like a rock, you can just -- the pressure's off, really, because you're really buzzing off each other I suppose.  We played great foursomes golf yesterday and today.  Yeah, it was a tough shot, but it landed well and ran out nicely.   Q.  You've got nothing to prove in Ryder Cup but is there a sense of satisfaction, again, in that the captain picked you as a wild card and you proved it, a justified pick?  LEE WESTWOOD: It's all about the team really and trying to win as many points as we can.  I'm not trying to justify anything.  We're playing for each other and playing for the captain and playing for Europe.  Not out there trying to justify anything.   Q.  Having said that, this is your 23rd point and beaten Seve's total of 22, congratulations on that.  LEE WESTWOOD: Thanks.
