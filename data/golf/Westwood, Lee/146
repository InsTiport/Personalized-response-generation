Q.   How did you strike the ball today?
LEE WESTWOOD:   I hit it pretty good.   Started off not so good but got better as the day went on.   It's very difficult when the conditions are as tough as they are today to really give a fair assessment of the way you're hitting it.

Q.   What do you make of this championship golf course, obviously the renovations in 2010; do you prefer it this way, really tough? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I suppose for a championship like this, I prefer it this way.   You know, if I were a member here at Wentworth, then I would prefer the other golf course.   I thought that was a little bit gentle to play.   This really taxes you. 

Q.   Just spoke to Billy, he said there were a couple of 3‑putts in the last five holes.   So you left a couple out there. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I 3‑putted 14, the par3, and 16.   Just a couple of times I was going up and over ridges and struggled to get the pace.   But it was nice to make a nice one from about six feet on the last to finish on 2‑under.

Q.   A bit of a weary round for everybody.   Looking forward to tomorrow? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Looking forward to tonight and getting a good night's sleep.   Finished very late last night and started very early this morning, so yeah, recharge the batteries and come out all guns blazing tomorrow.
