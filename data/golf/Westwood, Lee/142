 Q.   Just overall thoughts about your round today?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just got off to a slow start, you know, 3â€‘over through five.   You know, not the best start.  
And then battled back, you know, a lot of good shots.   I struggled with the speed of the greens more than anything, gave myself a lot of birdie chances.   Didn't make that many.   
Made a nice eagle at 5, got me back to level par, so not too much damage done.  
   
 Q.   And then just some impressions of the golf course so far?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Pretty similar to when we played in April.   It's in good condition again and still a good test.
