 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Played nicely. Same as yesterday really. Hit the ball well. Didn't really make any putts again. But putted well. Greens are firm, tough to figure out. They are unique. 

 Q. Frustrating? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Are they frustrating? I was mildly frustrated out there, yes. But it's one of them things. Golf is a frustrating sport.

 Q. And it's a four-round sport. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: 4-under today gave me a chance, doesn't it. Six behind one and three behind second. I have a funny feeling a lot can happen on this golf course. 

 Q. It looks like you'll need a top-five finish to stay ahead of Martin Kaymer in the World Rankings. What are your thoughts on that? Luke Donald could also overtake you with a good showing in New Orleans. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: All positives then, eh? Got to finish Top-5 and Luke can get past me. Oh, my, God. I might not eat my tea.
