 Q.   When you birdied 17 to get within three of the lead, I guess you had to go at the last?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I thought I needed eagle at least.   On 15 I hit the wrong club and was short on 16.   18, I felt like I had to go for it, commit to finish the fourth.  
   
 Q.   Overall, positive with the first competitive outing of the year?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Overall sort of summary of it is game is in great shape.   Short game, couple of nice saves out of traps, made some nice putts.   So yeah, really pleased with my game.  
   
 Q.   You'll play the next five weeks in America, next week with your dad at AT&T?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Really looking forward; been awhile since I've played AT&T and awhile since I've played with my dad, so knock two off in one go.   And then L.A. for Northern Trust at Riviera, one of my favorite courses, Match Play is great, home game at Honda and another World Golf Championships at Doral so some big tournaments, good ones to be playing well coming into.   
   
 Q.   Your verdict on the week?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Played lovely.   Made a lot of birdies, there's not really a weakness in the game at the moment, so, yeah, looking forward to next week.  
   
 Q.   Had to go for it at the last?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I think so.   You know, I felt like I had a good yardage, tried to cut a 3â€‘wood in there and didn't quite flush it how I would like and it came up three yards short.  
   
 Q.   Given first week, nothing but positives?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, all positives, not a negative in there, my game is in good shape.
