 Q.   A grinding day today?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, there weren't any easy flags.   I played nicely, just didn't make enough of the par‑5s, even par is not good enough on the par‑5s.  
   
 Q.   Are they tougher pins than they normally are on a Thursday?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah.   I was surprised about some of the them.   They were tucked away.   
   
 Q.   How were the conditions?   Wind got up a bit in the afternoon?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, you know it's going to play as hard all day, being last out.   And you're going to get the worst of the greens and probably the wind is going to pick up.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the two birdies, if you wouldn't mind?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   A hit it about eight feet on 6.   And about five feet on 10.  
   
 Q.   Talk about 13.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   13, I mean it was a tough shot.   And I was caught between rescue and 3‑iron.   I decided on the 3‑iron and just lost my footing a little bit on the severe lie.   Pulled it and it came down, but I got away with it and managed to make five.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was one of those I thought I could even get it close.   Just even par is not good enough on the par‑5s.
