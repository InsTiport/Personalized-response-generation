 Q. Nearly got back at them. It was a good fight back. 
 SCOTT JAMIESON: Yeah, yeah, fought back quite nicely but unfortunately they won too many holes on us.

 Q. The nature of match-play, where it ebbs and flows out there. 
 ROSS FISHER: Sure does, yeah. Obviously I could speak for both of us, disappointed. We played really good yesterday and we were really up for today. Knew it was going to be a tough game but you want to get off to a good start and we just didn't really do that. 
 We both hit a few too many loose shots and kind of gave them a few too many holes. We just set at the turn, let's mix it up. So we switched our order around and just tried everything we could. We started to spring a few birdies together, and Scott made a couple of birdies, I chipped in and it was nice to get him down the last. But just unfortunately left ourselves too much to do. 

 Q. Looking at the board now, it's game on, isn't it. 
 ROSS FISHER: Yeah, it would have been game on even if we would have done the same as yesterday. There's a lot of golf to play for, like Paul kept saying, there's ten points available Thursday, Friday and 18 on the weekend, so pace yourself. 
 We got off to a flying start yesterday, and hopefully we can make that last game, two-point lead going into the weekend, that would be huge. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's nice when the more established players play well, it takes the pressure off the rookies. That's why you pair them together. 

 Q. There's been plenty of doubt expressed about this field. Do you feel it still has relevance? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't think there's much doubt about the field. Obviously some people have priorities in the FedExCup. Obviously it's a massive thing; if you can get to the second FedExCup event; you should go and play it. 
 But there's not many people that aren't there that haven't taken the opportunity to come and play here. Poults is playing here. I'm not a member, and I'm playing here and Darren is obviously playing. I think it's a pretty good field. 
 It's going to be probably would say at least eight out of the 12 Ryder Cup players next time around will be playing this week. So pretty strong field. 

 Q. Which of those that haven't played Ryder Cup that are here this week do you really fancy next time around, people like Simon Dyson? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, instantly going to put pressure on him. Thomas didn't play last time but he would be a valuable member having played in Ryder Cups and seeing what the team room is like and things like that. Dys -- trying to think who else is playing. 

 Q. Manassero?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Maybe a bit too young. 

 Q. Probably Donaldson if he got a win behind him. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. Molinari is very solid. Played solid today. Wouldn't surprise me if Anders Hansen qualified. What's a nice way of putting it -- he's very ballsy. He's a hard man to shake up. 
 Anybody up there is capable. Peter has obviously played. RaphaÃ«l Jacquelin is very consistent. Alex Noren, I've played with him a couple of times; he's won twice this year. You've got three people up there that haven't played in the last Ryder Cup that have won twice this year. 
 And Thomas won three times. You do that in the qualifying, and then you're in the team, win two or three tournaments. 

 Q. And Mark, as a Worksop man, good for him to get off the mark?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was nice for Mark. I played well today and Mark came in around that back nine and it was nice for him. You could see him physically relaxing and play the game he's capable of after he had rolled the one in on 4 and then birdied 3 and then birdied 5. 
 Sometimes it's difficult; you feel like you go out there having to do more than you actually do have to do. You set your expectations too high, you go out there thinking, I've got to birdie every hole, which you don't have to do. 
 You know, it would be more experience and better for this when he plays the next couple of days.
