LEE WESTWOOD: Itâs obviously a frustrating day having to keep coming off, but thereâs nothing you can do about the weather. Iâm playing well though, playing nicely. Iâve dropped shots when Iâve missed it in the wrong spots and made some nice birdies too. The eagle on 14 was obviously a nice shot. The course is playing nicely and the greens are fast, even with all the rain. I donât know how it is going to hold up after this rain though, as it is a bit different to what weâve had.
Q. (No microphone)?
LEE WESTWOOD: The eagle of 14 was a four iron and the a wedge from 128yards which landed right of the hole and screwed sideways in, which was nice.
Q. (No microphone)?
LEE WESTWOOD: The game is solid. Iâve been playing well now for a couple of months, so it is good to build on that. Experience obviously comes into play a lot at Majors and US Open but it does so even more on days like this.
