LEE WESTWOOD:  I think the course is quite good.  I don't think there is enough penalties for missing fairways.  The greens are good and the traps are good; so, should be all right.


Q.  Exciting day?

LEE WESTWOOD:  I think there is advantage if you hit it 295 yards off the tee.  You don't particularly need to hit it straight.  You just need to hit the ball a long way, then there's a huge advantage.  For me, the par 5s, a couple of them, probably driver, driver.  They will play into a couple people's hands this week.  Not mentioning any names.


Q.  Do you feel in some ways this is the culmination of a lot of hard work for you?  The idea two years ago was to get into the top 64.  Obviously, you've more than done that.

LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, every time I play in a big tournament, you know, it is a milestone.  That is what I have been working for.  I suppose it is a milestone, yeah.  Nice reward for playing well over the last few years, to be able to play in an event like this.  They are always run so well.  It is nice to be here you are always looked after, so --


Q.  Have you looked at your draw?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Not really.


Q.  Are you taking it one match at a time?

LEE WESTWOOD:  No.  I haven't looked past Eduardo Romero.  I know he is a good player and he is quite capable of shooting 63.  If I go up against him on a day like that I have to shoot 62; so, every match is going to be difficult and you just have to pray that when you have your bad round, the other guy has his, and that you don't hit somebody on a good round when they shoot a low number.


Q.  Confidence pretty good after the fine finish in Dubai?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, confidence is great.  I have gotten to my stride quicker this year than in previous years; so, we will have to see.


Q.  Huge amounts of money.  Does that play in your mind?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Just the title.  The money is --


Q.  If you hadn't? 

LEE WESTWOOD:  It is not what I am here for.  It is always handy.


Q.  Can you give a few thoughts on the Tiger/Faldo game?

LEE WESTWOOD:  I think Tiger is obviously the favorite. The course plays into his hands.  Nick's obviously having not been playing great just lately, but -- you know, this tournament lends itself to having one good day and if he has his good day and Tiger doesn't have such a good day, you know, Tiger is quite capable of shooting 72 and Nick is quite capable of shooting 71 or 70, easily, even as bad as he could hit it.  Match Play lends itself to that sort of setup.  He has got a chance to beat him.  I think more of a chance of getting one of the non-favorites winning this week than you would in a stroke-play event.


Q.  Do you think Europeans and, really, international players have a slight advantage this week because they have more experience with Match Play having grown up playing a lot more than Americans?

LEE WESTWOOD:  No, not at all.


Q.  Did you actually enjoy Match Play at the International level as an amateur?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, Match Play is great.  I don't think we play enough of it.  I'd like to see -- I think if you had more events, it might devalue this one, but I think this is a great addition.  I think it is going to be a very exciting week.  Great for the sponsors.  Would be nice to be sitting home, you would have so many bets going, it would be frightening.


Q.  Do you think somebody who grew up around here would have any advantage at all against somebody who didn't?

LEE WESTWOOD:  I don't think so because there is no secrets to the golf course.  It is right in front of you.  It is wide open.  Other than getting the hang of the greens, which you can do after a couple of days, there is no tricks to it.  In that respect it is a good golf course with its format.  But I would have like to seen it a little bit tighter.


Q.  Might a win this week be more satisfying than most other tournaments because of what you would have had to have gone through?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, and the quality of the field, you know, you know that there is the best players in the world here. You know you are going to have to play -- probably going to have to play great every day.  You can't afford a level par round.  So, it will be a great tournament to have on your C.V..  You'd also be  the World Match Play Champion, won't you?


Q.  How is your cold?

LEE WESTWOOD:  No, I am fine.  We don't get colds if you take Centrum.


Q.  We will remind you of that.  Where is the patch?

LEE WESTWOOD:  Here.
