 Q. How do you feel with your position right now?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm delighted. I played really well out there. All aspects of my game were solid. Made one bogey which is always pretty good around this golf course and felt really comfortable.

 Q. Tell me how it feels, I know you're in first play, Tiger is in third, we always focus on Tiger, what's it like having the world's No. 1 behind you?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I have my thoughts about my own game and how I'm going to get around the golf course tomorrow, which is hopefully as similar as I've done it today. 
 Before you said that I didn't even know Tiger was in third. 

 Q. What's it like being in the Masters lead with one round to go? Exciting, nerve wracking, a little bit of both?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Certainly not nerve wracking. I'm amazed how calm and collected I was out there. I know it's a position I wanted to be in. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
