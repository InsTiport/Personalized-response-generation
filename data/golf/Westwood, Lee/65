Q. Do you like playing in that type of playoff format after doing the match play the last three days?
LEE WESTWOOD: The chances that you make birdie, you are probably going to go through.  It's match play really.
Q. What about playing in conditions like this, the rain, the no rain, going back and forth?  How difficult is that for you?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, the course has definitely played easier this morning.  It's easy to control the ball on the greens and get it close.  It was very scorable this morning.  I think I was 6-under or something like that.  Pat played good as well, so we had a good match.
