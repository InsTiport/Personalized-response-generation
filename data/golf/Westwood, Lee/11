Q. You've got to feel pretty good about your position.
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean, only two behind, and I don't feel like two shots is a lot around this golf course. I didn't have my "A" game today. I didn't play as well as I did the first two days, but I only hit two greens on the front nine, and short game and putting really held me together. I played a lot better around the back nine, hit a lot more good shots. Could have shot a few under par.
Yeah, so looking forward to tomorrow. This is a golf course that's obviously exciting to watch, and especially the finish, and it's exciting to play, as well. It's a risk-reward golf course on steroids, I guess. There's nowhere quite like it.
Q. A lot of guys from England, Donald and Fleetwood is in the lead. Is there any rhyme or reason to that? Does it make it any more enjoyable?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not sure there's any rhyme or reason. We've all got one common goal, and that's to win the tournament. But I think no surprise to see Tommy up there. He's a quality player, high in the World Rankings, hits the ball great, and that's what you need to do around this golf course.
Q. You've already had some success this season. How are you drawing on that going into tomorrow?
LEE WESTWOOD: I mean, it's always nice when you've had a win recently, you can feed off that and feed off the emotions that you handled during those times. I know I played well that final day and the weekend in Abu Dhabi, shot 65-67, so those memories are fresh in my mind, and hopefully I can pull them out and do it again tomorrow.
Q. What's the mindset heading into a round like tomorrow?
LEE WESTWOOD: Difficult to know around this golf course. I know you can't see anybody going out and shooting a really, really low one. It's kind of a grinding golf course. You've just got to hang around, not make too many mistakes and see if it's your day at the end of the day, really.
Q. If somebody had said to you 10 years ago that you would have two PGA TOUR wins, would you have been surprised by that?
LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. 44 career wins, I would have been surprised at that, yeah. Do you think I should have more or --
Q. No, I'm just asking.
LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know whether you think it's too many or not enough.
Q. Is there a difference in winning over here versus winning elsewhere?
LEE WESTWOOD: Not really. It shouldn't be. It's still 18 holes on grass and a 72-hole tournament. The strength of the fields are strong all over the world now, so no, it shouldn't be any different.
Q. After Abu Dhabi you talked about wanting to get back inside the world top 50. I think you're ranked at 30 currently. How much positivity does that give you going into a Ryder Cup year?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not even thinking about the Ryder Cup. I'm just enjoying each week and it comes and enjoying playing well. I've had spells in my crier where I've not played very well and pretty miserable, and you've got to enjoy it when the ball is going where you want and putts are going in.
