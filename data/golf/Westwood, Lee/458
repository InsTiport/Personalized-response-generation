   LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I got as much out as I possibly could have done, really, again. Played pretty good. Didn't really hole anything of any note. A couple of cracks shots at 5, a driver and a 3-iron to ten foot but missed chances at the first from six, seven feet, 3-putted the third, the 17th. Marvellous 17th, in the water again. So that was the most disappointing thing of the day to make a bogey because I didn't make a bogey all day.  
  
  Q. You were going nicely forward at that point, weren't you.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I was 6-under at that point and probably should have been nine or ten at that stage.
