 Q. Your day overall? You turned a 6 into a 3 at the last. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Seriously, I did turn a 6 into a 3 at the last. I pulled it down the left, it landed on the wall, shot out to the fairway, I had 154 flag, hit it to four feet and holed it for birdie.
 It was a frustrating day. I played quite nicely. There was a couple nice ones at the start of the day, but then I just didn't get anything on line for the rest of the round, so it just turned into frustration.

 Q. Overall the 71 then --
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's by no means out of it, is it. I think the course is soft, and that's probably when it's at its hardest, I guess, in terms of layout, and it made for tough scoring conditions, I guess.

 Q. In Akron you were flawless, it was just the putting?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I wasn't flawless today, but it was pretty good. Yeah, I'm giving myself lots of chances, so I think I've just got to be patient.
