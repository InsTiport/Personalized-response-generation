  Q. Disappointing to lose, pretty good battle out there?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I played lovely. There were about four or five turning points during the game. That's the unfortunate thing about match play; sometimes it doesn't reflect the two players playing.   
 Didn't make any putts; Ian did, and he had a couple more breaks than me.  
  
  Q. You say you didn't make any putts, you still made a hell of a lot of birdies out there, didn't you?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, but the birdies were a 2-putt on 3, a 2-putt on 4, 2-putt on 8, stiffed it to a foot on 9, 2-putt from ten feet on 11. Pitched to a foot, two foot on 14, and holed a putt from 2 1/2 foot on 18.   
 Longest putt I holed was from about six feet on 15. That's why I said I didn't hole anything.   
  
  Q. In match play, Ian just kind of grinds the putts, doesn't he.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, you know, when you play Ian, you just accept that that's his game. You know he's not going to hit it great, but he's going to make a lot of putts and get up-and-down from everywhere, which was typical Ian today. He just had a few breaks, as well.   
 He pulled it on 17 and rolls off the bank and around to two foot. Stayed out of the hazard on 11 and pitched it on the other side of the green and holed it from off the green for a halve.   
 You know, that's the frustrating thing about match play, and especially 18 on match play. Sometimes it's not reflective of how the players are playing.  
  
  Q. Was that the turning point or the key hole, almost a miracle one for him, wasn't it?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, the one on 11, I didn't think he would be able to play it. But the one on 15, I didn't think he would be able to play it either, and he got it on to the green and made me hole from six foot.   
 He didn't hit a great shot at 17, wasn't aiming on the left fringe on 17 and comes down to two foot. You have those days where you play in match play, and that's the unfortunate thing like I say, it's not always reflective.  
  
  Q. Overall the game?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: My game is in great shape. I played lovely today. I made two bogeys on the par 3s, but around in 67, something like that. So 19-under par 45 holes and going home. That's how match play is.
