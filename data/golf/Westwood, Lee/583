 Q. You didn't deserve what you got on the 17th did you?

LEE WESTWOOD: Can I do the interview? I'm going to ask you a question. Can you give me anything to be optimistic about after that. Every time I hit a bad shot I get completely ******. I'm getting pissed off with it now. What am I supposed to do? I practice hard Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I don't play great, hit quite a lot of fairways, hit a few bad shots, make the odd good save like I did from the back of the 14th, then hit a average drive off 17, pushed it a little bit right, pitches in the face of the trap and when I get up there I can see about three dimples of the golf ball. What can you do?
