   LEE WESTWOOD: Felt like a decent score, 68. Not easy out there. Easier than the first couple of days certainly but they were brutal.   
 Yeah, it was nice. There probably was a little more wind but you'd still like to play well and shoot a good score.   
 Quick start, 4-under through seven and could have been 5-under quite easily. A poor bogey at 9, and then a very good sand iron. I had lots of chances on the back nine. Put it in the trap at 15, but birdied 14 and 18. So all in all no complaints.  
  
  Q. Were you well rested?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I got quite a lot of rest. I played Korea, and so that was a long way to go for just one week, but I'll be pleased to see some decent weather. I really haven't played in any decent weather for a month. Four-layer tournaments.   
  
  Q. Looking forward to this part of the schedule, looking ahead?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I was going to play three in a row here, not sure what I'm going to do after that, two weeks before the U.S. Open, because Austria has been moved, and so obviously the U.S. Open and then back to decent weather in Europe, French Open and Loch Lomond.
