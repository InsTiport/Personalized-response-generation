  Q.  Lee, you birdied three of the first four holes, got 3-up.  Do you feel in control of a match like that?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  No, I didn't really feel in control of that one because Brandt was playing well, as well.  He birdied the 3rd, and he just kept hitting it close.  He's a good player, and I knew that going out even though I never played with him before.  He really didn't make too many mistakes, so I needed to make the seven birdies that I did to beat him.   
  
  Q.  We're seeing some incredible scoring out there.  Is that the format or the golf course?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Both, really.  The format obviously lends itself to aggressive golf.  The golf course is in good shape, greens are very good.  You start it on-line, you make it.  It does give you a lot of chances out there.  There's some par-5s that you can reach and there's a lot of wedges into greens, so I'd say it's a bit of both.   
  
  Q.  How different is your mindset in match play as opposed to stroke play, if you were to play this course in a 72-hole stroke play?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  You'd play a little less aggressively.  There's a few roll-offs on several holes where you just don't want to be on the wrong side of it, depending on how you stand in the game.  Obviously I was 3-up with three to play and could fire away from the flag on 16.  But that's one case where you really don't want to miss it left because there's trouble down there.  It's a slightly different approach to it.   
  
  Q.  Fancy your chances the rest of this week?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Well, I'm confident, but you can never really fancy your chances in this format.  I was just saying to somebody else, this is the kind of week where you kind of unpack but you don't move stuff too far away from your suitcase.
