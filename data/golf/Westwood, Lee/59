 Q.  2-under par 70.  Talk us through it?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I had a good opportunity out there to shoot a bit lower but you know, it's not easy, this golf course.  I don't think you can ever be too disappointed with 70.   
 Q.  How have you managed the greens this week?  A lot of players have problems reading the putts?  
LEE WESTWOOD: They are a great surface but they are tricky.  It is difficult to read them sometimes.  The subtleties you just can't pick up and are quite puzzling but you can't complain with the surface.  If you pick the right line, a good putt goes in.   
 Q.  Currently 7 off the lead, what type of score do you think you'll need tomorrow to contend?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, a low one, you would think, but I'm not really going out to focus on that.  I'm going out to sort of manage my game well and keep playing how I'm playing and keep hitting it close and keep holing a few putts and if it's good enough, it's good enough.   
 Q.  Reaction to the football and were you aware of the score?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, they told us after 13, on the 14th tee and they told us on the 17th tee we were 2-0, people in the crowd.   
 Q.  Overall, how do you assess how England have done and chances going forward?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, they seem to be a unit and a team for this World Cup, or big championship, which seems to be different to how we've been in the past.  Seem to have been trying to fit players in because individually they were great players but this one, we seem to pick the players to suit the team.
