Q. Talk about your round.
LEE WESTWOOD: Delighted, yes, good round of golf and I played well.  I hit the ball really well.  Hit it close a few times.  Putted nicely, as well.  So I'm very pleased with the round.
Q. Talk about the weather conditions affecting the course.
LEE WESTWOOD: It's firming up pretty quickly.  I think this golf course does that.  The greens certainly firm up fast.  The fairways are starting to run out.  So I think if this golf course did dry out, it would become extremely tough.
Q. Do you think this course is wide for a U.S. Open?
LEE WESTWOOD: I don't think it's easy.  I think there's a lot more room than there normally is at the U.S. Open off the tee.  And if you give the best golfers in the world this much room then you've got to expect good scores, especially with the greens having a lot of rain on them last night.
The players out here now aren't intimidated by long golf courses, they're intimidated by tight golf courses.  You expect there to be good scores this morning.
Q. Rory in his press conference the other day said that they were actually shaving a couple down.  What are your thoughts on that?
LEE WESTWOOD: I think they've got it right.  I think if this golf course hadn't got the rain, it would be brutally tough.
Q. Are you happy with where you are?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean if I keep going like this, I should be right there on Sunday to give myself a chance.
