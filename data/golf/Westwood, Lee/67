 Q.  Thoughts on that 4-under, 67?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Played well.  Played really solidly.  Hit off the tee well.  One of the keys to this golf course, because the greens are quite firm, is hitting fairways so you can attack some of these pins.  I did that and putted nicely, as well.   
My whole game was sharp.  Bit of a slip-up on 12, the par 5.  If I was being critical, I didn't play the par 5s well enough.  Was only even par on them.  If you don't score well on the scoring holes and you shoot 4-under, I think you've got to be pleased.   
 Q.  You've played well at this tournament in the past.  What is it about this golf course or this area that seems to bring out your best?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It's a really strong golf course.  I think you have to hit the ball well.  If you do, it gives you good scoring opportunities.   
If you start missing fairways and missing greens, it becomes tough quickly.  There's a lot of overhanging trees and some good run-offs and the greens are going to get faster as the week goes on.  I think water comes into play on a lot of the holes, so I think you have to be hitting the ball well.   
 Q.  Given The Race to Dubai points and what's at stake over the next three weeks, do you find yourself changing your game plan at all being a little bit more aggressive perhaps?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Not really, no.  My game is generally aggressive, anyway.  I tend to take shots on that maybe I shouldn't.  You know, Billy's job, really, my caddie's job, to put the reins on and hold me back now and again and get me to play conservative.  I don't really look too much at points lists or anything like that.  I'm just playing each shot on its merits.
