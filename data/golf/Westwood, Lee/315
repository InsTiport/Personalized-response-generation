  Q. Lee, you were scrambling out there. You bogey the first hole, battled all the way. 4-under for the tournament.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I struggled to get it going. I played poorly on the front-9, almost -- I don't know what it was, couple of 3-putts early on, struggled with the greens and just couldn't get it going, and then shot 3-under on the back-9, which salvaged the day.  
  
  Q. I was impressed with your patience when maybe you weren't striking it the way you wanted to, you stayed in the moment and you pulled out a decent round.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. Sometimes it's not as you like. You got to get a round as low a score as possible. You get that with experience. I used that today.  
  
  Q. Lot of stuff to build off of these first two rounds.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I played alright. I hit some decent shots around the back-9. Good drives. Keep working on the same things. Trying to feel a little bit more comfortable on the greens with the pace these are. These are as quick as we've seen all year. Going to be like that next week. Just a case of getting comfortable.  
  
  Q. Maybe it was that Anthony just sucked up all the birdies on the golf course playing with you.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: He played well. I played with him last year. Maybe it's an omen for him. He scored well.  
  
  Q. Looking forward to seeing you play this weekend.  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Thank you.
