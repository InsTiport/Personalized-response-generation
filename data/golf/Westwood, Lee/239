Q.   Talk about the match. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   It was a pretty good match.   I came out pretty strong.   I got 3‑up early, but then Rory‑‑ 11 was big.   Rory advanced, he made a couple of birdies to go 2‑up.   And then made an eagle at 15.   It was a good game.

Q.   Lee, clearly not the result you were hoping for, but some consolation that you came up against some inspired golf?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I mean, Rory played well.   I think we both played well.   It was just one of those typical match play games.   I got off to a nice start, got 3‑up early.   I had a bad break on 5, with the second shot on the flier.   But then Rory holed a couple of nice putts on top of me.
Going down 11, I thought, was a big turning point when Rory hit his second shot down the right, bounced a couple of times on the cart path and could have gone out of bounds in a bush.   It ends up perfect, and I have to hole from 12 feet for half.   That sort of thing can change a match. 
We're back to level then.   It's a different kettle of fish.   And then Rory made a good putt on the next and birdied the one after it to go 3‑up.   So it was going to be hard work after that. 

Q.   What were the main positives that you take from this week?
LEE WESTWOOD:   I'm playing great.   Keep playing well.   Shot 4‑under today or something like that.   It's all solid stuff.   Every part of my game is pretty good.

Q.   With this sort of form to build on for the Masters, which is your main objective, these major championships, how encouraged are you by that and how excited by the possibilities?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, very much so.   I've shot 4‑ or 5‑under par every day this week.   That's pretty good golf.   And you can't let a game of match play with all its fickleness get in the way of when you're playing well and build up your confidence and try and carry that forward.
