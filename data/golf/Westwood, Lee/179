Q.   So even par lately? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, for many different reasons lately.   I don't feel very good today.

Q.   Is it your health? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, just under the weather.

Q.   Still even with an even par, you still find yourself well within striking distance for Sunday. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, looks like it.   I'm going to have a chance tomorrow, so I'm pleased about that.   Hopefully my body can cure itself a bit and my stomach can calm down, and we'll see what happens.

Q.   (Indiscernible)? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, they gave me antibiotics which it's clearing up a bit, but antibiotics have an affect somewhere else occasionally, don't they? 

Q.   With the field kind of bunching up and the lead given back a shot from yesterday, does it tell you anything about the golf course, the conditions? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it's tough to run away on this golf course.   I think the greens are dictating that with a pretty good bunch.   Nobody's going to get streaky and shoot a 62 I don't think.   It will be a case of playing solid tomorrow and giving yourself chances and taking opportunities when you can with it.

Q.   What about going off early and trying to beat the weather as well? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I don't think we want to play these greens when they're really wet.   There are some out there with more mud than grass on them.   So if they have more rain on them, that could be hard on a couple of greens.
