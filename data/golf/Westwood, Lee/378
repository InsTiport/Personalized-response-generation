  Q. Lee, I know it was a rough day, felt like you were right in it until about the 15th hole.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean, it wasn't that rough a day, really. It was quite enjoyable out there. We both struggled off the tee early on, I think, but you know, Phil being the champion he is hit some great shots coming down the stretch there; his 9-iron into 13, and his second shot into 13 was incredible, and then just played solid coming in.   
 You know, he's been through hard times recently and he deserves a break or two.  
  
  Q. You have come so close in major championships recently. What do you think is missing? Is there an ingredient, something maybe you feel like this is what I need to do to get over that hump because you're awfully close?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think I just need to keep doing what I'm doing. One of these days the door is going to open for me. I keep knocking, finished third, third, second the last three majors.  
  
  Q. You went through a slump during your career. Was there a time when you thought you might not even -- was there doubt that you might not even get back and get this kind of opportunity again?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, there was a time where I didn't want to go out and play, didn't want to go out and practice, couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, so I've been through that bad patch. I can appreciate what it's like to play well better than most people. So when I'm playing like this and I am contending for major championships, I feel like a lucky man sometimes.  
  
  Q. When you look back on this, will it be a disappointment because you weren't able to get over the hump, or will you consider it a success because you were able to contend once again?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think whenever you come as close as I've come today, there's a tinge of disappointment there, but that doesn't last too long. Phil was saying in there, he's been there, kept finishing second and third, he was saying that in the cabin there, and it's just a case of persevering, and one of these days I'll get the breaks and I'll become a major champion hopefully.
