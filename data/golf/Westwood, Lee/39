Q. Four years since your last victory on The European Tour.  Can you explain how you're feeling after that final round 64?
LEE WESTWOOD: Not really.  Pretty emotional.  A little bit relieved.  Still got it, I guess.  Just nice to do it again under pressure and win against a couple of quality players at the end there, Sergio and Louis were my two nearest challengers.  To hit the shots I hit down the stretch, it was just nice to prove it to yourself every now and again.
Q. You started with an eagle early on, and nice to wipe a couple shots off the lead.
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's not such an easy golf course when the wind is in the direction it was and it was swirling as the day went on.  I made a nice par on 1, and a great 3-wood on 2 to about three feet.  Then made a lovely par at 3 and then just steadied off and gave myself birdie chances pretty much all the way around.  It was essential to get off to a quick start and put a bit of pressure on Sergio.
Q. Talk about the tee shot on 17.
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit great shots all the way in.  I came off it a little bit off the 17th tee and slid it out to the right.  But it gave me a good number in with a 7-iron, and the wind managed to stay in the right direction for long enough.  Just turned it in off the TV tower to ten feet and rolled the putt in.  I can't wait to watch the highlights to be honest because I hit so many good shots coming in.
Q. You've had your partner Helen on the bag this week.  How special being able to share it with her?
LEE WESTWOOD: It's been brilliant.  She's caddied twice for me this year and we lost in a playoff in Denmark and we've won here.  Have to have a bit of a rethink, not least about who caddies for me, but our percentages.
Q. You're the latest winner of one of the big Rolex Series Events.  Having been on Tour such a long time, you must have been delighted with the initiative when Rolex came on board.
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, they are incredible for the Tour and a great sponsor.
You know, really sickened me that I kept getting off the first tee and everybody had gold bibs and I didn't have one.  I was thinking, it's time you won one of these things.  You need a gold bib on your caddie.
Yeah, it's nice to win one, and they are great sponsors and you know, obviously they put a lot of money into the Tour and without people like Rolex, the players wouldn't have the vast fortunes to play for that they do.
