  Q. Started the day four shots behind, when you double-bogeyed the fourth, it wasn't going to plan but 5-under from there in, how pleased with your day's work?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, really pleased.  I just really played the same as I played the first couple of days, just solid stuff.  I've not really made loads of putts but I've putted well, I've driven the ball great.  Just a bit of a hiccup on that fourth.  Just keep calm, regroup and plod along from there.
 Q. You withdrew from last week with a lower back issue and you were limited with your preparation, are you back to a hundred per cent?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   I'm not quite a hundred percent.  Kind of niggling a little in my lower back.  It's mainly when I'm walking on the loose soil in chip-ins when I slip, because when it flexes, it's sort of tiring out quickly.  So I get around 14, 15, I start to feel it.
 No complaints or excuses.  I'm swinging it as good as I've swung it all year and I've hit it further than I have all year.
 Q. You've played around here with the Ryder Cup and the championship on the line.  Is it different?  What does it feel like?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I think it is very different because you have little things creeping into your mind all the time which drag you away from your process and what you really should be focusing on.  So, you know, it's a distraction if you let it be.
