 Q.  4-under first up 2017, how does that sound to you?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty good.  Played nicely.  Everything was pretty sharp, really, which is quite surprising for me.  I haven't done much in the last six, seven weeks since the DP World championship.  I haven't really hit that many balls.  Played a couple of rounds.  But yeah, it was pretty good.   
 Q.  Maybe that's the secret.  It's a golf course that you need to drive it well off the tee.  We know you're one of the best drivers of the golf ball in the world and you have been for some time now.  Do you feel that, get yourself on the fairway and you can really go deep, as Henrik did today?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, very much so.  I like the way they set this golf course up.  There's penalties for missing fairways.  The rough is thicker than other venues we play at and the bunkers are well placed.   
I think there's a few that the really long hitters that can carry it 300, 310 have a big advantage.  But all in all, I think it's a pretty fair driving golf course, no matter what distance you hit it.  Certainly pays dividends if you can hit a lot of fairways around here.   
 Q.  Your partner, Helen, on the bag today.  How was that?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It was good.  She's under strict orders to not say too much about the golf side of things.  But she's there giving me encouragement.  Unfortunately, you know, Billy's dad passed away on Saturday, so that's why he's not here this week.  Helen said she'd step up.  And I have to say, I wouldn't want to carry the golf bag around six miles in this kind of heat.  Every credit for doing it.
