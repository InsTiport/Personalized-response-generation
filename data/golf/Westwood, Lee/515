Q.  A fine round, which could put you right back in contention, but a few missed chances?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I probably left, conservatively, about four or five shots out there. I missed from four feet at the first, missed a good birdie chance on the third, missed from ten feet on nine, missed from five feet on ten for eagle, missed from 12 feet on 11 and missed from four feet on 12.

Then I started raking them in, holing from eight feet on 14 and five feet on 15. Left it on the edge of the cup at 16 from about 20 feet and missed from 15 feet at the last two holes.

I hit the ball as well as I could tee to green but my putting was a little bit worse than shocking to be honest. I wanted to get off to a fast start and I know I was capable of shooting 63 or 64 out there but I just didn't putt well enough for that.
