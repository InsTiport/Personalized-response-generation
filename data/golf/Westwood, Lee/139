  LEE WESTWOOD:   I dropped shots on holes that other lads are probably picking shots up on.   It was basically just rusty.   Hit a lot of good putts today that missed, grazed the hole a lot and a few times I hit what I thought were good drives and the fairways were a bit pinched in in certain places and I haven't got a lot of experience of playing this golf course.   I hit what I thought were good drives and they didn't turn out good.
This week's all about just getting competitive again, really, for me.   Obviously I would have liked to have shot better than 2â€‘over par but there were signs of good golf in there.   Play well tomorrow hopefully and get another couple of rounds over the week. 

Q.   Have you always tended to be the type that can shrug off the rust pretty quickly? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I do play better after I've played a bit.   That's why I try and play the week before a major championship.   I like to be competitive.   It's serving its purpose this week.
