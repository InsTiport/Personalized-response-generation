LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, played nicely today.  I hit a lot of good shots today.  Hit it close a couple of times.  Made some nice putts.  Much more positive.  I think there's a good score out there again.  I don't think it's playing at its most difficult, depending on whether the wind gets up.  But I think there's a low one out there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really.  I got pretty much what I deserved all week long.  That's the great thing about Birkdale, you don't get bad breaks.  There's not much misfortune out there.  It's probably the fairest links course you could ever wish for.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD: Bridgestone, PGA and then a couple of weeks off, and then Czech, Swiss, Dutch.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I can build on today and this week, and see what those couple of tournaments hold.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit a lot of good shots.  I hit some poor ones.  The poor ones have been too destructive, really.  A couple of double bogeys, you can't afford to do that.  But all in all played all right.  Just not quite on.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I mean, yesterday and today I played a lot better.  69, 67 at the weekend.  So, I'm looking forward to playing again at the Bridgestone.
