  Q.  Overall, how pleased were you with 71?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Quite pleased. I didn't get off to the best of starts with two bogeys and I had to hole from eight feet at the first to avoid a four putt! That wasn't great, but I played pretty solidly. The course played tough today, a bit more breeze and that makes it harder to hit the fairways. The ninth fairway is almost impossible to hit so it's not easy and there won't be many low scores. The greens are firming up and drying out and the pins are harder today. Our first two pins at 10 and 11 are right at the top of slopes and 17 is tricky. Anything around 70 is a pretty good score I would say.   
  
  Q.  Are there birdie chances out there?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, if you hit the fairways there are, because you are then hitting stand irons and wedges at a couple of holes. I hit a wedge to the 18th and made birdie there and hit a sand iron to the first and birdied that as well. Same at the third.   
  
  Q.  the ball is going an awful long way?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, but you've just to adapt to the fact that the clubbing is different. For me a wedge is going 145 to 150 yards so it's all about adapting which is what golf is all about. I will go and do some work on my short game now because that's where the tournament is going to be won and lost at the weekend.   
  
  Q.  Is you wrist okay?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, you just get some horrific lies out there and you just have to gouge it out.   
  
  Q.  You have Alastair (McLean) on the bag. Is that a permanent fixture or a trial?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just these two weeks to start off. I don't know how Alastair sees it but he's a very good caddie and he has spent enough time with Monty under pressure situations that I knew he would be a good bagman.   
  
  Q.  How is this as preparation for next week?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Very good. This week is all about fairways and I would imagine next week will be much the same. It's a demanding test, which is good. The humidity is going to play a part so this week's weather helps us to acclimatise.   
  
  Q.  There are not many under par? Right in the shake up?   
 LEE WESTWOOD:  Yes, the object is to be in contention as much as I can. I've been in contention quite a lot this year but haven't finished it off.   
  
  Q.  Is it fair to say it's a two week trial with Alastair?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty much yes. I don't know the way Alastair looks at it. I asked him to do these two weeks and he said yes.   
  
  Q.  How about Dave (Renwick)?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: David and I are finished.
