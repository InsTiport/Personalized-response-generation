 Q. What went wrong at 8? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I just over-hooked my second shot.

 Q. And then you had to play out of the trees?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I was up against a tree, but I hit a good shot.

 Q. On 12?
 LEE WESTWOOD: 12, a good shot, pitched in the face of the trap, and everything that pitches in the face in the trap now on 12 comes back on the downslope, so you can't even hit the green out of that trap now.

 Q. So you fired it through the back of the green?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, just popped through the back, two-putted for a 4.

 Q. How did you feel overall? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's how my game is at the moment. If you can't hole it out from four feet, you're going to struggle, aren't you.
