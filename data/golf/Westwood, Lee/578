Q. Play well?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yes -- I played good.
Q. Feel as though you could have made some more putts?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I missed a really good chance on 14, then again at 14 and 16 but then I made one at 17 that I hadn't expected to and then the same again at 18 so there are some days that just happens. I holed a good one on three as well from 35 feet and then missed from two feet on eight.
Q. Have you changed putters from last week?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No it's the same on as I had last week -- and for the last three weeks. I played good today, hit a lot of good shots -- especially a few iron shots that I hadn't hit for a long time and I drove the ball pretty good as well. The course is playing a bit harder than it was last year so I'm quite happy with a 70. I could have had 68, but 70 is not a bad score.
Q. So 70 was a fair reflection of how you played?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, 68 would have been a fair reflection of how I played but I'm not disappointed with 70.
Q. What about the course -- rough and pin placements?
LEE WESTWOOD:  The rough makes the course tougher. The third is not such a gimmie hole now and eight is a very trick par four and the greens are tricky because they are a lot grainier than I have ever seen them -- they are the grainiest I have ever seen them. Some putts look as though they are going to swing left to right and then you have to actually hit the outside the right edge the grain is that strong. So there is going to be a few people who get to grips with it - like Bradley has obviously done and shot 64 but most of us are going to struggle because it is quite hard to judge just how much break to give it.
Q. Did you watch the scoreboard when you were up there today -- or was it too early?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No I don't watch scoreboards on a Thursday -- I rarely watch them on a Sunday, so Thursday -- no.
Q. Any chance of playing the way Ernie did down 18 in the future? Did that surprise you?
LEE WESTWOOD:  It didn't surprise me really because the way they have set the course up, they have shaved the rough right down on the right hand side and if he had landed his driver on the fairway it would have ran out into the water, which is plainly unfair. If you grow the rough long down one side and then shave the other side, what are you trying to achieve there? So credit to him for hitting three iron, three iron -- it just completely takes the mickey out of the person that set the hole up.
Q. What did you hit there?
LEE WESTWOOD: . I hit driver, five wood -- I'm not long enough to reach the water!
Q. You knew the five wood was on?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yes -- I did it in the practice round. I didn't hit the second shot down there but I had a look at the yardage, which was 193 yards to the flag. If you make the correct way to play the hole ludicrous then you have to expect people to find another option.
