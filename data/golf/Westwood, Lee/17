Q. Your 25th victory on The European Tour, you've now won in four different decades on this tour. Describe how special a week this has been for you?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's been a good week.
Q. Again, emotional, probably understandable. Obviously a day when other people are posting terrific scores, two 63s got to 17-under, Matt Fitzpatrick got to 17-under, as well. Tell us what was going through your minds?
LEE WESTWOOD: I wasn't really paying any attention to what other people were doing. I was trying to control me, control my emotions and control what I'm working on in the golf swing. Just managed to do that. A little slip-up at 16. Like I said yesterday, with what I'm working on, if I don't quite do it, I hit a pull, and I hit a pull second shot and pulled the putt actually, as well, but hit some good shots coming in, and really just pleased with the way I controlled myself.
Q. Earlier in the week you told me your goal was to get in the Top-50 in the world again and WGCs and all the majors; and that's projected to 29, and flying up The Ryder Cup rankings. How excited about the possibilities for the rest of this year?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not sure I can take any more Ryder Cups. Played ten, and it was good watching the lads last time. But you know, obviously if there's a chance of that, then I might as well go for it. It's nice just to come out and keep proving that you've still got it.
