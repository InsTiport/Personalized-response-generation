Q.
You never really got it quite going?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, I didn't get to a very good start.  Bogey on the 5th was like missing two shots, really.  I just didn't really get close enough on the first few holes.  Then on 9 I hit it stone dead and dropped a shot at 11, which was no good.

14, got it in the front trap in two, got it up and down, and 16 I hit 6 iron to about two feet.  I burned the hole a lot from 20 to 30 feet, but there's no excuse.  I just didn't play very well.
Q.  You see the way the scoring is, and it is deep?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Today didn't really seem any easier than any of the other days.  I don't know why the scoring is so low.  There's a wind, more wind, if anything.  And on the last few holes, I think 17 and 18 really looked some flags to hit.  And 16 flag, as well, was front right, which would be harder.  I don't know why the scoring is so good.
Q.  Today was really close to yesterday, for instance.
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, these first two days I made too many mistakes.  I'm 3 under, still mental errors.  Today a made a couple of them out there, as well.
Q.  Pressing a bit?
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, not really pressing, just not thinking really.  I don't know whether it's the two weeks off or what.
