Q.   (No Microphone.)
LEE WESTWOOD:   It's a good start.   I played nicely yesterday and then came out this morning and the conditions were a little bit different.   It was quite cold and damp and a little wet.   So I think 70 is a good score and I'm in decent position. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
LEE WESTWOOD:   It's pretty similar.   I would say around this course you got blind tee shots, you have to get your sight lines right. 
There's no semi rough this week.   It's just strange really, because there's some undulation on the fairways. 

Q.   (No Microphone.)
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, well I did hit it.   But Peter Dawson has reassured me that for the Open Championship we'll be going back to flags like a normal tournament.
