 Q.  What changes, if anything, because you have to come back and finish a round that right now looks pretty good?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah.   
 Q.  How do you -- is there a difference in how you approach it?  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, no, just come back with the same mindset I had this morning.  No change to the way of thinking.   
 Q.  Been through rain delays.  You know what the drill is.  Do they frustrate you?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, they frustrate everybody, don't they?  We'd like it to just go smoothly, but sometimes it doesn't.  You just have to be patient.
