 Q.  Tough day for the pair of you - you pushed him hard but you both came up a little short? 
 HENRIK STENSON: I have been struggling with my tee ball all week long and it was no difference today and I didn't hit enough fairways. Because of that I haven't been able to hit my driver enough and I didn't feel comfortable on the tee. I think that made the difference for me, if I had a strong driver in the bag I felt like I could have given him a run for his money 

 Q. Did you think your chance had gone at the 13th when you missed that birdie putt? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not sure about that, I thought I had a chance up until the end, I mean a two shot swing can happen any time here but I was really pleased with the way I played tee to green today - nothing really happened on the greens. I holed from about 15 feet on the second but apart from that nothing really happened. 

 Q. Nevertheless a great start to the season for you? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yes, I have been playing very consistently, driving the ball well and hitting some good iron shots and it is all coming together nicely. As for today, I think I gave them all a little bit too much of a head start this week, two under over the first two days is not really good enough, you want to be a bit closer than that. But I put up a fight at the weekend which was good. I was hoping to get to double figures and I got to 11 under so I am pleased with that. 

 Q. Knowing your love of the desert Henrik, you must be pleased with your form and looking forward to the next two weeks? 
 HENRIK STENSON: Yes absolutely. It is an important year with the Ryder Cup at the end of the season and this brings some good points in for both Lee and myself and that is where I'm heading. I will just try and be consistent for the rest of the year to fill up the points.
