  LEE WESTWOOD: Disappointing finish.  Three bogeys to finish, but you know, 71 and by no means out of the championship.Q. (Inaudible.)LEE WESTWOOD: I bogeyed the last three holes.  You know, turned what would have been a good round of 4-under with three pars into just an average round of 1-under.Q. How difficult is the course getting out there?LEE WESTWOOD: When the wind is in this direction, the front nine is always where you score and the back nine is where you hang on.  It's a tough wind to play the back nine in.  You try and make your score on the front nine and pick up ones where you can on the way back and hold on on holes like 15, 16, 17.  Hungry, looking forward to lunch.Q. They're expecting a big change in the weather tomorrow.  How big a part will that play?LEE WESTWOOD: Always plays a big part in links golf.  With the draw you can get carved up being on the wrong side of the draw, and you just hope that it's fair to everybody, but very rarely is it.  You know, just have to grin and bear it and get on with it really.Q. (Inaudible.)LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, mastering the conditions and also playing St. Andrews experience is a key, as well.  It helps to have gone out and played this golf course in tough conditions before.Q. Do you actually like it when the wind gets up?LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I think this golf course needs a fair breeze blowing.  Obviously none of us like playing in rain, but I think you want a 15, 20 mile-an-hour wind blowing on this golf course, otherwise the players just murder it basically.
