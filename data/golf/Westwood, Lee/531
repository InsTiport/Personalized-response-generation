Q.
Lee, 17 gets so much attention; why is 18 maybe more formidable and so challenging mentally?
LEE WESTWOOD:  I don't know.  I've always found both very testing.  Obviously 17 is surrounded by    surrounded by a big gallery and very visually intimidating.  And I suppose once you think you've got that over and done with, you let your guard down and the 18th is just as intimidating, you've got the water all down the left hand side, and you can't force it to the fairway right or else you can't get to the greens.  It's a fantastic finishing stretch to a great golf course.
Q.  How satisfying is it to be where you are right now, knowing the weather that's coming, all you have to deal with and getting two rounds in and on top?
LEE WESTWOOD:  It's unpredictable.  We don't know what's going to happen, it could be three rounds, four rounds, we just don't know.

The greens staff have done a fantastic job to get two rounds in considering the conditions.  I'm happy to have played well.  But it's nice to be leading.  It's better leading than chasing in conditions like this.
Q.  Did you feel the course was there a little bit for the taking?
LEE WESTWOOD:  There's not too much wind about, but obviously if you miss the fairways, the rough is really penal now; it's very long and lush.  The ball sinks to the bottom, and if you get it in there, you're going to have to accept that you're going to make bogey.

But if you hit it straight and you control your iron shots well, you're going to have a lot of birdie putts.
Q.  Do you have any more confidence when you went in after the delay with the lead, do you get any confidence once you get in there and have that lead, even if it is only for
LEE WESTWOOD:  No, it doesn't really matter to be honest.  I've been playing pretty well this week, and I'm confident, no matter what position I'm in.
