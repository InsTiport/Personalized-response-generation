LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I made a three tough bogeys today.  And Miguel, he's playing very well, making a lot of putts and chipping in when he hits the green and he's going to be tough to catch.
Q.  Do you feel as if you're in winning form?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I feel like my game is getting back to the way it should be.  I've been working quite hard on a couple of swing changes and certainly looking forward to playing Bay Hill, TPC and the Masters.

I feel like I'm hitting more shots right lately and that's normally a good sign.
Q.  Strange how golf has changed, now you have to always be on year-round, don't you?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, the big tournaments are spread out throughout the year now.  We've got the World events spread out.  Everybody takes them all quite serious but at the same time, I don't think anybody can peak for that one time -- for two months of the year, I think people are able to gear it up towards TPC and Masters.
Q.  In a tournament like this, is there any moment where you feel you have to win this one?
LEE WESTWOOD:  Yeah, I think, you know, on the range before you start, you know whether you're playing well or not.  I've been sort of -- inaudible -- first couple of months of the year.  Didn't play much the first couple of months of the year.
