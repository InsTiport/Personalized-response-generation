 Q.   Now that was one of the tough days at the office.   What was proving so challenging about the conditions out there today?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, this golf course is not really sort of set up for winds like this.   It's fairly penal.   And when the wind starts blowing like this and starts swirling around in these trees, you have to be ultra‑precise.   
   
 Q.   We saw the problems really begin to manifold themselves about 15, 16, and then of course 17.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Problems started on the first, Hazel.   
   
 Q.   I was going to skip over that, Lee, to be honest.   But when we got to 17, very unusual to see three re‑loads from all of you.   What was so particularly problematic about that hole today?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   It's a tough drive and you try to aim down the right and sling it a bit and we all over‑did it.   It was one of those things.  
   
 Q.   And of course, the putt.   Were you fully aware that that was the putt that possibly and probably will keep you in the championship for the weekend?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I was aware that 1‑over was likely to be the cut.   But you know, there's not much pressure with cuts anymore.   I'm out here trying to win.   At least I get a chance to come out and play the course again twice more over the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you'll be going out early like James Morrison, 8‑under, quite a score on a day like today.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, we should play a different tournament, shouldn't we.   We should play a an early/late tee off time tournament and then a late/early tee off time tournament this week, because I don't think the guys in the afternoon are getting within seven or eight of the lead.   
So you know, you couldn't see a 64 around there this afternoon, no way.
