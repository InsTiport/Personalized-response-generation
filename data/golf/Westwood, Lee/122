STEVE TODD: Welcome, I'm sure you're happy to see the British Masters back on The European Tour, an event that means a lot to players and particularly special to you.  What does it mean to be back here this week?   
LEE WESTWOOD: It's great it's back on the schedule.  It's a prestigious title and one that's been around The European Tour for a long time.  Certainly I remember watching it on the Beeb when it was back-to-back with the PGA Championship at Wentworth and watching Tony Johnstone, Christy O'Connor and Seve up there.  It's been played here and the Belfry and all over Britain, so it's nice to see it back.   
There aren't that many tournaments in Britain nowadays, which surprising with the quality of British off gopher the last few years.  It's nice to see that recognised and start bringing a few tournaments back.   
STEVE TODD: As a player, how much does it mean to play on home soil, as well?  And having won the tournament, as well.   
LEE WESTWOOD: I think it's very special for the players, especially the British ones.  There's something different about playing at Wentworth in front of the British crowd and playing The Open Championship and things like that.  It's more fun, that's for sure.   
 Q.  What sort of memories do you have of those two occasions --  
LEE WESTWOOD: I can remember a lot of '07 and not a lot of '08.  I know I played well the last round in '07.  I think I had the lead and ended up shooting 65 and winning by a few.  That was good.  And then the follow year, I played solidly again.  Kept making long putts to stay in it and I think I bogeyed it on the 18th.  It was two good British Masters back-to-back.   
 Q.  How will it work going forward -- obviously Ian has a situation with Woburn.  What's the plans -- do you have any specific plans going forward what you'd like to do?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know when I'm hosting it.  I thought I was hosting it in 2017 but somebody mentioned I might not be doing it that year now.  I think that it's sort of coming together.   
So I certainly would like to see the golf tournament held in the north of England.  It's been a long time anything has been held sort of north of Birmingham, really.  We have a lot of good golf courses and the golfing public up there are keen on golf and should be given the opportunity to go and watch top-quality golf.  There's certainly a void that the tournament should in my opinion fill.   
 Q.  Are you worried about hosting -- you have to spread yourself around, haven't you?  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, it doesn't worry me.  Dealt with media and sponsors for the last 20 years.  They are not that scary.   
 Q.  Will you be taking notes this week?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Of Ian?  (Laughter) no, I think I can handle it.  Still able to focus five hours a day on the golf, six hours a day.   
 Q.  In terms of infrastructure, Close House, is it big enough to host a European Tour event?  
LEE WESTWOOD: A lot of things have to be taken into consideration obviously.  Plenty of land around the outside, so I don't see any reason why not.  I guess the M1 is five minutes from there, so pretty easy to get to, as well, and Royal Links I guess, as well.  No reason why not in my opinion -- inaudible -- very keen on it.
