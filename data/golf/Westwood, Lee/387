 Q. People say that normal service has resumed?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's been pretty good over the first few days. Didn't hit it as good today as I did yesterday, but obviously conditions are a lot easier today. There's far less wind. But I suppose if you don't hit it great and you shoot 69, you have to be pleased with the state of your game.

 Q. Well documented what happened last week missing the cut, but how much of a shock to the system was it for you? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not really a shock. It is more reality. If you don't put the work in on the range, then you don't get any benefits. 

 Q. Are you getting used to the clubs? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, the specific changes, I've had to change the set. But as far as that's concerned, there's no getting used to them. You shouldn't have to get used to a new set of clubs. They should just fit straight in. If you start to get used to them in your body, it does start to adapt after sort of five, ten shots, then they are the wrong set of clubs.

 Q. How surprising is it to be able to turn things around from such a short space of time from last week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Not surprising at all. I've been with PING for 22 years now. They generally know what works for me and can sort it out for me pretty quickly. They sent somebody out Monday and it clicked straight back in. I knew it wasn't so much me, more of a case of getting the equipment fine-tuned, and I did that on Monday, as I said, with the PING technician.

 Q. Talking about the Englishmen in the Top-10 in the world and the state of European golf in the moment and these three weeks, is this something you've thought about much or something that we are in a better position now than ever? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I haven't really thought about it too much. Over the last few years, we have had a strong contingent of English players and we are very lucky at the moment to be like that. It's only ten years ago when Nick Faldo had mentioned that I was the only one in the top one head in the world, and it just goes in cycles; it happens every now and again. 
 I would hope that with the wealth of talent at the top of the World Rankings, the guys that are English, that would inspire more kids to take it up at the moment and get to that position, as well. 

 Q. A long way to go over the weekend, how nice would it be for you and Oliver Wilson to be together on Sunday, given your history to together?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I get on well with Oliver. We didn't play in the same county team because I'm a little bit older than he is, but it would be nice. I enjoy playing with Oliver. He's a nice guy and we get on. We talk about Forest all the way around. 

 Q. How did your round feel today with six bogeys, three birdies? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Other way around, fortunately, six birdies, but I knew what you meant. 
 No, wasn't quite as good today, but you have days like that. I'm not a morning person. I didn't feel in as much control of my swing as I did yesterday. 
 So it wasn't quite as good, but 69 is still a decent score around this golf course.

 Q. Let me ask your verdict on the day, if I may, the score you've ended up with?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty good. It wasn't -- I didn't by any means flush it today, but it was still pretty good. You know, if you don't flush it and you shoot 69 -- it's a pretty tough golf course. The conditions were slightly easier today. So I think a good score today would be more like 64, 65 rather than 68, 67. 
 But I'm pleased with the day's work. I'm in contention for the weekend.

 Q. Is there an element of frustration given that that is your feeling of what the score could have been?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it could only have been that if I played well, which I didn't. So there's no frustration there. I let a few shots slip coming in there. I missed a couple of putts, which I should be making on 7 and 8. So I feel like I should be standing here a couple of shots better. But other than that, I pretty much got what I deserved out there. 

 Q. What time was your alarm call this morning?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Pretty early, 4.50. You know, the life of a professional golfer is not always a glamorous lifestyle. 

 Q. At least they put the lights on on the putting green for you. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, the sun come up when I started to hit the ball, so I didn't have it that bad. Certainly got here when the likes of Nick Dougherty was out at 6/40 and was warming up in the cold in the dark under the floodlights. 

 Q. So does that mean you got six hours sleep or a full eight?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm pretty good at sleeping. I got eight hours sleep and felt pretty good this morning. Just couldn't put it together with my swing on the golf course.

 Q. Even that takes discipline to make sure you go to bed early?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it does. There's all sorts of different factors contribute to playing well, and sleep is always one of them.

 Q. We had a conversation with Oliver Wilson today, and if you don't mind, I'll pursue it a little. And I spoke to him and he says when he was caddying for you, you allowed him to select one club, and you wanted 3-wood and he said driver, you went with it and you overshot the green by a bit. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was a par 4. I remember it. I think it was the 15th or 16th, and I thought it was 3-wood and he didn't think I could get there with 3-wood. And I hit driver and it went about 20 yards through the back. So that ended his caddying days I think with me. 

 Q. And that was the only club he ever selected for you?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, he's turned out to be a better player than a caddie fortunately.
