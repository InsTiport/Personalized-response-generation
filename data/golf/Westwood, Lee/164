  Q.How did it go out there today?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Didn't get off to the start I wanted to.   3â€‘over after four, that's just awful.   You're not going to get into the tournament that way.  
   
 Q.   Do you keep believing during the round then?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Tried to, but I was hitting some good shots and getting a few unlucky breaks, so it was just not my day.   The greens are difficult to just hit a putt on.   
   
 Q.   It's hot and muggy out there.   Is it quite a grind for you?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, no, it's not any hotter than yesterday, really.   
It was quite pleasant conditions.
