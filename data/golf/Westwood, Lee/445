  Q. Involved in a great match there?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: He just got up and down on nearly every hole today. He only hit seven greens in regulation and when it is hard to make birdies round this place with the undulations on the greens so any time you get someone like that who gets up and down from everywhere and keeps making putts for halves it is going to be tough.
