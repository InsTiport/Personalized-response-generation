Q. A very strong first day; how would you say today's play was?
LEE WESTWOOD: I played okay again, really.  Struggled on the greens a little bit.  Struggled to read them more than anything.  Yesterday they went in.  Today they grazed the edge.  Had a few bad breaks.  Pitched it on 10, went off the green, hit a couple of trees in line with pins.  It was that kind of day, really.  Tough to get anything going.
Q. I've seen you out there playing today, I saw a couple smiles out there.  Do you feel the joy coming back in your game?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I'm enjoying playing.  I always have, really.  Always do, try and do.  Love to do something I love to do.
Q. Sounds like you've got a bit of a cold.  Is that what's holding you up a bit right now?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's filled my sinuses more than anything, so I'm struggling with my balance a bit.
