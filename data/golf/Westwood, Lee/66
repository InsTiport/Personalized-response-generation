Q. Happy with that today?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, played well again.  Hit a lot of good shots.  Could have probably got a bit more out of my round.  I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, so it was just one of them days, really.  But I did everything well.
Q. Tee-to-green, is that as good as it gets?
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit it all right tee-to-green all week.  Not sparkling but certainly as good as I've hit it in some time.  I feel like I'm starting to swing the club well, and considering it's the first week of the year, I'm looking forward to getting back after Qatar to Dubai.  I'm not playing next week, and then pick up in Dubai, play Malaysia and then in South Africa for the Dimension Data.  I'm looking forward to playing.
Q. Is the putter ultimately the difference this week with a chance to win?
LEE WESTWOOD: I think I dropped a few too many shots really.  I made a few too many bogeys.  Second round I made four bogeys.  Just various things.  I probably could have hit a few more fairways.  But all in all I played pretty well.  Nothing went spectacularly right for me.  It was just a solid week.
Q. Ultimately, a decent performance to the start of 2017?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I played really well this week, so I'm pleased.  I normally don't play this well this early.
Q. Assessment of your caddie's performance?
LEE WESTWOOD: Caddie was fantastic.  She can definitely do it again.  Very impressed.
