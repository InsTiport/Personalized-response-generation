  LEE WESTWOOD:   Quite pleased.   70 is a good round.   Conditions were tricky this morning, a bit of breeze up and the golf course is‑‑ I think the golf course is as good a golf course as I've seen all year.   I think the fairways are just right, give us the right width, and if you miss them you get penalised.   The greens are just the right kind of firmness and good speed.   Very happy with the way I've started.  
   
 Q.   We've come here for quite a few years now and it seems to have grown into its skin and developed as a course.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I've always liked the golf course.   I think it's a great design.   I think it's a good risk/reward golf course.   I think 16 is the best short par 4 we play all year.  
The par 5s give you a chance, certainly; two or three of them, to get there in two and make eagles.   There's a lot of water in play.   I think it's a really good venue for a World Golf Championship.  
   
 Q.   Are you feeling the benefit of playing Malaysia last week?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I'm not struggling with any time changes.   Completely different conditions.   Last week, very muggy and different kind of grasses.   This week, a bit of breeze blowing.   
Nice to be back in China.   Haven't been here for a while and nice to be back at a golf course I've played well in the past.   I've had a couple second‑place finishes around here.   Nice to start off well this week and hopefully get into contention for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Yes, I did mean about acclimatisation; sometimes you can come in here and that's when your thoughts are on sleeplessness and not necessarily concentrating only on your golf.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I generally have no worry of sleeping, just as long as I'm here at the right time, I'm happy.   And obviously playing last week at CIMB Malaysia, I'm on the right time zone.
