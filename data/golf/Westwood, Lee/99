Q. You were picked to do a job and that's exactly what you've done?
LEE WESTWOOD: I played well today.  Got off to a fast start.  Probably should have birdied the first four holes but left it short in the middle of the hole on the second.  Get off to a fast start like that, I felt like I was going to be tough to beat.
Q. You kept the pedal down all day and Team Europe, as well, following Darren Clarke's instructions to the letter?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think we wanted to win the singles today and it looks like that's what we're going to do.  We didn't want to just creep over the line.  We wanted to win emphatically, and we're doing that so far.
Q. How much has your experience in Ryder Cup helped this week?
LEE WESTWOOD: Experience always helps in team competition.  Not just on the golf course but in the team room, as well.  Nice to be able to play and help.
Q. Clarkey was saying all week about how much the team have bonded and you've obviously been an integral part of that.  Has it been a joy to see everyone coming together and fighting for the same cause?
LEE WESTWOOD: It's a good team.  Europeans never have a problem bonding.  We know each other well and play together a lot, so that's never too much of an issue.
Q. Obviously match play is different, but you're obviously going into the year in great form.
LEE WESTWOOD: I finished off last year strongly with a second and that got me in the Masters and The Open Championship and back into the Top-50 in the world, and playing this week, not having played much over the Christmas period -- I was about 7-under today I think and the swing felt good and I felt good on the greens.
