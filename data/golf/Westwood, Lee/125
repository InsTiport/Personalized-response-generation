 Q.  Your assessment on the round today.  LEE WESTWOOD: I played pretty similarly to yesterday.  Yesterday I had 23 putts.  Today I had 26.  I hit some poor shots, but I hit some good shots.  Got up and down when I needed to really.  I felt like 70 was a decent score.  There was a bit of a breeze blowing, a bit more than yesterday. Golf course is firming up all the time, which is nice.  I like it when it plays like this.   Q.  Do you remember a time when you've seen it like this in recent memory?  LEE WESTWOOD: A few years ago it was like this, I think.  I think, when I finished second to Vijay, it was playing pretty firm.  A lot of the years, they all blend into it because you play the same golf course all the time.  I think this golf course certainly plays a lot harder and better when it's firm.  There's just natural defenses that you have that come out when the golf course is fast running.
