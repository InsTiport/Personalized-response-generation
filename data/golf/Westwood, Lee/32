Q. What a crazy match.  Just comment a little bit about it.  It was really a tale of two nines for both of you guys.  And what a huge putt for you there at the end to get the halve.
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was nice to make that putt for the halve.  My putting was poor, really, towards the end -- well, on the back nine I was 4-up, gave him 12, gave him 13, gave him 14 -- 15, three-putted.  He made a nice pitch and birdie on 16.  But I missed from five feet.  And I three-putt 17.
So, I don't know, if you call it justice on the last.  It's more luck than judgment on the greens for me.  But I've hardly been playing coming here.  I don't practice when I'm at home, so I can't really expect anything different.
Q. But how much that putt makes a difference in the way you feel right now?
LEE WESTWOOD: Oh, yeah, certainly.  I'm looking at the score at the group in front, I think if I beat Tyrell tomorrow, and Rafa beats Xander it's a four-way playoff.  That would have been daft, wouldn't it.  We'll all have one and a half points.  We could all in theory still go through.
Q. Talk a little bit about your play early in that match.
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit the ball well all day, even when I was losing on the back nine, I was hitting the ball well.  I was striking it well.  I just gave too many holes away on the back nine through poor putting, basically.
