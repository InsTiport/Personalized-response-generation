   LEE WESTWOOD: 70 was a decent start. It do have been a little bit better. I struggled a little bit to get things going. The only hole I played poorly was from -- I hit a great shot down on 16 off the tee and completely duffed a sand iron and walked off with five. That was the only disappointing part of the day, but I played really controlled golf the rest of the time.

 Q. Is it a case of pacing yourself this week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think so. Like any major or any big event, you can only play your way out of it the first day. You know, first couple of days, two or three days, it's all about getting in position and having a chance on Sunday. 

 Q. You had a good final round at Firestone; do you take anything from that?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I played very solidly, as I did today. Just the difference between the last round last week and today was a few putts went in today. When I struggled to make anything, it was all close to the flagstick. But I'll go on the range this afternoon and the putting green and try and work a few things out and come out tomorrow and try to shoot 64 or something like that because I'm sure it's out there.

 Q. You were so close at the Open; how did you bounce back from the Open?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I keep having these close calls and continually proving to myself that my game is improved and I'm good enough to win one of these majors.
