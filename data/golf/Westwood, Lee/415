  Q. Give us your thoughts on the day and maybe week as a whole?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, some good points. I just played very poorly today. Hardly hit a good shot. Salvaged a bit with going two, two on 16, 17 and making a birdie at 14, as well. So disappointing to bogey the last.   
  
  Q. Feeling wasn't quite there early on?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it wasn't quite there and there were a lot of distractions out there. We'll probably let's leave it at that.   
  
  Q. Would you comment on The Race to Dubai, Rory closed the gap on you a little bit today.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I honestly don't know. I haven't looked.  
  
  Q. He's obviously finished third or fourth, so he's a bit ahead of you?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: He finished fourth, did he? So I don't know what that does. (Laughing) I'll comment on Monday.
