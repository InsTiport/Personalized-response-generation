 Q. Another strong performance. What are you going to do to try and continue that going into tomorrow?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just keep playing the way I'm playing. I played pretty good over the first three days. I haven't really made enough putts. A little bit rusty on the greens, but it's getting in there. 
 I didn't play as good today as I did the first couple of days. I didn't get the first couple of days falling back and have good chances tomorrow. I won't be far off the lead. Anything can happen.

 Q. All right. You're in striking distance. Anything you plan on doing differently?
 LEE WESTWOOD: No. Just keep playing the same and trying not to make too many mistakes. If you get aggressive on this golf course, I think you can short-side yourself and you start making bogeys, so I think you gotta play a patient game out there, strategic game

 Q. How do you feel about playing the par-5s? You're 6-under on the week so far?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah. I haven't really played them well enough. I've hit it close a lot, a lot of good chances today, and didn't really take enough. So hopefully a little bit better over the weekend, or the last day.

 Q. And scores were pretty low today. Do you think that'll continue into tomorrow?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Possibly. Who knows?
