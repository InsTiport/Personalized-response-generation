  Q. Can you just talk about your round a little bit, please?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was tough out there. The golf course changed a lot. It got really firm this afternoon. I thought I played well, gave myself a lot of chances, made some nice iron shots in close. Missed a couple, but all in all I was pleased with the way I played. I didn't make too many poor shots out there.  
  
  Q. I guess we need to talk about the shot at the 18th.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was a great shot. I got a little bit lucky. I hit it on the same line yesterday and had to hack out sideways basically. But today I found a little gap and took advantage of that.   
 The trajectory of my 6-iron really matched the trees in front of me to go under one and over the next one to fade it into that flag.  
  
  Q. Which you have to have some imagination to think of when you're standing there, right?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I've got plenty of imagination in my game. I played a few of those shots at Augusta a few weeks ago, and sometimes you have to play them.  
  
  Q. You hit kind of a blind shot your second shot on 9, too.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, over the trees with a 5-wood. It was a good shot. Made birdie with that one. I was pleased with the way I played today.  
  
  Q. Will you approach things differently or the same tomorrow as the leader, or how will you --  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just exactly the same as I did today as the leader. You know, it's getting harder, the golf course. I don't think it'll be softened up overnight. I think it'll get nice and firm. You'll have to hit as many fairways as possible and as many greens as possible, I would imagine.  
  
  Q. Any great Mother's Day memories as a kid?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: I've got plenty of good memories of my mother. Mom and dad have both been very supportive growing up and as a man now. We had Mother's Day earlier on in the year in England, so it's not Mother's Day for me.
