 Q.   Got a little messy as the day went on, didn't it?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, it was a pretty miserable day out there.   The rain was on and off.   We expected it though.  
   
 Q.   All in all, how do you feel you played this week?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   I struggled with my swing a bit.   I battled.   I didn't feel so good either.   I was struggling with a chest infection all week.   
All in all, sixth or fifth is all right.  
   
 Q.   Was there a turning point in your round today that you feel?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, bogeying 12 and 13 was obviously not good at the time being in the lead.  
   
 Q.   At the time though I'm sure you felt there were still some birdie holes out there?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I birdied 14, and I had a good chance at 15, and a good chance at the last.   Yeah, there are plenty of birdie holes out there if you're hitting it well.
