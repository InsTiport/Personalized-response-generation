  Q. Your thoughts on your round, Lee?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: It was tough out there. The wind was pumping out there. Although it looks like its dropping. I was six over after six and struggling really. The course was playing tough at the start and you didn't have to do a lot wrong really. I dug in though and was three under for the next six holes but three putted 16 which was a shame. All in all two under might be in with a chance  
  
  Q. You managed to pull it round after nine, was that a turning point?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I missed from six or seven feet on eight which was the turning point really as it was the first green I hit in regulation.   
 It was a good birdie at nine and I missed a short one at 10 from four feet, had a good chance at 11 and then birdies at 12 and 14- two gimme birdies today - then bogeyed 16. But I parred the last two holes which you can never complain about here.   
  
  Q. Still got a chance?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think so it just depends what the leader finishes on. I'm just happy to make the team cut that's my main priority for the week.
