 Q. 10-under, Lee; your thoughts? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Just played really solid again. Gave myself a lot of chances. When I missed the green short game was good. Felt I rolled the ball better on the greens today. Got a few more running out of the hole, which I didn't yesterday. 
 I feel like if I keep hitting as I am and have one good putting day, I've got sort of a 63 or something like that in me. So happy with the way things are going.

 Q. Only halfway, and the other day you were speaking about having not won this year, how much would it mean to you to actually do it this week?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't want to put any unneeded pressure on myself. I've not won all year and it would be nice to win this year, and also starting this Race to Dubai, it would be nice to get some momentum in that. It would also be good just to finish off the year solidly. I've played good all year, and I'm continue to go do it this week.

 Q. How do you compare this year to your prolific victorious years? You've been so consistent in majors and everything. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm really pleased with the way this year has gone. I've played well in the bigger tournaments, even when I was winning six, seven times in a year, I wasn't really giving myself good chances in the majors and the World Golf Championships in the States. 
 I finished one off the playoff in the U.S. Open and second to Vijay at the World Golf Championships at Akron. There are better showings in the bigger tournaments.
 So the consistency has been good all year, and I did feel like I'm getting more of an all-around game now. 

 Q. What was your highest World Ranking when you were winning? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Fourth. I'm 10th now. My goal was to get into the Top-10, so I've achieved that now and you can't knock yourself when you're achieving goals.
