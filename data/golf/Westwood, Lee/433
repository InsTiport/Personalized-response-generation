   LEE WESTWOOD: Difficult to tell really. I didn't really hit it so good all week, so, you know, to be in contention is great. People will point to the 9 on the second day on the third hole. But if you hit bad shots, you're going to make big scores, especially around here because you don't have to be far out.
 I hit a couple of bad shots today: A 3-iron into 10. I made double-bogey there when I'm looking to make birdie and all of a sudden is a 67 is 64 just there. And then I hit it into the water on 17 and made five.
  I have a bit of a destructive shot in there, but I'm getting experienced enough now where my game, it isn't quite there, it's playable, and that's the thing that pleases me most.

 Q. Having to take off the shoes and socks, roll up the trouser legs?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I'm going to be looking for a good dry cleaners later on, because these trousers are going to be ruined. Yeah, just waded in there and played it out and got soaked. 
 My caddie wasn't expecting rain today, so the waterproof gear wasn't in the bag.

 Q. I take it you felt like that had to be a gamble worth taking. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it looked like it had come out pretty good but it just didn't. It was pretty soft in there, and I could have made five, but in hindsight, hindsight is a wonderful thing and if I had dropped it back, I would have pitched it close and holed it for five. But you go with what you think at the time. 

 Q. Destructive shots aside, do you feel in good shape ahead of the Match Play?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, not too bad. I'm pleased with my short game. My short game is in good shape. I'm starting to see a few lines on the greens, hitting better putts. So there's no doubt a good putter at the Match Play tournament will serve you well. If you can roll in a few putts, then it demoralises people.

 Q. How do you regard that tournament and your chances within it? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I think there's more luck involved in that tournament than any other to be perfectly honest. You can catch a guy on a really hot day and you can shoot 7-under and lose, and, you know, you can shoot level par or over par and win. 
 So there is quite a bit of luck involved, but you know, Tiger's won it a few times, so it proves that the best player in the world occasionally does win.

 Q. I take it by and large as everybody has said, it's good to have him back?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think golf's got to be better for having the best player in the world playing. And you know, he walls going to come back at some stage and he obviously thinks it's the right time to do it next week. It will be interesting to see how he plays.
