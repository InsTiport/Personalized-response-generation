 Q. Thoughts on the day?
 LEE WESTWOOD: That was a very strange day. I played really well on the front nine, in fact for the first ten and a half holes and then it just went for some reason. I just couldn't hit anything straight after that, bizarrely. In fact I only hit one green in regulation on the back nine and hardly hit a bad shot on the front nine. I don't know what happened - it was just one of those days.
