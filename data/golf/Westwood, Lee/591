LEE WESTWOOD: No, it's not changed particularly. 17 is a little bit longer. And even in
today's condition you couldn't get there. Other than that, it's just the same. Very good
condition. The greens are good. Fairways are great. It's still a good test.

LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not quite putting as well as I'd like; maybe if I can hole a few more
putts this week, I'll have a chance.

Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you need for your game?

LEE WESTWOOD: I'm not so sure -- you need to drive the ball very straight. You can get
a big advantage if you can hit the ball straight along off the tee. Because you tend to
just run off the fairways, and you're not in particularly thick rough, but these greens,
you want to hit in them high, and you've got an overhanging tee. So.

Q. In the whole scheme of things, where does the Order of Merit stand with you after
this year, next year?

LEE WESTWOOD: I'd like to win the Order of Merit, but as far as it bothering me if I
don't, it wouldn't really bother me. I think the game is becoming more of a World Tour,
now, so I think titles -- I think today if you win majors everybody in the world --
everybody in the world tends to play those. And these World Championships have joined the
major category, because they attract such good fields.

Q. In that context, then, how do you rate Colin's run of success in the Order of Merit?

LEE WESTWOOD: I think it's fantastic. I think he's doing very well. He's -- to win six
is a great achievement. I don't think it will ever be repeated again.

Q. Is there a sense that you're playing for the honor and the glory in the four
established majors, and to play for the money in the three World Championships?

LEE WESTWOOD: Not me, personally, no. But some people might view it that way. You
always want to play for the honor and the glory in the major championships, because of the
history and just what they are, majors. But I think as these World Championships get
played each year, I think they'll build up to very prestigious tournaments to win. You
need a bit of fine tuning, obviously, but when that's sorted out, they will be events that
people take notice of.

Q. (Inaudible.)

LEE WESTWOOD: They obviously need some fine tuning or people wouldn't be pulling out,
would they?

Q. That was my question. What is the fine tuning needed?

LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know. Whoever runs it has to figure that out. They have the top
64 playing in this one, and you -- whether it's the schedule, I don't know what -- I don't
know what makes people not want to play in it.

Q. How would you have felt if it had been over in America?

LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I played the two that were in America. So I would probably have
gone to it. I don't think it is fair that they should have three over there. I don't think
it's fair they should have two. If they're World Golf Championships, there's lots of good
courses in Australia, Japan, South Africa; no reason they shouldn't have had one of these
events this year. No reason why they should have had two. 

Q. Do you feel your own season has gone slightly off the board just a little bit?

LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. I haven't played as well as when I won three events in
Europe, but you can't do that all the time. I'm hitting the ball as good as I was then.
It's just a case of not being on the boards.
