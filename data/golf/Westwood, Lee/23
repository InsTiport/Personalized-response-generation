  Q. Can you talk about your round today?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   It's hotter out there today, isn't it.  It's obviously windier.  Greens tiny bit firmer, pin positions a little bit tougher.  I didn't quite play so well.  Got off to an iffy start, bogeyed the first two holes, but the first three holes were playing tough.
 But just a disappointing finish, dropping four shots the last three holes.  I was 1-under for the tournament with three to play, and they're all playing downwind.  So a bit disappointed to finish like that, but 3-over par, here for the week, and you never know what's going to happen in U.S. Opens, do you.
 Q. What were your expectations coming here?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   I didn't really have any.  Played well in the last round of Valderrama, so know I'm hitting the ball well and playing well.  Just looking for a few decent breaks and make a few putts.
 Q. You've played in so many U.S. Opens.  You know what it takes to be in the hunt.  From your position, what do you think you have to do over the weekend?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   U.S. Opens I just think you've got to hang around.  Ideally you don't want runs of holes where you drop four shots in three holes, but 3-over is by no means out of it.  Then you've just got to play solid over the weekend and see what happens.  I shot 3-under yesterday.
 I know I'm capable of going out there and shooting 3-under if I play well, and that will get me back to level for the final day.  I'm sure it wouldn't be far off even par winning this tournament.
