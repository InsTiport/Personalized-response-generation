   LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I just tried to hook it too much because I knew with driver it could run out quite easily, and just sort of pulled it and lost my grip a bit in the right hand and hit the tree and came down in the hazard. Then hit quite a good layup on a bit of a sidehill lie and a bit of a downslope and caught it a bit fat in the ditch again. Then played a great pitch and a putt, holed a nice putt from about five feet with 18 inches of break on it, so that was good.  
  
  Q. Do you have a sense of relief?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. I played very well all day, just didn't make enough putts, really. I had good chances on a lot of holes, but exceptional chances on 7, 14, 16 and then 18. If I make 5 on 13 and convert three of them, I'm around in 67. So it was good golf.   
  
  Q. How was your form yesterday?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yesterday was great tee to green again, so I'm really pleased with the way I'm playing.  
  
  Q. Is this the best tee-to-green you've played this year?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I think so. I played quite well today. It's not easy to putt on these greens. You have to hit them so slowly that you don't put a pure stroke on it, you get yourself off line early, it just looks a poor putt. You can read things into your putting on these greens that isn't there. These are the severest test.  
  
  Q. How do you assess the position then? Obviously Immelman put it together and shot 8-under.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, fabulous score. I thought 6 would probably lead after two days. So 8 is great, yeah, very good.   
  
  Q. Which do you think is the most difficult hole on the golf course?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Hole? I think 11 is probably the hardest hole on the golf course.   
  
  Q. What makes it so?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's a little easier because they've taken some trees out on the right-hand side. And 17 is no pushover. Well, I've made a 3 and a 4 so I can't complain.   
 12 is playing very tricky today. It was swirling around down there quite a lot. I got really lucky, I hit 8-iron and it carried the lot and it hit the bank and came back and I got up-and-down for 3, so I dodged a bullet there. And then got hit in the forehead on the next.  
  
  Q. Since you're behind, have you got to be careful tomorrow?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, and I think it's probably going to get harder over the weekend. On previous experience, it certainly will do. If it gets tough, I'm quite capable of shooting two 70s, and 6-under could still win the golf tournament.   
  
  Q. So just more of the same, really.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I don't think the weather forecast for the next two days is as good as it's been for the first two.  
  
  Q. Given last year anything is possible?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it was playing right in front of me. I shot level par on the third day and moved from one of the first out to one of the last out. So anything is possible on this golf course.   
  
  Q. Overall are you pleased with where you are?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, pleased. Well, I think it's a decent position, so we'll see what happens on the weekend. Anything can happen on the weekend, as you've seen in the past.
