Q. Pleased with your start to the tournament?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I played well both days.  Very solid, only a couple of bogeys, which is good around this golf course.  You've got to hit it well.  Keep it in the fairway.  Get maximum control into the greens.  Yeah, putting nicely, as well, so pleased with the way I'm playing.
Q. You've been a runner-up previously on the course, but with the changes have you had to re-learn things?
LEE WESTWOOD: The relaying is a massive improvement and they are much truer.  But you sometimes have it in your head what your putt is going to do and it's doing the opposite.  You should be hitting and reading every putt on it's merits and sometimes you don't.  All in all, it's been good and the golf course is in great condition.  Got some fantastic weather, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.
Q. The breeze is swirling around today.  How does that change the dynamic of some of the holes?
LEE WESTWOOD: One of the joys of Wentworth, standing in the middle of the fairway thinking it should be off the right and you can feel it off the left.  Just one of the defenses of the golf course.  You are playing through a lot of sort of avenues of trees all the time, and it gets in there and it swirls around.  You have to combat that.  It makes clubbing difficult and when the greens are as firm as this, obviously even trickier.  So it puts a premium on hitting fairways.
Q. How are you feeling about today's play?
LEE WESTWOOD: Played well today.  Played well yesterday.  Only made two bogeys in two days.  It's looking good.  Hopefully I keep playing like this and you know, stay in contention.
Q. Obviously a lot of comments about the greens over the last couple of days.  What do you make of them out there?  How tough are they?
LEE WESTWOOD: Fantastic.  The whole resign is really good.  It's a massive improvement the golf course is playing well, tough, as it should do for this championship.  The greens are true and consistent.
Q. How are you feeling on a hole about your game?
LEE WESTWOOD: It's good.  I did a little work with Pete Cowen on the range on Tuesday.  I'm starting to feel better about the way I've been swinging it.  He gave me a couple of tips and I've hit the ball well, kept it straight off the tee.
Q. How important is it to keep it straight off the tee on this course?
LEE WESTWOOD: When the greens that are firm, you need to be coming out of the fairway.  It's paramount that you have control of the golf ball on your second shots.
