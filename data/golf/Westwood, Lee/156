  LEE WESTWOOD:   I played well, hit a lot fairways, putted nicely, obviously which you need to do if you are going to shoot a low score.   I gave myself a lot of chances.   All in all there was no real weaknesses out there.  
   
 Q.   How does your familiarity with this course, being here for the Ryder Cup help you?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   It's playing a lot different to the Ryder Cup.   It seems a lot softer.   We played firmer there.   They have changed a few greens, things like that.   
It's certainly very different to the PGA, when we were here in 2000.   
I only had three lots of nine holes.   I tried not do too much in the practice rounds, because it felt like it was the kind of golf course where it was just all there in front of you, and you just played it as you see it.   There didn't really look to be too many tricks to it.   
Billy obviously helps, he is good caddie, he tells me to when to play away from flags and which ones are soccer pins.   That is what I did today.   It was a good strategic round of good.  
   
 Q.   Are you comfortable with your swing?   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, you know, last week was a big week for me.   Going into last week, I felt like I turned the corner.   I was starting to swing it a lot better.   There's no good unless you start converting it into low rounds.   The first three rounds were frustrating, because I played a lot better than 3â€‘over par.   Then obviously I got it going the final day, shot 63.   Then obviously tried to keep it low key in the practice rounds, carry that momentum through to the first round, which I've managed to do, made nine birdies.
