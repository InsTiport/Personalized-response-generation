   LEE WESTWOOD: I guess that's sort of what you should do really when you have an off day. You know, they didn't feel very good. Very rusty. Couldn't really feel the finish on my swing but chipped nicely and putted nicely. Hung in there and reaped the rewards. On 6 chipped in. 7, holed from just off the green from 20 feet and then hit two good shots at 8 and lucky enough to make eagle. So I'm delighted, really. 

 Q. Was it about what you expected? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's pretty much exactly what I expected, yeah. I figured I would feel out of sorts and I had a chip around a bit, but you do that when you've not played, even practised, for six weeks. If you would have given me 69 before I went out, I would definitely have taken it. Billy rates it alongside the last two rounds in Dubai -- I'm not joking. The 69, over the last day, he said this is as good if not better.

 Q. Do you think five years ago what you would have shot --
 LEE WESTWOOD: Absolutely anything. You you're not going to play great all the time, especially when you've not put the work in. 69 will keep you in touch all the time, especially when you've not put the work in. A round of 69 will always keep me in touch. You will never play your way out of a tournament with 69. 

 Q. Have you not practised? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I just needed a break and just wanted to not think about golf and not go through the motions of practising. 
 It won't take long to come back I don't think. There were signs there. There were the occasional good swinging out there that should give me hope. The thing I was most delighted about was my putting and short game. That's usually the first thing to go and last thing to come back, and it was pretty sharp today.
