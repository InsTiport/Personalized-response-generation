 LEE WESTWOOD: Six birdies and 30 pars - that's pretty good going on links courses. You always feel you can slip up and land in one of these bunkers. I didn't hole a massive amount. Missed a few 20 footers but you are going to do that here where you don't miss many greens.

I am learning to like this course. Dave Musgrove caddied for me here two years ago and gave me an idea and appreciation of how to play it. He just showed me different ways to play certain holes. I think it's a great 'risk reward' course.

My confidence is great. I am playing well. No bogeys at courses like Carnoustie and St Andrews isn't bad. 

I have goals all the time and getting back into the top 100 in the World Rankings would be a short term one. I'm 111th at the moment. You never know what's round the corner, though.
