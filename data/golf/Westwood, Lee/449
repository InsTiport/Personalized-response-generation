  Q. Lee, wanted to get your views on the appointment of Colin Montgomerie yesterday as a Ryder Cup stalwart.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I think it was a difficult choice for the committee. I think they narrowed it down to JosÃ© Maria and Monty. You know, both of them are very good candidates, but they gave it to Monty and I think he will be a good captain.  
  
  Q. And what, in particular, do you think he will bring to the role?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, lots of experience, and like I said last week, after his eight Order of Merits, his career is remembered for fantastic Ryder Cup record and never having lost in the singles, and having been in The Ryder Cup team for, well, best part of the last sort of 16, 18 years.   
 You know, he's played under a lot of captains and has had a lot of experience of Ryder Cups. So I think he'd make a good captain.  
  
  Q. And he's very much his own individual, but he gets the team ethic of it very, very well, doesn't he, in Ryder Cup week?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, he's good in the team room. He pulls everybody together. He's very vocal around the table in the team room, and he will lead like he's done when he's been a player. But obviously in a different capacity.
