 Q.   Just thoughts on the week overall, in a pretty good position after two rounds?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm playing lovely.   Couldn't be any worse than 68.   
   
 Q.   Looking at the schedule, playing last week, and this week, a tournament you haven't played in a while, trying to balance membership of both tours, are you looking at the early season now with this, and Honda and Cadillac, as a chance to get a in number of events in early on?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   I plan on playing the majority of the events here this year anyway, really cutting back in Europe because I'm living here now.   
   
 Q.   Any particular events we'll see you that you've circled that we haven't seen you play?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Here I haven't played for a long time.   Bay Hill I haven't played for a long time.   Memorial I've only ever played once.   And then there's some in the middle of the year.   It's nice; it's like a second wind really.   Switching it up a bit.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about going into the weekend being back at this course.   
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, the scoring is very bunched.   That's probably due to the greens.   It's difficult to hole putts in the afternoon.   You'll find most guys make a good score in the morning and the guys in the afternoon are happy‑‑ well, I'm delighted with 3‑under.   
I had a lot of putts today that I thought I hit good putts and didn't come anywhere close.   That's just the nature of poa greens in the afternoon, they become difficult to hole putts on.
