   LEE WESTWOOD: These things happen. Starting on the tenth tee is not an easy place to start. I tried to cut a five wood in there and it didn't cut, it just went straight there. That was an easy enough bogey, then I three putted 11 and hit a poor shot into 12 so three deserved bogeys. I struggled to get it going a bit after that but battled away and got my reward on 17 for being patient battling away and hanging in there. I could have birdied 18 as well and then birdied the first. I have a birdie chance on the second as well. 

 Q. What did you think of the decision to set you off the tenth - it was done for television apparently?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well there you go, it was done for TV. I was puzzled because when you are leading you expect to go off the first tee but if it was done for TV then that's it. TV is an important part of professional golf. 

 Q. So you accept it?
 LEE WESTWOOD: You have to. It certainly wasn't the reason I birdied the first three holes.

 Q. It's difficult to cut that shot in there as your first shot? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Don't get me wrong. I would have rather have started on the other side, but it's not the reason I made those bogeys. Anyway I have made decent recovery. I could have played my way out of it but managed to stay in it.
