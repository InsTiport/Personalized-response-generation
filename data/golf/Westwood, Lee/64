Q. You've had some good stretches of golf here. Any stretch better than that five hole stretch today?
LEE WESTWOOD: No, I mean it was nice to make five birdies in a row. Really got some momentum going. Got me back in the Tournament. 
So, 3‑over par, you know, I wasn't really suicidal or anything like that, I wasn't too disappointed. I was just trying to not make any silly mistakes on 10, 11, 12 and play my way out of the tournament.

Q. Not a lot of people have gone for it in two on 15 today. What was the thought process on that today?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I could get there. I only had 239 front or something like that. So, it was a perfect 3‑wood for me. I had to smoke it to hit it long. Fortunately, I did smoke it and pitched and stopped dead on the back edge. 
But right is always a good miss there as well. It's an easier up‑and‑down from right, I think, than laying up. Shane laid up and I thought that was an error on his part and he ended up making six. I'm not saying that's why he made six, but I like the one out right and you got the full length of the green to play out there.

Q. What got things turned around for you today? 
LEE WESTWOOD: I've just been patient. I rolled a nice one ‑down the green at 13. Didn't make any mental errors. So, just kept plodding away. 

Q. I don't want to discount your five birdies in a row, but did the wind at that point, did the conditions seem to be a little more favorable than they had been earlier in the day?
LEE WESTWOOD: No, I think it stayed pretty much the same all day. 
I hit 6‑iron into 16. It's a long time since I've hit 6‑iron into that flag. It's still normally an 8‑iron for me. 
But it was still blowing. And 17, I hit a wedge from miles out. So, it was still pumping. 

Q. 15 was interesting because earlier in the day guys couldn't even get to that green in two. 
LEE WESTWOOD: They're not as long as me, obviously. 
(Laughter.) I'm a bomber. 
(Laughter.) 
We all could get there, our three‑ball. We all hit really good drives like low and penetrating and got some run. 

Q. There's never a question in your mind, I mean, as you just said, you would rather go for it in two than have a hundred yard chip into that green. 
LEE WESTWOOD: When it's as windy as this and the wind's picking up and dropping. You got one where it picks up, it blows the ball back in the water. You got one where it drops and you're through the back and that's nightmare spot. You might as well be there in two as three. 
But you've always got the bail out area on the right. The trap's not a bad miss either. You can get ‑‑ yes, it's a long bunker shot, but you only have to land it a third of the way and it runs down the rest. 
So, today, if you could get there‑‑ and I only had 235 to the front right, I knew I could cover that. So it seemed like a no brainer.

Q. Were you aware Charley was kind of making a move in front and felt like you needed to kind of make a move as well?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I seen a lot of his back side, yeah. Yeah, he was definitely making putts out there. And I was watching the scoreboard and we were saying on the 18th green what a phenomenal round 7‑under par is today. That's a belter, yeah, really good. 

Q. How good do you feel about the 2‑under today yourself?
LEE WESTWOOD: Delighted. Yeah, obviously, 3‑over par through 12, you would absolutely love it if you ended up 2‑under par.
