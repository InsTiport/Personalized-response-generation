Q. A 66 on day one.  You've had some solid finishes the last few starts.  What's been working for you?
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm playing well, basically.  Rolling some putts in.  Putted well at Valderrama.  Led putts per greens in regulation, and I'm hitting a lot of greens, so it's adding up to low scores.
Q. Was putting the key for you today?
LEE WESTWOOD: I hit a lot of good putts that missed.  I rolled a few in.  These greens are pretty good once you can get used to reading the grain on them.  They are weird.  You don't often get greens where the grain goes the opposite way at the slope.  So sometimes you're looking at a putt that looks pretty flat and might be right edge but it moves left-to-right with the grain.  That needs a little bit of learning.
Q. Looking at the leaderboard, a lot of low scores out there, a very impressive type of golf course.  Do you enjoy that type of golf?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I like a Valderrama style of golf course where par means a lot, and I like golf courses like this.  Obviously it's like playing indoors today, warm, no wind, and just aim at the flag and if you put a good swing on it, it goes close, and the greens are receptive enough if you're coming out of the fairway.  I'm a bit surprised nobody has gone lower than 7.
Q. Nice to bring the good form with you to Turkey?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, played well today.  Hit the ball good.  Hit a lot of fairways.  Hit it close.  Made a few putts.  Short game was sharp, which, surprising, I didn't do any practise last week.  I hit balls for about an hour and spent most of that our giving my son a lesson.
Yeah, it was nice to go out there and play well.  Hit the ball well.
Q. Does it change the strategy in any way in terms of aggression to know you have to shoot low on this golf course to be in contention on Sunday?
LEE WESTWOOD: No, I think it's the opposite.  You can get frustrated out there if you're not 3-under through five or six.  You have to be patient and just play each hole as it comes.  Try and make birdie, and if you don't, just keep ticking along.
Q. Overall conditions out there look pretty much perfect today with no breeze around?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, there's not much breeze out there.  It's like playing indoors.  If you can put a good swing on it and comes out straight, it goes close to the hole.  The only sort of slightly if you were nitpicking with my round, slightly disappointing thing, was I was even on the three par 5s.  You obviously want to score well on those and I gave myself good chances.  They just didn't go in.  Hit what I thought was a good shot on 15 and went in the water.  So made a nice pitch to a foot there and got a way with par.
All in all, it was a good round and I'm looking forward to tomorrow and the next three days.
