Q Lee, a round of 68, no bogeys on the card, four birdies.  How pleased with your day's work?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Really pleased.  I played well.  Hit the ball very solidly.  Gave myself a lot of chances for birdie, so I was pleased with the day's work, yes.
Q Tell us about the second shot into the last; you were displaying your muscles afterwards.
LEE WESTWOOD:   Finno thought -- he thought I'd just hit wedge out of the rough and lay it up and knock it on, but I had a pretty nice lie and only 191 to the front, so went at it with a hybrid.  A bit of excitement in your life every now and again, it's good, isn't it.
Q We've spoken about your history here, you've been playing here since 1994, you've finished second three times.  Is this a tournament you target and say you really want to win that one before you're done?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I love it one.  I'd love to win it.  I've come close a few times.  Just seems like it's eluded me.  But all you can do is put yourself in with a chance coming into the weekend and I've done that over the first two days, so I'm not too far behind and anything can happen at the weekend.  I'm looking forward to it.
