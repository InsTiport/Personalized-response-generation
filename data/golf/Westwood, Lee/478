  Q. Can you sum up your day for us?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, a little bit tricky today. I didn't get off to a great start. Hit it a bit hot on the first behind the tree and had to take a penalty drop. It was a day I didn't play particularly well but scrambled well.   
 Shows the work I've been putting in on my short game and holed out well; these are the kind of the day where that pays dividends and keeps you in tournaments.  
  
  Q. Could be a cavalry charge with so many good players bunched up near the top of the leaderboard; at four shots off the pace, how do you think that places you?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I have to play a lot better than today, today was pretty average, if not worse, a lot worse. Just come out and hole a few putts, and that's all you can do when it gets as bunched as this.  
  
  Q. We've seen in the last couple of years 63s from Edfors and Levet; is that what you think might have to be posted tomorrow?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: I don't know. Depends on the weather conditions. Today was a little bit tricky and we struggled to get the direction of the wind all day and clubbing was quite difficult. On the Pro-Am on Wednesday, I made ten birdies and an eagle so I know what's possible out there. It's just a case of doing it when it matters.
