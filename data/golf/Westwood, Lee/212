Q.   Your thoughts on your round?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, I fell to 6 and then a good tee shot down 2.   And good tee shot there on 6.   Got it's in the bunker.   4 was a poor shot.   So it wasn't quite going my way.   Then I sort of dug in and made a few birdies and hit it close and birdied 15.   And then just had a poor finish.   Hit it in a terrible spot on 16 and the second shot (inaudible) come up the back there, but it was a chance of that because it was quick from back there.

Q.   What is your goal for the remainder of the weekend in terms of what you may be looking to work on in the future?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just keep moving up and shooting under par.

Q.     Were the pin placements more difficult today?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, they were a lot trickier today, so you had to have your wits about you. 

Q.   Are the weather conditions that much different?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not really.   There's a fraction more breeze, I guess.   But it's still very playable and very scorable out there.

Q.   How much did you talk?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, we talked a lot.   I talked a lot with Tom.   Played first with him in Japan in 1996 in the Dunlop Phoenix.   Jumbo Ozaki was the third member of that group.   I've played in majors a lot with him, most recently I think at the Masters when I saw Tom. 

Q.   Is he as easy to get on with as he seems?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, very easy to play with.   He's a great ambassador for the sport.   Nice to watch, playing alongside him.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LEE WESTWOOD:   He's nice to play with. 

Q.   Did he give you any encouragement in your major quest?
LEE WESTWOOD:   We didn't talk about that.

Q.   You talked about the pressure that you feel.   Are you more comfortable with being‑‑ do you at all feel pressure when you look at the calendar?   You're 39. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   No. 

Q.   You're sure?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
LEE WESTWOOD:   Not really, no.   No, not hitting the ball great.

Q.   Your long game hasn't been up to speed?
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, nothing has been that good this week.   I haven't holed enough putts.   I hit plenty of fairways.   You need to have your game in shape to play one of these weekends.
