  LEE WESTWOOD:   I knew Jordan was going to be tough to beat.   And sliding down the banister to start, 2 down after 2, I had to regroup and fight back after that.  
   
 Q.   Key moments on the back nine?   16, tell us about that.   Everything happened on it?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Everything did on 16.   It happened before, Jordan chipping in on 15, and me from about nine feet on top of him.   And making a massive 16 out of the trap.   It was a tough lie on the downslope there.   It was a nice chip‑in to sort of keep myself in it.   Had a great 6 iron at 17, holed a nice 12, 15‑footer to go 1‑up.   
   
 Q.   You talked about the putter at 15.   What about the putter at 17?   What's behind the improvement in putting?  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Just a little bit more confidence.   You know what it's like when you see a few go in, the hole starts to look bigger.   That's been the key to Jordan's game.   I got to watch him today.   And I was learning a little bit off the way he was freeing his stroke, not taking a lot of time over it.   The hole must be looking as big as a bucket to him.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
LEE WESTWOOD:   Anything can happen.   I think probably getting out of the group is really one of the toughest things to do this week.   It's sort of a different format.   Fortunately I won three games and get the fate in my hands.   Very excited about tomorrow morning.   Don't know who I'm playing yet, but try to come out and play as good as I did today, just keep holing putts.
