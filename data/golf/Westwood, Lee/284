  Q. You saved the best until last, final round of 65. To me it looked over the last two days like you played virtually flawless golf from tee to green.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's been pretty good. I haven't hit many bad shots. I think I've missed -- not counting semi-rough where sometimes it runs off these fairways, probably three fairways, so that's pretty good golf around here. I have not missed many greens, either.   
 Today really started to get the hang on the greens and rolled in a few more, made a couple of nice 15-footers on the front nine, and then made a nice one at the last from about eight feet for par, which would have been a bit of a significant thing if I would have made par at the last because I hit a great 8-iron and the wind just switched on me. It went farther than it normally does.  
  
  Q. Do you feel like you're making progress in your putting?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's moving along nicely. I don't want to get too ahead of myself, but today I felt a lot more confident on the greens, and saw the ball setting off on the line that I picked a lot more often.  
  
  Q. Next week's course for the PGA Championship is very severe, a difficult one. You must be looking forward to that.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, well, that's good the way I'm hitting the ball, the harder the better.
