   LEE WESTWOOD: I played nicely. I hit a lot of good shots. Holed a nice 20-footer on 15. Nice, solid day. 

 Q. Putter getting a bit better? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I feel like I'm rolling it all right. Just nothing won't go in, which is a bit of a pain. Just nothing will go in, which is a bit of a pain. 

 Q. Greens still settling down? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, they are new, aren't they. In the afternoon, they are not as good as the morning, obviously, but no green ever is. So you have to be careful out there and concentrate. 
 I missed a short putt at 5, just bubbled off line, and hit a poor tee shot off 17, but other than that, played really solidly.

 Q. Been a good day, guys have come back and you've moved forward?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I don't think anybody is going to go away rapidly on this golf course. It's got the feel of a Major Championship golf course where you've just got to keep chiseling away every day. 

 Q. Is that how it feels? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it's a grind out there. 

 Q. Great touch, everybody sort of decked out in Seve's colours?
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was nice, wasn't it.
