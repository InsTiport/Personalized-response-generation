LEE WESTWOOD: Just played all right.  A couple of poor shots but not too bad overall.  Just struggled to make any putts, really.  Didn't quite hit it close enough, I would say.   
 Q.  Obviously going into next week, a tournament you've won.  You must be feeling good about that.  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I'm driving a lot better and I'm getting used to the G4 PING driver and I'm hitting a lot of fairways.  I'm looking forward to next week.   
 Q.  How have you enjoyed the week not just as a player but as a host?  
LEE WESTWOOD: It's been good.  It gave me another view of a tournament; appreciation of what goes on leading up to a tournament and during the tournament.  Yeah, I'm glad I did it and hopefully everybody had a good time.   
 Q.  Record crowds this week, so that must be pleasing?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, nearly 70,000.  I think that's brilliant.  It's the best attendance since we've brought the tournament back.  I'm delighted with that but I had a funny feeling people in the northeast would support it well.
