Q. Very nice start, 8-under par in The Final Series.  How did it feel out there for you?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, I played well.  I hit the ball close a lot of times.  Just really solid.  I didn't play the par 5s as good as I'd like.  I was only 1-under, but all in all it was a good round of golf.
Q. The par 3s, you were in command of those.  What's that all about?  Some of those are pretty tough.
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, they are, but if you hit good shots, then you get rewarded.  I hit some good shots.  Stiffed it on 14 and pretty close on 16 in two.  Striking my iron shots well.  Hit it close on the last and missed it.  But my whole game was pretty sharp.
Q. You sound as though you've got a cold.
LEE WESTWOOD: Really?  Just a little bit.
Q. How long have you had that, and are you getting better or are you getting worse?
LEE WESTWOOD: Feels like it's coming out now.  Just stuffed up.  Maybe concentrates me, focuses me.
Q. 32 on each side, a 64; way to open up The Final Series.  What was working well for you today?
LEE WESTWOOD: I drove the ball pretty good and I was in the fairways so I could attack the flags.  My iron shots were good.  I hit it close a lot.  That was solid, nice.  Putting was good.  Didn't play the par 5s quite as well as I'd have liked.  I was only 1-under for them, but try to rectify that tomorrow and shoot lower.
Q. You've been working hard with Mike Walker to try to get the game back to where it was in years past.  What does a round like this do for your confidence?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, obviously it does a lot.  I've been working hard with Mike and with Kevin Duffy in the gym, as well, working on getting my hips working better.  I'm no spring chicken anymore.  I'm 42, training my hips to work in a certain way the last couple of years, not playing very well and not with a great hip and leg action.  I'm trying to train my way out of it now and get it back to where it was.
Q. Obviously one round does not a tournament make, but when you get out of the gate like you did today, what frame of mind does that put you into heading into Friday?
LEE WESTWOOD: Well, it's nice to shoot 64, as opposed to 74.  With a low scoring tournament like I would predict this is going to be, you want to be right in there from the start and not playing catch-up.
