Q.   Brief summary of your round. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Brief summary:   I dropped shots where I hit poor‑‑ I made bogeys where I hit poor shots, and I made birdies when I hit good shots. 

Q.   Do you feel that you're hitting the ball‑‑ that is brief, yeah. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Brief and absolutely spot on.   When I hit a bad shot, I made a bogey.   When I hit a really good shot, I made a birdie.   Didn't hole anything, lipped‑out a couple of‑‑ had a couple of lipouts.   One at 17 and one at 15 was better, going slower.   None of us holed any putts really. 

Q.   Interesting that no one has really got away today on this course?
LEE WESTWOOD:   No, because it's difficult.   It's set up hard.   You come in across a lot of fairways, they have trimmed them right in and the rough is thick.

Q.   And I suppose it's fair if you do not hit the ball clean that you get penalised, good golf course. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Absolutely.   Just how it should be. 

Q.   A challenging day, but certainly in a good position?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Obviously the scoring was easier this morning.   You've only got to look at the leaderboard to see that.   This afternoon, that's how it is.   In the desert, the wind picks up a little bit and the greens apparently don't run quite as true. 
We have got the morning to go at tomorrow morning.

Q.   First competitive round of the year?
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I actually feel quite happy with a 72.
