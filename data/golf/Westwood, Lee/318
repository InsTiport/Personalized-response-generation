  Third Round 71. 9-Under. 207 Total.

 Q. Bit of a grind today? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was, very much so. You have days like that occasionally where you really have to grind, and not a lot went out for me out there and it turned into one of those grinding days. 
 Kept giving myself a lot of chances at birdies and nothing would go in. I had to hit some good shots coming in just to make a couple of birdies in the last five holes, which has kept me in the tournament probably. 
 So to say how rusty I am and how many shots, if you like, I've squandered through lack of competitiveness out there, you know, I'm surprised I have a chance on Sunday.

 Q. I suppose that's the big consolation, isn't it, you're feeling frustrated inside but often that means you're out of the tournament, but you're not. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: No, still got a chance. I know I can do a lot better. It's been pretty average over the first three days, been sloppy a lot of times. 

 Q. Got one of those questions that goes to world No. 1s for you, your thoughts on what it is that makes the ideal sporting coach and wonder if you can turn your thoughts to that after a grinding day on the course?
 LEE WESTWOOD: I think they have to have a keen eye for detail. They have to have a lot of knowledge of the sport.
