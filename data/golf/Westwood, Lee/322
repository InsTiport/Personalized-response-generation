  Q. Can you talk about the round how tough it was?   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, it was difficult out there. You know, the easy holes were not easier today, they were hard. It was a grind. Tough to get it close to the flags. It's just hard -- as hard as I've ever seen this golf course play.   
  
  Q. Really?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah.  
  
  Q. 72.   
 LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, not bad. Hasn't done any damage, has it.   
 Obviously I would have liked to have shot 69, 70 and been a little bit close and I could have done that, but, you know, not quite.   
  
  Q. Conditions similar tomorrow; going to be difficult?  
 LEE WESTWOOD: Might have a sniff at it. You never know. You never know.
