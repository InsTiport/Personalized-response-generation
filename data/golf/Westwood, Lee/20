Q. 1-under par 71 to finish the tournament, how do you assess the round? Do you feel you left a few out?
LEE WESTWOOD: No, not really. I mean, it was tricky out there. I think 65 is a great round by Tommy. I played pretty well. Hit a lot of good putts. They didn't go in today.
In general on the week, played the 13th hole in 4-over par, didn't play the par 5s well enough, and second round, to have four penalty drops. You know, that cost me the tournament.
Q. That said, how much have you enjoyed your title defence this week?
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, I always enjoy coming to Sun City, it's a great plate, great place to play golf. I always have a good time and look forward to coming back next year.
Q. You mentioned earlier in the week you felt you had a chance to contend going into the end of Turkey. Another Top-10 this week. How much confidence does that give you going into the DP World and where your game is at?
LEE WESTWOOD: Gives me a lot of confidence. It's as good as I've played all year. Just going to keep working on the things with Robert Rock we've been working on and hopefully it will keep getting better. 10th last week and sixth next week and hopefully even better next week. I'm looking forward to Dubai and play well again.
