 Q.  7-under for two rounds, no bogeys on the card today. What's pleased you most about your play in these first two rounds?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Just really getting back into it after a long break. I didn't hit too many balls in the off time there. I was on holiday in Thailand after Christmas and didn't even take the clubs, and then came out here last Friday and hit a few balls, because you know how bad the weather was in Dubai with the rain.   
I didn't hit as many balls as I'd like, but I've done some hard work here on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday, and been working with rocky and the swing feels like there's a bit more width into it and I've driven the ball well. Putting lovely. Rolling the ball nicely, and you know, not really hitting any bad shots. Not putting myself under any pressure.   
 Q.  You started working with rocky last year, that work continuing. What exactly are you working on now?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, the club is gradually getting further and further kind of behind me, and probably due to a lot of wrist hinge, and that's gotten more and more over the years, trying to take straight away from the ball and not break my wrists, which doesn't sound it too good, but when you've been doing something for 20 years, it's hard to take it out on the golf course.   
But I managed to take it from the range to the golf course. Got a bit of length back because I got some width back and a lot wider at the top, and angle and attack on my iron shots is better.   
 Q.  Fourth place finish at The Open last year qualifies you for the Masters. How much are you looking forward to going back to Augusta?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Yeah, really looking forward to it. It's one of, if not my favorite tournaments. I've always played well there. It's a golf course that fits my eye and even if I'm not ripping it, I feel like I can get it around there. It will be nice to go back and get on slick greens and use some imagination.   
Before that, I'd like to play a couple of World Golf Championships, which is a goal to get back into the Top-50 in the world. I'm around 60 right now. A bit of work to do these next three weeks and see how the lead-up to Augusta pans out. I'm playing the week before Augusta which I'm looking forward to in Texas. That's normally what I do and that normally takes me into the Masters competitive.
