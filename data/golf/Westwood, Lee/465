 Q. 67 to start yesterday, 69 today, how do you rate your efforts on day two?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It was an "almost" day to be honest. I almost drove the ball well; I almost hit it close enough with the irons; and I almost made a few putts, but not quite. 
 I suppose to shoot 69 shows the sort of state my game's in. It's pretty good at the moment and you know, even if it's an almost day, still happy with the score.

 Q. Four shots off the lead, and as a man who has won this particular event, how do you think that places you going into the weekend? 
 LEE WESTWOOD: Well, pretty good I think. It's not the easiest course, and we've seen a lot of people in recent history at this tournament come from a few behind; notably Johan Edfors whom I played with a few years ago shot 62 in the last round. 
 Anything can happen; if you don't quite play well enough out here, it can penalise you. There are 64s possible like I saw on the board, but if you don't play well you can shoot 73, 74 quite easily.

 Q. The key to your game is consistency; how much is that worth to you when you stand on the tee to you every morning?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It's worth a lot because you can continually build on what you've got. You're not getting the knock-backs, there's not too many disappointments. I look forward to going out and playing every day, and it's just a natural progression. I feel like things every day are moving in the right direction.
