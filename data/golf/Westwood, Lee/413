 Q. Talk about your round out there. 
 LEE WESTWOOD: I played all right. A played a little bit better than 73. A little lucky on 8 with the wind switch. Made double there. And other than that --

 Q. Talk about the weather conditions out there. How was the wind? How was the course playing?
 LEE WESTWOOD: It was tricky, but there was a score still out there. 
 A little easier than yesterday a little harder than the first day, probably.
