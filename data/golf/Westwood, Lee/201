  LEE WESTWOOD:   Well, that's a nerve‑wracking day, I tell you what, you when you see that leaderboard go blue‑‑

Q.   How nervous were you actually feeling on the course? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Very‑‑ I was nervous over that one‑footer there, I tell you what, that's pressure.

Q.   You look at that board now, what a chance, 10‑6 going into today, got a chance now. 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Much better chance than we've had all week.   Momentum is in our favor and they are going to be starting to think, oh, no what's going on here, and that's when the pressure really increases on them. 

Q.   What was going on with that last putt? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   I don't blame him for not giving it to me.   I was shaking like a leaf.   I make no apologize for this.   This is the ultimate pressure in golf.   You're playing for a lot of pride, and just nice to roll it in and win. 

Q.   How satisfying was it for you to win your 21st Ryder Cup point? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I'm gradually building them up.   I feel like I would preferred two days like this, let my teammates down, I didn't play well, struggled last week and didn't get it together this week.   I today I played really good, and the putt on 15, I really enjoyed that.   
Got a sniff, but last time it was done, it was the American Team in America.   But this would be against all the odds.   This would be‑‑ if we were to achieve it, it would be the greatest come back in The Ryder Cup ever. 

Q.   How satisfying was it to hear less of USA and more chants for Europe? 
LEE WESTWOOD:   They were still supportive of the USA but not as vociferous.   When Matt went quiet, you knew when you start hearing, Matt, we need you, that they are under pressure.
