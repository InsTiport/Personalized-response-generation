  Q. Just your thoughts on your second match?
 LEE WESTWOOD:   Yeah, I mean, it wasn't a high-quality game.  We both struggled a little bit early on.  The wind had a little bit to do with it.  It's playing a little trickier today.  But I put a good spell of golf together.  8 through to wherever we finished, I played him in 3-under, so that's pretty good stuff today.  Yeah, pleased to have won a match, and depends on -- unfortunately losing to Sergio yesterday, it's out of my hands what happens in the group.  You know, you need a bit of luck in this format, and I need a bit of luck tomorrow and obviously to play well against Tyrrell, whatever the result is in front.
