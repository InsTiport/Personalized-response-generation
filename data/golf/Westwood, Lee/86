 Q.  It was a tale of two halves, you got off to a really nice start.  We thought you really had the look in your eye but it wasn't to be.  What happened?  
LEE WESTWOOD: Weren't really a tale of two halves.  It was a tale of hit it awful on the range and hit it awful all 18 holes, an absolute embarrassment tee-to-green.   
 Q.  We noticed that you're working with an ex-snooker player on your putting, on rhythm, would that be fair?  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, I'm not.  You're believing all you read in the papers.   
Ask me what I'm working on.   
 Q.  Okay.  Lee, what are you working on?  
LEE WESTWOOD: I'm working on my routine and the mental side of it.   
 Q.  Six seconds over every putt; is that true?  
LEE WESTWOOD: That's what ideally I'd like it to be yeah.   
 Q.  So is it a count in your mind, like two, six, or is it just a mental thing that you have to rehearse?  
LEE WESTWOOD: No, I'm practicing a routine and doing that on the putting green and practice rounds and things like that, and hopefully that will transfer into the tournament rounds.  Obviously can't count once I'm over the ball, but I think it's somewhere between six and eight which is pretty good at the moment which is way better than 15, 16 seconds having stood over it.
