Q.   When did you first realise it could be going?
JAMES HEATH:   I had a sneaky feeling it could be quite good because I thought the club I had was maybe a little too much and I didn't quite strike it‑‑ then it went in.   I had visions of doing it on Friday.   I had real visions‑‑ then I hit that 20 yards right.   And then today, yeah, just a little fade 7‑iron, spun back in the hole. 

Q.   Is this your first ace on the Tour? 
JAMES HEATH:   First ace on Tour, yes.   I think it's my 15th. 

Q.   What other prizes have you seen?
JAMES HEATH:   None.   I didn't even get a pat on the back in MÃ©xico or something like that four years ago‑‑ Colombia, not even a ripple.   This was obviously a good time to do it.

Q.   Did it cost you anything in terms of the caddie, if you're an amateur, you have to pay a big round for the caddies or something like that? 
JAMES HEATH:   I'll make sure my caddie is well looked after, don't worry about that.   He did initially pull 8‑iron and I pulled 7. 
I drive a CitroÃ«n DS4, very nice car‑‑ I don't have a garage.   I have a flat.   But I have absolutely no complaints.   Absolutely delighted.   Still can't quite believe it to be honest.

Q.   What do you think of the car itself? 
JAMES HEATH:   Honestly I don't really ever take the time because I've never been able to afford something so wonderful.   So I've never really looked at it.   It's just like torture; why would you look at cars like that that you can't even afford. 
But now I'd obviously take a lot of time. 

Q.   Any ideas about colours? 
JAMES HEATH:   I really don't know anything about the whole situation to tell you the truth.   Yeah, I don't know anything about it. 

Q.   Do you consider this your biggest prize on the Tour so far?
JAMES HEATH:   100 percent, the biggest prize cheque I've ever had is 35,000.   So it's well above that.   Yeah, as I said to Michael earlier, it would be nice to win on the course, get in The Race to Dubai. 

Q.   If you had a choice between taking a higher placing and a car? 
JAMES HEATH:   I would take‑‑ well, depends on the higher placing.   If it was a thousand pound‑‑ well, I would probably take‑‑ that's a tricky one, isn't it.   I'd rather take a higher placing if I'm being truly honest, a top two or top three.   I wouldn't take 43rd or 42nd.

Q.   Was it easy to concentrate afterwards? 
JAMES HEATH:   It was a bit tricky.   You've just won this awesome car, and yeah, I wasn't particularly playing kind of that great today.   Yeah, it was a little tricky to focus actually and towards the end I was kind of like, just get it in.   Like I say, nice problem to have. 

Q.   Have you Tweeted it already?
JAMES HEATH:   I'm not on Twitter, so I haven't, no.   I'm not on Facebook, either, so I haven't done anything like that.   I've just come off the golf course so I haven't done anything.   Been focusing for four hours. 

Q.   What did the other guys say? 
JAMES HEATH:   Obviously delighted.   It's obviously great to get a hole‑in‑one any time.   To get a hole in one on that particular hole when there's such a magnificent prize‑‑ my friend got a hole‑in‑one worth a couple thousands, and that's obviously great but when you do it in this situation, it's fantastic.
