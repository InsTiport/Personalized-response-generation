  DANNY LEE:   Three‑round total 12‑under, I think it's a pretty good score, and I think I still have a chance.   Just got to look forward and play hard.   
   
 Q.   What's it like for you trying to get off to that good start?  
DANNY LEE:   To be honest with you it's always very important.   I was working very hard this last year winter.   Even though it's very cold in Dallas I was preparing myself for this year, try to improve my game, and mentally, physically with my golf game, and I think it really worked out very well, and I'm playing really good right now.  
   
 Q.   How confident were you Monday trying to get into this tournament?  
DANNY LEE:   You know, I was very nervous, and I didn't really have that much success in Monday qualifier, and I had to come over here and practice because the weather is so cold in Dallas, so might as welcome over here and enjoy the waves and surfing.   It was fun.   
   
 Q.   Compared to Monday at Pebble Bay, completely different down here?  
DANNY LEE:   Yes, weather wise, wind wise, rain wise, it's different.   It's been really nice this week.   
   
 Q.   Have you done any surfing since you've been here?  
DANNY LEE:   Yes, I tried to surf, but I was pad willing for an hour and I got sore arms, so I quit.   But maybe after this week I'll try a couple more times.
