 Q.   You put yourself in a good position.   What were the keys to your round today?   
DANNY LEE:   I actually had some good breaks, and I made two eagles today.   I holed out from a hundred yards away.   One, I think it was the second on the par‑5, I was in the left bunker, and in a very tough place to get up and down from there.   I actually had to pick up slack to stop the ball, and it picked up slack and went in.   So after that I think I got good momentum going, and I played it really nicely.  
   
 Q.   What club did you use for the eagle?   
DANNY LEE:   I used a 52 ° wedge.  
   
 Q.   So your year so far has been kind of up‑and‑down.   How would you say, did you feel this coming?   
DANNY LEE:   Yeah, and it's only starting.   It's only February right now and it just started.   I guess I was too nervous and not focusing on my own game.   
So I just kind of learned to play a little bit better than what I used to do in the last four weeks.   I was playing good the last four weeks, it just didn't really happen for me.   I'm starting to play really good.  
   
 Q.   You played the Nationwide Tour last year.   Do you feel that helped you a little bit in training for this year on the PGA TOUR?   
DANNY LEE:   Yes, a lot, actually.   I was actually struggling for a couple of years how to make low scores, especially out here.
