   DANNY LEE: It was close. It was almost playing before. And I didn't feel anything different. But, you know, I was expecting I'm going to play well today.   
 But I did play well, and I had a great shot. Bunch of great shots, and lot of bird putts. I just had a few bad holes. Like 7, and 6.  
  
  Q. Did you have a certain number in mind going into today?   
 DANNY LEE: No, you I just wanted to shoot like even par, 1 under. But, you know, I shot bad holes, and it really caused my problem.  
  
  Q. When you make doubles and you make triples in your short career in the last three or four years being a world class amateur, how do you usually handle it? Do you ride the ship and you're fine? Or is it something where you're prone to have double and triple there?   
 DANNY LEE: No, like this year I had lots of doubles and triples, and every time I did I just wanted to attack my putts and get one on the golf course. I can't do that. And so many people are watching me.   
 I'm trying to control that anger. I wasn't really angry at all today. I was still disappointed about how I played.  
  
  Q. Yeah, those days of snapping clubs are probably over since so many eyes will now be on you on such a regular basis?  
 DANNY LEE: Yeah. I have to be careful what I'm doing.   
  
  Q. Well, 4 over is probably not what you were hoping for. I can almost say it wasn't. Where do you go from here tomorrow?   
 DANNY LEE: I'm going to try to figure it out.
