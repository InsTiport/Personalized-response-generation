Q. I know a little bit disappointing to finish like that, but a 10-under 62, considering where you were starting the day, you've got to be pleased with that.
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, I think we both went out there with a good attitude today and played some good golf and made a bunch of birdies, both of us, and luckily we didn't make them on the same holes, so it added up to a pretty nice round.  We should be pleased.
Q. This combination, I saw the names, you've both got DL as your initials, you've both broken through on the TOUR in 2015.  What were the other reasons for pairing up?
DANNY LEE: We're actually good friends.  We actually eat dinner after the golf quite a few times, and we enjoy each other's company.  He's a good teammate.
Q. You paired up in the World Cup, didn't you; is that sort of where this partnership came from?
DAVID LINGMERTH: That's where we decided to go, yeah, because I was playing with Alex, and Danny was playing with Ryan Fox, and last two rounds we were paired, Sweden and New Zealand, and we just decided let's have a go at it at the Zurich, so that's where it started.
