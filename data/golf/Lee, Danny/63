 Q.   Seemed like you carried over your Puerto Rico play.   Talk about the round today.  
DANNY LEE:   Yeah.   Obviously I gained a lot of confidence after last week playing with the finish in Puerto Rico, it really helped me a lot with that confidence stuff and I'm hitting it really well right now.   
My ball striking is the best it's ever been, especially with putting.   I got the new claw grip, still working great which is fantastic and --  
  
 Q.   When did you start that?  
DANNY LEE:   Couple weeks ago, yeah.   Just put it up to the green and swing the putter with the claw grip.   It always rolls where I want it to stop and distance control is fantastic right now which is good, so --  
  
 Q.   Talk about the conditions and obviously that's the big story of the day today.  
DANNY LEE:   Puerto Rico and here is totally different golf course.   I never played this course before so this week, Tuesday, I was playing practice round and I was -- I think I shot about 90 over here.   
It was so hard.   I was shocked how hard it was and actually I think today, afternoon guys got a lot of advantage from the wind and the conditions and stuff.   Sounds like in the morning group got the bad weather coming through and they played kind of social, I guess.   
It's a tough golf course.   It doesn't -- without the wind I mean -- wind and the cold weather, even we're playing in nice weather, it's a very tough golf course.
