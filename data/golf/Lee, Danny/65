 Q.   Here with Danny Lee on the 18th green.   Danny, tell me a little bit about your round.   
DANNY LEE:   It was another good day on my round, I mean another good day of golf.  
I was hitting it really well at the beginning and putting is good, and I think everything is going really nicely at the moment.  
   
 Q.   So you've had three great days of golf.   Tell me what's kind of like bringing that on?  
DANNY LEE:   It seems like whatever I'm doing with my caddy on the greens I'm getting a lot of good breaks, and I'm reading this green very nicely, which is really good.   And all I gotta do, just hit it on that line and see what happens that mostly it's been really dropping in for me.   So I'm very happy with that.  
   
 Q.   So the situation that's kind of developing now reminds me of last year at the Web.com Tour, the Rex Hospital Open.   Hadley came back from five shots under, actually took the tournament from you.   
DANNY LEE:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Is that in your mind already or what are you thinking?  
DANNY LEE:   No, not really.   I didn't even know I was second place after‑‑ until like 17th hole.   I wasn't really looking at the scoreboard.   I didn't really want to know where I was at.   I was just trying to be more focused on my round and try not to think about other stuff.  
   
 Q.   What's your plan going into tomorrow?   Is it the same?  
DANNY LEE:   Yeah.   Just play my game and see how it ends up, and hopefully I'll have another good day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Perfect.
