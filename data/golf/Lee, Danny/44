 Q.  Danny, first of all, just assess your week here at the BMW.  
DANNY LEE: It was playing tough for me.  Whatever Jason Day is doing or which course he's playing, it's ridiculous out there.  It was a tough week for me, but I learned good stuff good my game this week, so I feel good about next week.   
 Q.  How does it feel to make the season finale next week?  
DANNY LEE: I am very happy.  It was one of my biggest goals at the start of the year, and I'm very happy about that.   
 Q.  What's been the key to the season for you and getting to East Lake?  
DANNY LEE: Probably the tee shot, struggling with my tee shot game, so I think I grew up on that.   
 Q.  Do you know much about East Lake?  
DANNY LEE: No.   
 Q.  Have you watched the TOUR Championship before?  
DANNY LEE: No, never been there, never heard about it.  I've seen it.  I've watched it on the TV all the time, but I heard it's an awesome place, and I cannot wait to get there.
