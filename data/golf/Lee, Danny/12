Q. Consecutive birdies, 7, 8 and 9, what did that do for your game and the whole round?
DANNY LEE: Nothing, really.  I was just playing golf out there.  I didn't know what was leading and what I was at, so I just kept playing golf and I had a pretty good result, I guess.
Q. What did you feel was the strongest part of this week that you can carry forward?
DANNY LEE: Definitely my iron shots and my putting.
Q. Describe your outing today?
DANNY LEE: Well, a little bit of disappointment at the end, but I think I did pretty good all through the week.  Course conditions were a little bit tougher today.  I was playing a little bit firmer.  It was a little bit tougher for me to go for the front pins.  Other than that, it was great.
Q. You finished at 10-under, so pretty good day.  I know there were a couple.  There was one birdie putt that kind of lipped out on you when you were kind of I've got a shot.  So there were ones, I guess, you left out there?
DANNY LEE: Yeah, 17 and 18 was a bit of a disappointment.  But I gave it a try.  It was a tough putt.  It was breaking at least a foot to the right for both of them, and the percentage of making those putts were very low, I think.
Q. At this point you're at 10.  However, Jordan's dropped back to 11.  There are two guys at 11.  You might have to stick around for later.
DANNY LEE: I might, I might.
