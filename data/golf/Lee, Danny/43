 Q.  Great round to finish your first ever TOUR Championship.  Just talk about your year, I guess, and then also obviously, your round today.  
DANNY LEE: Well, obviously I had a great year, I'm here playing in the TOUR Championship.  It's not easy to get into this tournament and playing against the Top-30 guys, who all had a great year on the PGA TOUR.   
I was just trying to shoot some kind of under par and finish my year right.  And I shot 5-under today and I'm very happy with that score.   
 Q.  There's a lot of momentum going into Presidents Cup.  I'm sure that's another one you're excited about?  
DANNY LEE: Yes, I'm very excited.  I just cannot wait to be there, I think it's going to be really fun.
