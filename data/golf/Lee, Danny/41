 Q.  Just talk a little bit about your match and your last match.  How was it for you guys you guys were always fighting what seemed like an uphill battle?  
DANNY LEE: We had a couple of unlucky breaks off the tee the first couple holes.  And when you start your match with 2-down after two, you know, it's going to be a tough day.  We kept pushing ourselves to try to make birdie and win the hole back instead of playing our game, and we got carried away.   
We almost brought it back after nine holes off the front nine, but we have two balls in the water and that always hurts.  Then the momentum kind of switched from there.   
For me it was my first time playing this Presidents Cup match, so it was a good learning way for me.  I was a little bit, obviously, a little bit disappointed that I lost.  But all my teammates and Captain Price especially having my back and just the beginning.  Anything can happen out there, and just kept my chin up and just keep moving forward and do my best and try to win that one point for the team.   
 Q.  Being the last match out the Americans were putting on the wins early on.  Were you looking at the leaderboard?  There was a lot of red rather than your colors?  
DANNY LEE: I did after nine holes and it seemed like we are stronger players on the back nine I believe.  And I thought they were going to come back.  But obviously it was our first day and we're trying to mix the right combinations for the teammates and stuff.  Obviously it didn't really work that well.  We were still experimenting with that perfect match.  Tomorrow we're going to have a hell of a lot better team tomorrow, and we're going to just move on and go win that point.
