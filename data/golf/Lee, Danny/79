 Q. What are your thoughts on making your first cut on the PGA TOUR as a professional (finished T20 at the 2008 Wyndham Championship)?
 DANNY LEE: I was very nervous playing the last five holes. It was tough the last five holes. This is going to be my first cut as a professional. I was really nervous about it and I did play really well. I shot three-under today and it was tough conditions out there. I am really happy with my results.

 Q. So were you thinking more about making the cut or challenging for the lead?
 DANNY LEE: The last two holes were extremely tough so I was trying not to put it in the water.

 Q. What was the difference between last week and this week?
 DANNY LEE: I was working with Dave Stockton, Sr. this week - Monday through Wednesday. I was taking it really serious about professional golf and I think I overreacted and I was taking it too seriously. I was trying to make the perfect swing. I met Mr. Dave (Stockton) and he gave me some good tips and that really relaxed my mind. Now I am just having fun out here.

 Q. You concerned about the water on No. 18, is that why you ended up so far right?
 DANNY LEE: Yeah you know, my caddie was saying to hit a 3-wood down and it is an easy par. I was trying to make birdie and grabbed driver out and tried not to put it in water and pushed it. I was lucky and got a second shot and made par.

 Q. Were you thinking about the lead?
 DANNY LEE: I wasn't really looking at the scoreboard. I don't really think about what place I am in so all I am going to do is try to make five birdies out there. That is my goal this week, actually for me and David's goal. So I am just going to do that.
