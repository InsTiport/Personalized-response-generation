Q.   Danny, you didn't get off to the start you would have hoped for, but you really turned up the heat once you got your chances on that back 9.
DANNY LEE:   Yeah.   I was hitting the ball really good.   I made a couple bad positions early round, but it happens out there. 
But after, I make a 25â€‘footer on the 7th, I think, and after that I caught fire and kept hitting good putts and it kept going in.

Q.   You picked a nice club on 18.   It's a very unique finish here, but you were able to birdie it.   How big?
DANNY LEE:   Yeah, I wasn't really trying to hit it close there.   I was just going for the middle of the green and see what happens, and I think I just carried that big slope in the middle of the green, and I finished really nice.   Nice way to finish the round.

Q.   Danny, congratulations.   Keep it rolling.
DANNY LEE:   Thank you.
