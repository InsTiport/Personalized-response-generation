 Q.  8-under par through two rounds.  Just comment on your day out there.  DANNY LEE: It was very wet today.  It wasn't really windy or anything.  It was a good scoring day -- well, not a good scoring today.  I hit a lot of good shots today, I hit a lot of good putts, it's just I couldn't read the greens right today for some reason, but I'm still happy with my round.  I could have done a lot better, but I should go over there and work on my putting.   Q.  One guy says he absolutely loves the rain, seems like everybody else hates the rain.  Where do you fall on playing in the weather?  DANNY LEE: Which guy loves the rain?  I don't think everybody loves the rain.  I don't mind the rain because I grew up playing in the rough weather back in New Zealand, so I'm used to how it reacts and how my body reacts when it's pouring down, the rain.  I don't mind the rain.  It seems like we're going to play with a lot of rain this week.   Q.  Does that make you have to change some things?  DANNY LEE: No, I just keep doing what I'm doing, hitting it solid and make a lot of putts.  That's all I can do, right?   Q.  On a day like today when you left a little bit out there, is it motivating to have the weekend?  DANNY LEE: Yeah, I was hitting just as good as yesterday.  It's just a lot of putts that didn't go in.  But I all hit a good putt.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to have another good round tomorrow.  If I keep this up, who knows, I might have this.   Q.  So you guess you still like your new driver?  DANNY LEE: Yes, love my new driver.
