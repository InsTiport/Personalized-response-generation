 Q.  Danny, yesterday a 64.  Then today you come out here and you bogey two out of your first three holes but then you turn it around after that.  
 What did you find?   
DANNY LEE: I know that course is windy out there, obviously live here, and I actually live five minutes away from here and today is one direction.  I was just thinking if I made par through the first five holes I had a good chance to finish Top-10 this week.  I kind of started off kind of funky but I brought it back and had a good finish.   
 Q.  Was it a lot of fun to play out here this week at your home course?  
DANNY LEE: Lot of the family members, all my friends out here supporting me this week and it was just fun.   
 Q.  You guys do anything fun off the course this week?  You have some fun family time?  
JASON DAY: Not yet.  I'm about to.   
 Q.  There you go.  Now you got your first Top-10 of the season.  How is that going to help propel you into the weeks that come?  
JASON DAY: Thank God.  It happened way too late than what I expected.  I started off the season very, very poorly.  Got my team back, Drew, Kirk, I also added mental factor, Julie, and all the team been supporting me really hard when I go into some tough times and I guess I'm hanging out with the great people around.   
 Q.  We're glad that you turned it around this week and congrats and good luck moving forward.  
DANNY LEE: Thank you.
