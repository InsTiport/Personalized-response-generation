Q. You got to feel pretty good getting the low number up before the sun comes out, heat turns up and give somebody something to shoot at this afternoon.
DANNY LEE: It was a perfect condition out there.  The greens are so pure, not a breath of wind out there so it was really doable and lot of birdie chances out there if you're hitting it well and I was hitting it well and kind of missed a lot of the short birdie putts on the first five holes but starting to drop after I made a first birdie on the par 5 and then it was just a smooth ride.
Q. 5 through 8, you got on a nice roll there.
DANNY LEE: Yeah.  It seems like whenever I have a birdie early in the rounds it seems like I get pretty good momentum going into it.  So, I think I just got to try to make birdie early in the round.
Q. I know there are a lot of guys here who played in the Olympics last week.  Do you feel like you got your feet under you a little bit or what in the world have I gone through the past few weeks or so?
DANNY LEE: It was just amazing last week.  I really enjoyed playing in Olympics and Rio.  It was just one heck of an experience for me and just have to call myself an Olympian.  That just means a lot to me.
Q. We've heard a lot about how different it felt.  Can you convey that, just how different it was than the conventional or even a Major?
DANNY LEE: I really didn't know what to expect from there because I never, ever watched somebody playing in Olympics as a golfer, and I really didn't know what to expect but it almost felt like half Major events that you see all the Top 50 players in the world playing in it and just felt like a half Major event.
Q. Congratulations on that and good start here.
DANNY LEE: Thank you.
