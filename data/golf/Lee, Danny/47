Q. Could have ended pretty poorly. Ended up with two birdies at the end to get back in it.  That must have felt good.DANNY LEE: Yeah, I did.  I think it's a big thing that I made two birdies on the last two holes, get my momentum going for tomorrow.  It was definitely a tougher day out there.  I didn't know -- I kind of remember how tough this golf course is now. So yesterday I was playing very -- it wasn't easy, but it was -- every hole I feel like I had birdie chances out there yesterday.  But today I'm kind of different.  I felt different.Q. Do you think -- this course is really not playing easy at all.  Does it suit your game well?  Do you like it?DANNY LEE: It's a grind.  You have to think positively no matter what happens out there.  You have to try to grind out there.  That's what we're working on, me and my caddie.  We did a pretty good job today.Q. Is there anything that was said kind of on the back nine, okay, let's finish strong.  Or was there any moment where you were able to put that think positively into play?DANNY LEE: I was trying to finish strong all 18 holes today.  It wasn't in my favor today.  The ball wasn't really listening to me very well.  I never really hit that many bad shots, and I was 4-over all of a sudden.  I'm like, what is going on here? Then I made a long par putt on par 3, second par 3 on the back nine, and I think that kind of gave me the momentum of strong finish.Q. This is World Golf Championship, a little different level of events, best players in the world.DANNY LEE: Oh, yes.Q. A little tension on Saturday.  Is that going to be fun?DANNY LEE: Oh, yes, it's going to be fun.  I'm really looking forward to playing tomorrow.
