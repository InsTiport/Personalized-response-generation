A flash interview with:   
DANNY LEE   
 Q.  So overall how do you feel like today went?  
DANNY LEE: Oh, I got off from the rough start, I guess, making 3-putt on the second hole and making bogey on the 3rd hole par-5.  Should be making easy birdie there.  Tried to take it off my 5-wood little too much and just set it in an impossible area.  End up making bogey.   
I'm a very strong momentum player, and when I start like that, it was very hard for me to fight back.  I had a lot of the good putts, but it seems like today it wasn't going in.  I missed a short two-feet putt at 14, I think.  After that, I was like, okay...   
 Q.  You talked yesterday about how it was your first 54-hole lead.  What do you take from the experience, and how do you use that going forward?  
DANNY LEE: I think it's definitely harder to maintain where you are at when you're leading the tournament.   
I don't know it makes that much difference, but for me, like I said before, I'm a strong momentum player, but I just started off not my best and then it was hard for me to come back from it.   
 Q.  Was it just a shock to your system?  
DANNY LEE: No.  I made plenty of bogeys first three holes and came back from that, and then just this course, for me, it seemed like playing really long.  I had a lot of the 6-, 7-, 5-irons.  And when you have that iron, that in your hand, greens rock solid firm, it's hard to make birdie from that.   
 Q.  Do you think nerves or just never being in that position before had anything to do with it?  
DANNY LEE: To be honest, I'm nervous from when day one starts.  Always nervous, but it wasn't anything like different pressure or anything like that.  I just got off from the rough start.
