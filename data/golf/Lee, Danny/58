Q.   This morning, does that throw you off at all?   How do you kind of reset?
DANNY LEE:   No, actually it helped me this morning.   I had a very early tee time, 7:15, but we had a three‑hour delay, so I took a nap at the clubhouse.   That helped me a lot.   As you can see, I had a good round today.

DANNY LEE:   Surprisingly, it wasn't as wet as I thought.   I mean, obviously we were playing for lift, clean and place today, which helped me a little bit.   But it's still tough out there.   It's very windy, and the course is playing a little bit longer than usual because fairways are soft.   But greens are still firm, I think.   I don't know what any other players thought, but to me it was playing firm.   I think it's still‑‑ you have to play really good, solid golf to shoot under par here right now. 

Q.   You live in the area.   What's it like playing this week close to home, and does it help you in any way being‑‑

Q.   Do you feel like you have control of hitting into the greens?   You said they were firm.   Did you feel like you were able to‑‑
DANNY LEE:   I mean, I hit it‑‑ generally everything went very well today, off the tee and second shots, I feel really comfortable with it.   I made silly bogeys on the front nine, but it happens to everybody.
