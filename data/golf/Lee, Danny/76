   DANNY LEE: There were so many crowds out there, and now obviously Tiger is playing, so there were so many crowds. They were in the crowd yelling my name, and I think it was really good. I thought it was a really special thing. I really enjoyed this.  
  
  Q. Talk about how you played.   
 DANNY LEE: I played really good, too, so I really enjoyed it this week.  
  
  Q. There's a lot of talk that a Top 10 here would help you next week for the John Deere, not having to have a sponsor exemption. How aware were you that any of that was going on?   
 DANNY LEE: No, I didn't actually know that it doesn't count if I finish Top 10. But I just found out like five seconds ago, and I'm really pumped up I can play in another PGA event and I'm going to have some experience and play with all of the greatest players out there. I think it's going to be great.   
  
  Q. And finally, how much better, how much easier is it getting, now that you've done this a few times?   
 DANNY LEE: Well, I think this is going to be my first Top 10 finish. I'm not sure yet. But I think I said it to you before, like last six events, I was pushing myself way too hard. If I hit a bad shot I would get really mad at it. You know, all those kind of stuff, I think it's come out of the experience. And I played not as many as all those guys out there, but I've played more than five so I think I learned something. I think getting better at it, and I think I'm getting better at the course management, knowing how to set my mind. So those kind of stuff I think I'm really improving and it makes me play well.
