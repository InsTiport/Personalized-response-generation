DANNY LEE: Today I had a lot of missed shots off the tee, and I wasn't able to hit it close enough with the second shots to give me a birdie chance.  It's just weather like this, it's tough to play a perfect round of golf.
Q. Is there a certain pride and satisfaction of getting the job done and staying involved?
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be a really, really fun round tomorrow.  A lot can happen out there.  I'm not far from the leader.  Only three back I think.  Anything can happen tomorrow.
Q. Give us an example of how things changed.  When the rain came in, you must have had so many adjustments.
DANNY LEE: A lot of the afternoon guys today got it really, really tough.  Everybody is going through the same situation, so I can't really complain about it.
