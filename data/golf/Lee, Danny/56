 Q.  Do you want to talk about your round and what was going well out there for you?  DANNY LEE: Well, obviously I played great, shot 7-under, made seven birdies, no bogeys.  I was driving the ball very, very well after I changed my driver.  I actually gave it away, my driver, last week, and Callaway wasn't happy about it, and they tried to make the best driver for me, which they did, and I'm very happy with it. I shot 7-under.   Q.  Who did you give it to?  DANNY LEE: I gave it to one kid.  He was following me all day, so he was a die-hard fan for me.   Q.  Friday at the Travelers?  DANNY LEE: No, it was actually Sunday.   Q.  Sunday at the Travelers?  DANNY LEE: Friday can be a problem.   Q.  Do you think you'll ever do that again, give away your driver?  DANNY LEE: Not this one.  (Laughter.)   Q.  Can you talk about the conditions today before the weather and then after the weather, how challenging it was?  DANNY LEE: I haven't really looked at the morning weather, but I heard it was very calm and perfect conditions out there, but afternoon got a little bit rough with the rain and stuff, but it wasn't really windy, which was good for us.  Greens were getting softer and slower, which I can try to land the ball near the flag and just don't worry about hopping back over the green.  I did that very well today, and I got the good result.   Q.  Explain your save on No. 7.  DANNY LEE: Well, I pulled my tee shot a little bit in the left rough, and I caught a flier the second shot.  I took a nice drop from the cart path, and it was just an easy flop and made a two-footer.
