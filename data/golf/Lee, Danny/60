 Q.   Did you have a different mindset when you got to the back nine?  
DANNY LEE:   No, not really.   But I was having a problem with my back all week.   Always getting a lot of therapy work in.   And I took lots of Advil before I teed off.   But, kind of got to where it wore off, and my back was kind of fatigued, I guess.   
I hit some, a couple bad tee shots and then in the wrong areas there, but I know that it could have been a lot better, but I'm still happy with the way I played.  
   
 Q.   What were you thinking about in the midst of those seven birdies, you just had to be just playing golf?  
DANNY LEE:   Well, I think it's all about the momentum, I think.   Ken and Fred were such nice guys, they were just giving me more and more motivation and giving me a fist pump every time I make a birdie.   I think that little stuff definitely helps and keeps you going.   
   
 Q.   Well played this week.   Get some rest and good luck when you start in 2015?  
DANNY LEE:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   First, a brilliant start today, 29, 7â€‘under par on the front nine.   All of a sudden golf started happening on the back nine there on the back nine.   Disappointing week, I know, disappointing finish, but overall still a very good finish.   What are you going to take away from today and this week?  
DANNY LEE:   I'm not sure.   I'm not happy with the way I finished, but the back nine on this golf course is very tough and you kind of have to hit perfect golf shots to make birdies on the back nine and which I didn't.   
I think I was a little bit nervous and I was rushing myself.   I should have taken a little bit more time, but there's always next week and next year I'm looking forward to playing all of the events in 2015 next year.
