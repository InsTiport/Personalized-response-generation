A flash interview with:   
DANNY LEE   
 Q.  Very rock solid start.  You ought to be pretty happy with that.  
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I was hitting it really well out there, especially off the tee.  [Indiscernible.]  I was hitting it really nice off the tee and holed some putts.   
 Q.  How was it getting started today?  There was the frost, and you got off to a little slower start.  You had to stop, had a little start, you had to get going?  
DANNY LEE: Right.  It was really, really cold this morning.  I have never seen this place get this cold in the morning.  It was one of the coldest.  I guess it didn't really affect me that much.   
 Q.  Then looking forward to tomorrow, you had a pretty solid start today.  What can you build on tomorrow?  
DANNY LEE: I have been struggling with my iron game, have been putting my ball on the right side a lot since I was playing in windy conditions last week.  That doesn't help that much.   
Putting the ball more in the middle and trying to hit my irons a little bit higher.  I think it worked out perfectly today.   
 Q.  You found the right spot.  Good job.  
DANNY LEE: Thank you.
