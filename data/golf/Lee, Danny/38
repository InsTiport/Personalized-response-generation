 Q.  You got behind quickly but you stormed back and actually took the lead.  What was it like to be in such a seesaw match?  
DANNY LEE: A lot happened in the last 17 holes, won the match.  It was a rough start.  Just keep making mistakes and I keep playing the wrong shots on the first three holes.  It's pretty hard, the first 3-down after three holes.  Match-play, you don't want to be in that position.  I gave my best.  We had a good match.  It was a fun match.  But it's not playing easy out there.  Probably Dustin had a little bit of an advantage on the long par 5 and the par 4s.  It happens.
