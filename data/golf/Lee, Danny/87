   JOHN BUSH: We'd like to welcome Danny Lee into the interview room here at The Turning Stone Resort Championship. Thank you for coming by and spending a few minutes with us.   
 DANNY LEE: No problem.  
 JOHN BUSH: I think you played a practice round this morning. Can you comment on the golf course.   
 DANNY LEE: Obviously I played really well today, and I'm hitting it well and starting to putting it better. I have a good feeling about this tournament.  
 JOHN BUSH: How about the golf course, does it suit your eye?   
 DANNY LEE: Yeah, it has really wide fairways and nice greens, so it's great out there.  
 JOHN BUSH: Obviously you won the U.S. Amateur Championship at Pinehurst. Comment on what that experience was like for you.  
 DANNY LEE: It was just great. I mean, it was a long week and there was tough match plays going on. I played really well over there, so...  
 JOHN BUSH: And then you played the Wyndham Championship on the PGA Tour last month. I think you finished tied for 20th there. Some comments on your PGA Tour experience and what your plans are for the rest of this season.   
 DANNY LEE: At the Wyndham I think I found a fine group on the practice round. I played with Mr. Jerry Kelly and Mr. Yang, and they give me lots of advice. That really helped me a lot.   
 They understood me for like how I have to play golf safely, and that worked pretty good. I found my confidence from there. Yeah.   
 JOHN BUSH: And the rest of the season, are you expecting to get some more sponsor's exemptions to play?   
 DANNY LEE: Hopefully. And I definitely going to play Masters, U.S. Open.   
 JOHN BUSH: Right. Questions.   
  
  Q. You had a little bit of a shoulder issue in the U.S. Amateur. Are you still having problems with your shoulder? How is that going?   
 DANNY LEE: It's getting better. I still had some little problem with my left shoulder, but it's getting better.   
  
  Q. What are your future plans? You're going to stay amateur for next year for sure. When would you think about turning professional?   
 DANNY LEE: Probably after the U.S. Open.   
  
  Q. In 2009?  
 DANNY LEE: Uh-huh.   
  
  Q. And what did you learn most from playing in the PGA Tour event at the Wyndham Championship? Or shall I say did anything that you used playing there help you win the U.S. Amateur the next week?   
 DANNY LEE: Uh-huh, I mean, yeah, it did help me a lot. I think PGA and amateur, they're just so different and so many good -- great players out here. Yeah, I think there is the difference.   
  
  Q. There's a lot women from South Korea on the LPGA Tour and not a lot of Korean men on the PGA Tour. I'm wondering why you think that is? Any idea?  
 DANNY LEE: Oh, I'm not sure, but I believe in Korea there is many great man players over there. Someday they gonna come over and play well hopefully.   
  
  Q. How long have you been living in New Zealand?  
 DANNY LEE: About seven years.   
  
  Q. What are your expectations for this week?   
 DANNY LEE: Good question. I'm not just here for making the cut. Hopefully if I play well enough I can win this tournament. That's my goal for this tournament.   
  
  Q. Think you'll win?  
 DANNY LEE: Yeah.   
  
  Q. How would that make a difference? How would that change you if you were to win, change your plans?  
 DANNY LEE: No, it doesn't -- it's not going to change me. Every tournament I play, even the major tournaments, I'm coming over here to win the tournament, not just making the cut, so...  
  
  Q. How much would it mean if you did win?  
 DANNY LEE: I don't know. I will say something after I win the tournament.   
 JOHN BUSH: There you go. All right. We appreciate you coming by, and hope you play well this week in the tournament.   
 DANNY LEE: Thanks.
