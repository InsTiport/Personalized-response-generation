 Q.  Talk about today.  You start out slow with two bogeys but then you bounce right back.  What was the mindset after that slow start?  
DANNY LEE: My mindset was, ouch, that was a tough start, I wasn't expecting two bogeys in a row in the first two holes.  And making eagle on the first par-5 helped me a lot.  And that kind of gave me the momentum for getting back in it.  After that it just went smoothly.   
 Q.  You've been playing awfully well and of course Fabian was playing well, too.  Did you play off each other out there?  Because he didn't miss a green and hit a lot of fairways?  
DANNY LEE: Yeah, his ball striking was really good today.  He actually played a lot better, if he would have made a couple more putts, but I think we are both struggling a little on the greens.  It's early in the year, so.   
 Q.  Talk about the weekend now.  You're right there with a chance to win this things, don't you think?  
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I think I have a chance.  Five or six behind after the 18th hole, but the way that Jordan is going right now, it's looking pretty good.  He's really taking it on.   
 Q.  I didn't realize how popular you were.  There are a lot of people that want your autograph and get a picture.  
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I didn't know I was this popular either.   
 Q.  You are.  
DANNY LEE: I'm actually happy about that.   
 Q.  You should be.  You're playing well and you're getting your name out there, too.  Keep it going, Danny?  
DANNY LEE: Thank you.
