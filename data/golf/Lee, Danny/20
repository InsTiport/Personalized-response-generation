Q. How would you assess the way you've played across the course of this week?
DANNY LEE: Very good. I was very impressed with myself, how I played, even through the tough conditions the first couple rounds; the first round and the third round was a little bit difficult.  I hung in there and I hit a lot of good shots.  At the end, my putting kind of ran away from me a little bit.  I just kept making silly mistakes with putting.  But I guess I know what I have to work on.  It's good momentum for next week I think.
Q. So it could have been better, but presumably the game is in very good shape if you'd given yourself a chance like this.
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I mean, putting less wedge and putting strong 2-iron in there definitely helped me a lot this week.  I just need to work a little bit more on my putting I think.  I have a good chance to do something special.
Q. You did suggest at the start of the week that it was a learning experience, as well, so presumably you've learned something across the course of four days?
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I definitely learned a lot, especially the last seven holes, what my miss with my putting was.  I think I'm ready to go.
