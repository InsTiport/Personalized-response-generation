  Q. Talk about your week this week. Coming out, really tough golf course, tough conditions. And what will you take away your experience from this week?   
 DANNY LEE: Well, it's not really hard out there. I just played really awfully. And I had a problem with my iron shots today and yesterday. I pulled my irons and hit some balls in the water.  
 Hopefully, I've learned something, and there's always next week.  
  
  Q. Heading to Quail Hollow this week. What are some of the things that you take away from the experience part of it this week that you can take on to the rest of the year?   
 DANNY LEE: I think I've got to think about what I'm heading into. I think I've got to think about my second shots and my next shots, I mean. And I think I've got to learn more about course management and how to control my schedule before I tee off. Try not to get burned out before I play.   
 I've got to figure it out how I'm going to use my time before I tee off.  
  
  Q. Did you have the same sort of experience at Augusta?   
 DANNY LEE: Kind of. It's really a strong field out here this week. And there are so many good players playing well in this tournament.   
 And last week, obviously, it was a great event. Now these last two weeks I really enjoyed it. And it was something special.  
  
  Q. What's after Quail Hollow?  
 DANNY LEE: My next event is going to be Byron Nelson.
