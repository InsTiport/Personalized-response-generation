 Q.  1-under today.  Just a comment about your round, first of all.  
DANNY LEE: Well, I gave it a try, just my putting was very cold yesterday and today.  If I just make half of the chances that I had, I would be up there pretty good.  But I gave it a try, I guess.   
 Q.  Still, as the defending champion, you still gave it a great effort this week.  Talk a little bit about what that means to you to play well coming back.  
DANNY LEE: Well, if it was last year with my defending, I probably had no chance, I was kind of struggling with my game.  It's good that I had kind of a one-year skip and got to come back to this place a couple years later when my game was on point.   
And I gave it a heck of a try, I really enjoyed playing with Phil and Bubba the first two rounds and it was a great experience.   
 Q.  Talk a little bit about the rest of the season.  You've had a good season up to this point, but your goals as far as the FedExCup playoffs are on the horizon.  
DANNY LEE: Yeah, I think I made a couple FedExCup points again this year.  The last couple of months have been really good to me.  And it's almost the end of the season, so there's not many tournaments left.  I don't know if I'm going to get into the British Open or not yet, so I'll try to just focus on the little bit bigger tournaments coming up.
