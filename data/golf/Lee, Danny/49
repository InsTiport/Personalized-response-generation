 Q.  Danny, your round was going along very nicely, very steady until the 16th.  Can you tell us what happened?  DANNY LEE: It was kind of a tough fairway, and I took the aggressive line on the right fairway, wanted to make birdie coming in, and just pushed my 3-wood onto the right side.  It went out of bounds.  It was unfortunate.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  DANNY LEE: Yeah, I finished in a positive way, but still, it was a tough week for me.  I wasn't hitting my irons very good.  I think I've got to learn how to play from the firm fairways.  That's all I can say.   Q.  What are you going to take from this experience?  How is this going to help your golf?  DANNY LEE: I think it's going to definitely help me play a lot better on the links golf course, like U.S. Open this year at Chambers Bay, that was a links kind of golf course.  I just played horribly there.  Same stuff going on here.  I've just got to learn how to play out from the firmer fairways, I think.  Besides that, I think I did great.  I hit a bunch of good shots today.  I hit a couple of putts that didn't go in, but it happens, I guess.   Q.  What will your memories of St. Andrews be?  DANNY LEE: Just walking over that bridge on the 18th hole.  It's pretty special.
