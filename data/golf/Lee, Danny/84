 Q. You must be absolutely delighted with your play today.
 DANNY LEE: Yeah, very. It feels like I'm dreaming. I won a couple of amateur tournaments before, but it's a different feeling than that. This is a pro event, and all I wanted to do here is make the cut after two rounds and just play well and get into the top 20. That was my goal and today I played extremely well and I won. 

 Q. And you're playing in the U.S. master's this year, and after that, you'll turn pro?
 DANNY LEE: Yes. 

 Q. So you'll be looking forward to playing some events on the European tour after that?
 DANNY LEE: Yeah, there is lots of great European events out there, and I'd love to play in the European events and now I'm really looking forward to playing them.
