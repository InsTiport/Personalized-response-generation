 Q.  How was it out there?  
DANNY LEE: It was a good solid round today.  It was very windy out there.  It got really windy out there in the afternoon, and it wasn't anything like the morning guys' golf in the afternoon.  I managed to stay very patient out there, I had a lot of good shots, just greens are getting a little bit faster than yesterday, pin placements were on a lot of the two or three percent side slope, so even when I missed the birdie chance, I wasn't very disappointed, I was just happy to make par every hole.   
 Q.  You're the closest guy to Webb, but it's seven shots.  How do you approach tomorrow?  
DANNY LEE: Same, I think.  Just got to keep my hat down and play my own game and, I don't know, where is he at?   
 Q.  19-under.  
DANNY LEE: 19-under.  That's an impressive three rounds, I think.  It's going very, very well for him.   
 Q.  But the last guy who had the biggest lead after 54 holes didn't win the tournament, so that was six strokes.  You're only one more behind.  
DANNY LEE: Well, I'm not thinking about anything.  Like I said before, I'm going to just keep my hat down and play my game.   
 Q.  You mentioned yesterday that you were playing more aggressive golf yourself and you're trying to remain patient at the same time.  How difficult has that been, especially with the leaderboard being what it is?  
DANNY LEE: Today it was tougher because of the wind.  The scoreboard doesn't affect me at all, I'm just out here playing golf and seeing what I can get.  After the round, the score, that's all that matters.  But when I'm out there playing, I don't really care where I'm at and where the leader's at.  That is how I do it.   
 Q.  You're not aware of your game when you are on the golf course?  
DANNY LEE: I definitely know where I'm at, but I'm just saying that it's not going to affect me.
