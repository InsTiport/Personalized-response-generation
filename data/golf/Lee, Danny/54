 Q.  Danny, wonderful 67 today.  How would you assess your round and what may or may not be happening upcoming up in the next few minutes?  DANNY LEE: I mean, I played great.  I feel great.  I was a little bit disappointed that I left my putt short on the last hole, but I think I did very good.  I don't know, I don't even know what's going on actually.
