 Q.   Danny, 1‑over par today little tougher conditions too there toward the end.   Just tell me a little bit about your round?   
DANNY LEE:   Yeah, it's what I heard from other players is this is the tougher course, and I wasn't really hitting it as well as yesterday on the tough course under tougher conditions, and it makes my game much harder.   
But I made some good up‑and‑downs, and I holed some good putts.   I still see a lot of positive things in my game at the moment.   
Yeah, and the last three holes it just kind of rain and cold and just kind of made the holes a lot longer than what I played on the practice round and I was panicking a little bit.   
You know, I guess it's not that bad.   I shot 1‑over.   I see a lot of positive things in there, so...  
   
 Q.   Yeah, you're still in great shape with two rounds to go.   Going over to Monterey, the shorter course, did you play there earlier this week?   
DANNY LEE:   Yeah, so I played a practice round out there with Appleby and Matthew Gogan, and we had a good time up there.   It's a little bit easier than over here, so hopefully I'll play a little bit better and just focus on the one shot, I guess.
