 Q.   Danny, good round of golf out there.   Talk about how you felt.   
DANNY LEE:   Well, obviously the feel was pretty good.   I played really nicely.   It wasn't easy out there.   It was very windy, and there's some tough pin placements out there, but I played very smart today and I hit it where I wanted to hit it, and I rolled it really nicely with the putter.   It was a really good day for me.   
   
 Q.   You mentioned the wind; the wind is always a factor on this course.   How did you kind of deal with that?  
DANNY LEE:   Well, I'm kind of used to this wind now because Dallas is having a really cold, windy winter, and I should say spring, but I'm kind of used to playing in the wind right now.   
   
 Q.   Tell us a little bit about the course.   
DANNY LEE:   It's really‑‑ you can hit some bad tee shots, and if you hit it in the right area to miss it, you can still get away with it with the bad tee shots, but second shot is very critical out here.   You want to hit it in the right area to make your putts, or you want to miss it on the right side to make up‑and‑downs, otherwise there's impossible up‑and‑down areas out there.   You do not want to go there.   
   
 Q.   Puerto Rico, gorgeous paradise; how are you feeling here?  
DANNY LEE:   I am just enjoying staying here, and I just went out to a burger place just outside the resort.   I just loved it.   People were so nice there, and I'm just enjoying Puerto Rico right now.
