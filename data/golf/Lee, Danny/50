Q. Run me through your thoughts on your round.DANNY LEE: Well, it was a really tough day for me out there.  It got really windy at the end.  17 I hit a good drive, 3-wood, and I was still 50 short of the green.  It's the first time at St. Andrews, and it really showed me what it's like out here.  I got my ass whooped.Q. Talk about tomorrow and what you're expecting?DANNY LEE: I'm kind of expecting that my goal was kind of to shoot a lower score today so that I can hang onto it and play a little bit safer tomorrow, but I guess I have to play really good tomorrow.Q. Did you get a chance to enjoy the atmosphere in the home of golf?DANNY LEE: Not really.  I was just too busy hitting my ball.Q. (Inaudible.)DANNY LEE: Yeah, I don't mind the rain.  It's the same for everybody, so it's okay.Q. (Inaudible.)DANNY LEE: Not really.  I mean, it is British Open.  I always wanted to come over here and enjoy the experience.  It's been awesome.  It's not finished yet.  I've got another day tomorrow.Q. Have you had a chance to see Ryan out there at all?DANNY LEE: Yeah, I did, before the round.  We just said hello and ate breakfast together.  That was about it.  We were just too busy preparing for our first round.Q. Was it nice to see him?DANNY LEE: Yeah, it's definitely nice to see a fellow Kiwi who I played against in amateur golf when I was young, back home.  It was fun.
