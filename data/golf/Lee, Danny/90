   CRAIG SMITH: Danny, a quarterfinal win that again you made look pretty easy. You won three of the first four. Go into how it feels to be up early. You've done that quite often.   
 DANNY LEE: Nothing really special. I played pretty good.  
 CRAIG SMITH: The putter again.  
 DANNY LEE: My iron shots went really well and the putter as well.   
 CRAIG SMITH: Before you teed off this morning everyone was a little concerned, tell us about your left shoulder and the pain and what you did to overcome it before you even got to the first tee.   
 DANNY LEE: Before two hours I was hitting my drivers two hours before my tee time, I was hitting, practicing my driver. And on the back swing my left shoulder clicked somehow and just since then it's just, my left shoulder has been getting a little pain.   
 CRAIG SMITH: You iced it, you took some pain medication, did it give you any trouble once you got to the first tee?   
 DANNY LEE: Actually, first five holes I was a bit worried and it's sore, after five holes that medicine I took kicked in to my shoulder.   
 And I was playing a bit better, actually, I was playing a lot better, but.   
 CRAIG SMITH: Are you playing well enough to be confident for two more?   
 DANNY LEE: Yeah. All I have to do is play well tomorrow and I have to play well in the finals. I have play well in the finals.  
  
  Q. Was it Advil? They just give you some Advil?  
 DANNY LEE: Yes. I think that's the one.   
  
  Q. And did you do something?  
 DANNY LEE: A massage. Yeah. That felt good.   
 (Laughter.)  
 CRAIG SMITH: Just to give you the background, Pinehurst got a massage therapist over here, and he had 800 milligrams of Advil, plus ice packs.   
  
  Q. How does it feel now?  
 DANNY LEE: Dizzy. My head is spinning.  
  
  Q. No, as far as your shoulder?  
 DANNY LEE: It's all right. It's, I can't really feel the pain at the moment. Which is good.   
 CRAIG SMITH: Oddly enough you started to give a few holes back, not that you gave them back, but he won a couple on the back side. Was he winning them or were you getting tired?   
 DANNY LEE: He was actually wining them. And Morgan, he's a really good player, and I played with him at the Western before. I knew he was a good player and that he was going to come back and it's not that easy to play match play with him, so, yeah.   
 CRAIG SMITH: You didn't face him along the way in one of your matches at the Western Am, did you?   
 DANNY LEE: I did.  
 CRAIG SMITH: You did? And do you remember that score.  
 DANNY LEE: I beat him 4 & 2.   
 CRAIG SMITH: And what round?   
 DANNY LEE: Quarterfinals.   
 CRAIG SMITH: So he was looking for a rematch and a change of decision, I guess.   
 DANNY LEE: It's bad.   
  
  Q. If you ever have to get to the last three holes are you going to know how to play them? You haven't seen them in a week.   
 DANNY LEE: Maybe just got to keep playing well and don't play those holes.   
 (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. Where are you playing Monday, that's what I want to know? You're not going to take a day off, are you?  
 DANNY LEE: Actually it's a good thing that we only play 18 holes today and I guess that I got some time to rest, so that's good.   
 CRAIG SMITH: After playing what is this 12 days in a row? This must feel like a day off.   
 DANNY LEE: Not really.   
 (Laughter.)
