Q. How hard is that 18th hole?
DANNY LEE: When you stand on the tee box, you have to hit this fairway, otherwise it's going to be a three-shotter from par-4, which for professional guys is very depressing.
Q. You broke through that at Greenbrier this year, and ever since you've been playing fantastic golf, what's been the key?
DANNY LEE: Probably the confidence.  I'm able to freewheel it out there.  I know my game's there and just a lot of freewheeling.
