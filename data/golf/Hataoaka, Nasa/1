Q. You had a very good round today, you're 3-under.  What are the highlights of your round?
NASA HATAOAKA: The good thing is that I didn't hit a bogey today.  That's the best for today.
Q. You obviously scored well and the course is playing quite hard.  What was the secret to your good scoring?  Maybe talk a little about the birdies.
NASA HATAOAKA: I didn't really aim at the pins.  I tried to hit the front of the greens and just be careful, because the ground is firm.  So just not to be too aggressive, stay calm.
