Q. How was it out there today for you?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Good.  I hit the ball really well and I putted -- thought I putted well.  Like I had a lot of chances on the front nine and didn't really make any of them except for a couple.
But thought if I just stayed patient they would drop, and they did.
Q. Feel good to put yourself if a position where you're close to the top of the leaderboard heading into the final round?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  I hadn't really done that all this year and kind of missed it.  I think it's a lot fun playing, contending and stuff.  So I'm excited to play tomorrow.
Q. And you and your caddie look like you guys have a lot of fun out there.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.
Q. How does she help you?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: She's great.  She keeps me relaxed and is really good at her job.  I feel like there is a lot of stress taken off that.  I don't have to worry about numbers or wind or anything because she's really good at that.
I think it takes a lot of stress off my game, and all have to do is hit the shot.
Q. How long have you been working together?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Since Evian.
Q. Last year?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: This year.
Q. This year?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.
Q. That was the first one?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, uh-huh.
Q. Got you.  What do you think is the best part of your game right now?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I'm hitting the ball really well.  If I think if I keep doing that tomorrow and just give myself good looks at birdies, I think they'll start to fall.
Q. Have people been watching you back home?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I think so, yeah.  My dad has been staying up and watching the rounds.
Q. Really?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  I'm like, Dad, just sleep.  They replay them.  No.  He likes to stay up and watch the rounds, so I know he's up.
