Q: Last year, you were part of that massive group that finished second. What are your thoughts as you come back here? Since that event, you'd really kicked your game into a new gear.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I like this golf course. Obviously I played well. The greens are pretty complicated. They have a lot of slope to them. Your approach shots, you have to hit them into the right sections of the green. Then I think you can score really well. I think it really rewards good shots and then if you hit it all over the place, you're going to have a really tough time making par. I think that it rewards good iron play and if you make putts on top of that, you'll shoot some good numbers.
Q: You're someone who is known out here for your good short game. So maybe this is a course that sets up well for you in that instance.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It definitely did last year, so I'm hoping it's the same way this year.
Q: You've come really close a couple of times lately. What do you think it's going to take to take that next step and get a win?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I have no idea. I just hope that if I keep putting myself in contention that eventually odds are I'll get one. I guess I just have to keep the gas pedal down on Sunday and not let up.
Q: It's got to be frustrating to get so close, but you have to know that you have it in you.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: In Texas was the first time I felt really frustrated because I felt like that was the closest I've come. But you know, it's all part of it. It's a good feeling to be in that position. I'd much rather it be that way than the other way. I'm happy where my game is at.
