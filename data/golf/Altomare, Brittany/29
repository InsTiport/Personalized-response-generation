 Q.  You had a great round today.  Tell us how you're feeling walking off the golf course?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I mean, I feel pretty good.  I struggled a little bit on the front there, but I played really well on the back.  The crowds here are amazing, and I know they were cheering for Brooke the whole way, but I really felt welcomed and feeding off the crowd was really fun.   
 Q.  Is it tough to stay focused with all these big crowds?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Not really.  I just thought it was a lot of fun.  This is the biggest crowd I've ever played in front of, and I just think it's a really good experience.  I had a lot of fun.   
 Q.  You had a nice stretch in there where you were draining putts from all over it seemed like.  What was the key for you on the day?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I was hitting it pretty well.  I just think I was trying to think of speed.  These greens are so fast, and it's really easy for the putts to get away from you.  I just think I was picking the right speed with the line I was picking.   
 Q.  Did you expect the circus that was out there?  Were you sort of ready for it or did it catch you by surprise?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: No, I think I was ready for it.  I saw Brooke play in her Pro-Am on Wednesday, and there was a big crowd.  So I mean, it's Saturday, so I just expected a pretty big crowd today.  But not as big as this.   
 Q.  When you saw that you were paired with Brooke, what did you think?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I was excited, because I've played with Brooke a few times this year, and she's just a great person.  Really fun to be out there with, so, yeah.
