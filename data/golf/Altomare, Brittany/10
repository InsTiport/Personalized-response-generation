 Q.  The Europeans were 4-up through 12 holes and here you're standing on the 18, after a brilliant fight-back, Brittany, sum up how you're feeling.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Really excited, really happy. We fought really hard today, especially on the last couple holes.   
 Q.  Did you feel comfortable out there with Nelly by your side?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yes. She's a great player. She's obviously won. And I'm comfortable with her. She hit an amazing shot on 17, in the hole.   
 Q.  Exactly. What a shot that was, Nelly. Can you tell me what you were thinking about on the tee there?  
NELLY KORDA: I just had to get it close. I know we were dormie; we were dormie on 16. And we had to birdie our way in, or win every hole to even have a chance at a half. So all I was trying to do was hit it close.   
 Q.  It's been a really successful day for you. Tonight, what will you do to try and recover and go again tomorrow?  
NELLY KORDA: I'm going to take a warm bath. I'm freezing right now.   
 Q.  What about that putt on 18?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It was exciting. But, like I said, we had two chances. And I just knew I had to be aggressive because if I missed it, she was going to make it.   
 Q.  This must be a big lift for the United States team?  
NELLY KORDA: I'm sure, yeah. Even Lexi and Jess, they won on 18 to halve the match. For all of us to fight our way back is definitely a big momentum boost.   
 Q.  You had a great day?  
NELLY KORDA: Yeah, we all had a great day, I think.   
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Of course. But we're tired.
