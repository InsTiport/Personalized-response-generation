 Q.  What was working well out there?  That was a good start.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I hit the ball really well.  I think.  We were just trying to focus on our landing areas and I was hitting them pretty well.  Then I just gave myself a lot of opportunities.  But I also made two pretty long putts, so that helped a lot.   
 Q.  What holes were those on?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: They were on the front nine.   
 Q.  Did you birdie three in a row on the front nine coming in?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I birdied 3, 4, and 5.  So 4 and 5.  No, was 5 the par 3?  The first par 3 on the front, I made like a really long one.  I think that's 5.  I made a really long putt, it was like 60 feet maybe.   
 Q.  Wow, that must have given you some confidence for the rest of the round?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I was just hitting it well, and then the putts dropped today, so it was good.   
 Q.  I want to ask about your experience at Evian and how that maybe has changed your outlook on majors or maybe given you some confidence here to start out with a good round?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it's definitely given me some confidence being under pressure like that.  It's fun, I think, being in those situations whereas before I used to get really nervous and not play very well.  But now I think a different attitude and being more excited about being in the position, and just embracing it is kind of how I felt.   
 Q.  Do you think this is a golf course where you could breakthrough?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I think so.  I really like it.  I think you have to drive it really straight, and accuracy off the tee is probably one of my strong suits.  You definitely have to putt it really well, and I think those two parts of my game are probably my strongest, so it should fit my game pretty well.
