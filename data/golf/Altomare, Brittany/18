Q. A round without anywhere bogeys is good, but how about a round with six birdies.  That was fabulous.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I mean, it was a lot fun.  I was hitting the ball really well.  I made some tap-ins for birdie and some long putts for birdie.  It was good.  It was fun.
Q. A massive putt on the 9th.  That must have felt very good.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it was great to see that go in.  I hit my lay up in rough and thought I hit a pretty good third shot.  Just didn't quite get over that ridge.  Then to make the putt was pretty fun.
Q. Also very classy with the irons as well on the 14th.  It was just getting better and better, your approach to the green.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it is great.  Like you said, the greens, they're very big and they have a lot of contour to them.  To be able to use the contours of the green kind of helps, yeah.
Q. How difficult is it in some way with the greens being so big to be able to focus on the flag?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: You just really have to hit it in the right section on these greens to have good birdie putts, otherwise you're just going to have like 50 footers all day.
Q. We spoke before about AimPoint.  Explain why that's been so beneficial to you.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I just think it's really helped me to feel how much slope there is on the green and to be able to hit the putt on the correct line with the correct speed I just think it's really helped.  My eyes aren't very good.  Just looking at the putt it's very hard for me to see it, and the AimPoint has taken my eyes out of it and used feel.
Q. Enjoying your time in Shanghai?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  We went to the city on Monday.  It's beautiful.  That Skyline on the Bund is really pretty.
