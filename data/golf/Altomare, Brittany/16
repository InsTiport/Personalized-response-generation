 Q.  For us it looked pretty good, minus 6 on the day.  How was it for you out there?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It was good.  I mean, I really hit the ball well today.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities.  Missed some short ones, but made some longer putts, too.  I think it all evened out.   
 Q.  How do you feel the course is playing?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Good.  I mean, the rough is thick so you just have to hit it in the fairway.  I think if you hit in the fairway you can give yourself a lot of opportunities and that's what I did today.   
 Q.  Runner-up here in 2017.  Bit unfinished business for you?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I think so.  I like it here.  I love playing here, the views and the golf course, so I'm excited to be here.   
 Q.  And amazing round of course, but anything you feel you need to work on before you head out tomorrow?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Probably just do some putting.  I think that's about it.   
 Q.  65, 6-under here at the Evian Resort Golf Course.  You hit 12 of 13 fairways today.  What kept you so consistent off the tee?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I just worked a lot on my ball striking for the beginning of the week, and I just think it really paid off.  I know at this golf course you have to hit fairways because lies are really goofy; the rough is super thick.   
 Q.  And finding the fairway so consistently led to nine birdies today.  What is it like to birdie every other hole on the course?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It was pretty fun.  I hit it really well today.  Hit some close and I made some longer putts, so that was good.   
 Q.  And the par-3s out here are some of the longer holes on the course.  You were 3-under on the par-3s today.  What worked for you on those?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, like I said, I think I hit some close so that was really nice.  The par-3s are tough, here so to be under par on the par-3s was really nice.   
 Q.  What's it like to play a round where you're hitting it close that consistently?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It's fun.  I don't know any other way to describe it.  It's a lot of fun.
