THE MODERATOR: Okay, (indiscernible) of hole in one is right here. Congratulations.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Thank you.
THE MODERATOR: Before we open the floor, would you let us know what happened and what was going through your mind before you hit that miraculous shot.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I just came off a couple holes that didn't really go my way and I felt good about the club that I had; made a really good swing finally, and went right where I wanted to and went in the hole.
But I didn't see it, so...
THE MODERATOR: Didn't see it?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Open the floor.
Q. (Through translation.) How many times have you run into this situation of a hole in one? Secondly, when did you that, did you get any rewards? Thirdly, this time you're going to have a car. As far as I know it's a beautiful car. What do you make of it?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, this is my seventh hole in one. None of them have ever won me anything. A lot of them came when I was an amateur. This is my first on the LPGA and my first time winning anything, so it's pretty cool. (Laughter.)
Q. (Through translation.) We know that you did very well last year finishing as one of runners up. Would you consider this place a lucky spot?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I have some really good vibes here. I really like the golf course. I think that you have -- the greens are very complicated. I think you have to hit the ball in the correct spot on the greens to have opportunities. If you don't do that, then you can get into a lot of trouble.
So I think my iron play and putting has been two of my strengths this year, so I think this golf course sets up pretty well, like it did last year.
Q. (Through translation.) As you mentioned in the past, you ran into situations of hole in one on at least seven occasions, however didn't get any -- six occasions; this is the seventh, right? So you didn't get any reward. This time you have a car ready to be given to you. Tonight any celebration planned at all?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Probably Sunday after the tournament I think would probably be a good time to celebrate, when it's all over. Yeah, I don't have any plans right now. Hopefully go out with some girls and have some fun. It'll be an expensive night for me I'm sure.
THE MODERATOR: Dinner did you say tonight?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Oh, Sunday.
THE MODERATOR: As a tradition you're going to have to share champagne with the media, right? (Applause.) I guess best of luck. Any more to add from your side, Brittany?
Maybe I'll ask one more question to conclude. You still have three more days to go. What do you make of it?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Just hopefully I have more luck like that on my side this week. Hopefully we can pull out a win.
