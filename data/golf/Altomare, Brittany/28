 Q.  6-under par today.  What was working well for you on the course?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I started hitting my irons really well, which I kind of struggled with last week and the beginning of this week, which gave me more opportunities to make birdies.   
I knew I was putting well, so I just really needed to give myself some opportunities.  I did that today.   
 Q.  How was the course playing this afternoon compared to Thursday and Friday?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Well, Thursday I played in the morning, so it was a lot softer; the last two days I've played in the afternoon and the greens have really firmed up a lot.   
You really have to know like where to bounce it, because it's definitely going to roll out and release.   
 Q.  You had three birdies in a row on the back nine.  What were those like?  Was there any particularly long putts or anything?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, my third birdie on the par-3, I hit it above the hole probably to like 35 feet, and, I mean, it barely like just went in.   
It was kind of cool because you want to make those, but you don't really expect to.  When I they go in it's just really exciting.   
 Q.  So you got to 11-under par total for the tournament heading into the final day.  How do you feel about that?  Anything different you'll do tomorrow?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I don't think I'll do anything different.  I feel good, and I'm excited to be in this position.  Hopefully I can capitalize on it tomorrow.   
 Q.  I think last year you finished in the top 20.  Do you think this is a place where you could set yourself up for a really good finish or a win?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I think so.  I really like this golf course.  I loved it last year.  I mean, I still love it this year.  Just I don't know what this is about it.  I really enjoy playing here.   
I think my game really suits it.
