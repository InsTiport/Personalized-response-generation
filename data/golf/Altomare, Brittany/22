Q. 6-under in your last 12 holes, I think.  Tell me about your round today and what you did well.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  I've really been hitting it well, like last week and today, and I've just been capitalizing on my putts.  I've really just tried to go with my first instincts and trust myself, and I think earlier in the year I just wasn't doing that.  I was kind of second-guessing myself, and I just told myself these last couple weeks, just go with your gut, trust yourself and play confidently.
Q. Is that a difference do you think, just mental, or is there something else that you've been working on?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I mean, I worked a lot with my coach after the U.S. Open, and we worked on some things, but mainly just getting some confidence back in my game.  It's nice to see him, too, because I think with your coach you obviously get confidence and stuff, so it was good.
Q. What's your coach's name?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Justin Sheehan.
Q. And you work mostly with him where?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: In Tampa.  He comes out every once in a while, and I work with Mark Sweeney, who's the AimPoint guy with putting, so they're my two coaches.
Q. Do you only see them when you're back home or back in Tampa, or do they ever come out --
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: No, they come out -- they were both at the U.S. Open, they were both at ANA.  Justin came out at Meijer for a few days.
Q. And your dad is out here?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, he's here this week.
Q. How often does your dad come out?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Just a few a year.  More so this year, I think.
Q. Just having had those good finishes at majors, does that make you more comfortable?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I just think being in that position, you just get some confidence that you can compete at the highest level at a major championship, and I just -- I realize that I enjoy being in this position, so hopefully I can get myself there on Sunday.
Q. What's your strategy on this golf course?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Like I said, just be confident in my decisions and my golf swing and I think just confidence is a big thing, especially at majors, and just trusting yourself.
Q. What do you think you did best in your round today?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I think it was just a combination of ball-striking and putting.  I didn't miss many greens, and I made a good amount of putts.
