 Q.  Not only your first top 10 on the LPGA, but your first Top 5.  How does it feel?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Great.  Yeah, I mean, I'm just really excited.  I played well all week, so I'm just really happy.   
 Q.  Did you feel like this was kind of coming for a while now?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I had had a few good tournaments where I was playing well, but like didn't quite capitalize on one round which kept me out of the top 10 by like a shot or two.   
That's kind of how I've always saw it, was just like one round or one shot or something.   
It was nice to string together four good rounds.   
 Q.  What does this do or your confidence moving forward and to the rest of the season?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I mean, it's pretty good.  We have a major coming up soon, so I think it's just -- I mean, makes me more confident heading into to big tournaments coming up.   
 Q.  How was course playing today?  I heard 18 specifically was tough.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  I mean, didn't help because I hooked it into the trees and it came out.  I had about 210 to the front, so it played a little harder for me than normal, but I came out with a pretty good par, so I was happy with that.
