 Q.  Thoughts as you just hug all your family and get a point for U.S.A.?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: That was my goal was just to get a point. And Juli said last night, you get up, you don't get comfortable. And that's what I tried to do today, just not feel comfortable and kept going.   
 Q.  You got off to a fast start and you kind of just never let up. What about your match today with Jodi?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: She's a great player, and I knew I was going to have to make a lot of birdies to beat her, and that's what I did.   
 Q.  Your Solheim Cup experience so far, just being a rookie out here?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: It was more than what I thought it was going to be like -- just the team bond and the friendships that you build with these girls. And just being part of a team, I mean, it's just been great.   
 Q.  What did Juli say to the team last night, tied going into Sunday singles? And did she give you a pep talk this morning before you went out?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Not really. She just said play your games; you've been playing great all year, just keep doing what you're doing and you should be fine.   
 Q.  What have you learned about yourself maybe through this experience and taking on the pressure and coming through with a win?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I just -- I guess it's just a huge confidence boost. To play like I did under pressure was really nice to see and hopefully that translates into a regular tournament.
