Q. 4-under today on a Sunday.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.
Q. What went well out there?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I hit the ball really well today. I gave myself a lot of chances, which really helped.
I left a lot just dead center in the middle of the cup which is frustrating, but still feel like I played really well.
Q. What's this week been like overall just knowing, Solheim Cup kind of on the mind?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, it's been a little more stressful than normal, but I just knew I had to play well. I felt like I've been doing that all year, so I figured if I just keep doing what I'm doing it'll just take care of itself.
Q. How relieved do you feel now?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Really relieved. It's like a weight has been lift off my shoulders.
Q. You played alongside Lexi, future teammate.
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.
Q. What was that like today? Did you talk Solheim at all?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: No, we didn't talk about Solheim. I asked her mostly about her dog. No, we just chatted a little bit, but we were both competing so we didn't chat too much.
Q. And what are you looking forward to in the coming weeks with Solheim Cup coming up?
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Just being part of Team USA and representing the United States. I think it's going be super and, I get to have Juli as my captain which is going to be super fun. I'm excited.
