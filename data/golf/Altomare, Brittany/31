 Q.  Feel good to sink that last putt on 18?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.   
 Q.  Was that kind of the story of the day for you putting?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, I made a lot putts, but I also hit some close shots.  I mean, I had a lot of putts that were pretty -- I mean, I had a lot of shots I hit really close, so it was kind of a mixture of both.  So, yeah.   
 Q.  Finished up this morning.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I did.   
 Q.  Was that a little awkward?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  I mean, I've done it before, but it's a little kind of awkward and slightly annoying, but it is what it is.  I mean, couldn't control the weather.  That was crazy that storm came through.  I mean, that rain was torrential.   
And then we were actually on 18 when it happened, and we looked up and we didn't see the group ahead of us.  I as like, There is no way that they finished that hole already, and then we looked and there was like a river going down.  I think we're going to wait.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, on 18 green.  But they got it cleaned up pretty quickly so it was nice.   
 Q.  In a way did playing that first hole today kind of rolled into your second round after that?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Sorry?   
 Q.  Playing that hole this morning kind of roll into what you were able to do in the second round?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, that was our ninth hole, so I actually ended up starting back up on 8 green.  Yeah, I had a short little warmup, kind of played the two holes, and then short warmup again.  Had some breakfast.  Yeah, I mean, I guess it was a little warmup to today's round.   
 Q.  How long in between when you finished the first and started, do you think?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I think we got inside to eat breakfast a little before 8:00 and I tee'd off at 9:00.  Had a little bit of time.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Well, actually it was really calm this morning, like super calm, almost no wind.  Then the wind started picking up later like towards the end the round, which was kind of weird, because yesterday -- I know I was last off, but there was hardly any wind yesterday afternoon.  It was a little different than yesterday and this morning.   
 Q.  How long have you been doing your putting routine?  I forget what it's called.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: AimPoint.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: So I've been working with Mark, this is probably my sixth year of working with him.  I started working with him in college.   
 Q.  Okay.  So been in the whole time?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah.  It's helped my putting tremendously.  I mean, before I wasn't very good.   
 Q.  And you switched to it in college?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, my junior year.  I think it gave my a lot of confidence, because I was always unsure of myself on the greens, and now I just feel more an confident and I feel like I'm hitting my lines and stuff.   
 Q.  Kind of methodical, right, like you?  You know where you're hitting ball every time based on the system.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Yeah, and it's pretty quick and you get your line and you just are confident in it because you've trained it.  Using your eyes, your eyes can trick you sometimes, especially with a bunch of slopes and stuff.   
I just think it's really simplified putting for me and I think it's helped a lot.
