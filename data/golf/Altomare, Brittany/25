 Q.  An awesome round 68.  You made it in before the rain, so we'll talk quick.  Tell me how you feel coming off the golf course.  Right now you have a share of the lead.  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: Really great.  My putter is working.  I'm hitting it decent.  It's just really nice to see everything clicking.   
 Q.  We're back here in the rain; had the sun come out for a couple hours this afternoon.  You said this is your first time here in Taiwan.  What's the big takeaway for you as you go through this Asian Swing?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I haven't played all the golf courses.  Last year I only played Beijing and Blue Bay.  So I'm just kind of like seeing the golf courses and just trying to keep the play that I've had going and staying positive through this weather.   
 Q.  You talk about the play; you've really clicked into gear since the Cambia Portland classic.  We all know that playoff with Anna Nordqvist at Evian.  What's gotten into you over the last couple weeks?  
BRITTANY ALTOMARE: I think I've just felt more and more comfortable out here.  My caddie throughout the year, Dewi, I think she helped me stay confident and be comfortable in those positions, whereas last year, I didn't feel so confident and comfortable.  I think now with two good experiences under my belt, I can hopefully do something this weekend.
