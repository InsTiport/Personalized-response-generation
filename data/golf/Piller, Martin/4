Q. It seems like maybe it took you a little while to get it going and then midway through your front nine kind of started making some birdies and feeling better.
MARTIN PILLER: Yeah, really that second shot on 5, par-5 is kind of what kick started it.  I had a 3-wood and I probably had like 240 something to the hole, 245 or something, and I hit one of the best 3-woods I've hit in a while.  It was just right at the flag and easy 2-putt birdie.  That really was, that really kind of got me going and I was able to make a couple more birdies from there on in.  But really that second shot on 5 was, that kind of jump started my round.
Q. Got to feel pretty good about where you are going into the weekend, I know this is an unusual tournament with the cut after the third round, but you're one shot off the lead, how do you approach tomorrow, knowing that you're over at La Quinta?
MARTIN PILLER: Yeah, I just have to try to play the best I can, really, at La Quinta, I know it's cliche, but that's a different golf course, so I've got to kind of adjust and make sure I've got the right things going for that golf course.  But different course, so just get my mind right for La Quinta and then hopefully be in really good position going back out here on Sunday.
Q. Does it help knowing that you played really well out here today on the Stadium Course knowing that more than likely you'll be out here Sunday?
MARTIN PILLER: Yeah, I've played the Stadium Course a bunch throughout the years.  I played Q-Schools here, I've always felt like I've always played pretty well on the Stadium Course.  It's a tough course, but I always play it really well.  So I kind of rely on past Q-Schools and playing here a few years ago as well, I kind of relied on those good memories, good shots that I hit to kind of give me a lot of confidence for that.
