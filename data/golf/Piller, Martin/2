Q. You were 2-under today, finished two shots out of the playoff, probably not the finish you were looking for, but how would you assess your play overall today?
MARTIN PILLER: Today it was pretty good, pretty good, I would just give it a B.  My short game wasn't -- I felt like I hit the ball pretty good, but my short game wasn't what it normally is and maybe I was a little tentative at times, but overall pretty good.  Just not enough.  Just needed a couple extra shots, obviously.
Q. You said you were tentative today, but you made a lot of birdies this week.  Was that an adjustment you made coming into today?
MARTIN PILLER: No, I still made a lot of birdies, I just didn't make enough.  So Jon and Andrew played great, so they set the bar pretty high, so but, yeah, no adjustments, just a few putts here and there.
Q. What can you take from this performance this week moving on for the rest of this season?
MARTIN PILLER: I'll probably just take playing in a final group on Sunday, I've never done that on the PGA TOUR.  And I played pretty good, I didn't throw up on myself or do anything crazy, so I would say I'll take away playing in final group and playing pretty solid.
