Q. Tell me a little bit about your play today.
AMY OLSON:   You know, I struggled a little bit off the tee.  Got out of position a couple times.
But overall I played solid.  I had a bogey early, couple bogeys early, but some birdies as well, which is a little more eventful I think that yesterday.
Overall I'm pleased with it.  I still putted really well, and other than a kind of double coming in, I played really solid.
Q. How do you prepare for the next two days after this?
AMY OLSON:   Yeah, I mean, hoping to hit a few shots, few drives on the range, but I don't know if the weather is going to allow that.
Otherwise just kind of rest.  The U.S. Open is such an exhausting week mentally and physically, so trying to get as much rest as possible.
