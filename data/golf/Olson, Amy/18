Q. Tough start to the day.  I think you started with a birdie and then two bogeys?
AMY OLSON: I had two bogeys.  I had a bogey on 3.  Missed the green right, which is the side you really can't miss on to that pin, and I didn't get -- because I was short-sided I just hit a shot that didn't quite get up the hill and rolled all the way back to my heat and obviously had a harder shot coming up.  Made an up-and-down for bogey.
Went for the green on 5 and hit a really good hybrid and honestly it was a foot off carrying the number that I needed.  And so that was kind of disappointing to start that because obviously you can gain a shot on the field there.
But you know, I bounced back really well.  I stayed in it and just never gave up, and fortunately, you know, some birdies came kind of on the back nine.  Made some solid par putts coming in because that finishing stretch is not easy.  So I'm really pleased with how I played.
Q. You made some great putts at the end.
AMY OLSON: You know, Thursday I made great putts and hit it terrible.  The rest of the week I hit it pretty well and just wasn't putting well.
Then I kind of figured out, I think kind of what I was doing yesterday afternoon.  Anyway, I was rolling the putts a lot better today.
Q. All in all, it's the fourth tournament I think for you of the year and it's actually a pretty strong start to the year.  You must be in general --
AMY OLSON: Yeah, very pleased.  You start the year, and it's good to start with and get some momentum going into the season.  I had a Top-10 in Australia.  I had two really good rounds in Thailand, and whatever this ends up being, so very pleased with it.
