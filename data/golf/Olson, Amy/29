 Q.  You say you like major championship pressure.  Why, and can you describe that feeling?  
AMY OLSON: Well, I think the biggest thing that I like about major championships is how it forces you to bring your best game.  You can't really fake it.  You can't get away with poor shots.   
So I love that.  Obviously the atmosphere is a lot of fun.  When you're playing well, you just feed off it.   
 Q.  Were you nervous today?  
AMY OLSON: I was a little bit on the first tee.  I really enjoyed that.  That means I care, right?   
So it was fun to just start solid and have a birdie on the 1st hole.  I don't think nerves are a bad thing.   
 Q.  Were you nervous coming down the stretch?  
AMY OLSON: No, not at all.  Not at all.  I have no idea where I am.   
 Q.  You might feel nervous tomorrow.  
AMY OLSON: Oh, I'm sure I will.  Yeah, and I think once again that's a really good thing.  You just have to channel it and keep your focus and not let yourself get ahead.   
 Q.  Does it take some of the pressure off having a little cushion heading into tomorrow?  
AMY OLSON: I guess so.  Sure.   
 Q.  You're not a board watcher typically.  
AMY OLSON: Right.   
 Q.  Is there a point where you would say, You know what?  I really need to know where I stand?  
AMY OLSON: I don't think so.  It doesn't really affect the shot that you're going to hit.  You're obviously just going to try to play the best shot you can in every situation, and I don't think the scoreboard should affect that.   
 Q.  What have you been saying to yourself over the last couple years as you've worked towards this moment?  
AMY OLSON: I mean, honestly just staying patient and recognizing that if my moment is going to come it'll come; if it doesn't, I'll be okay.   
I'm very content with my life and where I am.  Obviously winning adds greatly to it, but not as much as most people would think.   
 Q.  What's it like having your brother on the bag?  How is it different to when he's not there?  
AMY OLSON: It's a lot of fun.  We have a really special relationship going back a very long time.  Most of my golf memories do involve him, so it's a lot fun having him on the bag.   
I have a great caddie as well who caddied in the first major who will be back in Asia.  I really enjoy having them both.  Having a sibling be part of it is really special.   
 Q.  I want to know how your game this week compares to how your game was at ANA.  
AMY OLSON: I would say -- oh, that's a really good question.  I would say actually I was driving the ball better during ANA, but I'm putting a lot better this week.   
Otherwise, very comparable.  I would say the big thing is it's just been very consistent.  I haven't seen a lot of big misses or anything that you have to worry about.   
That was the same at ANA.   
 Q.  Most important lesson you took from the final round there?  
AMY OLSON: Watching Pernilla, I think she bogeyed the first hole and she stayed in it.  She stayed patient and some birdie putts fell, but she didn't try to force anything and didn't beat herself up over a lost shot.   
Watching that really inspired me.  I think at some point you're going to face adversity out there, and how you respond is the most important thing.   
 Q.  How did you like playing with Mo?  
AMY OLSON: Oh, so much fun.  We talked the whole time.  It was a lot of fun.
