Q. 68 all three rounds. How did you maintain consistently throughout the three days?
AMY OLSON: You know, it's so funny how golf is. I putted and chipped really well the first day and didn't strike it as well and my ball-striking is kind of coming back.
I rolled so many on the edge today. I mean, it could have literally been 10-under easily. You know what? It's really nice to have a round that you feel like was just really solid. I think tomorrow maybe the putts will fall.
Q. Right on. Have you been able to keep the Solheim Cup out of your head through the weekend?
AMY OLSON: Until everybody asks me about it, yes.
Q. Okay. How exciting will it be knowing you are likely or in a position to secure a spot?
AMY OLSON: I honestly don't even don't know what I have to do to secure it. The Rolex Rankings are really confusing to me. If I play good golf I just figure everything else will take care of itself.
Q. What was the experience like out there today? It was a good round for you.
AMY OLSON: Yeah, it was solid. I wish it could have been a little bit lower. I had so many lip out or just on the edge. I'm thankful for the ones that did go in. It was fun playing with Brooke behind us because we just heard cheer after cheer. We were joking because we were like, Did she just hole-out? No, she probably just hit the green. (Laughter.)
I mean, everybody is so supportive of her, and that energy is really fun to be around.
Q. This atmosphere is contagious.
AMY OLSON: Yeah, it really is. I love how everybody just comes out to support women's golf and they're just excited to be here, which makes you excited to be here.
