 Q.  4-under opening round today. Solid start. Happy with the way you played?  
AMY OLSON: Yeah. You know, it's funny. Traditionally ball striking is kind of my go-to. I was a little bit off on that today.   
But I putted and chipped really well. When I gave myself opportunities I kind of took advantage. If I can kind of up the ball striking for the rest of the week, we'll be in good shape.   
 Q.  Is that something you would work on today? Tonight after a round?  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, there are a couple things. I'll probably just go make some adjustments. But for the most part, when you have the late/early it's mostly about getting the most rest.   
 Q.  Kind of an important week. A lot of people talking about Solheim Cup. How much is that on your mind?  
AMY OLSON: Well, I would love to play. That's just one of those things you dream of growing up. But at the same time, it's not something you can really force.   
Yeah, I would love to, but I haven't played quite as well towards the end of this season as I would've liked to.   
So, you know, a little bit more worried about just trying to get my own game in shape and whatever happens, happens.   
 Q.  Yeah. You had a good finish at the Scottish. Is there something that kind of clicked that week for you?  
AMY OLSON: I mean, I hit a lot greens there and I was putting really well, but there is -- it just seems like it's each week it's been one thing that's just a little bit off. It's so close, but it would be really nice to put three more good rounds together.
