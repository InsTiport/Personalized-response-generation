  Q. 1-over 72, Amy Olson.  Amy, talk us through what you're feeling right now.
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, obviously very -- super mixed emotions.  You know, it was a long day yesterday not being able to play, but I did get some good rest.
 Coming out this morning I had no idea what to expect.  It was just one of those things I felt very weak and helpless the last couple days, and probably same went today on the golf course.  I really believe the Lord just carried me through.  Just so many -- it just makes you realize how much bigger life is than golf.  But pleased with my finish overall and my performance.
 Q. Great golf this week.  A lot for you to take out of this from a confidence level I would imagine.
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, for sure.  I struck the ball really well all week and I putted great all week.  Yeah, it was really fun to play well, to put four good rounds together, and just a lot of confidence going into the next event.
 Q. Was there a target score that you were looking at that you thought you might have to shoot today?  And also, are you surprised that somebody put together a 4-under round today?
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, I mean, it was definitely out there.  Again, like every week or every day, you had to pick which pins you were going to go at and which ones you weren't.  But there were birdies out there.  Still a great round, obviously.
 I kind of assumed it was going to be between me and Hinako.  I just thought it was going to be potentially between us, and definitely surprised to see someone come kind of from behind and put that good of a round together.
 Q. The shot on 16, can you walk us through that, what club it was and what went through your head as it's in the air?
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, I had 180 to the pin and I needed to carry it about 170 based on my math to carry that bunker.  My 5-iron, I hit a cut 5-iron on the previous hole and it had flown 152.  So I'm sitting there, and there's no way I can pull that club.  I tried to hit a high cut hybrid, which I pulled off beautifully, but it just -- I don't know if it caught a little downwind gust or anything, but obviously it didn't hold the green and got kind of a tough lie behind the green and didn't make it up-and-down.
 Q. How hard was it to focus out there at times?  Did you allow your mind to wander?
 AMY OLSON:   You know, honestly I didn't a lot.  I knew I had to stay very mentally disciplined just to get through the day.
 I allowed myself to think about what I'm grateful for, and I've got a long list.
 Q. Was it a blessing that you didn't have to play yesterday, that you could just sort of talk to Grant and be there for him before he got back on the plane?  Can you imagine even doing what you did today yesterday?
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, I mean, it's so hard to say that.  It definitely gave me a chance to get some more rest, but at the time it also didn't allow Grant to be here until the finish, and we had to make some more decisions.
 But I definitely did get a lot more rest last night than I did the night before.
 Q. Were you singing on the 13th fairway?
 AMY OLSON:   Oh, yeah.  (Laughter).
 Q. Was there anything in particular?
 AMY OLSON:   I had Josh Groban's song, You Raise Me Up in my head, particularly the part where it says, "You raise me up to walk on stormy waters."
 So that was kind of what was going through my head today.
 Q. Can you just tell us a little bit about your father-in-law?
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah.  You know, we had a really special relationship.  He's a big, tough, military West Point guy, loved the Army, but had a particular soft spot for the women in his life, particularly his wife and daughter-in-law.
 And just incredibly generous.  Loved to hunt and fish, and we'll have a lot of great memories to take from those activities, doing those with him.
