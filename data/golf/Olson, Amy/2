  Q. You had a great round today.  Have you ever had two eagles in a round before?
 AMY OLSON:   I actually was thinking about it out there.  I don't think I ever have.  That's a first for me.
 Q. Tell me about those two eagles.
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, the tee was up on hole 8.  Had a 6-iron in off kind of a downhill lie; pushed it right.  Ended up on the fringe about 50 feet away and just hit a perfect putt and was tracking the whole way.  Dropped in, which is fun.
 And then on 16 I hit a 5-wood off the tee and just got the perfect bounce kind of off the hill.  Kicked left to about six, seven feet; made the putt.
 So, yeah, I mean, just a couple shots that obviously worked out just the way I wanted.
 Q. You'll take them, absolutely.  It was a great round overall.  How are you feeling heading into the last round?  You seem to be rounding into shape.
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, I feel good, especially since at one point I was 6-over on I think Friday after my triple, and have rallied back.  It just feels good to be making some birdies and seeing some putts go in.  That doesn't always happen out here, so when you start seeing putts go in the hole it's a lot of fun.
 Q. What is the turnaround, do you think, from the 6-over to where you are now?
 AMY OLSON:   Good question.  It's golf, I guess.  I mean, I've kind of cued into a couple things as far as swing thoughts and putting stroke just feels, but for the most part I feel good with where my game is and just kind of trusting where I'm at and trying to be creative out there.
 Q. We've seen a variety of conditions this week, from all but San Francisco like to bright and sunny and perfect today.
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah.
 Q. How is the course firming up out there?
 AMY OLSON:   Yeah, it's firmer than I've ever seen it, so some of the roll-outs you just have to double check the number, because in previous years you step up there and hit driver or step up and hit 3-wood.
 It's a different club, so a little bit more thinking.  But I like how firm it's playing.  I actually think, yeah, it sets up really well.
 Q. Speaking of setup, how do you head into the last round now?
 AMY OLSON:   Have some dinner, get some rest, kind of the same old, same old.
