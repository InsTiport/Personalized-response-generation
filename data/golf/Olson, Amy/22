Q. Awesome round.
AMY OLSON: Thank you.
Q. How did it go out there for you today?
AMY OLSON: It was good.  It was really fun playing with Ariya here in Thailand.
Q. I was just going to ask you.
AMY OLSON: And obviously Michelle.  It was kind of a powerhouse group, so it was really, really fun.  Just really enjoyed the day out there.  Everything kind of clicked for the most part.  Left a couple putts out there, but really played pretty solid.  It was fun.
Q. We know how hot it is out here.  A couple weeks ago you were back home where the temperature was very different.
AMY OLSON: Yeah, about negative 32 one of the days Farenheit, so I'm still thawing out.
Q. Well you've thawed out beautifully, and a lovely round of golf.  We saw many highlights in your round.  How good was that second shot for the par-5?
AMY OLSON: Yeah, it was a really good shot.  Right in between the 3-wood and 5-wood and the wind kind of gusted right as I was about to hit, so my 3-wood was perfect.  Landed on the front edge and rolled to like six feet, so that was really fun.
Q. And the putting here, everybody watching at home and us in the commentary booth, we're clicking our fingers to get the putts to stop.  They are fast.
AMY OLSON: Yeah, if you're above the hole you have a really hard time stopping the putt.  If you leave yourself a good position they're rolling so well and you really can roll a lot of putts in.
Q. Loving Thailand?  Have you been for a foot massage?  Seems every LPGA player this week has had a massage of some kind.
AMY OLSON: Two so far, and there will be more.  (Laughter.)
Q. You're two shots off the pace going into the weekend.  A great position?
AMY OLSON: Yeah, absolutely.  That is all you can do, is set yourself up to make a run.  I'm having fun just playing really good golf and looking forward to the weekend.
