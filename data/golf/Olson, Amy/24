 Q.  Well played, a solid opening round.  Can you tell us how good that eagle was on 8, because it's left a few players scratching their heads that hole?  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, you know, it's not a long par 5 but it's a very challenging approach shot from that far.  You can't be short because you'll be in the hazard, and then it's a really tough bunker shot for that pin if you go over the green.   
I did have like a perfect club.  I hit a really nice, high shot, so it would come in soft and it just ended up being perfect.   
 Q.  I bet you breathed a sigh of relief because it's quite hard knowing what to do with the second shot.  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, when I struck it, I was like, that's as good as I can do and all you can do out here.   
 Q.  You had some excellent scores in 2019, 66s and 67s.  It's all going according to plan.  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.  I've made a lot of birdies most rounds, and it is fun posting some low numbers that can help you move up the leaderboard.   
Yeah, looking forward to continuing that.   
 Q.  And enjoying playing in your first HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore.  How did you enjoy the cocktail party last night?  
AMY OLSON: It was a lot of fun.  Honestly I've never done anything like that, and really seeing the skyline at night from such an incredible place was kind of a one-of-a-kind experience; so it was a really good way to start the week in Singapore.   
 Q.  A lot of people do call it Asia's Major, and it's quite fitting in some ways.  
AMY OLSON: It's a beautiful city, a great golf course and we all love coming here.
