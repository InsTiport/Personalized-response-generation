 Q.  Just sum up your week here. Great finish.  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was great to be in the second-to-last group today. I knew if I made a move I might have a chance, but Jin Young completely blew everyone out of the water. That was really awesome. She's having a great year.   
It was really fun. I played solid all day. Honestly, 3-under is great but could have been better. Yeah, I'm really happy with my finish, though.   
 Q.  What kind of lessons do you take away from today?  
AMY OLSON: Yeah, my game is there. It's coming. I had a little bit of a rough patch this summer, but I think we're kind of on the upswing. It's really nice to have the momentum going forward.
