Q. What was it like out there?  Did you feel at times like, I'm shooting 80 and you're even par?
AMY OLSON: Yeah, you know, it was so funny.  Yesterday you're riding wave and evert putt was just center of the cup.
Today I hit some really great putts; just burned the edge.  Honestly, I hit so many good putts that were right on the edge.  Just didn't fall in.  If you average it out, obviously I'm still pleased with both rounds.  Then, yeah, I just didn't have quite the opportunities that I had yesterday.  Honestly it was just the putts weren't going in.
Still, rolling it well; still feel good about it.  They were set up a lot tougher today.  Lexi's round, super impressive, and some of the other low scores out there.
I'm pleased with my even par.  I'm in the hunt, and that's a good place to be.
Q. And T-2, if you said going into the week you're going to be T-2 going into the weekend...
AMY OLSON: You take that every week absolutely.  So, yeah, there is a whole lot the golf left.  We're halfway through.  It's a marathon.  Hopefully just get some more birdies going forward.
Q. How do you feel?  You're coming back from China, the other side of world.  Got to be a little tougher.
AMY OLSON: Yeah, I'm not sleeping quite as sound as maybe I normally do.  I actually feel pretty good.  Helps to get into the routine of a tournament I feel like; better than coming back and having an off week where you can just sit on your couch.  I feel like I'm actually adjusting pretty well.
Q. I've talked to so many people and they have said, Amy is hitting it so well.  She's ready to win; she's right on the cusp.  Do you feel that way?  What do you think?  Are you mentally now over the hump and ready?
AMY OLSON: Yeah, I'm definitely ready.  I think even just starting the beginning of the year, and even towards the end of last year, I felt ready.
People are seeing that I've had some good results and stuff, and it'll come.  The whole key, and what so hard about golf, is working hard and staying patient.  It's easy to do maybe one or the other.  But just trying to keep grinding but at the same time not trying to force it, because you really can't.
You can't make it happen.  You got to let it happen.  When it's your time, it'll happen.
