 Q.   Mark, you're bogey‑free, 4‑under par, nice way to begin the season?  
MARK WILSON:   Thank you.   Yeah, it was good.   It was a good start.   Just kind of trying to be patient with the wind and hitting some weird clubs with different yardages and stuff, played conservative.   
I made some nice par putts early on in those tough holes on the back nine that get most of the wind and just made birdies on par 4s and stuff, and didn't birdie the par 5s.   So I'm looking forward to this afternoon.  
   
 Q.   You were very consistent, out in 2‑under, in in 2‑under, for a total of 4‑under 69 on our par 73 golf course.   How is the course playing?   The wind is not as severe as earlier in the tournament but it's still windy.   
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, it's still windy but pretty much par for the course here and we are used to that kind of wind.   The greens are slower than normal so we are not worried about the ball rolling anymore.   It's soft but it's still tricky with the wind all over the place.  
   
 Q.   You were out in severe conditions on Sunday.   Was that a positive or negative, positive in that you got some experience or negative because you realize how difficult the course can play?  
MARK WILSON:   I think it's just a positive.     Most of us hits balls, too, on Saturday and Sunday just a little bit, because we don't get a chance to hit into that much wind, so it's good to work on your ball flight.
