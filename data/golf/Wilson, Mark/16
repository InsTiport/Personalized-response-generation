 Q.   Can you talk about the match.   You closed it out pretty early?  
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, well, Bo and I both played really well.   I think we had one bogey between the two of us.   And I just played really well and got ahead of him.   
He's such a long hitter, but I actually managed to birdie the par‑5s and he didn't, even though he was up on the green in 2 a lot of the time.   That was kind of the difference.   He made a valiant effort there in the end.   But I rolled in a nice 4‑footer to finish it off.  
   
 Q.   What was your key today?  
MARK WILSON:   It was definitely just keeping the ball in play, giving myself a lot of chances.  
   
 Q.   And going forward, I don't know if you've seen who you're playing tomorrow possibly, but what's your thoughts tomorrow?   Are you just going to keep playing the same way?  
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, totally.   It's a neat feeling.   It really does feel like you're coming down the stretch in a tournament.   It's good to get this one past me and be a little more comfortable tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Have you played a lot of match play in the past?  
MARK WILSON:   Played last year.   And before that it had been since like amateur golf.   It had been a long time.  
   
 Q.   Is it something you miss and enjoy?  
MARK WILSON:   I do enjoy it.   I'm not sure which I enjoy more.   I guess we're so used to stroke play.   We're lucky because almost all the tournaments are stroke play, because you can come back after a day.   In the case today Bo shot a couple under par and he's going home.   And that would have been a good round to start the tournament out.   So I think stroke play is certainly a little more fair to everybody.
