MARK WILSON:  I played really well and made a 30 footer on 7 about a 25 footer on 8 to finish the round out.
Q.  You lived down here?
MARK WILSON:  I lived down here for a couple of years, played the TPCs quite a bit and now I live in Chicago full time.
Q.  What was it like living down here in Florida?
MARK WILSON:  It was fun.  I didn't have a whole lot of connections down here with friends and stuff and got married recently.  So my family is more up in the Midwest.  But this is a great place to be in the winter to play golf.
Q.  Could you just talk about your situation, you were up here, you had a taste of it, you lost it, you're getting another chance, just what it's like to be back on TOUR?
MARK WILSON:  Yeah, it's my fourth year.  I don't feel like necessarily I'm back or whatever, but you're right, I only played this tournament one time back in 2003.  These are the elite field tournaments, like Doral, and it's good to be here.  I just want to see if I can win one of these things so I can stay out here for good.

It's been all right, starting last year dating back to September, I did as good as I could have hoped for, three Top 10s last fall, had a good chance at Pebble Beach    finished 27th after a 76 on Sunday.  Had a real good chance last week and I had a 72 the last day where you've got to make birdies.  Still was happy that the Top 10 got me in here.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARK WILSON:  All of those guys that got bumped had a chance to get in themselves in Tucson.  They were all there last year.  This is kind of fair game.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MARK WILSON:  It's always been there.  I think it's a good thing, especially for a guy like me in my category.  I can't reshuffle up being in the 126 to 150 in any way, so Top 10s are important for me.  It's great to be at Doral.  I think the rules should stay.
