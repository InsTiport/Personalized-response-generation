 Q.   Just, first of all, kind of the round.   This wouldn't necessarily seem to be your golf course, per se.     
MARK WILSON:   Did good over the years, third and a seventh.   I just have a good feel for this place.   A lot of respect for Mr.Nicklaus, and I just love the condition of the golf course.   Being from the Midwest, love being in the Midwest.     
Yeah, played well today.   Hit the ball really good.   And rolled in afew ‑‑ it's one of those things, my good shots I didn't capitalize on, but then I made some long putts, which is funny how the game works sometimes.   
   
 Q.   This golf course, being soft, even is longer than it normally would be.   So did you find yourself having to hit more into some of these greens?   
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, a couple of holes.   But I've seen it play longer when we've had a lot more rain.   We're getting a little roll on the fairway.   And we played most of the holes with no wind.   So it didn't play that long for me.   
   
 Q.   Jack said he wanted to get it under 14 on the Stimpmeter.   Did it feel like they were‑‑   
MARK WILSON:   No, not yet.   They're a little slower than I remember them but faster than most we see.   We'll see what the rest of the week looks like.
