  Q. Talk about your last few holes.   
 MARK WILSON: I've thought about it. I've thought about many rounds doing that, but this is one of the 100 times I've done it, so it made a couple decent sized putts and then played 18 good, made about a three-footer for birdie there.  
  
  Q. 24 putts in the opening round of the year, and that's a nice way to begin.   
 MARK WILSON: Yeah, I got up-and-down when I needed to. I hit some iron shots that weren't exactly right on but got them up-and-down out of the Bermuda rough somehow. There's really no Bermuda up in Chicago I can practice in, but somehow I figured it out.  
  
  Q. I was never among the doubters you understand but there were some who questioned whether you would be here in the opening event because 2010 wasn't your best season on TOUR.   
 MARK WILSON: No, it wasn't, but I saved my best for last. Had my best finish of the year at Disney and I really carried that over into an off-season where I was just really happy and didn't stress about my game my bit. So came out here with a continuation of that.  
  
  Q. It sounded like you were really ready to go last week.   
 MARK WILSON: I sure was, yeah. I'm happy to be here, and boy, it was tough to not start until Friday. I was itching to go on Wednesday already, but we got it going.  
  
  Q. You've got the kids here, though, so your time was occupied?  
 MARK WILSON: Yeah, they're not here. They're with my wife's family, so my in-laws are watching the kids in California. My wife is here, so we've hit the movies and done stuff we don't normally get to do, so it's been good.
