 Q. Not bad going into the fourth round. 
 MARK WILSON: Yeah, nice to get that little 15-footer in for birdie on the last hole. It's going to be fun this afternoon. The course is not playing too difficult, not too much wind yet, and the ball is going far.

 Q. Any idea what's going on with your Packers going into today?
 MARK WILSON: Well, it's pregame, so I know it's 0-0, but I'll be anxious on our second nine to hear the score a little bit.
