Q.   Here with Mark Wilson.   Mark, have four today, three yesterday, seven total.   You gotta be pretty happy with where you stand. 
MARK WILSON:   Very happy, yeah.   Hit the ball nicely, rolled in some putts, made some saves when I needed to, and I feel great about it.

Q.   It wasn't the season here after last year, what did that off season, missing the PLAYOFFS, what did that afford you here before you regroup for this new season?
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, just very thankful that I still have a year of exemption from my wins back in '11 and '12 that I could just bank on that.   Last year I tried a lot of different things, and I'm kind of using what I liked last year of the new things, and it's paying off this week so far.

Q.   Got a lot of things obviously heading in the right direction.   I gotta think that this sort of golf course here really sets up well for your game. 
MARK WILSON:   I do.   I've enjoyed it ever since we came here in 2010.   I love the look of the tee shots, and you just gotta kind of be smart going into the greens and hole a few putts.

Q.   Obviously you were pretty smart, 16 of 18 greens.   That's some pretty good ball striking out there. 
MARK WILSON:   That's good to know, yeah.   It felt like I was going in the right direction most of the day.   That's a good stat though, yeah.

Q.   You're in position going into the weekend.   What are you looking forward to here over the next couple of days?
MARK WILSON:   Just really excited about the opportunity.   I mean last year I think‑‑ I don't remember for sure, but I think if I made the cut, I made it on the number by one, so I was never in contention really, unless I went out and shot a low one on Saturday.
So now I'm right there in contention to start the weekend where we all like to be, and just try to do a lot of the same and get out of my own way.
