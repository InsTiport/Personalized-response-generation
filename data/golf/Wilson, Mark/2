Q.   Tell me just a little bit about the discrepancy?   You said at some point mid round you saw a leaderboard that you weren't where you thought you were or they weren't where you thought?
MARK WILSON:   I looked over on one hole and I knew I was 6‑under for the day and this was on the par‑5 4th, which is my 13th of the day.   I looked over and the board said 9‑under.   So I'm like, maybe they just got the number upside down, you know. 
But those things happen, but usually not by that many strokes.   But made a couple birdies coming in, which was nice.

Q.   You got to feel pretty good about your round no matter what?
MARK WILSON:   Yes. 

Q.   Feel pretty good about your round in general though?
MARK WILSON:   Very much so, yeah.   I came in feeling okay, nothing great about the game, but it was ideal today.   I made some saves when I needed it and capitalized on my good shots.

Q.   And then a little bit of a different tournament here.   You got two different golf courses to play the rest of the day before cut day.   How do you approach that?
MARK WILSON:   Thankfully, I've done it a lot of times.   We played all these courses many times and this tournament you just got to keep making birdies.   So that's the mentality, just keep the gas pedal down. 

Q.   I can see just see through the trees rippling just a little bit here, but normally it's pretty perfect scoring conditions out here.   What was it like out there today?
MARK WILSON:   It was pretty ideal, but there were a couple of holes that played a little different than normal.   The fifth hole is usually about a driver and a mid iron for me and I hit a 3‑iron in there to a back pin. 
So there were a couple holes, due to that ‑‑ it's only about a seven or eight hour wind, but it made a couple holes play different than we previously have seen it.
