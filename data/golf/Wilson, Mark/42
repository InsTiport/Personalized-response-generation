 Q. Just obviously a long day. You're in great position. Can we get some comments on round 3 and the quick turnaround? 
 MARK WILSON: Yeah, everything went good. No bogeys this morning, and just played solid and just chipped in one time. A couple breaks went my way again just like the first two days. But now I've just got to catch my breath because I've got two minutes to make it to the tee. I've got my sandwich for the afternoon, eight new golf balls, and I'm all set.
