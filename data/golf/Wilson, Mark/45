 Q. Okay. I have Mark Wilson here, 6-under for the tournament. Tell me about your round today.
 MARK WILSON: You know, it was funny because I didn't drive it very well, kind of hit some squirrely drives, but just took advantage of when I got it in the fairway and just putted really well. I mean I really couldn't have made any more putts than I did today. So the putter was hot.

 Q. And after playing Palm yesterday and Mag today, differences that you were seeing between the two courses? They say that Mag is a little bit more difficult. Is that what you found today?
 MARK WILSON: They didn't say that with the Mag more difficult in the sense that none of the tees were up on the really hard holes, like 16, 17 and 18, a couple holes at the front, too, where if they put the tees back, it would be tougher.
 You know, the Palm's a little easier because all of the par-5s are very reachable, even for a shorter hitter like myself; whereas, out here there's only one or two I can get to. But I only birdied one of them yesterday anyway. 
 I've had good history on this course, shot 63 here once, after they redid it and everything. So I always feel like I score better on the Mag.
