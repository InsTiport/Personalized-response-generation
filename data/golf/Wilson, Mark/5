Q.   Mark, well played out there.   One bogey, 7 birdies, you and Pat both shooting 6‑under par out there out there, had to feel pretty easy out there. 
MARK WILSON:   It did.   It's nice when you feed off someone like that, and we got off to good starts, both of us, and kept going. 

Q.   Is the golf course playing that easy or did you guys just play that well? 
MARK WILSON:   I think it's a mark of a golf course, Like if you're on, like we were.   I hit a lot of quality iron shots, so did Pat.   And we made our putts.   If you're a little off, and you're on the wrong side of ridges here, you can make bogey easily. 
So I don't think it's playing that easy, I did just play really well.   There was of a lot of good scores out there, the "watch" looks like 59, with Mickelson going on right now. 

Q.   You're normally a fast starter in the year.   I know it's not been the year you were hoping for.   What's been the problem and what's been going right this week? 
MARK WILSON:   Just a little bit off, I keep telling people.   There is such a fine line of missing the cut by a shot and contending on the weekend.   You know, I made a nice birdie on 18 yesterday just to squeak in the cut by 2 shots, and that's a bonus on 18, anytime you make birdie there. 
So things feel better this week.   The difference between the first two days and today is I hit more fairways, it's easier to play it the golf course from the fairway. 

Q.   Talk about that "Green Mile" you almost birdied every hole, that chip‑in almost dropped. 
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, Pat and I had a lot of fun there on 17.   We both had big swingin' putts and somehow we got 'em to drop.   Trying to get close to the hole, and they fell in.   Yeah, the chip looked really good from my angle, but I'll take par there. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks, Pat.
