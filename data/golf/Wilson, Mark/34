 Q. You have been in contention obviously a lot this year already. Here you are in your first match play. Were you able to kind of draw off that? Playing on Sunday where every putt means something in match play, it's kind of the same feeling?
 MARK WILSON: No question. I was very fortunate with my putt on 18 to extend the match. It was pretty much the same put I had at the Phoenix Open. It was a little left to right and I kind of drew on that. Let's release the blade through this putt. I made it this time. Didn't make it in Phoenix.

 Q. Take about the match. Any key holes that you thought turned the momentum one way or the other? 
 MARK WILSON: We both gave each other some holes that we shouldn't have. You hate making bogeys to give your opponent a hole. We both did that to each other. 
 Then 16 was pivotal. I hit a great hybrid in there. We had about the same length putts, his par and my birdie putt. I missed that and Dustin happened to miss his, too. I got kind of lucky that I still won the hole. That was pivotal along with 17. I had about an eight footer there to stay in it and knocked it. That's what's kind of cool at match play. 

 Q. You made putts -- especially on the last hole, you really made the putts you needed to make?
 MARK WILSON: I didn't make the putts until 17 and 18. Dustin made a few in the middle there, 12, 13 and 15. That's why he had the advantage. I was able to knock some in to bring it home.

 Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, I would imagine? 
 MARK WILSON: Yeah, I'm thrilled to not pack my suitcase up yet.
