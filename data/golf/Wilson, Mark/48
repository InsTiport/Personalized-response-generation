 Q. Did you see this coming? 
 MARK WILSON: I didn't really see it coming. I didn't feel great about my game coming in. I played good on the weekend at Mayakoba, so I was excited about that coming here. I was actually a little under the weather early in the week, and it was probably good to get some rest. 
 The finish, yeah, those holes are very exciting with some birdie opportunities, but you can also make some big numbers. Thankfully today I did the opposite and made some birdies.

 Q. How are you with the 16th hole? Do you embrace it?
 MARK WILSON: It gets a little easier every year, but it's crazy. We take one less club there for sure because it's just amped up like the last hole of a tournament or something like that, and I pulled an 8-iron a little bit there, but it just was enough and led to a birdie. It was one of those things where it could have trickled all the way to the bottom and I would have had a tough par, instead I make birdie. It's been good to me. I made birdie both days.

 Q. What's your mindset going into the weekend? 
 MARK WILSON: Just try to keep doing what I'm doing. The scores are low here, so probably going to have to get up there 20-something under par to win the golf tournament. I'll kind of have that in the back of my mind, but just try to take one hole at a time like we always do and see what happens.
