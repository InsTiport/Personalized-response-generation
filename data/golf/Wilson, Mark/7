  MARK WILSON:   Let me guess what you're going to ask me. 

Q.   Did you notice anything at all? 
MARK WILSON:   No, I didn't notice anything.   He wasn't playing the way the world No. 1 plays normally.   Didn't hit the ball where he wanted to, and he's a true gentleman, though.   It's not like he was really‑‑ wasn't treating Ernie and myself in a different way.   He was upset with his golf and I guess he had enough for the week.

Q.   Did he say anything about his tooth? 
MARK WILSON:   No, he didn't, no. 

Q.   What did he say on 18, and did he give any indication prior to that?
MARK WILSON:   No, he didn't.   All he did was hand me the scorecard and said that he's going in after that hole.   I wasn't about to ask him, either. 

Q.   He was saying that he said a statement afterward that he felt like he was affecting you and Ernie a little bit.   Were you guys affected by his play?
MARK WILSON:   No, I'm never affected by somebody else.   We've all been there.   We've all struggled.   I would have liked him to finish, but if that's what he felt, then that's fine with me.   Yeah, he wasn't affecting us one bit, no. 

Q.   How was the pace for you guys after he left? 
MARK WILSON:   We just took our time.   Obviously big Ernie is slow, he just kind of walks slow, so I tried to keep the pace with him.
