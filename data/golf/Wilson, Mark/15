Q.   Another good win here at the Accenture Match Play Championship.   Just talk about advancing, and maybe some of the keys to the match today?
MARK WILSON:   The key is that I guess I was in play a little bit more.   Robert gave me a couple of holes, which certainly helped pad the score a little bit and gave me a lead.   And I tried to give him some back late.   But in the end it worked out in my favor.
I think the key shot was right on the second hole.   I hit a 3â€‘iron right up there to about three feet.
