Q.   A little bit better today but maybe not quite good enough.   Just talk about the two rounds that you played. 
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, short game kind of let me down yesterday.   I didn't get it up‑and‑down.   A few times I missed the greens.   Today I played really well.   I don't know how I only shot 2‑under to be honest with you, a couple fliers and made some bogeys.   But yeah, it was a fun week, and just sad I won't be playing the weekend.

Q.   Do you put any extra pressure on yourself when you're defending do you think or just other things going on maybe?
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, I've learned from that, so no, it just was one of those weeks where is it didn't seem like things were going in my favor.   I felt like I hit a lot of good shots that ended up poorly and didn't make as many long putts as I normally do, and there was the difference.

Q.   Wind was picking up a little bit out there toward the end of the round today, wasn't it?
MARK WILSON:   Yeah, yeah, the wind is picking up a little bit.   That's the shortest club I've ever hit into the 9th hole; I hit 8‑iron in there on that par‑5.   So yeah, it's a nice direction, though.   I think it makes the course play a little bit easier, but it's still tricky.   There's a couple holes you've got to land the ball short of the green and let it run up.
