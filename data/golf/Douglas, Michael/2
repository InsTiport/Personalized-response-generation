CARNOUSTIE
MICHAEL DOUGLAS:  We'll have to see if we make it through in the team format. It looks like we will be on the cusp of the cut, so it could go either way at the moment. Colin had a tough day out there today, but if we do get through then I'm sure we'll enjoy tomorrow.

At the minute, though, I would not be too disappointed if I have to watch tomorrow. It was as tough as I've ever known it today, it was very rugged.
