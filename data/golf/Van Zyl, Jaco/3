 Q.  Bogey-free, 3-under today.  You must be very happy.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, a little tougher out there today than yesterday.  I'm hitting it nicely.  Made a couple of mistakes but I kept it together.  Got it up-and-down when I needed to.   
Unfortunately I didn't give myself a whole bunch of birdie chances on my back nine.  But kept it together and got it up-and-down when I needed to, and managed to get one more coming in.   
 Q.  Always nice to start and finish with a birdie, as well, isn't it.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, it is.  10 today is downbreeze, so it's pretty much the only hole you can capitalise on, and 9 was really a bonus.  Playing my back nine out there, you're kind of dreading the ninth hole, because all it takes is missing one shot and you're on your back foot.  I hit three absolutely pure shots in there, and yeah, like you say, 69, 3-under par, bogey-free, I'm very chuffed.   
 Q.  Great position to go into the weekend with, as well.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Definitely.  I said to my caddie, Jason, at the beginning of the week, we kind of linger there or thereabouts every single week, and we kind of hope for one good round.  We're always finishing in the middle of the pack and it feels like it's become more of a comfort zone than the golf I'm playing.  We've come out this week with a different mind-set, and so far, so good.
