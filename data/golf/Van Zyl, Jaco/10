JACO VAN ZYL: Horrendous start but just managed to keep it together and got a couple back.  At least managed to get a round out of it.   
 Q.  You say a horrendous start but one of those adventurous ones, if you like, because it was three birdies to cancel out the triple.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Like I say, made a couple of birdies and it's just really a pity about the 12th hole.  Other than that, I really played nicely today.   
 Q.  What happened at 12?  
JACO VAN ZYL: One club or two less.  Just hit a little bit left of the target I intended to and I literally came up a foot short.  The drop zone is a good 130 yards out and doesn't leave you with an easy third shot from there.  Just hit it a bit long and ended up with a plugged lie in the bunker, so all sorts of fun.   
 Q.  What were playing conditions like?  
JACO VAN ZYL: It was really good the first nine holes.  It started getting up a little bit our back nine.  I think they got a little bit of wind forecast for this afternoon, so just managed to get it all done.   
 Q.  You're still in a very nice position.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Definitely.  If you told me on Thursday morning, 4-under par, first two rounds, I would have taken it with both hands.   
 Q.  Given we're expecting some bad weather on the way, but that all the more enhances your position on the board, doesn't it?  
JACO VAN ZYL: It does.  It's obviously a top-quality field, and you know, you've got to kind of expect the boys to still make a move.  See where we are at the end of the day and take it another day tomorrow.
