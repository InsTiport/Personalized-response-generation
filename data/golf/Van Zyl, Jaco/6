Q. Nice shooting today?
JACO VAN ZYL: Nice, solid start.  I hit it nicely tee-to-green but still felt like I left a couple out there.
Q. There was a nice purple patch, five birdies without any dropped shots in that period.
JACO VAN ZYL: It's just the sort of golf course, you've got to get off to a quick start and then hang on, and then once you go through the turn, there's another couple of birdie opportunities.  Like I said, hanging on again towards the end.
Q. And you've achieved this despite not feeling as your best, so what's the blistering like?
JACO VAN ZYL: I played yesterday, and it was all good, no hassles.  Wearing the same shoes now for the last two years and just started spinning up and really uncomfortable the last two holes.
Q. Walking gingerly, does it affect your balance and swing, as well?
JACO VAN ZYL: Obviously with the blister popping, you feel it.  Even going through your pre-shot routine, it's harder to concentrate on what you need to do, instead of trying to get your foot comfortable in your shoe.
Q. Have you recovered from the appendicitis, the operation and just getting the rhythm all back?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, played in Turkey last week and I was really comfortable out there.  Just really rusty the first two rounds, and I played really nicely on the weekend.  Played a lot better than what I scored.  The form has continued into this week and it's a solid 3-under par round.
Q. Excited to get back after last year's exploits around here?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, and I've been coming here for many years and I just absolutely love the place and love the golf course.  You've got to think your way around here, and it's not really a bomber's paradise, which we play 100 percent of the time.  It's just nice to come back and play a nice, old, traditional golf course.
