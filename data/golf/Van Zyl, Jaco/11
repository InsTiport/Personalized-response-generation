JACO VAN ZYL: Nice to wear my sunglasses for most of the round.  I didn't quite expect that.  We've been very kind with the weather.
It's a great golf course.  It's a test from the first tee shot to the last putt, and you know, didn't hit it all that great today but still managed to get it under par.
Q. I daresay you feel lucky not to contend with the rain but the winds were particularly strong in the afternoon, weren't they?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, it picked up quite good.  We had some really horrendous conditions last week in Mauritius, so it's kind of par for the course right now, and the first couple of holes felt like a little breeze.
Q. You don't expect it in Mauritius, you do expect it in Ireland.  So do you tailor your game or your attitude accordingly?
JACO VAN ZYL: I just think 90 per cent of the golf here is literally depending on the weather.  Not much work to be done this afternoon, and we'll see what Mother Nature has got intended for us tomorrow.
Q. Your game in good shape generally?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, I've been playing nicely.  I haven't played much the first half of the year.  Just really looking forward to get stuck into it and get nice momentum going.
Q. Most people regardless of the weather tend to enjoy coming to this part of the world.  Are one of those?
JACO VAN ZYL: It's just a very special place, green everywhere you look, and the people are very friendly.  It's a warm place to come to, despite the weather, just absolutely love it here.
