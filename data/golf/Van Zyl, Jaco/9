Q. So please tell me, how satisfied you are with a 5-under par start.
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, I'm very, very chuffed.  I think it's my personal best round around here.  It's just one of those golf courses that just doesn't let up.  Got off to a nice start, 4-under through 12, and you know, you get 13, 14, 15, it's a couple of really rough holes there.
Q. What is it that you've done to make this the best?  Is that just down to experience for you?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, it's only my sixth or seventh year coming back here, and you to know where to hit it, not to hit it.  And the 20 degrees Celsius and the sunshine definitely does help the South African.
I got off to a nice start last week, as well, and just kind of hit pause there for a while.  It will be nice to carry on the form throughout the week.
Q. You said about this being the best, but is that partly learning the nuances of this course, because there are places that you mustn't hit it, I guess?
JACO VAN ZYL: Definitely.  The first couple of times you go around here, you kind of figure out where to hit it and where not to hit it.  As the years go on, you definitely know where to pick the spots and where not to hit it.
Q. You've played some prestigious tournaments around the world; is this still very special?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, definitely.  I think playing on The European Tour, this is a very special place for all the players.  We've been coming back here for years and just a great atmosphere, great venue.  Love it here.
