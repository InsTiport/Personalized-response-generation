Q. That finish really boosted you right up there again.
JACO VAN ZYL: I got off to a bit of a slow start and missed a couple of shots, and just started hitting it really nicely on the back nine and made a couple of putts.  Obviously feel like I left a couple out there, but 4-under par the back nine, I'm sure anyone will take that.
Q. We have sunshine on you at the moment and barely a breeze, but it wasn't always like that out there, was it?
JACO VAN ZYL: No, it got quite breezy at one stage.  It's all fair and square when you finish on 12, but once you turn on to 13, your home stretch is basically into the breeze.  They are really tough holes.  To walk away there a couple under par, I'm really, really chuffed.
Q. When you started, you'd have probably been aware that Danny Willett was affording a nice lead; did that affect you?
JACO VAN ZYL: Not really.  You play the first three rounds and try and put yourself in contention, and you know, keep yourself in the first nine holes on Sunday to put yourself in contention for the back nine.
Q. Excited?
JACO VAN ZYL: Very excited.  I've been in this position a couple of times out here.  Try to get the monkey off the shoulder and hopefully get that elusive win.
Q. Is it feeling like that, because you've won so many tournaments all told; it's just out here on The European Tour, isn't it.
JACO VAN ZYL: It took me awhile back home to win my first one.  Just kind of gets a little bit easier the more you do it.  I just think to get the monkey off the back will be good.
