  JACO VAN ZYL:   It's been a great week.   A little disappointing today.   Just a very slow day in the office.   I suppose it could have been a lot worse.   You've got to take the positives from this and move on to the next week.  
   
 Q.   As an observer, putting it very simple, you weren't playing bad.   You still had the control but just didn't go for you.   
JACO VAN ZYL:   Yeah, just kind of a roller coaster round.   I hit it nicely, and then I'm not making the putt.   Get in a bit of trouble and end up rolling in a 10â€‘footer for par.   Just a long round of pretty much nothing happening.  
   
 Q.   Were you conscious of what was happening around you?   
JACO VAN ZYL:   I tried to keep up with the boys up to about the 13th hole and after that, I kind of realised it is what it is and just enjoyed it.  
   
 Q.   Still, with what you've gone through across the last period, this is quite nice to come out competitive and right up there.   
JACO VAN ZYL:   Definitely.   If you look at it a year ago, I couldn't walk.   So to be in the final group of The French Open, I'll take it any day.  
   
 Q.   Don't ask about money much, but is it important what you've won here for Race to Dubai and points and things like that?  
JACO VAN ZYL:   Yeah, every little bit helps.   Fortunate enough to secure my card a couple of weeks ago.   
Yeah, it never really stops until the end of The Race to Dubai.   It's a nice cheque and it will get us a little bit closer to The Race to Dubai final.
