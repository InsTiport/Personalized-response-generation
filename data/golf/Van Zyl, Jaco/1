Q. How important was that start?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, that was really important.  An unfortunate 3-putt on 6 kind of put a damper on things a little bit.  I kind of just lingered along until I made a nice one on 13.  Just unfortunately I hit a couple of good putts that just didn't go in.
Q. Conditions were very tough out there after starting quite calm.
JACO VAN ZYL: The back nine was playing really tough.  The wind came up and it was really challenging.
Q. Take confidence into Dubai with that, though?
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, I will.  Definitely.  It's a good start to the season, and a little bit more fireworks, so hopefully it continues.
