   JACO VAN ZYL: I shot 31 on the front nine, which was five under, and after that it was just a case of holding it together on the back nine. I managed to do that which is pleasing because the breeze was getting up and most of the holes coming in seemed to be playing into the breeze. Today there really weren't many scoring opportunities on the back nine and Kingsbarns has quite a lot of slopes on the greens - unlike the other two courses so that also means you have to be careful there. But overall very pleased with my start and it's important to score well at Kingsbarns because it is traditionally the best-scoring of the three courses.
