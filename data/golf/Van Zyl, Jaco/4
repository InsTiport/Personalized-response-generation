 Q.  How were conditions?  
JACO VAN ZYL: The greens are really firm on Tuesday, Wednesday, so with the breeze coming up, it's tough to give yourself relative birdie chances.  I got off to a nice start this morning and just managed to build on it.   
 Q.  And you got three birdies in a row, 12 to 14.  How important do you think that was to build the momentum?  
JACO VAN ZYL: Very important.  At 10, you always kind of feel that's one to take advantage of.  I parred there, and I just missed a very makeable birdie putt on 11.   
So you know, to get one on 12 kind of got the momentum going, and made a nice one on 13 and hit a great shot into 14.  A little disappointed.  Always feels like you've left one out there, if you don't at least get one playing 16, 17, 18.   
 Q.  We haven't seen you here for a few years.  What made you put this into your schedule this year?  
JACO VAN ZYL: I didn't play much last year.  I normally just go to Dubai, and figured I haven't done the full Desert Swing in a long time.  I've got fairly good memories of Qatar, so here we are.   
 Q.  Pretty solid start to the season.  
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, it's been solid.  No fireworks.  Pretty much the whole season last year, I didn't miss many cuts, but not very good finishes.  So I'm going to try and build on that this year.
