 Q.  How do you feel about that?  
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, obviously it's a good score.  But really felt like I left quite a lot out there.  I hit it nicely today and just didn't quite capitalise where I could.   
I'll obviously try and get them back tomorrow, and get some with interest.  Yeah, really excited to get out there tomorrow.   
 Q.  What were conditions like out there today compared to the last two?  
JACO VAN ZYL: Started off a bit breezy this morning when we started, but it died down a little bit towards the end.  I felt that the back nine definitely played a little bit easier than the front.   
 Q.  Great position, take some confidence into tomorrow?  
JACO VAN ZYL: Yeah, definitely.  Like I said, I've been hitting it nicely and playing nicely the last three days, and I'll take that form into tomorrow.
