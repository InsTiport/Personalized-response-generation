Q.   Nothing cleverer; what are your thoughts winning your first tournament like this?
JIN JEONG:   I was nervous, I was shaking but I controlled myself pretty well all day I thought.   Yeah, I don't know what I've done to be honest.

Q.   Proud of yourself?
JIN JEONG:   Yeah, very, very.   It was great. 

Q.   If we think back to, it's a very young career, but world No. 1 amateur, come back into the pro ranks, I guess it took a little while for things to really happen. 
JIN JEONG:   Yeah, it did to be honest.   I was struggling quite a bit when I was turning pro.   But it was going to happen in the learning circuit I guess and learned a lot from there and it showed up today. 

Q.   We touched on this during the week but learned a lot from playing in Europe in the Middle East and smaller events. 
JIN JEONG:   As I said yesterday, played the Chinese tour, six events this year and a couple‑‑ I was in contention and full off, so I learned the experience from there and definitely I used that experience today. 

Q.   What was your playoff experience prior to this?   Had you been in one? 
JIN JEONG:   I played a playoff‑‑ mini‑tour events, but playing with Ross Fisher, he's one of my heros, as well.   Playing with him in the playoff, it was unbelievable.

Q.   What does it mean to you?   Because you now have a lovely ranking, you've risen up from outside a thousand to something nice and you have a two‑year exemption on The European Tour and you're into Shanghai in two weeks' time?
JIN JEONG:   It means a lot.   I was waiting for something like this for a long time.   I was going to go back to Q‑School Second Stage week after next week but I guess I don't have to anymore.   Definitely a good thing to have. 

Q.   And you'll celebrate with a party?
JIN JEONG:   I don't know what party yet.   I need some rest first.
