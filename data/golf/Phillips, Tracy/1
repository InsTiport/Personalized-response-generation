 Q.   Your thoughts on your round today.   
TRACY PHILLIPS:   It was a little more of a struggle today, especially finishing with an eight on the last hole, that was ‑‑ actually made three bad swings coming down the stretch.   
On 17, that hole seems to grab me a little bit.   
18, I just flared two drives that was out of character.   
But I enjoyed it.   A bad day on the golf course is a lot better than a good day in the office, especially when you're at a Major Championship.
