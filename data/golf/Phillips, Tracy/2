 Q.   I want know your thoughts about the condition of the course out there today.   
TRACY PHILLIPS:   Oh, gosh, it's in great shape.   Yeah, it's fantastic.   The greens make it a little difficult at times, but the speeds are good for the slopes that are on the greens, I think.   Everything's really in good shape.   
   
 Q.   What were your thoughts about your round today, it seemed like it was a little up‑and‑down.   
TRACY PHILLIPS:   It was a little up‑and‑down.   I had it ‑‑ hole number 17 seems to bite me each time.   I made double both times, different ways.   I hit it today in the bunker on the right and it plugged and I tried to get maybe too cute with the first shot and then had a bad lie on the second shot after it rolled up to my footprint.   
But all in all, I'm very pleased.   I'm happy to be out here playing with these guys for the first time in my life, so.  
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward to the most about tomorrow?  
TRACY PHILLIPS:   Just the whole experience.   For some reason I've been a little ‑‑ I made some putts, I've been a lot more calm than I thought I might be.   My parents just flew in today, so that's always special that they can share these next two days with me.   So I'm looking forward to it.   I'm having a ball.  
   
 Q.   Are there a lot of people in Tulsa rooting for you?  
TRACY PHILLIPS:   There's been quite a few people e‑mailed me and texted me and contacted me.   So I got a good cheering section back home.
