 Q.   Great job today.   Talk about the round.   
TRACY PHILLIPS:   Yeah, it's just great to be out here for me.   
I played okay.   I made a bunch of putts that kind of kept me in it.   I had a little oops on the 17th hole.   Hit a bad iron shot.   I made double there.   
But I couldn't be happier.   
   
 Q.   What is it like for you, especially as an alternate, now having this great success on the first day?  
TRACY PHILLIPS:   It's great.   I'm happy just to be in this event and playing with some great players and it's just kind of a dream come true for someone that's always thought about being out here as a kid and stuff, so it's great.   I'm having a great time.  
   
 Q.   What's your overall impression of the course, having been here just for a few days?  
TRACY PHILLIPS:   The golf course is a ma sink.   The greens are a little severe in terms of slopes and stuff, if you get on the wrong side of one it can make you look silly.   
But, fortunately, today I was able to make a couple of comeback putts and stroked some five and 10â€‘footers in.   
But it's a great golf course.  
   
 Q.   What is this like for you as well for all the people back home in Oklahoma who have been cheering for you?  
TRACY PHILLIPS:   Gosh, I got a lot of people who are cheering for me and it's kind of a dream come true for me and certainly my family and just looking forward to playing tomorrow.
