Q. Don't really have a lot of time to think about it, but you're one win away from being champions in your first USGA event.  What does that mean to you?
SAMMI LEE: It's pretty insane.  It hasn't really sunk in.  You're just out there trying to, like we said yesterday, grind it out, but --
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: 18 more holes.  Just play like we've been playing the whole time.
Q. I don't think it's an accident all the teams that got this far seem to be the teams that are having fun out there.  When you go out there this afternoon, is it just fun?  Is it stressful?  Are you just kind of trying to soak in --
SAMMI LEE: There's always nerves, but like --
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: No pressure, though.  It's just fun.  We know Alice and Taylor, and it'll be fun.
SAMMI LEE: It'll be a good match.
Q. How long have you known them?
MARY ELLEN SHUMAN: My brother went to Furman, so I've known them since I've been in college.
