SHIV KAPUR:  I just kept hitting it into bunker after
bunker, not just in the middle of them.  I was either up against
the lip or in the back.  Made two triple bogeys on the front nine,
and 8-over after 6 holes, it's never going to be a good day.  But
you just try and salvage something out of the round.
It was just one of those days that I didn't play very
well, and nothing really went my way.  I felt like I had a couple
of good shots on the back nine that ended up under the lip of a
bunker and bounced out.  That's the nature of the game.  You take
the bounces, you take the good and you take the bad.
Q.  Can you reflect on today.  Forget about the day, just go
back and reflect (inaudible.)
SHIV KAPUR:  Yeah, that's the only way to approach it.
This is a sport.  This is golf.  You have your good days.  You
have your bad days.  You're not always going to have a good day.
The bad days are tough to take.  It's obviously a bad knock.  It's
not something you plan for, you hope for, it happens, you've just
got to take it on the chin and move ahead, just try and salvage
something, get some confidence out of tomorrow's round, and just
try and shoot some kind of good score to get my confidence back.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
SHIV KAPUR:  It gets tougher as the week goes on.  And
the more you play these courses, the better you can sort of get at
them.  But it's a learning experience, that's the only way I can
approach it.  I've learned a lot from the good and from the bad
and how to handle it, and there's obviously some work to be done
that I don't want to repeat mistakes like this.
