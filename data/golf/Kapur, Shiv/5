Q.   Happy man with that finish? 
SHIV KAPUR:   Yeah yesterday I finished with a bitter taste in my mouth and today to birdie the last is pretty good.   Played solid all day.   The key for me, setting out, I wanted to go bogey‑free and to do that is pretty good.   I know out here you get your birdie chances but if you can keep the mistakes off the card, that's the challenge in the end and I managed to do that. 
The front nine plays I think a couple of shots harder than the back, and the back is where you can really make your score.   Just try to avoid the mistakes.   Hit a lot of greens today.   Didn't make a lot of putts early in my round but stayed patient and I think that was the key.   I guess the late birdies were the reward for the patience.

Q.   And the latest birdie, did you take a sneaky peak to the leaderboard and think, name is at the top now‑‑
SHIV KAPUR:   When I looked at it‑‑ I just said, look, if you make birdie, one‑shot deficit is better than two, and two is better than three.   Today is just a day of putting yourself in position.   Obviously a long way to go in the golf tournament, but the more birdies I can make today, the easier it is tomorrow. 
Whether it's the Challenge Tour or the main tour, winning is always hard and winning always takes the same kind of thing.   For me winning recently in the last couple of months has been good and I know what kind of juices will be flowing and I know what to expect, and also realise that sometimes you can make a couple of mistakes and still a win a golf tournament, and I think that's been the biggest realisation for me in the last few months.
