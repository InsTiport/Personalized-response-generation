 Q.   Well played, 66, what was key to that?  
SHIV KAPUR:   Just putting.   I holed everything I looked at.   Actually didn't drive the ball very well at all, even on the last hole, drove it in the hazard, but was able to recover every time.   And if I hit it a green, I seemed to be able to putt in.   It was just a case of getting the putter hot and when that happens, you're going to go low.  
   
 Q.   What do you think of the challenge of the golf course?   Jack Nicklaus designed it and the players have been talking about it this week.   
SHIV KAPUR:   It's fantastic.   It's a course that rewards good golf and if you hit shots offâ€‘line you'll get penalised.   You have to drive it pretty straight.   The greens are soft and receptive but the greens are tucked away.   It's a fair test.   A bad shot will get penalised and good golf shots will be rewarded and I think that's the way a golf course should be.  
   
 Q.   Quite a slow start to the season for you, so where does this form come from?  
SHIV KAPUR:   I haven't played very much.   I've been very lucky, BMW and Marco have been very nice to give me to invite this week, and I have a chance to show what's going on with me.   I've been playing pretty well.   Feel that I just haven't had as many opportunities as I would like, and this is a good start for me and I just need to build on that.   
   
 Q.   Did you feel good coming into this week then?   
SHIV KAPUR:   I did.   I played at St. Omer last week and felt like I was close to putting things together.   I had a lot of rounds where I was a couple under after 14 or 15 and nice to finish the round off.
