 Q. Tell us about your round?  
 SHIV KAPUR:  I didn't too much round. In the final day, the pins are always tough. It's a matter of patience when you're coming from behind and I went to attack and had to defend which is a fine line. Only blemish on the card was on 12, I should have been looking at a three but ended up with a five. Any time you finish with two birdies, you have to feel good about your round. 

 Q.  You started the week under the weather but improved. 
 SHIV KAPUR:  If anyone had told me at the start of the week you'll be 14 under par, I'll be laughing at them. It's a bonus. That's the way the game is sometimes, you get good breaks and you get bad breaks. I felt really bad on Wednesday and didn't know if I would tee it up in my hometown but sometimes things work out better. I hope I'm well more often so that I can play better golf. 

 Q.  A better performance here than at the Indian Masters. 
 SHIV KAPUR:  I can't say I'm satisfied as you always say you can do better. But it's a bit of a redemption from the Indian Masters. It's nice that I came out to play well and I had a chance to win. Only if you win, you can be satisfied. How I finished, feels good. I feel my game is in the right direction and that week will come around. I'm happy but not satisfied. 

 Q.  Indians have performed well the last few week. Thoughts? 
 SHIV KAPUR:  I had no doubt in my mind that the Indians would do well. If I had to put my money down, I would have put my money down on an Indian. But that didn't happen. However, I think we've showcased to the world that we could play against the top players and we stacked up against the best of them. It's a very encouraging sign.
