   SHIV KAPUR:  I was lucky. I got the good end of the draw and was out there almost before daybreak. There was no wind for my first 10 or 12 holes and made a few putts and just kept it going.   
  
  Q.  You  finished tied 45th last year. Did that experience help?   
 SHIV KAPUR:  Yes, good memories of also shooting 66 in the second round last year so it was nice to repeat that score in the second round this time!   
  
  Q.  Good finish in the HSBC but you've changed your swing since then?   
 SHIV KAPUR:  Yes, I saw my coach, Peter Murphy, in Dallas. I spent four or five days there over Christmas and made some changes and it seems to be working. I haven't played much golf and feel mentally refreshed and are ready to go. I don't want to look at the leaderboard. Just go out and keep doing what I am doing and maybe at the 72nd hole on Sunday I can have a look at the leaderboard.   
I was hitting it great yesterday but couldn't make the putts. I did today. It was one of those days when I had no confidence in the putter but I had more comfort in the putter today. The longest I made was only 15 feet but I made some good ones early in the round. Not really bombs, just 10 or 12 footers.   
I feel at home here with the Indian population, and I get a lot of support from the people out there. It's nice.   
  
  Q.  Nice to be in this position after time off?   
  KAPUR:  Yes, midway through my first round I was struggling to make the cut. It's funny how it can change so quickly.   
  
  Q.  Your coach in Dallas?   
SHIV KAPUR:  He came over for the Indian Open and I played the Volvo Masters of Asia and felt I needed to sort my swing and I went to see Peter in Dallas. He is Australian but lives in Texas.
