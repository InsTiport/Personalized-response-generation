Q. Just take me through Q-Series, what you kind of came into the week with, like the mentality you have. Is it a fresh start? Positives? Negatives?
BRIANNA DO: Well, first off, I've never done Q-Series, so this is all new to me.
But obviously it's a marathon, eight rounds, two weeks, two courses. It's just I took the last two weeks to really refresh. It's been a touch season out on the LPGA and I just needed to figure a few things out.
I think I did a good job of doing that, and had a good day today.
