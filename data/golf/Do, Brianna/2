Q. Take us through the hole-in-one?
BRIANNA DO: You know, I've been having a tough day the last few days.  But you know, I just felt really comfortable with the club we talked about hitting, my caddie and I.  It was just a nice, smooth 8-iron.
Probably one of the best shots I hit today.  The guys up at the green said it took two hops short of the green and then on to the green and then just kind of rolled in.  Didn't have to work too hard on that hole.
Q. For you, did you have to compete with the windy conditions in did you think about that as you went for it?
BRIANNA DO: It was much windier today than yesterday afternoon, and I think it's supposed to get even windier today.
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't too crazy out there, but it was definitely more windy than yesterday.
Q. And for you, every time there's a hole-in-one made, a lot of money gets donated to St. Jude.  What does that mean to you and what do you think about the cause that is the hole-in-one program?
BRIANNA DO: I think it's awesome.  I mean, St. Jude does so much for children and families and everything when they are struggling with health issues, and so I think it's a great cause.  For me to help donate in any way, is a small part in a bigger cause.
