 JOHN BUSH:   Thanks for coming by the interview room.  Congratulations on a great round.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Thank you.
JOHN BUSH:   Can I get some general thoughts on how it went out there for you today?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I didn't have any -- I didn't have too many big mistakes, and my putts and my shots were very good.
JOHN BUSH:   Can you take us through your round with your birdies and your one bogey?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I don't remember too much, but anyhow, driver, 3-wood, 20 yards to the 3rd shot to about 9 feet.  Driver, approximate 15-yard approach shot, about 10 centimeters which is about what, 5 inches, 6 inches.
JOHN BUSH:   Number 16.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  7-iron about -- a little less than 15 feet, I think.
JOHN BUSH:   18.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  9-iron, 2nd shot, 146 yards to about 12 feet.
JOHN BUSH:   And No. 2.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  3-wood, 91 yards left, wedge, about 6 feet.
JOHN BUSH:   Bogey on No. 3.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  169 left, used a 7, it was short about 10 yards and 3rd shot went over to 6 feet, 2-putt bogey.

Q.  What hole was that?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  That's the bogey on No. 3.
JOHN BUSH:   No. 3, his 12th.  And the 7th hole?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  145 left, used a pitching wedge, right collar of the green, used a putter from the fringe.  It was about 20 feet. 
JOHN BUSH:  Then on No. 9?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Used a 2-iron off the tee, about 118 left, 2nd shot used a wedge.  It actually -- it bounced about 6 feet past the hole, spun back, hit the cup, lipped out and about maybe a foot left.

Q.  118 yards, you say?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  118, yes.
JOHN BUSH:   Questions?
Q.  Is this your first time playing the golf course and how did you like it?
