JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Hidemichi, for joining us for a few minutes.  Great start today, seven under par, 64.  Do you want to make a couple of comments about your round and then we'll go into questions.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I wasn't feeling very well today.  However, I took each shot one shot at a time carefully.  I felt tee shots were very important, to keep it on the fairway, hit a good tee shot.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Questions?
Q.  Why were you under the weather?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  It's my 28th tournament and just probably physically a little bit tired, feel a little bit tired.

Q.  Feel any better after this?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Getting better.  Maybe because I'm not feeling well, my legs are feeling a little bit weaker, so I didn't swing as hard as I should or could, so maybe that was better.  The end result was a better result because of that.

Q.  Are you playing this number of events just because you feel like you're a rookie and you need to  get as many tournaments under your belt as possible?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Of course I'm a rookie, but it's my first time full-time this year, and one reason is I wanted to see all the courses on the PGA Tour, and the other reason is because the money rank was not that high.  I wanted to get up at least under 125.

Q.  What moved you to decide to come over and play this tour?  Obviously you could have made a killing over in Japan.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I played the Japanese Tour for approximately seven years, and during that time, two or three times a year, I would come here to play on the PGA Tour, and I know to play with the best in the world I have to come to the PGA Tour, and I felt that in order to become a better player I felt I needed to come here.

Q.  Do you feel like this first year has made you a better player?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I'm not sure yet.

Q.  Have you shared the lead at other points this year?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Maybe in Canon, the Greater Hartford Open.

Q.  You're listed at 5'6" and 132 pounds.  You're  giving away a lot of inches, giving away a lot of inches and a lot of pounds to your competitors.  What keeps you with the same length?  Why can you hit it as far as they can?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I feel I need to.  Because I'm small I feel I want to beat the big guys.  That's my feeling, so then I feel that maybe the kids will look at me and say because I can do it at this size, the kids can also do it.  Motivation, I guess.

Q.  You heated up on the back nine obviously. Was there a key shot that just really got your round going?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  On the 10th tee I put it in the rough but made a bogey there, but on the next hole I made a birdie, and I think that was the key hole maybe.

Q.  Is it fair to list you at 132 pounds?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  About 61 kilos.  I don't know too much in pounds.  61 kilos, whatever that works out to.  27-inch waist.

Q.  David Duval, we're used to his name.  We all had to look up Tanaka.  How are you going to sleep tonight?  Is this a unique kind of thing?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I sleep well every day.

Q.  You're tired after playing 28 events, right? 
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I don't have as much stress as I have when I play in Japan.

Q.  Do you feel like you can always go through here with some anonymity?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  In Japan every time I go -- maybe you don't believe this, but in Japan every time I go out to dinner or anywhere, people come up to me and ask for autographs or pictures or whatever, all the attention, and here in the United States, maybe you won't believe me, but no one knows about me, so I feel that much less stress.

Q.  How difficult is the rough?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  From my height that's very difficult.  I need to wear higher shoes.  I really feel that Bermuda rough is pretty thick, and the taller you are, it's a little bit more advantage.  I just feel that I just don't take too many chances, I just hit it out.

Q.  Is driving accurately one of your strengths?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I think so, according to the data, the statistics out there.  This year it's been very good.

Q.  Hole by hole?
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Just the birdies and bogeys.  What club did you use to No. 3? 
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  I'm nervous now:  My tee shot went in the rough, I pitched out with an 8-iron, 70 yards, sand wedge.

Q.  To how far?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  About two meters, which is a little over six feet, I guess.
No. 7, 4-iron second shot.

Q.  To the green?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  About four meters, which is about 12 feet, a little bit over 12 feet.
And then 9, the par 4, 170, 7-iron about six meters, which is about 20 feet, I guess.

Q.  Bogey at 10?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Put it in the rough, the tee shot.  I used a 6-iron and put it in the rough again.  I had about 120 left, used a pitching wedge, on the collar of the green, two-putt.

Q.  No. 11?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  138 left, 9-iron, three meters, about 12, 15 feet.

Q.  12?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  125 yards with a wedge, two meters, a little over six feet.

Q.  15, the par 5?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  240 yards, used a 3-wood.  It was in the rough.

Q.  So short of the green?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  No, right of the green, just about 15-yard approach shot to about three feet, four feet, about one meter.

Q.  16?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Par 4, 173 yards, 7-iron to 12 feet, 15 feet.

Q.  17?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  7-iron to about six feet.
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Good job.
Q.  How long was the putt on 18?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  About four meters, about 12 feet.

Q.  Did you think you had given it a chance?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  It was kind of a hook.

Q.  You played too much break?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  Too much break.  I was thinking if I put this in I would be on top of it and I knew I would come to the interview room and I was wondering what I would speak about in here, that pressure.

Q.  How is your English?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA:  It's one word.  "I am over the moon," and "McDonald's". 
JOAN v.T. ALEXANDER:  Thank you very much for joining us.
