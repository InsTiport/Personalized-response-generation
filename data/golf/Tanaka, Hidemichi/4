TODD BUDNICK:   We have Hidemichi Tanaka, rounds of 64, 70, have him 8 under par, the leader heading into the clubhouse.  Hidemichi, kind of an up-and-down round today, a couple birdies, a couple bogeys.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Yesterday as you know, it was very good score for me.  I have only 23 putting stroke, and then today the putting was not so good as yesterday, so the result, this result today.  He feels not so bad, just the result was not so good.

Q.  Well, it must be nice to have a bad result but still be atop the leaderboard?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: During my round I thought other players will play well, I mean, like 9-under or 10-under, but I found actually not, so I realized that if he play good I can still stay at the top, one of the top positions.

Q.  His birdies and bogeys?  You bogeyed the first hole, No. 10?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Tee shot was into the bunker, left side.  Second shot was on the green but away from  -- eight meters - from here to the door.

Q.  25, 26 feet?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Yeah, and then three-putt.

Q.  12, birdie?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I don't remember very well.

Q.  That's all right.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: 12, birdie.

Q.  15, the par 5?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: My second shot was 220 yards, goes to the side of the green, and then from there 20-yard approach, then I made birdie.

Q.  What were the clubs that you used?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: 3-wood.

Q.  And then a chip, and then how far was the putt?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: One meter.

Q.  And then 18, bogey?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Hit second shot to the pin with 9-iron, was short, then my approach  -- 30-yard approach to the pin, went over about three meters, and then I made two-putt.

Q.  Bogey on 5?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: 6-iron into the bunker, and then I should approach but I didn't make it, just the edge, the fringe, from here to the door, and then two putts.
7, my second shot, 215 yards with a 5-iron, then about 15 meters  - from here to the door, and then two putts and made birdie.

Q.  No. 7.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: 199 yards, four meters, so half length from here to the door.

Q.  Talk a little bit about the round today.
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Now I play today is not so different from yesterday.  Yesterday I only had a lucky bounce or lucky putt into the cup, so I am satisfied with how I played today.

Q.  Are you still tired?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I'm okay.  On the last hole I still was overreading, and then there are many players with 7-under, and I, of course, hoped to finish 8-under, just only one player, and then I thought the taste of the hot dog will be different after I made it 8-under because I'm hungry.

Q.  After two solids, do you allow yourself to think about what it would be like to win the tournament?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I really don't know  -- probably afternoon some players will proceed to eight or nine, so I don't know where I'll finish today.  I only have once finished best ten this year, so I just want to finish  -- a better finish, in the best ten.

Q.  Would you rather be leading tomorrow when you start or back a little bit?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I really don't care about tomorrow.  The day after tomorrow, Sunday.

Q.  Do you want the pressure of being last, being first?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I am just happy.

Q.  It doesn't matter as long as you do well?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I feel very happy if I can play with a good player on Sunday in the last group and then compete against with them, so I'd like to do only that.  Last year I played with Mr.  David Duval in Japan down in Dunlop Phoenix, but probably he does not remember me.  David Duval does not remember me.  So if I played with him on Sunday and then he wants to remind him, and then I will let him remember how I played, how I play.

Q.  You said yesterday you're very famous in Japan.  How much more famous now after two good days?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Just only a good result for two days is not enough, so I want pose holding the victory cup and many people will feel I'm a good player.

Q.  When you played with Duval in Phoenix how did you play?
HIDEMICHI TANAKA: David Duval was leading, but I just managed to make the cut.
TODD BUDNICK:  Everybody good?  All right, thank you.
