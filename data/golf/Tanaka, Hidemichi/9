 Q. Are you very happy with your round today?
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Amazing. 
 
Q. Tell us about it, the eagle -- the important hole of the course for you. 
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I try to make a 2-putt, but in the cup. So surprise.  
 
Q. How different are the conditions here at Valderrama to what you are used to?
 
Q. As opposed to Japan. 
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Yes, it is very difficult because of the point, it's very narrow. And
always I have to keep my concentration during playing golf. And also, if I miss the shot
to the woods or whatever. So I think about this hole is par 5, you know? Instead of par 4.
 
 
Q. Is there a difference in difficulty the first nine holes versus the last nine holes?
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Well, every hole very tough to me, so I cannot tell back nine or
front nine. But right now, because of everybody coming to me and, you know, I can't speak
English. So that's more difficult to me.  
 
Q. How did you score so well on the first nine holes?
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Because yesterday, the front nine was so bad, the ball comes
everywhere. So that's why I just focused on keeping the ball straight. 
 
Q. How valuable an experience is it to just compete well in this tournament?
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: Because I played with Steve Flesch, and he's very good this year. So
I'm just watching him as the gallery of spectators, so I do not focus on myself very much.
I just relax, and so it's valuable. But this tournament is a World Championship. This is
my first tournament, a big tournament like this. So that's why I'm surprised about that.
But I'm just keeping focused on playing like just like a spectator.  
 
Q. What does it mean playing in the same field as Tiger Woods?
 
 HIDEMICHI TANAKA: I want his autograph.
