Q.  How did you think you played today?
CHRIS WIEMERS:  It was up and down.  I had a triple bogey on I think 13, the par 3, and then a couple bogeys on par 5s.  I think I should have probably birdied those.  I played all right, though, other than those three holes.  If I could take those away
Q.  First time you've gotten this far?
CHRIS WIEMERS:  I played Baltusrol last year.
Q.  How did you do there?
CHRIS WIEMERS:  I missed the cut.  I shot 74 77.
Q.  Did you have a good following last year?
CHRIS WIEMERS:  We had a pretty good following last year.
Q.  Are you expecting better things tomorrow?
CHRIS WIEMERS:  I am expecting better things.  With the exception of about three holes, four holes maybe, I played good, real good, and I think that if I can minimize those mistakes tomorrow, there's no reason I can't shoot 3 , 4 under par.
