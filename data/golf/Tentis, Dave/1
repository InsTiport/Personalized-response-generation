 Q.   Tough day out there today.   First off, can you talk about the conditions?  
DAVE TENTIS:   Yeah, you know it was a little wet.   But I mean it was playable, for sure.   The greens were holding very nicely and putting nicely, too.   Just another 79 for me.  
   
 Q.   Can you talk about your tournament overall and the experience?   
DAVE TENTIS:   You know, it's a great experience.   It's obviously a huge test to try and come in here and be competitive after putting the hours in at the shop.   It's a great opportunity.   It's a nice bonus that the PGA of America gives its members if you can finish in the Top 20.   It would be nice if I was a little more competitive.   I know some of the other guys played better.  
   
 Q.   This is your fourth PGA?  
DAVE TENTIS:   Fifth.  
   
 Q.   How does this one compare to the others?  
DAVE TENTIS:   It's been like nine years.   I think the guys that are hitting it longer or I'm hitting it shorter.   You know, I recall difficult golf course like before.   I played four in a row.   So the golf courses are extremely challenging.   But the guys were fun to play with and, like I said, it's a great experience.
