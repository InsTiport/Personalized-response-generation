   PHILLIP ARCHER:  I got the swing going on the back nine and had some good yardages. Hit a good drive on the tenth and that was a good birdie and then 12, 13 and 14 I just had good yardages.   
  
  Q.  Were you fighting it on the front nine?   
 PHILLIP ARCHER:  I started fine and then one bad tee shot and I got a bit quick. I am trying to work on things where if you hit a bad shot to challenge yourself to hit a good one and not dwell on it. Get up and down. I did that on the ninth and goot up and down for a five after finding the water and that gave me a boost to push on from there. Played the next five holes in four under.   
I am only two or three shots behind and I like the last days when I am in contention. I am confident I can put one on the board and hope it is good enough.   
  
  Q.  What would it mean if it is good enough?   
 PHILLIP ARCHER:  It is what I have been building up to the whole time I have been playing golf., to lift a trophy and after three seconds last year believed I could do that so it would mean a hell of a lot really.
