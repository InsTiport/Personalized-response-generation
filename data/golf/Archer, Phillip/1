 Q. Beautiful round of golf, but the hole-in-one, obviously the highlight; did you have any feeling?
 PHILLIP ARCHER: We had a similar yardage yesterday and the wind was the same and it gently rolled in which was lovely.

 Q. It gets a round going and with the huge delay this morning, that sets you back, but it really got you going. 
 PHILLIP ARCHER: Yeah, I tried to stay loose this morning. I had three practice sessions and so I was quite loose when I went out. That really got me going. I bogeyed the fourth and came straight back with a birdie there but got me going with a birdie on 8. 

 Q. How many have you had in your career?
 PHILLIP ARCHER: Only my second in 17 years as a pro. 

 Q. This one was for a magnum of champagne, was the other for a car?
 PHILLIP ARCHER: Yes, and I'm not complaining. At the time it was brilliant, first one I experienced in a tournament, actual European tournament. 

 Q. Huge boost at this time of year, bubble territory, 112 on the Order of Merit, very important couple of weeks coming up. 
 PHILLIP ARCHER: Yeah, it makes a nice change to be talking to you guys after the round. I've not done it for quite a while. It's nice to come back with five tournaments left. 
 I can still turn it into a good year to tell the truth. I've been playing well but not scoring well. Today the putter started working again, so no reason why I can't finish the tournament off well.
