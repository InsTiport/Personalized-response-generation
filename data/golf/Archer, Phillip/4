   PHILLIP ARCHER: I am happy to play anywhere. I am playing well and putting well and if I keep it up I think I can give someone a good match, whether it's front, middle or back. I think the boys will do it tomorrow. We couldn't do much more this morning. They got the breaks on the 18th. That was the difference.
