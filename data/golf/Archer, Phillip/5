   PHILLIP ARCHER:: We dovetailed well. We holed some important ones for halves and shut the door of them when they were trying to get back at us. 14 and 15 were key - I holed a six-footer for a half on 14 and Brad holed a 20 footer for a birdie on the next to win and put us two up and three to play. It's a completely new experience. I had a few butterflies on the first tee but hit a good tee shot and that settled me down. There was more blue than red on the board all day so to finish only 3-2 down is a big bonus.
