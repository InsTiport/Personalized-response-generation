 Q.   Some excellent numbers on the scorecard.   Give us a sense of how you compiled them.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, started pretty good.   A couple birdies on the first couple holes, and well, a hiccup mid round but got it back on the next hole making a long putt.   
Played very solid.   Didn't do anything extraordinary but I holed some good putts.   I missed some shots, as well, but pretty steady overall and quite happy with the result.   I saved a couple of good pars on the last two.   
   
 Q.   I understand you had some problems getting into the country.   Tell me about that.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, my girlfriend, she's from Czech Republic, and always forget that she doesn't have Spanish passport, so she needed a Visa to get in.   It was my fault, I forgot about it, and we got very, very lucky with the help of Nick Tarrat, the Tournament Director, he helped a lot.   We were very lucky in the end and they let us in.   So it was a stressful moment, but it was fine in the end.   
   
 Q.   You got to play with Tiger Woods in the final round last week.   I saw your reaction when you saw that you were going to play with him; you were quite excited.   How was the experience despite not a great day on the course?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, the experience was great.   The first time in my life I played with him, so I always grew up watching him on TV, and it was a little nerve breaking for me, I was a little nervous.   But in the end, I think it was a good experience for me to realise that I can be amongst the top players.   It was fun.   I didn't play good, but it was fun.   
   
 Q.   That's a very satisfying start to this championship, isn't it?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I wasn't feeling great at the warm‑up, but I just looked forward and it turned out to be a great day.   I started pretty good with a couple birdies, so that helps.   I kept it very steady, didn't do anything special.   But made a couple long putts for birdie, and overall, very quiet round and it felt like it was easy.  
   
 Q.   That quiet round came to life in the end with three birdies in a row.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I made a long putt‑‑ on the par5, I hit the green in two, 2‑putted there, and the next one, I made one of the long putts of the day.   
And on 16, I hit a great 5‑iron to three feet, made that, and saved a couple good pars on the end.   I made a couple‑‑ 4‑footer and 5‑footer for par so quite happy at the end.  
   
 Q.   After a largely very good week in Turkey, you've had a bit of disruption here; not quite the preparation you wanted.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I forgot about my girlfriend's Visa.   I always think she's got a Spanish passport but she's got a Czech Republic passport.   It was very stressful but we got very lucky with the help of Nick Tarrat and the captain of immigration when we got in at three in the morning.   So we got very lucky in the end.   They let her in so it was fine.  
   
 Q.   A lot of hanging around at the airport, was it?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yes, it was very stressful.   They wouldn't let us check in at the beginning.   We had Travel Services, the guys from Fairway helping, as well.   A lot of people helped me, so we were very lucky with everybody around.   
   
 Q.   Last time we spoke, you were looking forward to the fourth round in Turkey and the first appearance against Tiger Woods, as well as Henrik Stenson in that group, so I know it didn't work out score‑wise, but do you take things from that?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I do.   I think it was a positive experience for me.   You know, it's one guy that you always look up to, and it was difficult to get in the normal state of my golf.   But I had fun.   It was fun watching him.   It was positive, because I can now think that I can do as good as the top guys, so why not.
