 Q. 5-under par, good start today?
 ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, it was a good day, better than it looked, I think. I started out a little, not consistent with my game but I putted good. That was the key. I made a long -- a good putt on 9 for birdie and made a long putt for 10 on birdie and that got me going a little bit. I managed to birdie, I think it was -- I made a long putt on 14, from 15, 20 feet, three in a row there. Then didn't miss shots on the back nine, so that's good.
 But the front nine, my swing was a little on and off. But it was good. Overall very nice.

 Q. Continuing the good form this season, you've had a lot of terrific form, good finishes and things are going well for you.
 ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: They are. They are. After last year, when I missed my card, so I'm very happy about this year. I achieved my goal and now I have higher ones and try to get them and playing very good and feeling confident and see where it goes from here.
