  SARAH GWYNN:   Well played today, thanks for joining us.   Just sum up how your day's been.
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   It was a great day for me.   Started off really well.   I hit the ball a lot better than the previous days.   I didn't roll the greens very well.   I didn't see some putts, didn't read them very well.   But overall very satisfied.   I made some good putts for birdie and I kept it going, even making a couple bogeys coming in.   So finished very well, and very, very happy to be here. 
SARAH GWYNN:   I understand your father had a very good record in this event with four Top 10s; how good would it be to go one better and win this one.
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   It would be great but there's still a long way to go.   I think my father made a few Top 10s in his career, so every tournament I play, he's done something, so we are not going to look at that.   I'm just going to look at trying to play, do the same as what I've been doing and see what happens in the end. 

Q.   How much of an influence is your father in your recent career, and did you speak to him every day?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I think I speak to my parents every day just like every other person, not just golf.   Golf is a very normal thing in my family, so they are very used to this.   Like I said, my father was a great player, and growing up, we have seen this before, so nobody's very surprised in my family.   They are probably very happy. 
Obviously he's been a big influence.   He taught me how to play and he's the reason probably why I'm playing golf.   Myself, I can't be trying to do what my father's done, because my father has done great things, and I'm still starting to be a better golfer than I was a few years ago.   So just going to try to do the same thing for tomorrow and stay in the present moment and give it 100 percent. 

Q.   I think a lot of people would look at the leaderboard today and probably a lot of people in there writing the stories now for the papers are going to look at the leaderboard and they are going to assume that Lee Westwood will be the winner tomorrow; what's your opinion? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, my opinion is, I understand why they would assume that.   This sport has proven that it's not always what it looks like and it's not always what it should be.   This sport is a very special one, and anything can happen and anybody can win.   Anybody within five shots or with any opportunity can win, so you know, his career‑‑ he's had a great career and everybody will expect that, but in the end, nobody knows. 

Q.   Terrific atmosphere among the crowd out there today; secondly, what did you think of the young rookie that you were playing with, Eddie Pepperell?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Firstly, the crowds are great here.   Can't ask for better.   They clap for you on every green.   The only other tournament that that happens in my experience is the British Open.   So it's a pleasure to be playing with these crowds, and it's a lot of fun for us. 
Eddie and I had a great day of golf, not only by the results, but he's got great talent, he hits the ball very well, and he seems very confident, and I think he's going to have a great career.   I enjoyed playing with him today. 

Q.   How pleased are you with the finish given that you nearly missed a few chances early on with a couple bogeys on the back nine?   And secondly, I won't ask you to go over the whole story about China, but just how are you physically, as well?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I'm very pleased with the finish, because I missed a few putts coming in on the back nine.   Made a couple bogeys, so I'm extra‑pleased, because coming from some misses, I had give myself the opportunity to make some good birdies in the end; didn't get down, and I finished with birdie, birdie, and I fixed the misses I made. 
And in regards of how I'm feeling, I'm okay.   I'm just a little tired more than normal.   Every now and then, I get a little weird feeling in my head.   It's just‑‑ all the doctors say it's normal.   I'm not in my full strength, but it's working for me, so I'm not going to complain.   Hopefully it stays like that and I feel weak tomorrow, as well. 

Q.   It's a heavy trophy. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I think I'll be all right (smiling). 

Q.   How did you feel when you struck the tee shot at 18?   Because it looked like it might be going right; did you think that you were going to end up with a birdie? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   No, it was the worst swing of the day.   It's a tight tee shot.   You have the bunkers on the left that are reachable and then you have the trees on the right that you want to fit it in between to give yourself a chance to hit it in two. 
It was a terrible swing.   I blocked it, and I thought‑‑ I blocked it so much that I thought it didn't carry the trees.   So I thought it was in the trees.   I hit a provisional ball and we were lucky it missed the tree by a bit.   I thought it was in the bushes. 
Never thought it was‑‑ never thought that's where it was going to end up; the second shot was tough, as well.   I had to fade it with a 9‑iron or slice it with a 9‑iron; I did it, and in the end I gave myself a great number and made birdie. 

Q.   Your tiredness, has it changed your attitude to the round at all or your strategy? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, I've been working on that for the full year, working on my attitude, because, you know, personally, I am a little‑‑ I push myself a little too much.   I push; I don't want to make any mistakes.   I want to control everything, which is impossible, and that's what I've been working on, trying to accept the misses, as well as the birdies. 
This week, I was just happy to be able to swing the club.   I wasn't feeling great.   After the practise round on Tuesday, I felt really tired because it was the first 18 holes I walked in three weeks.   So I was very tired.   I had a big headache, so I had no idea how I was going to feel for the tournament, and very pleased how it's ending up to be working for me. 

Q.   Tomorrow will probably be the biggest day of your career going out in the last match of the day with player like Lee Westwood; how do you feel about that, and how do you think you'll cope with the nerves on the first tee? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, I'm sure I'm going to be nervous.   I'm sure I'm going to be more nervous than Lee Westwood. 
It's a great opportunity for me.   It's a pleasure to be there.   I did not expect it but obviously very welcome to be able to play with Lee Westwood, and I've done it a few times before so I know how it is.   I'm just going to try to enjoy it and play my golf, be focused on every shot, be focused on my game and play my golf and see what happens, that's all I can ask for. 
SARAH GWYNN:   Thank you.
