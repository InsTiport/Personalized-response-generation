Q. Fantastic round of golf.  Everything seemed to go right out there today?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, the first; I would say, 12 holes, I played great.  Didn't miss many shots.  It was very fun.  Had a little luck on a couple coming in on 6 and 7.  But yeah, overall, played great.  I missed a few, but I made a couple par putts on 2, my 11th hole, and the par 5, I think it was 5.
Very pleased, birdied the last, on 9, difficult hole.  Very pleased.
Q. I've got to ask, do you think it could have been lower?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: I think it could have been lower.  I missed a short one there, but you know, couldn't complain, as I hit the pin.  But I missed a three- or four-footer for birdie, and I missed a six-footer on the next.  But you know, I missed a couple, but I made -- obviously I made a few, so I can't complain.  Golf is like that.
Q. How would you describe your golf at the moment?  We've been following your progress.  You were joint winner of Tour School.  It was a bit of a struggle last year but something seems to be working right now.  What is it?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Well, I've been working with Robert Rock and his partner, Liam, and I've been working on my swing quite good.  I like the way we are working on it and it feels easier, the things I'm doing.  I started working on my short game back with my old coach, Mike Walker, and he's helped me.  My short game is getting there.
So it's just a matter of letting it happen.  I feel comfortable.  I haven't been able to practise much.  The last two months, I had a baby, so I haven't been able to practise much, which sometimes, it helps because there's no expectations.
So it was a great round and I'm happy the way it went, and excited for the week.
