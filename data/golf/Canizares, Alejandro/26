Q.  You bogeyed the first, level par for the tournament and then 8 under on 17.  What was the key to that success?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  I putted better today.  I putted better than yesterday and I got more confident with my irons off the tee.  Yesterday I was a little sideways from the tee with my driver but I hit it better today and putted really good.
Q.  You went to college in America, Arizona State; Mickelson and Casey went there, too, and you had a tremendously successful time there, how useful was that to you going to America?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  It was really helpful because you really learn how to manage your schedule, wake up early, work out and do the things that you have to do to be a professional.  The golf courses are great, and the competition is great.
Q.  Your father is a very popular and successful player on our tour, how much has he helped you with your career?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  He taught me how to play and I learned how to play golf watching him since I was little.
Q.  Your third tournament, were you surprised when you won?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  Of course, but it happened I got lucky one week, I played great.
Q.  Was contention as you expected it to be, the nerves?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  Well, nerves, obviously I have pressure but I was playing great last week, two weeks ago and I was really confident that everything happened my way.
Q.  How much will that experience help you here over the weekend?
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES:  A lot. It gives you a lot of confidence on how to manage pressure and how to manage the nerves, stay confident and keep doing what you're doing.
