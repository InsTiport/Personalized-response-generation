 Q.  How did the course play today, as opposed to yesterday?  
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES: Yeah, well, in the afternoon, the greens are quite a bit firmer than yesterday.  The pins were a lot tougher I thought, but my game wasn't as good as yesterday, so it felt like it was playing really tough.   
The wind was quite strong and it was -- you know, with the trees, you never know if it's in off the left or in off the right.  It can change pretty quickly.  I just didn't hit the ball very well.  I missed a few shots left.  I wasn't very -- as confident as yesterday obviously and a few putts that I could have made on the back nine, could have solved a 3-over, could have been even par if I made a couple but just, you know, I couldn't score on the back nine.   
 Q.  You're very much in contention here.  You're only a couple of shots back at the moment.  What has the experience taught you about holding it together when the winds are like this and the conditions are tough?  
ALEJANDRO CANIZARES: Yeah, you know, you wish that experience could help more, but yeah, you have to be patient and you have to know -- I wasn't looking at the leaderboard, so I was a little, you know, 3-over, wasn't a good round for me.  But I was trying to push but I just wasn't hitting good shots.  I was missing the fairways and I was hitting poor shots on to the green.  Just going to hit some balls and get that feeling back and ready for tomorrow.  It looks like everybody is in it.  You know, 5-under is leading and this golf course, you know, it's tough.  Depend on the wind.  In the afternoon, the greens do get firmer and it's more difficult.
