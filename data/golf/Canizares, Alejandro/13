 Q.   Take us through the last there, because that was a lovely save in the end?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, the tee shot wasn't great, I heeled it very badly.   It was pretty short.   There was a chance to go in two if I hit a normal drive.   But since I missed it, I just had to lay it up, and it was a routine, ordinary lay‑up.   That is probably why I wasn't too into that shot.   I think it was a mental mistake, and I pull‑hooked it in the water.   I thought it had a chance to stay up, but it was a terrible shot.   
But in the end, I gave myself a chance and I really wanted to make that putt, because I haven't dropped a shot in the whole day and I didn't feel like I should have.   Made that putt and it felt great.  
   
 Q.   I'll state the obvious, but sinking that putt does mean you're in a tremendous position here.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I knew that it was difficult to stay up there, because it's great players.   But just play my golf and playing the way I'm playing, I know I was going to shoot a decent score and today felt like I could have shot much better.   But after that putt on the end, I'm not going to complain.   
   
 Q.   Are you conscious of how the scores were going and what Henrik Stenson was doing?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   No, I haven't looked at the leaderboard at all.   I knew where I was standing and I wasn't paying attention‑‑ it's too early to pay attention to that I think.   So I just played my golf and in the end, it paid off.   
   
 Q.   After three rounds last week, you were saying, it's about time you did something in elite company.   Is it still that kind of feel?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, why not.   I played with Henrik on Sunday, and he's a fun guy to play with, and tomorrow I'm just going to go out there and enjoy it and focus on my game, and hit shot after shot.   That's all I can do.   
   
 Q.   Is it the best you've ever made, consistently, like this?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I don't know.   It's been too long as a professional.   I don't remember every round I've played.   But I'm playing pretty good.   Nothing out of control but the front nine today was probably as good as it golf.
