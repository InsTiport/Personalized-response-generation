 Q.   Thoughts on shooting 5‑under par to start here?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   It's great.   I ended last week with a good round and I kept it going this week.   The swing feels good.   The putting is good.   So I'm very pleased and hoping for the best for the rest of the week.   
   
 Q.   You've ended this round with a particularly nice putt, as well, for that birdie at the last?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, hit a pretty good shot and just left myself like a little more than a 10‑footer I think, and made it.   So the lunch is going to taste a little better after that.  
   
 Q.   Was it fun playing alongside Rafa, as well?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, it's always fun to play with a guy that comes from your country and we've been growing up playing golf.   We've known each other since we were ten years old pretty much, so it's always fun to have somebody cheering for you and pushing you during the round in the same group.   
   
 Q.   And you did push each other, and certainly those scores‑‑  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   We did, but Rafa started really nicely, he started making some putts, and you know, I wanted to catch up with him and not leave him‑‑ not let him leave me very far behind.   So it was a lot of fun today.   
   
 Q.   I take it with what you said about Abu Dhabi, this essentially is a good start to 2015, isn't it?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I hope so.   Last year I ended up a little not so good with some injuries and stuff but it's hopefully a good start and we'll keep it going for the rest of the year, get healthy and play to win the tournament.   
   
 Q.   Are you 100 per cent at the moment?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I wouldn't say 100 per cent.   I wouldn't mind being like this and shooting 5‑under every day.
