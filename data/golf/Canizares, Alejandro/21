  ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I just changed putters and I went back to the short putter this morning pretty much.   I came in a little earlier and I spent an hour putting.   Didn't hit many good shots on the front nine, the back nine, my front nine. 
But I ended up 1‑under, and then it just happened, I don't know, one of those things that you keep going, and you keep making putts, and six birdies in a row to finish.   It felt decent. 
One of those days that everything is like happy and finish up and make every putt you look at.   And I think 8‑under is the lowest I've been maybe in the whole tournament this year.   Very few tournaments I shot under 8‑under for four days, so I'm happy to shoot that score today.

Q.   Sounds like a knee‑jerk reaction to change a putter first thing in the morning. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I was getting a little uncomfortable with the belly, and since everybody is talking about that they are going to stop playing it or they are going to ban it or whatever, I thought, well, I'll go back to the start, and it worked out perfectly today. 

Q.   You've had some good runs of birdies in the past but six in a row is pretty special to come home in 29?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I don't know if it's my lowest nine holes, maybe second to best.   But it was a great feeling.   It was getting colder and I started hitting better shots when I was colder than before. 
Very happy, I hit good shots when I needed it, and I made every putt I looked at on the back nine.   

Q.   Not entirely out of the blue, you've been playing well for a while. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I've been playing well all right this year, and after I finished second in the Spanish Open, I had two months of boring golf pretty much and my attitude went a little down because I couldn't score and I felt like I was hitting the ball pretty good and still couldn't score.   Hopefully I turn it around for the upcoming tournaments and I finish up with good before the break in honest. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, it's understandable, it was quite cold, and it was kind of late.   Yeah, we weren't playing in exactly the TV times.   Maybe you get going when everybody is cheering for you.   I was relaxed and obviously it was the first day so there's not much tension there and I can make good putts, and that's all. 

Q.   When is the last time you used a normal putter in a tournament? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I changed to the belly in Czech Republic last year.   So it's been almost a year.

Q.   And just this morning, you thought‑‑
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, this tournament, I decided I wanted to go back to the short putter and I started practising it.   But yesterday I wasn't feeling it too much.   I have like 4‑putters in my bag, so I felt like this morning, I came back and I said, well, I'm going to putt the short putter and make sure I feel comfortable with it. 
So I spent an hour before lunch, and it was overall pretty good.   That's what's difficult, it's all you, all in your head.   When you let it happen and you keep going, your head works in the same way, it's easy. 

Q.   When a couple go in, does the hole get bigger?   Do you think everything is going to go in? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   No, you're going to get in‑‑ like they call it a zone.   You get so focussed on what you're doing, and you're thinking the right way, that it happens.   You're not expecting to make it every time, but it's like a feeling that you get into the concentration.   It's funny when it happens.
