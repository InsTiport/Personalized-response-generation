Q.   Verdict on the week, please. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, overall, very pleased.   I think I finished inside the Top‑10, and like I said, all this week, it's like a dream come true that I've been able to play with not many issues physically, and I didn't hit the ball that great on the weekend and I still shot 7‑under on the weekend.   So I'm really happy the way I managed my golf and the way I kept going.

Q.   Nice to get that birdie at the last?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, it was one of those I thought I needed it to make the Top‑10 because I saw there were a few guys better than me, and I really wanted to make that putt and it happened.   So that makes everything even better.

Q.   Does this bode well?   Presumably you're on to Dubai like most. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, tomorrow I fly to Dubai, and hopefully I have another good week like these couple I just had.   Just enjoy, enjoy the weather, enjoy the golf and being able to play golf.
