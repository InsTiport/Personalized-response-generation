  ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, today was a little slow.   I didn't feel very good with my irons.   I was pulling most of the shots, and I didn't putt like yesterday obviously.   Didn't get the pace on the putts very good on the longer ones, and luckily I made all the short ones back. 
So it could have been‑‑ started with 3‑putts on the first hole, which kind of sets you back after making everything the day before. 
But I'm happy to finish under par because the round wasn't looking too good, so happy for the finish.

Q.   Silly game, isn't it, because everything was just flowing on that first day. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, well, the back nine and yesterday was one of those things that everything comes easy and you get in that mood and everything comes to you.   Today I grinded it out, I wasn't hitting it my best, and I wasn't making putts. 
But in the end I made a couple of birdies coming in to finish under par.   It was a calm day and there was not much wind and it's kind of easy to shoot low scores on this golf course.   So 1‑under par is kind of a humble round.

Q.   Does that make it all the more galling when you know you've shot a low round yourself and you know what can be achieved and you can't quite manage it despite the conditions?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Disappointing like that when things don't come your way‑‑ on any golf course when you're not hitting good shots, any golf course becomes difficult, even if it's the easiest one.   
So it was a day that it could have been a good round so you shoot 3‑ or 4‑under after yesterday.   But I'm happy the way I played and I'm happy to finish under par. 

Q.   Still in the mix. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, it's been a while.   So hopefully I finish the day up there and give myself a chance for the weekend and try to fix the mistakes I made today. 

Q.   "A while" ‑‑ the Spanish Open wasn't that long ago. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   In the Spanish Open, it was kind of like coming from behind almost.   I played great on the weekend, so hopefully I do that this week the same. 

Q.   Do you prefer one to the other?   Do you prefer coming off the pace and challenging on the final day or do you like to be there all the time?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I don't mind.   I prefer to make birdies, that's it.   I don't want to‑‑ I mean, if you're up there, it's a good place to be.
