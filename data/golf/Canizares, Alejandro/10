  ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I took advantage of the last couple holes, a little easier to make birdie and really happy how I finished.   It didn't look as good as yesterday.   Yesterday I played really solid but I didn't make many putts, and today I didn't play solid at all but made some good putts.   That's one of the days that you have to be really happy about.

Q.   I guess it's a test of patience when that happens, as well, isn't it? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, during the week, I've been hitting the ball great.   I've been feeling better with my swing and today it wasn't there.   I didn't feel great.   Missed a couple tee shots really far to the right, and got a way with them. 
So it would have been a great birdie here on last because if I hit my tee shot 60 yards right of where I was thinking‑‑ but overall, it's been a great day and I'm very pleased and really happy to be playing good, and I can't wait for tomorrow. 

Q.   Nice to be in that position with the chance of victory into the final day I guess. 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, to give myself a chance is more than I could dream a couple weeks ago, so it's a pleasure to be here.   I just want to enjoy the moment.
