  ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   It was a good day.   I played really good.   I kept it in play.   I think I only missed one drive, so it was very different from the previous two days.   I wasn't very confident on the greens, but 6‑under with a few missed putts, but very, very happy.   
6‑under in a tournament like this, a day like this, can't be any happier.   Hopefully tomorrow I do the same thing and I give it all I have.   We'll see what happens.   
   
 Q.   It looked a special start today, as if anything could happen from that.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I started very good.   I started hitting very good shots, and just kept it going.   I mean, I didn't miss many‑‑ I had a lot of birdie opportunities.   I didn't miss many greens today I don't think.   Overall, a pleasant day.   Enjoyed my teammates today who played with me and it was fun.  
   
 Q.   Now that you've got back and you've seen a leaderboard, you'll see the leaders are somewhere ahead.   So what is the approach?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, if you ask me in the beginning of the day, 6‑under, I thought it would have been closer than what it is right now.   But I did my best and that's all I can ask for, and tomorrow I'll do the same.   And if somebody does better, good for them then.   
   
 Q.   As if 66 isn't a low round, but do you sense that you can go even lower and maybe get even closer?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, the greens are receptive.   So if you hit good shots, you're going to end up with a lot of birdie opportunities.   Today I had a lot of chances.   If you get it going with the putter, you can shoot very low.   So hopefully tomorrow, we'll see.
