 Q.   Must be quite happy with your day today?   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, I'm very happy.   I started off, well, it's a difficult golf course.   It was windy.   It wasn't easy.   Made a double on 8.   
But I think that got me going, that kind of woke me up, because I was on and off, on and off, even par, and doubled that hole and then got it back with a few birdies in a role after that.   Maybe that double helped me, who knows.   
A great back nine; I played really well.   I made great up‑and‑downs, made a bunker shot, and on 14 I think it was, or 13.   So one of those days.  
   
 Q.   Many positives to take from the week as a whole, the way you played.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Played really well.   Felt the nerves a little bit in the second round after that 7‑under, because I made a couple focused mistakes.   But I got it back, I shot 1‑over, and I didn't play myself out of it.   
So I think that Bo Van Pelt and Jason Dufner have played unbelievable golf on the weekend, because the greens are really, really firm.   This golf course is not easy.   It was windy.   
So I'm really happy to finish top three and third place, if it keeps going like this, I'm not sure.   Go back home and celebrate.  
   
 Q.   In terms of the season, gets you into Singapore, and on the cusp of Dubai, Top 60?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I was 70th going into that tournament since March.   The last two months I've been hitting the ball especially not so good.   I wasn't confident in my swing when I came here, didn't think too much about it and got great rhythm and started hitting the ball great.   I started feeling good.   I like the type of golf that Australia has, firm greens, and beautiful golf courses.   I enjoyed it.   I was‑‑ I had a great time on the golf course.   
   
 Q.   You spoke a little bit the other day that Dubai was your goal.   
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, the top 5 here gets me into Singapore which helps a lot.   I didn't have that tournament before because of my ranking from last year.   So happy to be able to get there on my own merit.   It helps me, gives me one more chance to consolidate in the Top 60 and hopefully play in Dubai.
