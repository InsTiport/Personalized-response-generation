ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: I played good.  I hit some great putts, as well.  Yesterday I actually didn't play that bad.  I just had one really bad hole, but the rest was pretty decent.  Feeling all right.  I like links golf.  I like playing in the wind, and I seem to be rolling the ball nicely on the greens.  So it's a nice round and happy to have a good round.  It's been awhile, actually.   
 Q.  I imagine there's satisfaction for both days, isn't there, because you've stayed in the competition in a lovely position when you're battling all of the elements on day one.  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yesterday, one of those days, with really high winds, and it was really tough just to play golf.  It was tough.  And I think I did quite well.  I mean, because it was difficult.  I hit, for example, on one hole, I hit a 3-wood 190 yards to 17, the par 3.  I flushed it and I didn't get to the green.  That's how blowy it was.   
Today I played good.  It was a little calmer and I managed to make some putts and really happy to finish like this.   
 Q.  You did say it's been a little while, so what's the story?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Golf is a story.  The year started out pretty good for me, and then since a while ago, I've been playing not so good.  I've been struggling with some areas and then suddenly one bad hole or two bad holes, and the tournament was over.  But that's golf.  I mean, it's tough to be out there all the time, and just happy today I had a good round and happy for towards the weekend.   
 Q.  And something fun, the creativity of links golf that can be inspirational?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, I always liked it.  I always liked links golf.  Obviously being from MÃ¡laga, I'm not used to playing in the summer like this, but it's fun.  It's fun to play with the ball, to hit low, high, draw, fades.  It's fun to do it.
