 Q.  Fantastic up-and-down at the last.  That was a nice one.  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, the wind switched.  It was downwind on the tee.  The tee shot wasn't good.  I sliced it a little bit and then on the second shot I got lucky, it was just before the bunker, but we weren't sure because the wind switched totally from being downwind to being into and so we thought it was like a two-club wind and I didn't hit it good and went into the water.  Should have hit 3-iron but I hit 4-iron.  The up-and-down was great.  I had no chance to leave it close and I left it very close.  I was unhappy but happy at the end.   
 Q.  Overall, how was it today?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: I played good.  I played good.  I putted really nice.  I've been putting really good.  I hit some really good shots.  I had a couple mistakes off the tee, three mistakes off the tee.   
I hit a couple bunkers here but the rest is really good.  I felt good.  I felt confident.  Shot 5-under in Carnoustie which is always very nice.  It was a little chilly this morning, so I will take it for sure.   
And very happy.  Not expecting much and just trying to play my best every day.  That's what I'm trying to do all the time.   
 Q.  And you put yourself into a nice position for the weekend, knowing that you've always played Carnoustie which is the tough one and going to Kingsbarns tomorrow --  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Kingsbarns gives you more chances but I think you have to play very well on these type of courses because you never know with the weather how it will play.  I'm just going to try to play it as it should be and see what happens in the end.
