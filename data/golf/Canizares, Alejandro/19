  STEVE TODD:   Welcome, thanks for joining us.   Bogey‑free 65 there is a pretty good way to start the tournament.
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, it was a good round.   I played really well.   I hit the ball really well and made some putts, so really happy. 
STEVE TODD:   Talk us through your card.   Any particular highlights for you? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, played pretty steady the whole round and gave myself plenty of chances.   I think I only missed two greens in the whole round.   And one of them I chipped in on the 8th hole, par 3, which was a bonus. 
Putted well.   Missed a couple short ones on 14 and 15 for birdie, but I made a long one on 17, so I made up for that and made a good one for put on 18.   So happy to finish 7‑under. 
STEVE TODD:   Put the round in context of your year as a whole.   You obviously had a second place early in the season, but coming into this week? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, the year has been a little slow since March.   I started pretty well, a couple Top 10s, a Top‑5 in MÃ©xico in the PGA TOUR event, and then finished second in the Spanish Open. 
Since then, it's been very slow.   I haven't played good enough to be in contention, and every week I was falling down the rankings. 
So I came here from Portugal from last week, didn't play very good last week.   I hit the ball terrible, but I came here and I felt great.   Maybe the traveling, the 24 hours traveling helped.   I feel good with my swing and hopefully the week keeps going like this. 

Q.   What do you think of the course?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I really like it.   It's a really nice track.   The greens are firm and they have a lot of slopes so they are not easy. 
It wasn't as windy today as it was yesterday and the day before, so it was playing a little easier.   But I really liked it.   I've been twice in Australia and both courses I played were really nice. 

Q.   Inaudible.
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, maybe tomorrow afternoon the wind picks up like normally it does, but it will get even with the guys that are playing in the afternoon today.   So we'll see what happens. 

Q.   (How hard will the course be if the wind picks up)?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yeah, definitely, because this golf course, it's a tree‑lined golf course, so it's very difficult to judge the wind where it comes from because you feel it swirling around, you're not sure where it comes from.   So when it's gusting like yesterday, it's difficult to judge.   So it will be a test if the wind picks up. 

Q.   Where are you on the Money List?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I'm 70th at the moment.   That's my role.   That's why I came all the way here because I won't get in Singapore or Hong Kong because of my ranking of last year.   So this is either my last or my second‑to‑last tournament of the year, so I need a good finish‑‑ well, if I win it will fix a lot of things. 
I'm not sure what finish I need because there's still some big tournaments going on at the moment.   Singapore is a big tournament and BMW and HSBC, some guys behind me are playing that, so you never know.   I'm just going to try to play my best. 
The next one that I could play would be either Hong Kong or South Africa.   But South Africa, for sure, and Hong Kong will be on my ranking. 

Q.   How long have you been playing on The European Tour?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Since 2006.   I won in Russia on my third tournament in 2006.   I finished 28th in 2010. 

Q.   And on The European Tour‑‑
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Well, I tried the U.S. on 2008.   I played Q‑School there, qualified for Q‑School, played both tours at the same time and it was tough traveling around.   Since I wasn't playing the majors or the World Golf Championships; to do both at the same time, it's a lot of flights and it's tiring. 
So I was thinking about going to Q‑School this year over there since it's the last one like a lot of players are doing but since I've done it before, and I know what it is, I think I should focus more on getting better, what I can get better on The European Tour and aim towards the goal, which is get better as a golfer and be in the Top‑50 in the world would take me there or take me in the big tournaments. 

Q.   The longestSpain ‑‑
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   Yes, it's a difficult situation.   The economy, we all know they are struggling in Spain and southern countries most of all.   But we lost a few tournaments on The European Tour and hopefully I'm pretty sure it will get better.   Maybe in Spain, it will take a little longer, but Europe will get better pretty soon I think. 

Q.   What tournaments did you have next year? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   At the moment confirmed we have The Spanish Open, and maybe AndalucÃ­a, but it's not confirmed. 

Q.   How many did you have this year?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I think we had six or seven on schedule and we only had two in the end. 
The last one was this week, actually, in Valderrama, my home golf course.   But the government didn't have money to support the tournament, so they have to drop out. 

Q.   How much does that hurt? 
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES:   I think it hurts a lot because where I play a lot in Valderrama in Costa del Sol, which is MÃ¡laga, golf is the main attraction, or one of the main attractions with the beach obviously.   And last year, JimÃ©nez and Sergio Garcia were in contention; Sergio won.   So it attracted a lot of people there, and golf needs to get a little bigger in the area so the tourism can come and the economy gets a little stronger. 
So losing a tournament in that spot, which is Valderrama, one of the best‑known golf courses in Spain, it hurts a lot I think. 
But I cannot be talking about politics.   It hurts me as well because it's my home golf course and I would have loved to play there. 
STEVE TODD:   Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow par far.
