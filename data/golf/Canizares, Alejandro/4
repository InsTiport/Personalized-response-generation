Q. Please give me your verdict on finishing in some style for a nice position here?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: It was a great day for me.  I had a lot of fun out there.  Playing with Ricardo, we both were doing great.  We were helping each other out mentally and it was fun.  Played good, and I made a lot of putts.  Confidence on the greens, that's what I lost a little bit in the last couple tournaments, and I got it back here.
Hit good shots.  Just couldn't be happier.  Pity on the 17th that I had a tough second shot in into the wind, but I did my best and finished really happy.
Q. Having slipped back just that little, it must be all the more nice to finish in some kind of good, positive manner?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, yesterday was a difficult day with the wind, but I didn't hit the ball very well.  Today I got it back in groove.  I hit some great shots and I made some great putts.  So it was a great way to finish just before the final event.  I'm very happy really.
Q. You've been a winner on The European Tour a couple of times, but this is lovely in terms of ranking points and prize money and everything, isn't it?
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, yeah, it's a big event, World Ranking points and Race to Dubai points.  It's a big event for us.  One of my best finishes of the year.  So really happy; this gives me more confidence to keep going and keep working hard.
Q. And keeping going means Dubai next week, which must be fun.
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, Dubai next week is great event.  It's always fun to be there, and it means that you had a good year if you play that tournament.  I like that I played good before there.  I like that tournament.
So really looking forward to it.
