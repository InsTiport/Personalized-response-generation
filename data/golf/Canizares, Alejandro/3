 Q.  65 today, how would you reflect on your play today?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: I played really nicely.  But I've been playing this week really nicely overall.  Today, hit some about shots but today the difference was that I made some good putts.   
Yesterday and the day before, I played really well but the putts didn't go in.  Today I felt more comfortable and I rolled a few good ones, so I'm very pleased.   
 Q.  Particularly nice way to finish, having bogeyed a couple holes before?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Yeah, well, that hole is quite difficult.  It's quite long.  Used to be a par 5 and if you missed the fairway, it's tough to control the ball on that green, which is very slopey.  Bogeyed that and then nice birdie on the last, great shot and nice putt to finish.   
 Q.  Give us a sense of conditions out there today?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: It's perfect.  I mean, just a little breeze to take the mosquitos out.  The temperature is great.  This week is ideal.  Wish we would play like this all the time but it's difficult on The European Tour.   
 Q.  What will you take from today's round going into tomorrow's final round?  
ALEJANDRO CAÃIZARES: Well, I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.  I'm hitting the ball really nicely.  I feel comfortable on the golf course and just do my routine on the putts and let them roll, let them go in, and we'll see what happens tomorrow.  I'm going to do my best like always.
