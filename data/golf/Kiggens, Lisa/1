LISA KIGGENS:  Honestly, going out, I have not been hitting it as solid as I would like.  So starting off was kind of shaky.  Not too much confidence.  I held it together, and I think I made two birdies in a row on the front side.  I birdied 5 and 6.  I hit it within 10 feet on those two holes and made the putt.  And then on No. 8, I pulled my drive left, and I was actually standing part way in the bunker. It was just -- I got a bad break; a bad lie.  Made bogey got out of there.  I just held it together and hit it much better on the back.  I made eight greens and I had four birdies in a row.  Three of them were within probably 8- to 10 feet.  And par 5, I knocked it on in two and 2-putted.

LISA KIGGENS:  I was very relaxed, and until they told me I had made four in a row, I didn't realize it.  I just tried to keep it going as long as it goes, and just, you know, tried to stay each shot one at a time.


Q.  What enabled you to shoot such a good round on the day when everybody else is standing still on the leaderboard?  Did you notice?

LISA KIGGENS:  I'm not one to watch the leaderboards that much.  I did see my name up there once.  And from then on I didn't even know until she said I was tied for third; I had no idea.  I don't know, because there's not much wind. The greens are holding almost as well as they did yesterday.  I think if you just hit the green and give yourself a birdie putt, they roll so good.  And they are not that quick.


Q.  Lisa, obviously having one of your best U.S. Opens, ever, are you happy with your position?  And what's the strategy now in the next two days?

LISA KIGGENS:  I'm definitely happy with my position.  Like you said, this is, I think, my best Open.  I don't know how many Opens I've played in, but I haven't made many cuts at an Open.  Hopefully, I can just hold it together the next couple days, you know, take it one day at a time, and see what turns out on Sunday.


Q.  As compared to your rookie year in '92, what is the most different thing you're approaching now when you come to a major?

LISA KIGGENS:  Honestly, I try -- which I'm probably different than a lot of people.  I just act like it's just another tournament.  I try not to -- it is the U.S. Open.  It is very important.  For my mind, just take it like any other tournament.

LISA KIGGENS:  That's a misprint.  (Laughter.)

LISA KIGGENS:  Yes.  Like I said, I started out not hitting the ball very well.  Luckily, I missed it straight down the fairway.  If you would have seen the shot, it was the ugliest shot possible.  But I was able to hit a 7-wood there to about three feet.  It's a crazy game.  I hit my second shot further than I hit the drive.  A lot of times today, I hit a lot of 3-woods off the tee just because I don't have the  confidence with my driver.  But I'm able to hit my 3-wood far enough to be okay.

LISA KIGGENS:  Yeah, usually the putter is not the problem.  I don't want to jinx myself, but like I said, most of the time it's my tee balls.  If I can get it in play, I'm okay.

LISA KIGGENS:  Thank you.
