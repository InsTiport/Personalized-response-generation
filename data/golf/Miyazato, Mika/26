   PETE KOWALSKI: Fifth place in the Championship, Mika Miyazato.   
  
  Q. How pleased are you with your finish?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Like so this week so very long, so finally finish.   
  
  Q. Was it tiring? Did you get pretty tired?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes, a little bit. Uh-huh.   
 THE INTERPRETER: First time to play on Monday.   
  
  Q. Earlier in the week you mentioned you were going to donate your winnings.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes.  
  
  Q. Are you still planning on that?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes.   
  
  Q. How did you stay mentally involved with all the weather delays and stay mentally sharp?   
 THE INTERPRETER: I was able to kind of relax when I'm not on the golf course, try to go back to the hotel and, you know, watch some -- try to do things other than golf and try to kind of turn on and off switch so I was able to control myself.  
  
  Q. What did you think of the course as far as difficulty and other courses you've played?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes, very tough this golf course, but very...   
 THE INTERPRETER: Especially around the greens it's very tough, I thought. And the par-4s are very long, so for me I had to hit like fairway wood or long iron.   
 It was really difficult. I wanted to be aggressive but just the pin position and the hard greens doesn't allow you to just go for the pins, so it was tough.
