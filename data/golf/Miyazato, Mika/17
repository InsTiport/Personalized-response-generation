  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Mika Miyazato into the interview room.   Nice round today.   Take me through what went well.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I played very well today also, but I played the back nine today, I start, I made a three‑putt bogey, so I hit it not so good.   17 hole, I try to do my best.   
First nine is more patient, but back nine is somewhat more aggressive.   So I hit very well the putting also.   
But very disappointed about No.9.   I can't make up‑and‑down, so...   
THE MODERATOR:   We were talking when we came in here the wind picked up on the back nine.   Do you think that affected you at all?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Hmm, I don't think so.   
THE MODERATOR:   Do you like the windier conditions?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Maybe.   Yeah, I like windy conditions because I from Okinawa, is always windy.   
THE MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   What was the biggest difference today from yesterday in your game?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   In my game?   The green.   I made two bogey.   That's mean I can't make up‑and‑down, two bogey.   So very different compared to the yesterday.   
THE MODERATOR:   You hit 18 greens yesterday?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I hit 18 greens yesterday.   
THE MODERATOR:   Do you know how many you hit today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   15, I think.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel about your position midway through the tournament in terms of taking a shot at winning your first championship?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Well, I'm very excited next two days.   But very tough position also I think.   I need more patience.   I need more focus on my golf game.   Very important.   
   
 Q.   Do you know the players who are around you?   You have several Koreans.   Have you played with them before?   Can you say a little bit about their games or do you not know them very well?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I know the other people, but they play always pretty well.   Like I seen like always make putts everywhere, so...   
   
 Q.   Tomorrow will you play aggressively, to the middle of the greens?   How will you play the course?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Oh, I thinking still more aggressive round.   Last two days I got more aggressive round, so still continue aggressive round next two days.   
THE MODERATOR:   Mika, thank you.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Thank you.
