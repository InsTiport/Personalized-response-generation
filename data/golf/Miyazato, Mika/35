   MODERATOR: We're here with Mika Miyazato, who shot a fabulous 5-under par rounds today. Standing a little 9-under par for the tournament, and the leader by three in the clubhouse as the now.   
 Can you talk about your round and the conditions of the golf course? Start with your round first.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) For the front nine I wasn't able to play as steady, but the back nine I was able to keep all my shots in and to play very solid. I was very happy that I was able to put in a birdie for the last shot.   
 Today there was a rain delay, and I just tried to keep my concentration and make sure that I was very, very focused today.  
 MODERATOR: Do you think the rain delay helped your score on the back nine? Because it seemed like the conditions were less rainy and less windy. Was that an advantage?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) I think that that was very good, but in the beginning, the first nine, my driver wasn't as steady.   
 But with the rain delay, I was able to refresh my mindset and have a good back nine.  
 MODERATOR: I heard that you have a unique way that you mark your golf ball. Can you tell me the story behind that?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Laughing.) Everybody say pumpkin, so I say tangerine because my name is Mika.   
 (Through translation.) Mikan is tangerine in Japanese, if you put an N on the last part of her name, so that's the reason why that's her nickname.   
 MODERATOR: I like it. Tangerine. Perfect. Do we have any questions in English?  
  
  Q. Have you won many times in Japan?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: No.

 MIKA MIYAZATO: I'm 20.   
  
  Q. And this is the second time at Evian Masters?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes, second time.  
  
  Q. What do you think about the golf course?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Golf course, I like golf course, but fairway so narrow, greens so small.   
  
  Q. Is this your third year in America? Second year on the LPGA Tour?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Second year.   
  
  Q. Can you tell us how do you cope with life in America and how you enjoy it over there?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I like it here. (Laughing.)   
  
  Q. Where do you live?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I live Florida.   
  
  Q. Did you go to school in Japan and then go to America after just for LPGA Tour?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: So I finish high school. I came 2008, in July, so I practice IMG Academy almost two years.

  Q. Is it very a lot of people with Miyazato?
