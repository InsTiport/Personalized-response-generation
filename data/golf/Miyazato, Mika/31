   THE MODERATOR: We're here with Mika Miyazato who just shot a 5-under par round in the first round of the 40th anniversary of the Kraft Nabisco Championship. Congratulations on a great start to the tournament. Talk a little bit about your round.  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Okay. I had a good day today. I played about 295. And then I made a birdie on No. 10, 11 and 12. Like No. 10 is maybe four feet and 11 is maybe two feet, three feet. 12 is like maybe 15 feet.   
 And also the front nine I made birdies on No. 9, like three feet. So I played so good today because no bogey and I am so happy.  
 THE MODERATOR: Talk a little bit about how the course was playing with the heat, the firmness of the greens.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: The weather is soggy hot. I like cold weather, but greens so like very hard.   
 THE MODERATOR: Do we have some questions?   
  
  Q. Mika, did you birdie the 18th, the par-3?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: 18? I made 10, 11, 12 -- no, 17.   
  
  Q. 17, the par-3?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yeah.   
  
  Q. What did you hit into the green and how far of a putt did you have?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I hit a 4 hybrid and like six feet.   
  
  Q. And did you feel -- when you birdied that late in the round and you tied for the lead like that, does that give you some momentum going into tomorrow? Do you feel like you're on a hot streak right now?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yeah. I think so.   
  
  Q. How many players are wearing the logo, the Japan logo?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: How many?   
  
  Q. Did you give some to other players?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yeah. I gave to some players, but I don't know how many, yes.   
  
  Q. You seem very happy not to have had a bogey today. Is that surprising that you can play 18 holes, as tough as the course is, without a bogey?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Not surprised because I hit very good today tee shots and second shot. Like No. 16 I went to the left side, fell off, then good up-and-down, like 10 feet pop-up.   
  
  Q. Do you know how many greens you hit today? It sounds like you were hitting your iron shots very close to the hole.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: How many greens. Hmm. I don't know.  
  
  Q. We'll look it up.   
 THE MODERATOR: Do we have any more questions in English? Okay.
