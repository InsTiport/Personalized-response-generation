 Q.   A great round of 7‑under ties you for the lead.   What was really working well for you today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I had a very good putting.   I got 27 putts today.   And the short game was very, very good also, so I had so much good today.  
   
 Q.   This golf course can set up for some low scores, especially when you're playing 8, 9, and 10, three par‑5s in a row.   What was the biggest key in terms of taking advantage of the golf course?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I think it's more important short game on this golf course.   Like I played this afternoon but the greens were hard and had more speed, very quick.   
Like the back nine's very quick, so very different from the front nine to the back nine.  
   
 Q.   You've been having a pretty good season so far and putting yourself in contention.   Are you feeling more comfortable now when you're getting yourself up there at the top of the leaderboard?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   My golf game is very confident right now.   I don't know.   But to begin the season I was not so very good with my golf game.   I started to shoot right in a couple four or five events.   So I'm gaining more confidence in my golf game.
