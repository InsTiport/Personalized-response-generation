Q.   A plusâ€‘one round, but still you're in the Top 5 and in contention.   Tell us about how you played today. 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's pretty tough conditions out there.   Like the front nine is so much windy, but I came to practice round, so I know each direction wind.   So I know everything. 
Back 9 is very patient.   I tried so many body putt.   But just one body make it.   Still very tough conditions. 

Q.   You have some very good experience internationally, so being in the Top 5, does that help you with getting ready to try to get back into contention and maybe possibly win tomorrow?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I can't control the results.   I try just do my best, one shot at one time, so I played last year U.S. Women's Open also.   That's so much good experience for me.   So that's big help.

Q.   Do you feel like you have it in you to try to maybe catch Na Yeon tomorrow?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's seven strokes, eight strokes? 

Q.   For you it's seven, I think. 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Seven strokes.   I don't know.   I try best but it's seven strokes so much big.   But U. S. Open everybody don't know.   Seven stroke maybe happen, maybe catch up.   I don't know.
