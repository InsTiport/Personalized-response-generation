Q. So how tough was it playing today in these conditions?
MIKA MIYAZATO: Much different the last two days.  We saw much windy and around the green is really slow than last two days, so pretty difficult.
Q. How have you felt about your game so far this week?
MIKA MIYAZATO: My golf game was getting better, but this wind is more difficult, like more confused.
Q. What did it mean to you to get an invite to this event from the Ladies Scottish Open and Aberdeen Standard Investments, to get a sponsor invite from them?
MIKA MIYAZATO: Well, this week, especially I thought maybe not play this week, so I got this event, last week, I got invite.  So last three years, I never played in Scotland, so I'm so happy to be here.  So thank you so much.
