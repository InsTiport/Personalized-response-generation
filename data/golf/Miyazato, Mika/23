  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Mika Miyazato into the interview room today.   Congratulations, a great round of 5‑under 67 today.
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Thank you.

           THE MODERATOR:   Bogey‑free round.   Can you just take me through your round and what was working well for you on the golf course today?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It was good the last two days, and my second shot is putting so much better today.   So I'm so happy with today's round. 
THE MODERATOR:   What part of your game do you think is going best for you right now?   What have you been working on and what has translated out on the golf course.
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I just practice more like iron shots, like chipping also. 
THE MODERATOR:   This is the third event of the season for you.
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.
THE MODERATOR:   Played decently in Thailand and Singapore, but do you feel pretty good about your game coming into this week? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I played Thailand, Singapore, not so play good, but this week so much better. 
THE MODERATOR:   What's been the biggest difference? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Biggest difference.   Like iron shot is much better because the green regular in regulation is, like today, 16, so better. 
THE MODERATOR:   Yeah.   Much better.   Do we have any questions for Mika?   Okay.   Thank you very much.
