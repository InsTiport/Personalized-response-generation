 Q.   Here with Mika Miyazato after a second round 69.   Just hit it 3‑under for the tournament.   Tell us what was working for you out there today.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's pretty tough condition today because cold and rainy and the windy.  
But has so much patient today.   Some up and down, too.   Pretty good round today.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned the conditions.   It's been down pouring, a little mist; rain and wind has been going all sorts of ways.   Tell me how you adjust to that mentally and in your golf game.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Well, I knew the weather is rain today so I knew how to play the rain weather.   
Not so difficult.  
   
 Q.   This is a tough golf course to begin with.   How do you think these conditions make it even tougher?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   This golf course was like more challenging.   If I miss the fairway, rough is coming.   Is pretty tough rough.   
I need more good course management.  
   
 Q.   What would you say is the one thing that was working best for you out there today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Up and down.   Chipping, yes.   
   
 Q.   You got in just before a big surge of rain came.   You're probably not going out until later tomorrow after posting 3‑under.   What are you thinking for the rest of the day and leading into tomorrow?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's the same.   One step at a time always, so more focus in the short game, too.
