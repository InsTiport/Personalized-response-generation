  THE MODERATOR:   How are you feeling?   You look like you are nice and relaxed and happy?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, very relaxed.  
   
 Q.   How are you feeling coming into this week as your first time defending as a champion?   Last time was your first win here.   Talk about coming into this week.   Is it any different coming in as defending champ?   Obviously you have your face on the Spectator Guide.   Just talk about the extra hoopla and how you feel as defending champ?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I feel more nervous before the tournament, but not much (indiscernible).   It's the same tournament but different golf course this year and the whole day tournament.   So I don't know.  
   
 Q.   The course changing, does that make it so much different?   I mean, it's obviously going to be a whole lot different than last year since it's a totally different course?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of the course?   Did you practice today and then play today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on the course?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's pretty straight from the tee shot, but it's pretty shape.   And the greens some hole is very small and some hole is pretty big.   So I like this golf course.  
   
 Q.   Do you think that suits your game being straight off the tee?   Do you think that helps you a little bit?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   To play aggressive is more important maybe.  
   
 Q.   So you think you should be more aggressive this week on this course more so than Pumpkin Ridge?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   Is it just certain holes that you think are going to be set up to be aggressive or was it‑‑  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Front nine is pretty aggressive, I can hit.  
   
 Q.   You are coming off a good finish.   You played well last week in Canada.   So what were your strong points last week that you are going to hopefully take into this week?   What did you feel that was really good about your game?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Much better short game the last week, but last days not so much good the second shot.   Hopefully maybe I will get it fixed this week.  
   
 Q.   Second shots weren't as good on the last day?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   Have you been working on your short game more so coming into this?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   On the off weeks, what have you been working on specifically with a coach?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's more a practice the shorter game on the off weeks.  
   
 Q.   Now, I want to ask you about the Solheim Cup was just a couple of weeks ago.   Now the new event coming up next year, the International Crown, now you will have a chance to play on a team.   All the Asian countries are left out on the Solheim Cup and you say, What about us?   Talk about the opportunity that you'll get to play with I and some of your other compatriots.   How excited are you?   I mean, that's only oneyear away and you will get to play on a huge stage.   Talk about how excited you are to do that.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I don't know, but if I can play it's pretty exciting definitely.   Maybe I or, I don't know, TA‑‑ but if I play the team play, I like team play.  
   
 Q.   You like team play?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   So you think it suits you better when you get to play with somebody else and not just yourself?   Do you have experience playing in team play?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I have experience.  
   
 Q.   In Japan you used to play‑‑  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   As amateur.  
   
 Q.   And you thought you played pretty well?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I liked it.  
   
 Q.   What is the difference between this year your play and last year?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It's different.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, what's the difference?   Do you think something is better or something is not as good?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   The big difference is change of the club.   I change the tournament this year.   
   
 Q.   Your clubs?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, clubs.   In the beginning not so much good, but start May much better feeling with my club.  
   
 Q.   What brand did you‑‑ you switched brands?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Everything.  
   
 Q.   All clubs?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Are you TaylorMade now?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   So TaylorMade drivers and irons and putter?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   And the transition wasn't easy, just like Rory McIlroy?   It's the clubs, right?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   You finally got used to them and now you are playing better?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Much better, yes.  
   
 Q.   Were you disappointed when they changed the course?   You didn't get to defend your championship at the same course?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   No, no.  
   
 Q.   Why not?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Not disappointed, no.  
   
 Q.   This is your first time seeing it on Monday?   Did you get to see it on Monday?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yesterday, yesterday.  
   
 Q.   That was your first time?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   Do you like playing new courses coming in and learning courses or is it‑‑ because there is no pressure?   I mean, if you went back to Pumpkin Ridge, everyone would expect you to play well?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Less pressure.  
   
 Q.   So less pressure coming into an event where it's a new course?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, but it's new golf course and the new challenge, I think.  
   
 Q.   Still challenging.   Everyone says it's going to be a good test?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   So do you think you will like this course more than Pumpkin Ridge?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I like both golf course, but more‑‑  
   
 Q.   As far as fitting your game, do you think this course fits your game better than Pumpkin Ridge?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I think so, yes.  
   
 Q.   Do you like to play 72 holes or 54?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   That one is very tough question, but I like 72‑hole play.  
   
 Q.   72 better?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   72, yes.  
   
 Q.   Do you know why?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Why?   I don't know.  
   
 Q.   Stacy said 54 is too much of a sprint.   You can't really have too many mistakes since there is less time to make up.   She said she likes 72 better also.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   72 is like more chance to get back, I think.  
   
 Q.   More chances to get things back.   So if you make a mistake, you can make up for it?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   I think that's the consensus.   I think most players would rather have 72 to get their feet under them, especially on a course that's maybe new?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   You have a lot of young fans here.   I was wondering, when you were growing up, who was your first childhood idle, your hero?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Annika.  
   
 Q.   I've talked to other Japanese players.   They said she was on the magazine covers in Japan all the time?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   So Annika was the biggest one in Japan when you guys were growing up?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Did you play with her at any time?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   No, no chance to play.  
   
 Q.   Have you met her yet?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   No.  
   
 Q.   Would you like to?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, yes.
