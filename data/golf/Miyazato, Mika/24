 Q.   Mika, how do you find the tournament with all of this competition that you are competing with, basically the world's best ladies this week at HSBC?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I like this tournament so much.   So many people come in the week, and it's a lot of fun.   
   
 Q.   How do you find the Tanah Merah course in general?   Do you find it challenging or what do you think challenges you?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Difficult this golf course, like mostly the green undulation.   So I need to decide the second shot, pinpoint.   Like if I hit to the pin, maybe going down left or by the green.   So more important second shot this golf course.
