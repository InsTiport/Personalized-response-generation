Q. First off, you guys won out against just one player.  When did you know that you were only going up against Mel?
HARU NOMURA: She played really good today.  She's maybe 5-under today.  So far she made an eagle and birdie, and yeah.  She kept trying.  She made it, yeah.
Q. You guys were still able to come out with the win thanks to the big birdie you had on 17, Haru.  How long was that putt and what was your reaction when you saw it go in?
HARU NOMURA: Almost five meters, and little uphill slice, but I like slice lie.
Q. Mika, what's this event been like for you?  How has the experience been competing again in the UL International Crown?
MIKA MIYAZATO: Really great experience, and definitely more good teamwork, which is more important.
Q. Is there any approach going into tomorrow's final round against Team USA trying to make it to singles on Sunday?
MIKA MIYAZATO: As long as we play like today and communicate with each other, that will probably be what we will be doing tomorrow.
