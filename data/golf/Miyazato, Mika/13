  COLIN CALLANDER:   We have Mika Miyazato who has just fired a 2‑under par 70 for a total of 3‑under par total after two rounds.   You must be very pleased.  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Thank you.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   Did you play very well?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, I was patient out there, and I got a fast start.   No.18, I hit to about 30 sent meters, close to the pin on my third shot from 30 yards.   I hit 58.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   And you birdied the first hole.  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Also I hit the second shot 3‑wood, like 190 into the wind to just one feet, two feet.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   You dropped a shot at the third hole.  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, third hole is‑‑ I hit a hybrid second shot, pulled it a little bit left and I hit a third shot‑‑ but I ended up putting.   Then par putt was like 15 feet.   
5, I hit 5‑wood.   I went into left side of the bunker, then just laying up and then 55 yards to the pin.   I just made it.  
COLIN CALLANDER:   You holed it?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   Good shot.   And the eighth?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   8, I hit 5‑iron like 160 yards into the wind, 35 feet.   
The last hole, I hit 6‑iron just short about 15 yards.   I hit a chip shot, 58, but it was over the pin, like ten feet.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   And how were the conditions today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I think not so bad.   The wind is always out there but I pretty much stayed to my course management.  
COLIN CALLANDER:   Do you think it's a difficult golf course?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I think this golf course, but I don't think thinking it's a difficult golf course but I don't thinking it's a difficult golf course means, negative thinking, so smart thinking‑‑  
COLIN CALLANDER:   You were just trying to stay positive?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Stay positive.   
   
 Q.   You're in the middle of a great run including a victory, what's that down to?   You have Top‑10s and top finishes in your last few tournaments?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, to win the tournament‑‑ I have a lot of confidence in my golf game.   
   
 Q.   What do you put this really good round down to today?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I'm not thinking the result, just more one shot at a time and talking with my caddie about the course management, I think that's why.   
   
 Q.   And how difficult is the golf course?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   It is difficult but I'm thinking not a difficult golf course.   
   
 Q.   What time did you have to get up yesterday and today?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Get up?   3.30, 4.00, two days in a row.   
   
 Q.   And what happened to you on the course yesterday?   Can you tell us about your time on the course yesterday?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yesterday I played just two holes but I think nice par save, like up‑and‑down.   I think more playing yesterday‑‑ but to finish the tournament, chance to finish the tournament, and after the round, so much boring.   
   
 Q.   What did you do after the round yesterday, just sit around?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   More practise just around driving here.   
   
 Q.   Were you happy it was called off yesterday because of the weather, or would you like to have played?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I don't know.   I can't play yesterday but the problem is the ball moving.   
   
 Q.   What would have been a good score yesterday?   If you had to play, do you think 85, 90?   What would have been a very good score?     
MIKA MIYAZATO:   85?     (Laughter).   
   
 Q.   How different is it playing Europe than either the LPGA Tour or the Asian Tour?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Different.   This golf course, a links golf course, I feel like it's very close to the ocean.   As a junior, I played in lots of wind‑‑ punch shots‑‑ it's not past experience.   
So I know that this golf course has so much windy, but I know it's hard to play the golf course.   So in America, not so much wind, but greens are more tough.   And Asia, also, too.   
   
 Q.   Do you enjoy links golf?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I like it.   
   
 Q.   I know you gave money to the tsunami last year; did you know family or friends that were affected?   Was anybody that you knew affected by it?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   My family is okay.   
COLIN CALLANDER:   Thank you.
