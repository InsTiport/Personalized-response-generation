 Q.   Great playing today.   6‑under par round leading the tournament.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   What was the best part of the day for you?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Best part is putting, because I was 25 putt today.   I think best finish this year.   (Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   Overall with the new golf course, new greens to get to know, were you surprised how well you were able to putt on them?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Pretty good job.   One year is so much different the golf course.   I'm really surprised.   
So pretty tough condition.   A little longer than last year.   
   
 Q.   So with only 25 putts, were you hitting it close or were you making long putts?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Pretty close, the second shot was.   I don't know how much‑‑ maybe long putt was 30 feet, I think.   
   
 Q.   Okay.   So one long putt.   Other than that, a lot of short ones?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Have you been feeling your game coming together, and was today an example of your game working really well?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Pretty good is the course management.   I think almost 17 green regulation today, so pretty good second shot.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, really good.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   That's why, I think.   
   
 Q.   Just heading into the weekend, even after only one round, but at a major, to be in the lead, what's that feeling like?   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I don't know, but we play 36 on Sunday?   
   
 Q.   Possibly, yes.   But just heading in, what's it like to see your name at the top of the leaderboard at a major?   What do you think about seeing your name up there in a major championship?   That's pretty impressive.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, but I want to too much thinking the result.   More important is detail.   Like today I had a good putt, 25 putt, so keep doing just more focus in the my golf game.   
(Indiscernible) talk, but so much thinking.  
   
 Q.   Have you got to do anything fun in Evian this week?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   No.   I came last four years, so...  
   
 Q.   You've been around a lot.   Perfect.
