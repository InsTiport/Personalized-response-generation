 Q.   I guess just go through your round.   You had two birdies on the front, two on the back, and then your eagle on 9?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   All right.   How was your birdie on 9?   How did that go?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Eagle.   9, eagle.   
   
 Q.   Yeah.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Eagle is first time of the year.  
   
 Q.   First time of the year?   Okay.   Congrats.   
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Second shot was I think 220.   I hit with a 7‑wood.   I thought I was more short on the green.   
18 feet.   20 feet.   
   
 Q.   20‑foot putt?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Left‑to‑right putt.   
   
 Q.   I guess it's starting to get windier out.   Are you glad you got your round in?   How are conditions?   Was the wind picking up towards the water or how was the wind today?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Back 9 is pretty hard in the wind, but I hit a little contour shot and the (inaudible) shot.  
   
 Q.   I guess going into tomorrow what parts of your game did you think today are really going to help you out for the rest of the weekend?   What was really clicking today?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I hit almost perfect, but I think putting is more off today and second shot was pretty more confidence.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever played in the first group before?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, I did.  
   
 Q.   Do you usually score this well when you did?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Not really.   Today first time.  
   
 Q.   Is it less pressure when you're the first ones?   I mean there's not as much people around.   Are you more relaxed?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I want more crowd.   
   
 Q.   You want more crowd?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah.   That makes me more comfortable.   Yeah.   18 holes.   
   
 Q.   So you do better when there's bigger crowds?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Did you think you had a hole‑in‑one on 17?   It was close; right?  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah.   Like three feet?   
   
 Q.   Would you have gotten a new car or anything?  
THE MODERATOR:   I think it's hole 15 is the only hole.   So tomorrow.  
MIKA MIYAZATO:   (Laughs).
