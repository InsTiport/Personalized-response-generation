   MODERATOR: We're here with Mika Miyazato. She shot 4-under par in the first round. Talk a little bit about how you played today.  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) Today I was able to have a lot of good shots, and I had a really good putting day.   
 MODERATOR: How are you enjoying being in France at the Evian Masters, and how have you played here in the past?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I like here, so really hole good. But course is a little tough. Greens good and small, yeah.   
  
  Q. (Question regarding course conditions.)  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I think greens a little bit slow here.   
  
  Q. Slower today than yesterday?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. And were they more receptive because of the water and little bit of rain?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: A little bit green soft, yeah. (Indiscernible.)   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.)   
 Compared to last year, the greens are much slower compared to last year. Yeah.
