 Q. Mika, good to have you here today, you shot 4‑under par. Great start to a major championship. Tell us about the round, how are you feeling?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: I'm very excited because 4‑under finish is very good the first round. I made that eagle on No. 13. That's the most exciting about it.   
   
 Q. You had a couple birdies after that; is that right?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: I made a bogey after.   
   
 Q. So how are you feeling about the rest of the week? What time are you off tomorrow?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: I enjoy.   
   
 Q. And you like links golf; you like the wind?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: Today is no wind out there. It's more beautiful skies, so I don't know that tomorrow, maybe windy or rainy, don't know.   
   
 Q. What about your eagle, you holed a shot from the fairway. What club was it?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: I hit 6‑iron from 145 shot. So it's bounce, bounce, then go in the hole.
