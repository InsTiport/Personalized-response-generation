   THE MODERATOR: It is our pleasure to welcome Mika Miyazato to the interview room. She had a round of 4-under par, 67 today in the second round.   
 Mika, maybe you can just start us off with general comments about your fine play today.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I'm so happy to be here. So I play so well today. Like fairway tee shot is almost hole fairway -- like green regulation is like 18 -- 14 or 18, so like putting so well like 27 putt, so almost perfect.   
 THE MODERATOR: You must like the golf course here. Do you think the golf course here suits your game well?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Well, like my play is so well, like so aggressive golf today. Yes.   
 THE MODERATOR: Take some questions from the floor, please.   
  
  Q. Tell us how you learned the game of golf and how you became so good.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I play start to golf like 18 years old. So grow up is Okinawa in Japan. So I came to U.S. like three years ago. I practice with IMG Academy now, so...   
  
  Q. A couple of Ai Miyazato questions for you right now. Are you often confused with Ai? Do people think you're her? Do people think you're sisters?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Everybody ask me. (Through translation.)   
 THE INTERPRETER: Everybody thinks we're sisters. I think that way everybody could remember me, because Ai is playing great. In a way it's good for me because everybody think we're sisters and they could remember me. But we're not related.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about leading the championship right now?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I can't believe still, so I'm a little bit nervous but so excited.   
  
  Q. It's only after two rounds, but does it feel like three rounds?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes, it is. I played like one hole yesterday, so back to hotel. A little bit boring, so...   
 But it's I think did good time yesterday, so ready today or tomorrow.   
  
  Q. How are the relief efforts going back home? You're trying to raise money to help Japan, aren't you?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes.   
 THE INTERPRETER: Yes, I decided to donate all my earnings from the major tournaments on the Japanese tour and the U.S. LPGA Tour, so whatever earnings I make from the major tournaments I will donate to the Red Cross.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes.   
  
  Q. When you said it was really boring only getting to play one hole yesterday, what did you do in that downtime?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I went at the hotel yesterday, three hours a nap, then eat lunch and back to hotel again. Use Internet. Then came to the golf course, but delay, so...   
 THE INTERPRETER: Kind of a rest day.   
  
  Q. Donating from the majors, has that been the whole year? So from the LPGA Championship, the Kraft Nabisco, this one, and then also the Japanese Women's Open, money from all of those?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yeah, for British Open, too.  
 THE INTERPRETER: She also played the Salonpas World Ladies, which is one of the major tournaments back in her home tour, so that money will be donated, as well.   
  
  Q. Are you the only one donating these prizes, or is someone else joining in that effort?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I don't know.   
  
  Q. What is the strongest part of your golf game, and what parts do you think you need to improve on?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I think confidence like iron shot, like my golf style is very aggressive golf.   
 And shorter game is very well now.   
 THE INTERPRETER: I would like to focus more on the short game and putting. I think I have much room to develop on that area.   
  
  Q. When you say you like to play aggressively, could you tell us about that? Do you go hard after pins? How do you mean aggressively?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Sometimes go for hit pin, but like this week is a little bit different. (Through translation.)   
 THE INTERPRETER: At the U.S. Women's Open, I think just going for the green sometimes requires very aggressive shots. So for me, just sometimes it might be aiming at the pin or just aiming for the green, middle of the green, it's aggressive for me.  
  
  Q. Do you play like a Phil Mickelson normally?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I don't think so. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. As far as liking to gamble and take risks.   
 THE INTERPRETER: It depends on the situation. Sometimes I might just take the safe side, but whenever I have a chance, I'm pretty aggressive at it.   
 THE MODERATOR: You had five birdies on your card second round. Could you walk us through those holes, club selection and yardage and putts.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: No. 3 I hit 110 yards, like I use 9-iron. I don't know if meter is okay.   
 THE MODERATOR: It's fine.  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Like six meter, and No 4 hole I used the 7-iron, like two meter.   
 And No. 5 is 160, 165. I use a 6-iron like same as two meter.   
 No. 9 was like 73. I use 52-degree wedge like one meter.   
 No. 10 is like second shot was 170 yard. I use a 5-iron, like three meter.   
 THE MODERATOR: Other questions?   
  
  Q. Ai just made a birdie on 18 just before, so maybe you have a chance to be last group with Ai. So do you think it will helpful or give you pressure?  
 THE INTERPRETER: I'll be really be glad to play with Ai tomorrow. We are both from Okinawa. Obviously we're good friends, and I think she's a great player. Playing together should be good for both of us. I'm looking forward to it.   
 THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for joining us.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Thank you very much.   
 THE MODERATOR: We wish you continued luck in the championship.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Thank you.
