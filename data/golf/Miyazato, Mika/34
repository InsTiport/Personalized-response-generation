   MODERATOR: Welcome. Very good playing today. Just tell us a little bit about your round. 
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I hit shot very well today. Hitting good; putting very good; everything good. 
 MODERATOR: Questions. 

 Q. Did you have any idea as you were finishing up that you were setting the course record today with 9-under? 
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (In Japanese.) (Laughing.) 
 MODERATOR: When you got going, you really got going. You made five straight birdies and then four straight birdies.
 Was it one of those things where you made one putt and you just kept making them? Did you feel the momentum when you had those runs going? 
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) Everything was going inside my zone. Yeah, everything was going the way that I wanted it to.

 Q. You won your first international tournament in Japan. How much confidence does that give you to attempt to win your first LPGA event this week? 
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) Especially since the P&G Arkansas tournament my shots have been very solid and my putting has been very solid as well.
 I've been able to be more relaxed and play the game that is mine. 

 Q. With Ai getting to No. 1, has that helped motivate you to play better and say, I can do that, too? 
 MIKA MIYAZATO: (Through translation.) Yes, I agree. I think that's been a big effect as well. Yeah, I think I can be able to be the top as well.
