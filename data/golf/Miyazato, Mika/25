   MIKA MIYAZATO: Today I was much better short because yesterday was a little bit everywhere, not good green degradation, so much better today. So more birdie chances.   
So I made like five birdies today. So putting better, and everything much better.   
  
  Q. That's good. Knowing how tough it is in the afternoon, was it nice to go out and put up an early score today?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yesterday was so much windy, plus the morning was not much windy, so a little bit, yes.   
  
  Q. And looking finding yourself up near the top of the leaderboard, is it a nice feeling again?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes. I feel a little bit comfortable now.   
  
  Q. You've had a good year. Are you feeling good about your game and how you've been playing?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Well, my shot is very well like this year, just like the short game is my target point.  
  
  Q. Okay. Perfect.
