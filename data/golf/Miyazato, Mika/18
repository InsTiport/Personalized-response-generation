  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Mika Miyazato into the interview room.   Mika, nice to see you.   Great round today.   Can you take me through the day what you did well? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yeah, I had a good round today, bogey‑free round and a fine round today.   Also, I've not stopped rise, but 18 greens, (Indiscernible) I'm very happy.

Q.   You've had a good year.   You lost in a playoff at Wal‑Mart in Arkansas.   Can you just sum up this year like how much it's helped your confidence? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, I'm very confident.   After the Wal‑Mart, I finished second, but very disappointed.   But another good experience for me.

Q.   I know we talked on the way over that you're ready to go watch the soccer game of Japan versus the USA.   Have you been watching the Olympics a lot? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, I like watching the tennis and everything.   I definitely want to see the soccer game today.

Q.   Your last two birdies on 16 and 17, can you talk about what you did to get those and how it kind of took you closer? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Overall, I hit very good second shots.   And number 16, I hit a 5‑iron like one foot.   I made a birdie.   So number 17, another one for birdie putt.   So many birdies today on second shot.   Like I tried to have more patience on the golf course.

Q.   Knowing that this course can be scored on.   Do you just take it as it comes or do you play aggressively looking for birdies? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   This week, obviously, it's more important because I played today more aggressive because the greens are very soft. 

Q.   You mentioned getting home to watch the soccer game.   Are you excited about golf being in the Olympics and the prospect of representing your country in 2016? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I want to play in the Olympics in 2016.   I have a strong desire to be on the Japanese Olympic team and going to the Olympics.   I will go for it.
