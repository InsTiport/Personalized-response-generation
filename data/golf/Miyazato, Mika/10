  MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome our current leader Mika Miyazato, into the interview room.   Congratulations.   Sitting at 8‑under par after a 2‑under round today.
Take me through your day.   What was really working well for you out there? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I start day first, second hole two on the bogey.   And maybe not was today was thinking, but after second hole, just try do my best my golf game.   I was birdie 6 and 7 hole, pretty nice comeback. 
After 11 I went to the left side, the tree, and good up and down.   Made par. 
Finish pretty good No. 18.   I hit hybrid three and just this much okay birdie.   It's pretty tough day for me. 
MODERATOR:   When you look at 18, everyone is talking about what a tough par‑4 that is.   You had to hit hybrid in.   How excited were you when you saw how close that shot was to the hole? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I was thinking just to on the green, not thinking to made a birdie.   It's lucky. 
MODERATOR:   You won last year the Safeway Classic for your first win on the LPGA Tour.   This tournament is only going to be 54 holes due to the possible weather.   What would it mean leading now with 18 holes?   With 18 holes left at the moment, what would it mean to you to win a major championship? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I had that experience last year.   I won the Safeway Classic.   Not same situation, but this is a major. 
But just I heard rain tomorrow all day, but I still keep try more aggressive play I just thinking.
MODERATOR:   When you guys are now looking and you can see the weather forecast of so much rain tonight and tomorrow and you don't know when you might play, how hard is that when you're kind of unsure of when you're going to get back out on the golf course? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   That's pretty tough question.   (Laughter.)   But I don't know.   I try any situation, but I try to my golf game more important. 
MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   You are the second Miyazato.   The other one, more famous?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Talking about Ai Miyazato? 

Q.   Yes. 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes.

Q.   What was that like?   How much confusion has there been over the years?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I'm not confused, but I'm thinking lucky because same last name.   Looks like everybody say sisters, so everybody may remember me.
MODERATOR:   And you and Ai are very close friends and grew up in the same area of Japan.   I think that makes it more confusing for people that you're from the same area and have the same last name but are not related.
MIKA MIYAZATO:   No. 

Q.   Have you ever checked to see if you are related going back?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I don't know.   I never check. 

Q.   How difficult was it to get your confidence back after the first two holes with the bogeys? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I just mistake in the second shot yardage‑wise, so just figured out it's pretty easy, so...
MODERATOR:   So once you were able to get through those two holes and you knew it was just mistakes in yardage, you were able to get yourself back on track and didn't worry too much about the two bogeys? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Just two holes. 

Q.   Are you pleased with 54 holes?   Are you happy that it's just 45 holes?
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Not happy.   Usually major 72 holes, so I don't know. 

Q.   We just noticed the back of your jumper.   Who's little Pete? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   I need to answer?   I don't know.   This is my sponsor's shirt.   I don't know. 

Q.   Pete is not a good looking boyfriend or anything? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   (Laughter.)
MODERATOR:   Just a sponsor shirt, right? 
MIKA MIYAZATO:   (Laughter.)
MODERATOR:   Any other questions for Mika? 
Best of luck.   Hopefully we'll get some golf in early tomorrow.
MIKA MIYAZATO:   Yes, thank you.
