   MIKA MIYAZATO: Because I was play so good like a tee shot is almost every hole fairway keep, and the green regulation it's good hole maybe 16 today. So putting was like 27 putt today, so it's perfect today.   
  
  Q. You were aggressive going for the pin on 18. Were you aggressive all day long?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: My golf style is aggressive golf, so, but No. 18 so a little bit amazing.   
  
  Q. What about that little chip shot you had on 18 at the end?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Chip shot?   
  
  Q. What did it look like?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I work like short game practice a lot, so little bit confidence like last 18 chip shot, yes.   
  
  Q. Did you misread any putts today?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Nope.   
  
  Q. Did you do anything special or unusual to get ready for the altitude, and also for a U.S. Open?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Like this (indiscernible) is little different like one club, so I just thinking five, ten years.   
  
  Q. Did you prepare in any way physically or mentally?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: No.   
  
  Q. Anything special for the U.S. Open?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I just practice a lot short game.   
  
  Q. Where?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: What?   
  
  Q. Where and with who?   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Where? IMG Academies.   
  
  Q. Who is the coach? Is he here this week?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: No.   
  
  Q. The charity work at home with the tragedy, I know you have a website. Are you hoping that by doing well your name gets out there and maybe you help raise more money?  
 THE INTERPRETER: I have already announced that I'm going to donate all my earnings from the major tournaments in the U.S. and Japan. Whatever I earn this week will go to the Red Cross.  
  
  Q. What triggered that decision? How did you come to that decision?   
 THE INTERPRETER: A major tournament is very important for me obviously, and for a lot of the players. For me, major, winning majors is what I strive for, and to donate all of my earnings from the major I hope I could contribute to, you know, giving positive things to the people who are, you know, around the disaster area.   
  
  Q. What do you think of the course, the scenery around here at the Broadmoor?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: It's like this golf course is like very challenging golf course, like a very nice view but like...   
 THE INTERPRETER: Especially the par-4s are long and par-3s are pretty difficult, as well. The par-5s I think you have a chance to go at, but a lot of the par-4s are very tough I think on this course.   
  
  Q. What was the highlight of your round today?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: High one?   
  
  Q. Yes.  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I think No. 4, par-3.   
  
  Q. Do you think the weather delays helped you at all having that extra time off?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I was play just one hole yesterday, so I got a little bit boring in the hotel. That's good time.
