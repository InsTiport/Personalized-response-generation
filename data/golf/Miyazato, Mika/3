MOLLY GALLATIN: Good morning, everybody.  I'd like to welcome team Japan into the interview room.  Team Japan is our No. 3 seed this week at the UL International Crown.  This is their second appearance at the UL International Crown.  They finished third in 2014, and I'm happy to joined by Haru Nomura, Mika Miyazato, Ayaka Watanabe and Ai Suzuki.  Mika, you are the only returning member of that 2014 that finished third.  What kind of experiences from that event have you shared with your other three teammates?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: I would say more teamwork and more communicate.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: This is a question for all four of you, but how big of an honor is it for you to be here this week and to represent Japan at the UL International Crown?   
HARU NOMURA: First time team match this week, so I'm so excited.  Yeah, just I'm excited.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: It's your first time in team match play.  How will that inexperience in team match play, how can you use that to your advantage, Haru?   
HARU NOMURA: I think team match, very important team match, I think.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: Mika, is it important for you to get off to a fast start tomorrow against Thailand?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: Definitely is just more keep one shot at a time, but it's tough to play the match play.  It's different than normally.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: Is it important to get off to a fast start on the first day?   
AYAKA WATANABE: The first match is obviously very important, so I'll really, really go at it and try to get -- as we know, one of the players has won three consecutive tournaments, so I'm just going to have to go at it and just play my game.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: Team Japan was the only team that was out here very early on Monday morning practicing.  What are your thoughts about Merit Club?   
HARU NOMURA: I think very similar to Japan greens and grass.  I think a lot of wind is here, and some holes are long and some holes are short.  I think it's a very nice course to Japan team.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: Mika?   
MIKA MIYAZATO: Yes, is same green.  Undulation is more, pretty difficult.   
AYAKA WATANABE: Just like Haru said, it's just like the Japanese greens, so I think there's a lot of birdie chances.   
AI SUZUKI: In my case, because it's long holes, my chance of getting birdies is a little hard, but because it's like everybody is saying, the greens are just like Japan's, so I should be able to get them.   
 Q.  Mika, what's the interest level of this event in Japan, and have you seen it change in the past two years?  Is there more interest this year in Japan?  Do people care about this event in Japan?  
AYAKA WATANABE: I was watching it in Japan two years ago, so I'm pretty sure there is a lot of people that have an interest because it's an international match.   
 Q.  If you were to win this event, how big would that be in Japan?  
AYAKA WATANABE: There's still a lot of people who don't really know about this tournament in Japan, so winning it would make it better and more interesting for them to watch and have interest in it, so I will try to win.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: I don't know if all four of you know, but the winning team get to wear crowns.  Will you wear the crowns on your head as you travel to the British Open next week if you win?   
HARU NOMURA: Of course.  Of course.   
MIKA MIYAZATO: That would be interesting.   
AI SUZUKI: It might break, so I'm going to take it back to Japan.   
MOLLY GALLATIN: Thank you, guys, for coming in.  Good luck this week.
