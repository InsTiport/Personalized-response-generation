   MIKE SCANLAN: Mika, thank you for coming in. 10-under par today. Ties the tournament record. Just tell us how you played.   
 MIKA MIYAZATO: I'm so excited today. My best score today. My No. 1 hole, I made eagle. First time in LPGA tournament I've made eagle. So maybe I was a little bit nervous today.   
 MIKE SCANLAN: Questions?   
  
  Q. How will you approach tomorrow's round, knowing you're close to the top of the leaderboard?  
 MIKA MIYAZATO: Today's game I was fresh and I'll try to do my best for tomorrow, and hopefully I'll have a good result.
