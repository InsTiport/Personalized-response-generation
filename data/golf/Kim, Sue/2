  Q. Were you a little nervous this morning?

  Q. So you played on the CN Canadian Women's Tour this year?  
 SUE KIM: Yeah.  
  
  Q. It's been an awfully good year for you?

 SUE KIM: Next few days?   
  
  Q. Are you thinking maybe just now try and make the cut?  
 SUE KIM: Yeah, try to make the cut, have fun, do what I can do the best. That's probably it.

  Q. That would be, what, next year or the year after?  
 SUE KIM: I'm going to school next year at Oklahoma State.   
  
  Q. So you're looking at four years or so?
