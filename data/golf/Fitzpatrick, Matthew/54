Q. You grew up in Sheffield, so the wind you are familiar with.  What was it like out there today compared to what it was like growing up playing junior golf?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, very similar.  Very similar.  On top of a hill, so it gets really windy there.  You have got to learn how to control your ball and keep it under the wind a lot of times.
Q. The strategy involved in this kind of format, when the conditions are like it is today, how much does that change or alter the way you got about your business?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It's a completely day today than it was yesterday.  Yesterday you could be aggressive.  Less wind.  Whereas today it's all about hitting fairways and greens, if you can do that.  And just make pars it really makes your life easy.
Q. What an interesting match against your Chris Wood.  I imagine some emotions out on the golf course.  You were able to close it out here on 16.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It's always difficult playing a friend.  Playing on the Ryder Cup team with Woody and play on the Tour weekly with him.
Q. You have Justin Thomas going up on Friday.  Kevin Na won his match today, so you have to win and hope Friday.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, that's the plan.  We'll see what we can do.
Q. Will you be more aggressive or just play the golf as it comes?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Play as it comes.  It just depends on how he plays, I guess.
Q. (No microphone.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It was good.  It wasn't easy.  It was a bit of a battle for me and Chris with how windy it was.  You try to play smart out there today.  Played pretty nicely and scored well.
Q. When you go nose to nose with a friend, it's quite difficult, isn't it?  You have to battle against him.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, yeah, you really do.  It's always difficult playing someone you know really well.  Difficult to show any emotion, I guess, because they know you.  It's been a good day for me, obviously.  See what we can do tomorrow.
Q. The conditions weren't easy, were they?  You are not unused to these conditions.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, not at all.  I grew up where it's always windy on top of the hills.  You really got to control your ball flight and keep it under the wind.  I think it helped playing here today.
