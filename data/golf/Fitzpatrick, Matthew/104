Q.   How do you feel after that?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I felt like I played all right.   I played well for nine after the first hole.   But the back nine just trickled a little bit.   Just trying too hard, a few loose shots and it cost me, really.

Q.   Especially through Amen Corner you really got out of trouble.   How were you able to kind of stay focused when you're in the bunkers and over the back of the green a couple of times?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Just trying to get as low a score as possible.   Just trying to chip it as close as I can and hole the putt.   That's all I'm thinking about, really.   There's not much else going on.

Q.   What's your mindset about blocking things out but enjoying the moment?   How do you balance that?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Just trying to realize where I am.   I'm playing a Major championship with only the best golfers in the world right now today.   And just realizing that I'm only 19, as well.   So hopefully a few more years of growing up a little bit and getting a little bit wiser, might make life a little bit easier.
It's not easy out here.

Q.   You see Adam out there today, other than his mistake on 12 he was all over it. 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I don't know what to say other than just have it on a piece of string.   That's what I felt like, anyway.   Maybe a couple of loose shots, but other than that it was great to watch.   So it was really cool.   And such a great guy, fantastic player, fantastic. 

Q.   Can you tell us what Steve said to you at the end?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, he mentioned‑‑ he's not fond of soccer or football.   By the sounds of things he's going to change me over to a rookie league.

Q.   What does it do for your confidence to see, as you said, the best golfers in the world?   Even they're struggling a little bit on some of these holes, what does that do for your confidence?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I don't know really.   It's interesting.   Obviously for the best players there are in this field I don't know that it helps me out or hinders me that they're making mistakes.   I've made mistakes, as well. 
It makes it hard for me, especially when they're used to playing in Majors and used to playing around here, then they know what to do once you make a mistake.
I think obviously they're finding it tough.   So I'm likely to find it more tough. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)   Can you talk about the advice he gave you?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Just all sorts, really.   We were talking about his win last year and the gym and stuff like that, really.   Mainly we were talking about the weather today and how dry it was after the rain.   That's about it, really. 

Q.   Tell us what happened on the first. 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I pulled it left.   8‑iron out to about 60 yards, chipped on to hole a 6‑footer.

Q.   It seemed like Adam was making an effort to put you at ease.   Did you feel that way? 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, definitely.   Yeah, two good guys.

Q.   Have you stayed in the Crow's Nest this week?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I have not, no.   I stayed one night and one day, and I'm staying in an apartment now.   I should spend some time with him.

Q.   What was it like when you stayed out there?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   It was fine.   It was quite nice.   Is sleeps five, so it's not cramped, anyway.   But it's one of those things you've got to do, not something that I disliked, anyway.

Q.   Was there anyone else?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, there was two of us.

Q.   If you had to mark yourself under ten today, what kind of marks would you give yourself?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I don't know.   I would give myself a six, probably, six or seven.

Q.   You played at the Junior Invitational, not too far away from here last year, how did that get you used to the condition of the area, at least?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I've got to admit it's completely different.   It's just so much harder than here.   It's just so much different.

Q.   Could you ever have imagined a year ago that you would be standing here?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   No, I said if you would have said to me my soccer team would get to the semifinal of the FA Cup and I'd play at Augusta, you'd just never, ever believe me in a million years.
