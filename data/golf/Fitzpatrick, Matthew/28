 Q.  Your thoughts after that performance?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was a bit crap. Played great. Just one or two shot, but you look, that could have happened the first day. Just happened to happen on 9 today, but yeah, just disappointed because the way I played this week, was fantastic. To lose by one is obviously very disappointing.   
 Q.  How much does it get to you when you come close? You seem a very passionate guy.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it's disappointing. It's my fourth of the year. I've been in the position -- well, three of the four times, I've been in the position with the lead. And yeah, just all the guys just played better on Sunday.   
I wouldn't say I've particularly thrown them away. I think I've played well when I've been up there on a Sunday. Yeah, just other people really keep grinding, and I keep coming up from behind. It is what it is. Obviously it's still a great week. Obviously here to win and not here to just make up the numbers.
