Q. The birdie on the final hole helps tonight?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely.  It's a good start.  I didn't make the putts but I gave myself a lot of chances.  Nine chances inside 15 feet today.  Played pretty well, not expecting to quite drive it as well as I'd like around this place.
Q. 2-under, you're within striking distance.  So you didn't put yourself out of it, you're still in it very heavily.  What's your mindset?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, absolutely given the last two majors, I think I started 5 over at the Masters.  So after that I'll have played really well.  So hopefully I'll be within a shout.
Q. Do you feel comfortable here at Pebble?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I'd say so.  There are some holes that make you feel uncomfortable, there's no doubt about that.  It's just the way the course is designed.  But, yeah, it's a great golf course.  You've got to hit your shots.  It's tough.
