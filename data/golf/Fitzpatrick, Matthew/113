 Q.  What was your reaction to that one?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Disappointed, obviously.  A double
bogey on the last.  But just one of those things.  There's worse
things, and I was just thoroughly enjoyed my day, really, but it's
not too bad.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  First tee, as I walked through.  I
don't really know how to describe it other than the crowd erupted.
I guess, I got a lot of support from home, which is great to have,
especially if you have a bad hole.  It picks you back up.  Now I
have a lot of highlights, and not many lowlights.
Q.  What about the round on the way around, as well, once you
got used to it?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  I sort of got going on the front
nine, got it to 2-under.  And then just struggled a little bit on
the back nine.  But I holed a big putt on 8 for par.  And again
the crowd just went crazy.  And it's just a great feeling, really,
to have it.
Q.  You're one of two amateurs that are (inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Don't know about that.  It might be
that I am the -- they might just feel sorry for me.  But it's
great to have the support and to look around and see familiar
faces as well, is always a good thing.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  No, hopefully not, hopefully not.
Although I'm pretty sure someone asked for my pass this morning on
the range.  No, it was.  It was going into the locker room and
someone said, can you show me -- do you have any ID or whatever?
And I had to show my badge, and he was like, oh, sorry.  So it was
a bit bad today.
Q.  The greens looked tough?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Yeah, it was tough.  A lot of the
areas on the green are now going shiny.  So they're literally --
you touch it and it's off.  I know a couple of the guys I played
with today they putted quite well.  But there's a couple of
occasions that caught us all out, the way you hit the putt, just
catch the top of a slope and it was gone, six, seven feet past.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Exactly.  Exactly.  There's a lot
worse places to be.  I originally planned two weeks off, it would
be sad at home watching it, but this is miles better.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  I had A levels this year, so they
only finished about five, six weeks ago.
Q.  What did you do?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Geography, history and PE.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  I'd definitely say this.  I'm
fortunate enough to have my university place.  So they didn't
really matter too much, I guess.
Q.  Where are you going?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:  Northwestern in the States.
