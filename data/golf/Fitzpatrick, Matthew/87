Q. First time in Hong Kong?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Second time.  I was here on holiday when I was younger.
Q. As far as playing?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: This is the first time, yeah.
Q. So I've got to ask you:  What does it feel like, this first tournament you've played in as a champion of a tournament?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It's nice.  It's been great.  A lot of people have kind of said well done, which is obviously a really nice feeling and really nice of them to do that.  But yeah, it's great.  I know it's a great event and it was on my schedule all year.  I was looking forward to playing here, anyway.
Q. And the organisers haven't laid on any extra perks for you and your family?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, my family are not here this week.  No, no, no, they are just at home.  My dad is still working and stuff.  But no, the tournament's been great with me, and you know, had a great time so far.  Have a good weekend and see where we're at.
Q. You're getting all the comparisons now with Rory; do you find it flattering or tiring?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, I don't think you can ever get tired of that.  But yeah, absolutely fine.  If I have a career as good as his, then I'll be a happy person.  He's world No. 1 for so long for a reason and he's a great guy obviously.
Q. Who was your idol growing up in golf?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I wouldn't say I had an out-and-out idol.  I watched a lot of Tiger.  I think if you asked most people my age, they watched Tiger.  I would probably have to say him.
Q. Was he the impetus to get you into the game?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think that was my mom and dad.  It was my mom and dad, really, more than anyone.
Q. Have you had a chance to really sit back and digest what's happened to you the last few weeks?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No.  I was five days at home and it didn't sink in at all.  I think it will be the end of the year where I finally realise where I'm at really or I manage to make Top-50 and play Augusta.  I think that might be when it hits.
Q. Do you feel like after that win, you kind of are playing on house money in Hong Kong?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just the same, I try to keep things the same.  No point in trying to change it.  It worked two weeks ago.  Just keep working on the things that I need to work on and see how it goes really.
Q. What did you think about the course?  Does it suit your game?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Good.  I feel like it does.  It's quite tight.  You don't want to go in the rough.  Just got to think about what you do off the tee and stuff.  It's a good course, and like I say, it was on my schedule at the start of the year because people say you'll enjoy it, and so far I have.
Q. Did you feel any different this week?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, I don't think so -- a little bit.  A little bit.  Not like trying to be show-off or big-headed but it's nice to sort of have that to my name.  I wouldn't say it made me feel any different.  I'm still like -- at the start, I was like -- I bogeyed 9, I was like, right, the cut's level par.  I'm still looking at making the cut.  I've come a long way quite fast.
Q. Are you even thinking about The Ryder Cup next year?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No.  I mean, it's obviously a long-term goal in the future but obviously everything's happened so fast.
Q. Got to stay in the moment with golf.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Hopefully.  Hopefully.
