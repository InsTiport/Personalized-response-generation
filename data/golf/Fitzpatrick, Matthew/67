 Q.  Thoughts on that opening round?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Good start, yeah.  Pleased with that one.  Hopefully three more of them.   
 Q.  It's a tough day out there.  How are conditions getting up?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it certainly started to blow as we turned.  The wind was sort of moving a bit all over, as well, so it was difficult to gauge where it was.  To finish 3-under for the day, I think is half-decent.  Good to get in.   
 Q.  Nice mix of attack and defense out there for you.  What are you most pleased about with that round?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I drove it really well today.  That was something that I've been working on the past few days.  You've got to drive it well around here and it was nice to do.   
 Q.  Plenty of wind now and plenty of experience.  Do you walk out there with a certain confidence now?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: A little bit.  You always want to be confident in yourself and for me, like you say, won three times and won over here, in particular.  You just feel comfortable.  Certainly what I took into today and what I take into every week I play out here.  It's a great experience and hopefully can capitalise on it even more.   
 Q.  Tell me about the experience of being out there in that three ball.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Playing with Tiger Woods is just a fantastic experience and one I'll never forget.   
 Q.  Will you share any moments you had, any chats?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just general golf chitchat.  Just talking like you would on the golf course, yeah.  Nothing too exciting.
