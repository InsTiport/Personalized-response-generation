 Q.  What do you make of your performance out there?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It had miss moments.  Great irons.  (Indiscernible) misjudged a couple of putts out there.  I think as the day went on after each pin, unfortunately couldn't really tell, there was a couple towards the end where they were right dead centre and I missed the hole.  But yeah, delighted to be in this position.   
 Q.  You battled the round yesterday.  A round of level par was superb in those afternoon conditions of round one.  Is there a real sense of having to make hey when you get nice conditions in the morning today?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think so, yeah.  I think it's a little bit like that, definitely.  The golf course is so difficult.  There isn't really many holes where you can relax.  Normally in a round of golf there's two or three where you can just walk your way around and if you miss the fairway, even though you miss by five yards, the rough is pretty thick.  The fairways are so tight and the rough is so tight.   
 Q.  Outside looking in in terms of the Ryder Cup, your game is trending in the right direction.  You can see that weeks before, obviously playing well we U.S. Open, too.  Being here on site, is there any more importance of playing well this week because of where we are?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Well, no -- I mean yes, there obviously is.  I mean obviously it helps Thomas in any future decisions made.  But me personally, I'm not thinking about it at all.  Mr. I play well there or not.  I know in the past I have not played in the past.  For me personally when they set the golf course up like this that I've got more chance, because I just know the last couple of years I think they've been probably prepping the golf course for Ryder Cup and they have to chop a lot of goals, a lot of rough down and not just playing to what I feel is my advantage.  So I think when they set the golf course up like this, yeah, I think it suits me.
