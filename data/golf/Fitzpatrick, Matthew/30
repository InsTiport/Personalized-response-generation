Q. So, so far the low round of the day out there. 5‑under. Tell us what went right for you. 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I just hit more fairways today. Yesterday I really struggled off the tee and didn't hit it in play at all, really. 
So, yeah, just sort of fixed that on the range in the evening and then came out today and hit a lot more fairways, gave myself more chances with my irons and took advantage that have.

Q. And an eagle as well. Can you walk us through that?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely, it was obviously needed. The round was sort of just ticking over and then I birdied 12 and actually got lucky off the tee, pulled it, it went through the trees, left me a 6‑iron and I managed to give myself a good eagle chance from about 12 feet and made it. 

Q. The conditions out there today, a bit softer, perhaps?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I would say definitely, yeah. The first few holes obviously were very soft. I actually pulled a 9‑iron off the front of the 1st. And particularly going into the back nine, those par‑5s that are reachable, it sort of certainly makes it a lot easier to be more aggressive and to take your chances.
