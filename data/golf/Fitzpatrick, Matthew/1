  Q. Can you just talk about how it felt to come out with a win today?
 MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   It was good.  It was a good day.  I was just happy I didn't give my holes away.  That was the big thing for me.  Corey would probably say he didn't play his best today and he gave me a couple holes early and that got me off to a good start, and then I kind of hit some good shots, as well, kind of built on the lead.
 Q. What part of your game was working for you today?
 MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Just everything was solid.  Hit plenty of greens and made the putts when I needed to, and I drove it well.  I drove it well the two days, just didn't make the putts the first day.  Yeah, delighted to get the win.
 Q. What does this do for your confidence going into tomorrow?
 MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I'm going to need a result.  I don't know what's going on behind, but I think I need Matt to win and I need to play well and beat him tomorrow.  That's what I'm going to need -- I'm going to need some help.  Yeah, we'll see what tomorrow brings.
