 Q.  How was that for you?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was a good day.  Really pleased to get off to a good start.  66, 4-under, it's a couple back but 66 is always sort of quite nice.   
 Q.  What was going right for you today out there?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Scrambled really well.  Sort of made, not a mess, but a couple of bad putts and a couple of bad chips that just got a way but just managed to make the putts to save myself.  Holed a few good, 8-, 9-footers to save par, and capitalized when I gave myself chances.   
 Q.  Birdied the last, also.  Makes lunch taste that little bit better, doesn't it?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Absolutely, especially dropping in, that's nice.   
 Q.  The crowds came out and the sun came out, as well.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I said that on the par 3, five, looking around, Rory chipped to about a foot and the crowds, it was a lot and really loud.  It was great to see.  We were always going to get good crowds up here.  It's fantastic to see.   
 Q.  You won your last start in the mountains at Switzerland and looks like that form has carried over to here.  Does it feel that way?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, my game feels in decent shape.
