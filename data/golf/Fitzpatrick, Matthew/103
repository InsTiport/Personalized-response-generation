 Q.   Playing your first professional event and you've made the cut, how do you feel about that?   
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, delighted.   That's the first thing, to make the cut, it's a nice feeling.   Disappointed to finish with two bogeys in the last three but one of those things you have to learn from.   
Yeah, delighted to be here for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   You've had a taste this weekend of the sort of thing that happens when you're leading play, a lot of media to do, a lot of interviews to do; what do you think?   
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Keeps you busy, that's for sure.   Yesterday was sort of a long day and I was up early, and then stuff after the round, still a bit of practise, and then after that, it was fairly okay.   
   
 Q.   Your stated goal is to make enough money in the seven starts that you've got this year to get your card for next year.   Having made this cut, do you now go aggressively and try and make this cheque as big as possible?   
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I think so.   There's nothing to lose now.   This is my first‑ever job, so it's a nice feeling, so I'll just try to do the best I can this week.  
   
 Q.   Graeme McDowell made his first‑ever cheque the last time this tournament was here; you wouldn't mind following his career, would you?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   If I did, I would be a very happy person.   That would be absolutely great if that was the case.
