Q. What are your thoughts on a nice finish?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Delighted.  Really pleased with the way I've played this week.  Hopefully it's going to be the 10th Top-10 of the year, which is a nice little stat to have, particularly for my first year.  Yeah, it's been a great week.
Q. Do you have to pinch yourself at times, because that's an astonishing stat for a rookie season?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think so.  It's been pretty special the last few months.  Played really well.  Just sort of got on a good run and kept notching up the Top-10s.
Q. Story of this week, fairly solid throughout and building up to a nice score?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No real low ones unfortunately, but like you say, all in all, delighted to have another Top-10.  That's kind of the secret goal this week was to get to that 10th Top-10.
Q. And all good foundation for the future coming here, as well, when you get to know a course and experience what it's all about?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely.  It's not an easy course.  You've got to hit it well.  Hopefully next year I'll be a little bit longer and able to take advantage of a few more of the holes.
Q. Hopefully you set some time to sit back and digest, but what were your expectations and how much have you exceeded them?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: A ridiculous amount.  I was just happy to keep my card.  You compare to keeping my card to where I was projected on the Order of Merit, 12th I think, safe to say just exceeded it a little bit.
Q. Have you spent any money as a result?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Not yet, no.  I'm speaking to Chubby later I think about some cars.  So maybe we'll have something by the end of the day.
