Q. Looked like you were taking everything in your stride out there.  You spoke on course that everything just seemed to be clicking, is that how it felt?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, it was a solid round.  It was a really solid round.  Did everything really well.  The only bogey I made, I got really unlucky that somehow my 52 normally goes 128.  Pitched to 103 I think.  One off the green and made it difficult to get up-and-down.  On the whole, everything was solid so just keep it tomorrow.
Q. Birdie, birdie coming home.  How difficult was the course, a few gust, colder and damper?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Than normal, yeah, definitely.  Early on, it was a little bit windy, as well.  The wind kind of died on the back nine which was definitely beneficial.  The wind today made the course, certainly on some holes, a little bit easier -- the ones into the wind played tougher.
Q. Absence of a few fans, but coming down 18 without seeing the holes framed by the stadium, what does it look like?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   It's just a shame.  It's a real shame.  It's baffling to me still that there's not a few fans allowed in.  I can't understand it whatsoever.  But it definitely quieter, which is, unfortunately, to be honest, makes it a little worse and I'm sure that everyone agrees that it just doesn't have the same feeling coming down the last few holes.
Yeah, I mean, it's still a fantastic golf course and a great event, but it just really sad, obviously, not to have any fans.
