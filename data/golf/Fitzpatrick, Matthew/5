  Q. (No Microphone.)
 MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I actually felt like I hit the ball solid and hit a lot of good shots and didn't really put myself out of position, which I think is the key around here.
 Q. What part of your game best suits this golf course?
 MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   I think probably accuracy off the tee.  I really do believe you got to hit fairways here to give yourself a chance into the greens.  And I think that when I'm driving it well I can do that.
