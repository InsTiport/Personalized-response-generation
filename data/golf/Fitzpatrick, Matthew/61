 Q.  What was the difference from the first two days to today?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Not a lot, I admit.  I really didn't feel certainly yesterday I didn't feel like I had my A game.  And even the first day, I played nicely, but I never really gave myself a ton of chances.  So I don't really feel there's been too much difference, just the bad ones were a little bit worse today.  And you can't make as many birdies as you like.   
 Q.  Did the course change from the first two days to today?  We saw some lower scores out there.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I don't know, if anything it was firmer.  The positions I was playing, which weren't great ones, made it difficult, so it was difficult to tell.   
 Q.  What do you feel like you have to do better tomorrow to be able to chase down Kevin?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just hit more greens.  I'm going to take a guess that I hit about nine today and I think about three chances inside 15 feet.  So, if I can do more of that and just give myself chances like that, hopefully, I can have some good looks at birdie and make them.
