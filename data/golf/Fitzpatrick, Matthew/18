Q. Matt, tell us how the journey around the golf course today was for you?
MATT FITZPATRICK: It was a bit up-and-down. Certainly didn't have any A Game today. Yeah, just didn't feel comfortable really out there with my drive. The fairways around here are tough, and that was a bit of a grind. Yeah, to get in at 13 that was good. Yeah, you've got to be on your game.
Q. Louis birdied the first five holes, so that putts extra pressure, I suppose?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, of course, you're looking at leaderboards, and anyone that says otherwise is a liar. You've always got it in your mind, that you know what you need to do and at the same time, got to try and stick to the game plan.
Q. Tell us about that long putt.
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, that was a 58-foot putt. To hole one of those to save par was huge. Look back at the end of the week, if tomorrow goes very well, then you look at that and that was sort of a turning point maybe.
Q. You have to dig deep now and again, and so to finish on 18 with a birdie, a positive about that?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, huge. Hit a good wedge shot in. A little disappointed I didn't get a little bit closer, but to make that 9-footer down the hill, yeah, it certainly gives you something going into tomorrow.
Q. And coming into this week, you want to be in this position, don't you. You don't want to be going out at 9.30. You want to be going out towards the end.
MATT FITZPATRICK: Of course you do. That's why everybody is here is to win. If not, you may as well go home. Be a good day tomorrow. Unfortunately Rory is playing very well. He's playing very annoying. I've got to play well tomorrow. That's why it's a World Golf Championships. It's got the best players in the world. Be interesting.
