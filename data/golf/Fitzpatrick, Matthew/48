MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I just didn't play very well.
Q. How difficult is it when you're out there early on and you you're not playing as well as you want to (inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It's tough, because everyone else is shooting good scores.  It was pretty easy early on, and just dropped a few early, and it's just difficult to come back when you're playing Open Championship Sunday.
Q. Feels like a missed opportunity, does it?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I mean, I couldn't win, obviously.  I was 11 back going into today.  So I needed a 59, if everything stayed the same.  Obviously Jordan dropped a couple early.  But it's a Sunday of an Open, you're not going to shoot 9-under.  Yeah, just one of those days, really.
Q. (Inaudible.)  Do you go away and analyse what good things were, what the bad things were?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely there was some good in there, which is always nice.  But just again, just too many bad shots that just cost me too many dropped shots.
Q. What is up for you now?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just got a week off next week and then Bridgestone, U.S. PGA.
