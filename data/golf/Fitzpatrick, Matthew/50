MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It probably calmed down now in comparison.  There's no doubt about that.  But, yeah, I would definitely -- I definitely would say that I'd take 1-under.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  You can really see that someone that plays well, you can really golf your ball around here and make a few putts along the way and before you know it you can be 3, 4, even 5-under, depending.  These guys are the best in the world for a reason, so I wouldn't put it past any of them.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, hopefully.  Another good round tomorrow.  Obviously don't know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow.  But I'd probably take 1-under if it's like today.  You're never going to be too far off the pace.
