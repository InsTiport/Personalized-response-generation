Q. Awesome round. Talk us through that one. 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was just lucky. I just played really well tee to green. And I just gave myself a lot of chances. And that was the big thing for me today. Just kept giving myself chances. And I had a lot of putts between six to 15 feet. And certainly the back nine I started to hole them. That was the difference. 

Q. Do people wonder as a smaller guy how you still hit it so far?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I guess. I don't feel like I do hit it that far. But what was really funny was someone came over to me on the range the other day, and was sort of joking around really because he was saying that obviously I don't know‑‑ a lot of guys are saying I don't know if he hits it long enough to compete. And yeah, I was leading the greens in reg after the first two rounds. He was laughing at that, and he was pretty supportive. 
And so I think that certainly today I played well enough to shoot 67. And I'm not trying to prove a point, but it's maybe just helps me put my mind at rest if I was worried if I belong.

Q. The last two days have been tough for the weather, how were the scoring conditions and how did the course set up for you today?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: The course is set up for a low score. The flags are quite friendly. There's a few that are iffy. But I think at the minute the only thing that's probably defending the course is that it's pretty firm and you've really got to be careful where you pitch it. But I think there will be a few low ones today. Like you say, it's still not playing easy. It will be interesting to see the finish.

Q. How did you decide to put the big purple block N [referencing Northwestern University] on your bag?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I've been back a lot to see my friends and I've been able to see a lot of guys over here and in Europe that have it on their bags from their college. And speaking with friends, what do you think about having it on the bag? They were in full support. So first week on the bag and first top 10 of the year. 

Q. Did they [Northwestern] give you extra credit for it? You only took four classes total?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I'll maybe try to go finish my degree in four years or something.

Q. How is this experience compared with as an amateur?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It's different. I think when I came as an amateur, I didn't have any expectations, mainly it was to make the cut. Here this week I've managed to make the cut but I just think it's different. I think every shot really does count. As an amateur when I played it didn't really matter too much if I missed the cut. It was a great experience for me, and I think I wouldn't have done as well as I did this year without that, if that's what you meant. I think it helps to know the course well.

Q. Did you get any advice from Pat Goss or Luke Donalds?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, not particularly, no, no. Nothing here in particular. 

Q. You should finish in the top 12, how do you feel about getting back?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I can't wait. I wouldn't say it's been playing on my mind all week, but I know it's the case in the background. Yeah, hopefully finish top 12.

Q. Can you already think of this as a big step forward?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. I think it's‑‑ I think for me it's just a momentum boost coming into the rest of the season, I guess. It's the first major of the season and really the start of the year for everyone. So, yeah.
