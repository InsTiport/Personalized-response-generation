Q. A bogey start for you, but did you envision your 64 out there?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, not at all.  It was a great day.  Hit it really nice and scrambled when I needed to.  It was a great start to the week.
Q. What's been the aspect that you feel has most been tested around here today?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think tee to green is pretty tough if you don't hit it in the fairway.  The rough is deep, but it's quite wet so it clings to the face.  And it's difficult to get the normal distance with your irons.  So it's a test all around really, but tee to green.
Q. The season has really gone from strength to strength, hasn't it, for you?  You could be looking at a Top 100 in the world finish.  Did you envision that at the start of the year?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Not at all.  It was a tough start.  I missed quite a few cuts in the row at the start of the year, even though I felt like I was playing all right.  But now I've been playing decent and getting the right results that I've been looking for.
Q. How do you think playing on the main tour has changed you as a golfer?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just gained so much experience, I really have just week to week, learning more about myself, about tournaments, just everything.  I think that's being the biggest thing.  This year I can come away from it and say I've learned so much.
Q. Just finally, being an Englishman, it must be great to see another top tournament back in England?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it doesn't better than that.  This is the first day and the crowd has been absolutely fantastic.  They are really happy and been great all day.
Q. Three Top 3s in your last seven events.  This has been all part of a good run?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Same again would be lovely.  Top 3 here would be absolutely lovely.
Q. What's been the key for you in this realm?  Is it getting used to playing on the European Tour?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I couldn't put it down to anything.  The only thing I would say, I started hitting a fade in Switzerland at Crown.  That was sort of the start of the run.  I don't know, maybe I just felt like I've had more control over that.  Bad ones aren't quite as disruptive.  So, yeah, probably go with that, I guess.
Q. You have been close, you are contending.  What have you learned and what do you have to do?  Is there anything you have to do differently?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Just keep playing.  Just keep working hard on my game and trying to do the best I can.  If it works out, it works out.  If it doesn't, just got to try a little bit harder, you know.
Q. Any highlights in particular for the -- was it eight birdies?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yes.
Q. Any particular long ones?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: A couple nice ones.  Stuck it close early on, stuck it to about four or five feet on 7, the par-5 for eagle.  That was nice, sort of got me going a little bit.
Q. That big roar at the end, birdie-birdie finish?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: My dad has brought ten customers from work, so I think they've been chowing most of the day, which is nice.  It's nice to have some support really.
Q. What is your dad's name again?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Russell.
Q. From where he works?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: At his bank.  He is a bank manager.
Q. They took advantage of the free Sky tickets, I presume?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I assume they must have, and my free tickets.
Q. A good start, I suppose are you delighted?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Great start for me.  I played nice today, and holed some putts to shoot 7-under.  So it's been a good start.
Q. You got plenty of work done early and then managed to kick on from that, I suppose?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, absolutely.  It was sort of a good front nine, and then got a little bit stale in the middle of the round.  Made some good up-and-downs and some good par saves.  Then just sort of finished quite strongly.  Saw the last three, I was like wanting to get in level par on the last three.  I know they're tough holes.  It's small greens and flags, came into the last three, so picked up two.  So that was really good.
