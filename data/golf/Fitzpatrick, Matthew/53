Q. Nice pull out win here.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was a good comeback.  I managed to finish with four in a row, so it was good.
Q. What did it do for your confidence beating Justin Thomas with the year he's had so far?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: He's been playing great so far.  It helps me sort of get confidence in myself, with my game and where it's at, especially leading up to Augusta.  It's been good.
Q. The match behind you will determine the rest of your day.  Will you stay and watch or will you go in and see what the results are?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No.  I'll just go in and see what the results are.  I think it's about to rain.
Q. Four birdies to close him out.  Was there a moment that switched?  Did the light go on?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: My caddie said let's finish with five in a row and that might be enough.  I hit 3-iron stiff on 14.  Then had a perfect number on 15, not too stiff.  And then 16 wasn't a great drive, but again pitch number was perfect so we hit it close there.  The number felt great on 17 as well, but just pulled it a fraction and it was a good leave.  Just let my caddie line me up because I struggle on the greens, and it went in.
Q. What was the number on 16 that was really a clutch shot with Justin being already up by the green?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think it was 128.
