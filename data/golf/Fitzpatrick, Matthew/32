 Q.  There was some really good shots today.  Is that what you're taking from that first round?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I'll take back the two shots the entire round.  I played great tee to green.  Barely put myself -- I didn't miss a fairway other than the first.  And then just couldn't hole a putt, just couldn't make anything on the birdies inside 2, 3 feet.  Just couldn't make anything.   
So, yeah, that's cost me again.   
 Q.  But it shows that you're right in there and that you've got the game to do really well here.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Definitely.  If I can keep giving myself the chances and have three good putting days for the rest of the week, I'd like to think I'll be up there.   
But I think today getting an early tee time, not as breezy as it could be this afternoon, is a missed opportunity, really.   
 Q.  When you stepped on the first tee did you feel there was going to be a good score in you?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I feel like I've been playing well all year so far, bar a couple of weeks.  And just last week I played well, as well.  And I putted a little bit better.   
But that has been the difference in my season, really.  If I can putt well in the remaining weeks the rest of the year, I think I'll have some really good results.   
 Q.  What was it like?  Because we spoke to you before you arrived here, and now you're here, what was it like?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: It was brilliant.  The atmosphere was brilliant.  Good shot, bad shot, everyone claps.  It's busy.  There's a ton of people out there and it's great to see.  It's great for the tournament, great for golf in general, really.  It's been brilliant so far.   
 Q.  A quiet confidence about you, would you say?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Quiet frustration, I would guess.  No, I feel like my long game is in a good spot, just got to try and take advantage of my chances the next few days.
