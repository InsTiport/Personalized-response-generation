 Q.  Off to a flying start, four birdies in five holes and that fantastic putt on 4, downhill from 50 feet, something like that.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, 57 feet, I think if my paces are right.  But yeah, it was a great start.  Sort of what you're looking for on a Saturday, a day you're trying to make a move and a good start.   
 Q.  Wind seems to have changed today, and the distance you're able to drive it on 18, how does it change the dynamic of the back nine, particularly?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I think the back nine, the course plays more cross-wind.  The front nine is a little more down and into.  So that's obviously gotten a little tougher.  The flight on the back nine, it's a little more accessible because the wind is sort of blowing towards and at the same time still have to get it in play off the tee.   
 Q.  You struggled over the links in Ireland last week.  What's been the fundamental difference this week seeing you scoring well?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I couldn't really sort of get on with the course last week.  I didn't feel like it suited my eye.  I didn't hold too many putts last week, as well.   
This week's a lot better.  I've putted way better and I feel comfortable around this golf course.  It makes a big difference.   
 Q.  Nice to be up there in contention.  You've got yourself to the top end of the leaderboard and hopefully the leaders won't get too far ahead this afternoon?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, that's the thing, late tee off times here this week, so a lot of golf to be played out there and hopefully the wind stays like this and makes it difficult.  You never know, the scores are pretty low.  We'll see.
