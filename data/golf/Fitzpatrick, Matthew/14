Q. Describe your European Tour season to date?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Very good, yeah. Technically my best year. You know, in terms of World Ranking points. Mainly that, really, and my play in general, my strokes gained stats and stuff like that. The only thing that's missing so far is the win, but a chance to fix that this week and next week.
Q. How much can you use the experience of winning this tournament in the past to help you this week in your quest to win?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I think having that experience in 2016, to have been able to done it around this golf course, was massive.
You know, when I first ever came here, it wasn't a golf course that people thought I could do well around, really, but it's a golf course I love. I feel like it suits my game. I have good iron play and really good putting, and that's the big difference, really.
Q. How would you describe the confidence you feel?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Right now, I would say it's pretty high, yeah. I feel like my last couple of results, I have two Top 10s and my game feels like it's trending sort of in the right direction. It's a shame that the year is coming to an end and there's not a major coming up soon, but it's been a good year and like I say, I feel pretty confident right now.
