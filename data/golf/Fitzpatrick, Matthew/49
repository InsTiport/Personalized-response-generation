MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Obviously we got that rain as well on the back nine, which is always helpful.  Scrambling to put waterproofs on and off, on and off.  So, yeah, we definitely had the worst out of the draw, there's no doubt about it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Not necessarily -- yeah, yeah, it does.  There's no doubt about it.  But I think you still go through your routine.  You still -- until you fully commit to the shot, you don't start your routine.  I think you've still got to keep your rhythm that way.
Q. But the wind (inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, for us it was, for the first 15 holes, and then the rain came down on 15.  And it pretty much died, to be honest.  So for the guys out there now obviously the rain isn't ideal, but no wind makes it a little bit easier, I guess.  But we still had three holes left and it was raining pretty hard, and we were just trying to sort of all grind it out, to be honest.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I'm delighted.  Obviously, to make the cut in a major is always a good thing.  So now just two days of bad scores, my first two days, and hopefully move up the board.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, I'll just go home, relax, eat dinner, find out when you're off tomorrow and take it from there, really.
Q. (Inaudible.)
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Absolutely.  The crowds are always -- it's the best event of the year for the crowd and they show every time, and particularly in this weather today they've been fantastic.
