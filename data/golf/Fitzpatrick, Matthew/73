 Q.  What kind of year has it been for you and how important is it to you that you finish the year really strongly?  
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it's been a big year for me, obviously making The Ryder Cup Team, that was my goal at the start of the year if I'm honest.   
Now I just want to play as well as I can from now to the end of the season.  I'm not really setting myself any targets.  Obviously you always try to win, so that's sort of always the goal but yeah, just purely going to try to play as well as I can and work as hard as I can until The Race to Dubai.   
 Q.  You mentioned The Ryder Cup.  You're one of the rookies on the team.  How big of a learning experience was that for you and what can you take from that going forward?  
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was a fantastic experience.  It was something that I really enjoyed doing and I don't think really it's difficult to describe how good it was.  Obviously the atmosphere of the tournament and everything going on around it was incredible.  And for me to sort of be part of that was special.   
 Q.  And the cauldron atmosphere, you being part of that and experiencing that, does it help you learn about yourself and develop as a player?  
MATT FITZPATRICK: I think so.  From everything I've heard before, we got told how hostile it can be there and it sort of lived up to expectation in my eyes.  A lot of people were saying that it was worse than normal last week.  But I sort of almost expected that.  It obviously was interesting to see and experience it.
