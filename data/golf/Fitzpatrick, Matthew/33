 Q.  How are you feeling overall?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, obviously disappointed.  Just one of those things.  Had a bit of a look the first playoff hole, but yeah, it's just been a tough season so far, really.  Not holing the putts.  Missed a chance on 16 there.  Didn't hole it.  Holed a 12-footer on 17 in regulation.   
It's disappointing.  Been playing well.  Obviously that showed coming here, and getting into a playoff, which has been great.  It's a good week overall, but yeah, disappointed not to top it off.
