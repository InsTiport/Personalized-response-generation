Q. Ultimately not the finish you wanted, is that fair?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, very fair. It was a tough weekend. Didn't have my game yesterday. Last night we found something on the range and I felt much more comfortable with it tee-to-green. Didn't really translate on to the golf course. Just a little bit sloppy. I just didn't hole any putts this weekend when you needed to, and I had a lot of probably between 8 to 12 footers that I just didn't make to make anything of it.
Q. You said yesterday, people who don't look at leaderboards are liars, so when you get to two or three, you're tied. I know it's early but there was momentum early on.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, of course, eagling 2 is what you want. It's just the start I wanted and gave myself a chance at the next, missed that. Straightforward iron on the next and missed a short putt. You can't do that. Simple things like that that probably this year, just held me back a little bit just not making those easy shots easy.
You know, it's a good week overall, but yeah, definitely a little bit disappointed.
Q. In the mix, penultimate group, WGC?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: True, but finished outside the penultimate group. Yeah, I'm always very tough on myself. Everyone tells me that. I don't see Tiger Woods or any of the boys at the top going easy on themselves. It's what makes me tick, I guess. I just want to get better all the time.
