 Q.  A final round 67 here in Abu Dhabi, and the incredible Rolex Series performances that you bring continue. How do you feel about today's performance?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Good, yeah. Apart from one missed putt, wouldn't take a shot back, and to come off the golf course, that's a great feeling, despite not enough to win, it's been a great week.   
 Q.  It's very rare that we see you not have two great putting days in a row. It looked like after 2,3, and 4 we were going to see one of those days today?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, definitely. Front nine I felt like could I hole everything and managed to hole one putt for par, which was nice to keep a bit of momentum going.   
Yeah, just on back nine, just couldn't make a thing. It was just one of those days, but hey, that's golf. I'm delighted. It's a great start to the year, and sort of you're always a little bit nervous when you come into the start of the year after taking so much time off. So to come back and play as well as I felt I have done is a positiv,e.   
 Q.  You took a share of the lead after 4 and I'm sure would you have noticed on the leaderboard Tommy making a run today. At what point did you think things weren't turning for you after the turn; that you might pull something or stick to the process?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: That Tommy Fleetwood, he's so annoying. He just comes from everywhere, but yeah, he's definitely one of those, I have to stick to what I was doing; and he's probably the most disciplined golfer I've ever played with, just picking targets and sticking to them and not even being tempted to be greedy, really.
