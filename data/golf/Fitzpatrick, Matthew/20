Q. You drive it straight the middle, putted well. What was difficult?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Back nine I struggled with the driver a little coming in. Certainly the back nine, I putted fantastic, as good as I've putted all year.
Q. Leaving the flag in, you've really got an eye for it. Every time I see you with a putt over 12 feet, I feel as though you've got the pace of these babies out there. Do you feel like that when you grab the putter?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Certainly on the back nine. Talking to Phil about it on the way around, I think it focuses me a little better. Just see the line stood over it better and from there you feel comfortable. That's the big thing in putting and certainly did it on the back nine.
Q. But 67, the flags, a little tougher?
MATT FITZPATRICK: I think so. I think the way this golf course is, if you're on the wrong side, it makes a difficult up-and-down. The rough is tough. The greens are firm. They are slopey, as well. Yeah, today was definitely difficult.
Q. You say the rough's tough. How conscious are you?
MATT FITZPATRICK: A lot. It's so important to the fairways here, because you miss them, you've either got a terrible lie and hacking out, or you've got a good lie and getting a flyer. It's a big key to hitting fairways around here and if you can keep doing it, you'll give yourself more chances.
