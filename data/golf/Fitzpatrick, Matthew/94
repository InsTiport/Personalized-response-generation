  MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Really pleased.   Changed the game plan a little bit from last week.   I felt like I was a bit sort of playing a bit too safe and playing away from flags which sort of had to do around there but scoring was so low.   Anyway, you had to be aggressive to make the birdies. 
Yeah, just tried to play a little bit more at the flags today, and even though some of them were tucked, the wind helped for the direction you need to go to get it close.   Holed a couple of putts which is always nice.

Q.   You mentioned the wind.   Nothing like as strong as it was for the Pro‑Am but still a consideration. 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, absolutely.   It's definitely a club or two.   Sort of unlucky at my golf course at home, it has similar wind, probably stronger.   It's probably like the Pro‑Am wind every day to be fair at my golf course.   I'm fairly used to it, which is not too bad.

Q.   Nice track, one that you immediately like? 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, definitely.   Played it Sunday.   Got here early and played the back nine.   It was nice.   It was in great condition and it suited my eye.

Q.   You seemed to take it entirely on the chin after South Africa.   Did it take much to recover after what happened on the final day? 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Not really.   I think it probably would have if I had not played very well; I think I would have been a lot more disappointed in myself for not doing better.   But to play as well as I did and still miss out, it was disappointing but the fact that I played well, I was just alive, really, under the pressure.

Q.   Nice to carry on the form in a sense? 
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK:   Yeah, definitely.   It's good.   Sort of been playing well for a little bit and last week it was a little bit disappointing to miss the cut but hopefully another four good rounds here will do the trick.
