Q. Thoughts on the round today, please.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, really pleased, 4-under par.  The weather towards the end of the round was a good finish, really.  It played pretty nicely all day.  Nice to string a few birdies together early on.
Q. Give me an idea of the positives out there.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I feel like my game is in good shape.  Hitting it really nicely.  So hopefully take that in tomorrow and we can go even lower.
Q. You'll have to go fairly low.  Do you feel you have that score in you this week?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, definitely.  I got off to a great start, 4-under through nine; get off to that start again, and the back nine is really scorable.  Hopefully get off to that start and see what we can do on the back nine.
