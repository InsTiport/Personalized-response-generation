Q. What was the difference today then?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I just think the course is definitely a little bit more to be taken, really. The greens are softer and I just felt like it was easier to get at a few flags maybe, just because you could stop it. The first two days I've actually drove it brilliant all week, just not really hit the irons close, but I don't think ‑‑ me, I don't think I've been able to hit them close, so I had a few longer irons than most people in and the flags are tucked and the greens are firm, so I think just that weather's just made it a fraction easier.

Q. Did you think you caught some good luck that you went out early, that it wasn't windy, that the rain held off when it wasn't really supposed to?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: A fraction, yeah, definitely. Didn't rain overnight, I don't think, so I was a little surprised that how soft they were this morning. But obviously it was nice to get out there and make a score, really.

Q. It wasn't that windy when you were on the course, was it?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No, I wouldn't say so. I think you get gusts‑‑ obviously, I mean we played 12 just completely still, it was like perfect golf, really. So that was pretty nice. 

Q. Obviously if it starts gusting and stuff these guys could, at 9‑under, 7‑under and 5‑under could come back to you at even. Do you feel like you're in a good position after today's round?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I'm glad that I'm finished, yeah, absolutely. I think that no one can touch the golf course now, so it's only going to get ‑‑ it's not going to get easier, unless it really, really just poured down, which by the looks of the weather, it doesn't look like right now. But I think that it would have been nice to have picked up two more and sit in the clubhouse at under par, you never know what then happens. But I'm delighted with my round and glad that I got it in this morning.
