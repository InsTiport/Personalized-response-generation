 Q.  69 to move to 4-under par. What are your feelings on your position?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I think I might get overtaken a little bit. Obviously I'm one of the first groups out.   
Yeah, it was a good round. I had a good go around the middle there. Got a little unlucky on 16 from two foot. The ball jumped in the air and missed the hole, basically.   
I'm playing solid. But then I was a few weeks ago, so it's good to take into the weekend and next week.   
 Q.  These flags tucked away in these little compartments, what is the thought process behind when you can go for one, when you can attack it and when you have to play smart here?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, for me, in all seriousness, it's just playing smart around here. You do miss a green in the wrong spot and you're short-sided, even though if you get a good lie, you can spin it like crazy.   
It's just so tough. You miss it on any sort of downslope, you just can't stop the ball. So for me, it's all about hitting lots of fairways, lots of greens and just hoping you can make some putts.   
 Q.  Just finally, they call this place the 'Caddie Graveyard' and you have one of the most experienced caddies of all-time on the bag (referring to Billy Foster). How is he coping?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: He's great. He's won around here with Westwood before, so he knows what it takes. But no offense to my other caddies, but we've had the least problems so far this week. So far it's been good.
