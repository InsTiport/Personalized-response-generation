Q. A 69, day two.  How was that?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was a good day.  Played really nicely.  Got my irons going a little bit better this week and the past few weeks.  That's given me a few more opportunities with the putter and taking better chances.
Q. You had three birdies in a row at the end of the round.  Was that due to the iron play?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was.  I hit a great 3-wood into 14.  A 7-iron to about four feet on 15, and then hit driver by the green and lipped-out with a chip on 16.
So yeah, a little unlucky on the last three.  Lipped-out there.  Lipped-out on 17 and smashed a club on 18.  But yeah, I'll take 7-under.
Q. How are conditions compared to yesterday?
MATT FITZPATRICK: A bit trickier, definitely.  Definitely a bit trickier.  The wind swirls a little bit and picks up and sort of let's down a little.  Yeah, it's not too easy.
Q. Had fun playing with Haotong, too?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it was great.  Obviously Haotong, he's a local here, so brings a few crowds, which is always nice.
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow?
MATT FITZPATRICK: Absolutely.  7-under, good position on the leaderboard, so we'll see.
