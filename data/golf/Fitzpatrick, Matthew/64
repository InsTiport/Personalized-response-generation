 Q.  12-under, your reflections on that?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, delighted.  I'm really, really pleased.  Had a bit of bad luck on No. 8, blip on the card but after that, got going again and I played really well.   
 Q.  Talk me through some highlights and what you were doing well out there.  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Finishing with three in the last four was great.  Holed two really long ones, 15 and 16, and just sort of sparked a bit of momentum.  Hit a good shot into 17, made that, and then a good shot into 18 and gave myself another chance.  It was a really good end to the round.   
 Q.  Looking very comfortable and confident about your game right now, aren't you?  
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it feels good.  It's funny, I was saying, it feels like the best I've played in the desert season, even though I've only played two events and made one cut.  But I feel like it's sort of -- hopefully the result today is deserved of how I feel I've played.
