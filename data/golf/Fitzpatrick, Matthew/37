Q. You showed great character to battle back and finishing with a round under par at the end of the day.
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, hopefully that's my worst round of the week but even at 3-over, I didn't feel like I was playing that bad.  Just got a couple of up and downs that just were pretty simple to be honest and didn't make them and obviously you look back and go, you make them and I'm three shots better and I'm two behind Rory, three behind Rory.
But I felt like I could sort of get back at the course and kept playing how I was playing and make a few putts.
Q. Is there where the mental side of the game, things are a little bit stronger when you've had a bad run and perhaps you've not got the reward for the shots you've played.
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, a little bit.  You can't get too down on yourself, 3-over through seven, this early in the round, I know I've still got four par 5s, three par 5s to play.
You know you can sort of get up on all of them if you have good ones.  It makes -- you've got sort of to look ahead of you and forget what's already been on and just try and get on with it.
Q. It's quite congested with the exception of Rory, who is a little bit clear at the moment, but can you be aggressive around here if you need to be?  I know you've got the par 5s coming in, but that front nine, particularly.
MATT FITZPATRICK: Yeah, definitely.  I think it depends on how the greens are tomorrow.  Hopefully stays the same and like you said, it's going to take a bit to catch Rory but you can be more aggressive.
Q. Fantastic crowds as always.  What's it like playing in front of these galleries in your home country?
MATT FITZPATRICK: It's fantastic just to be back in England, and after the first sort of third of the year, I've been over in the States more.  It's the best to be back in the U.K.
