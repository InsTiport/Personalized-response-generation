Q. Card says 10 shot difference from yesterday to today.  Did it feel like that?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: No.  Not quite, really.  I just made putts.  I made probably -- I looked at my stats, I was about three shots back short game and four shots back putting.  So that's seven straightaway.  Probably drove it a fraction better, but actually my approach play was only like .1 better.  So actually not too much different, tee to green, just made the putts and then got up-and-down there.
Q. You had a lovely little run there in the middle of your round where you had five birdies in six holes.  Was there any one particular trigger that came to you right there, anything that threw the switch on to the goal section?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Not really, no.  Just start making the putts really.  Just felt more comfortable on greens, probably about that pace.  And then all of a sudden 1 goes in, 2 goes in, and you get on a roll and you feel like, you know, everything is up.  So, yeah, it was a good day.
Q. You have a bit of a reputation for prospering on tough golf courses.  Do they suit your mindset?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: I guess so.  I feel like they suit my game a little bit more.  You can't get away with anything 40 yards offline.  I think the furthest offline I've hit this week is 10 yards from the edge of the fairway.  All my other fairways I missed by a yard or two.  I think that's been a big key, I've hit a lot of fairways.  So this has been the key.
Q. So you'll be looking forward to tomorrow.  What are you going to do now, because you've got quite a rest until you tee it up again?
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Yeah, it's quite nice.  Just have some lunch, maybe a little practice, and then, yeah, call it.
Q. Have a good weekend.
MATTHEW FITZPATRICK: Thank you.
