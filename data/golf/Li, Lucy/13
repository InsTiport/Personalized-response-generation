Q. Can you just tell me a little bit about your play today?
LUCY LI: Yeah, I played really well today, actually.  I'm hitting the ball way better than I was yesterday, and the last couple holes, I rolled in a couple of 20-footers unexpected, so that was really good.
Q. Do you think that you played maybe a little more aggressive today?  What was one of your keys that led to success today?
LUCY LI: Yesterday I was kind of having an issue with my swing, so I kind of figured it out on the range after my round, so that really helped, so I hit it much straighter today.  And my putting was just good, just a confident stroke, and I think the greens are a little smoother today, so that helped.
Q. Do you think the wind affected you at all?  It seems like the flags are really blowing today.
LUCY LI: Yeah, it's kind of been blowing like this for the last three days, so I'm kind of used it to now, but it affected the last couple holes a little bit.  It was making the greens firmer.
Q. Pretty exciting to beat a Curtis Cup player?
LUCY LI: Oh, yeah, of course.  Mariel is really nice, and I had a lot of fun playing with her, so it was good.
