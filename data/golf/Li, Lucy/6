Q. The putts didn't fall for you today; you had a pretty good opportunity on 9.  Just talk about the putting, just didn't seem to be quite there.
LUCY LI: I don't know, I just think it wasn't meant to be.  I hit those putts good, and I made a lot of really good putts on the front nine.
Q. Sum up your week.  I know you're very disappointed that you're not going to walk away with the title, but you're medalist, get to the semifinals, furthest you've ever gone in a USGA championship.  Talk about your accomplishments this week.
LUCY LI: Definitely.  I felt like I played really well this week.  Even today, I played really well.  Obviously being medalist -- I just really wanted to make it further than I did last year, and I'm really happy for the way I played.
Q. How will you learn from this experience going forward?  Obviously you have some big events coming up, the Women's Amateur in a couple weeks, same type of deal, the stroke play/match play.
LUCY LI: Yeah, I'm really excited for the U.S. Am next week.  Obviously a lot of confidence from this week coming in because I feel like I'm much more physically strong than I was last year when I was in the quarterfinals of the Women's Am.  I have a lot of confidence going into that week, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Q. Talk about the way Alexa played today.  She's 13 years old and really has a lot of poise for someone so young.
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.  We both played really well today.  I made a couple of mistakes with my drives coming down the back nine.  But I felt like we both played really well.  Most of the holes were won with par or birdie, and it was a good match.
