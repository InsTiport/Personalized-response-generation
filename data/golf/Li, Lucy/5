LUCY LI: I played really consistent today, hit a lot of greens.  I felt like there was a few putts I could have made, but I still made a few good saves.  Overall just a really consistent round.   
 Q.  How was the course playing today?  
LUCY LI: It was playing really receptive.  The greens are really soft, so you could really attack the pins out there.  It was getting a little bumpy at the end for the putts, so there was a few spike marks out there, but other than that, it's in really good shape.   
 Q.  Obviously great run at the Girls' Junior.  How does that kind of carry into this week?  
LUCY LI: Obviously it gives me a lot of confidence with my putting.  I made a lot of putts that week, so that just gives me a lot of confidence for this week.   
 Q.  What's your mindset going into tomorrow's round?  
LUCY LI: Well, there's still -- this is a long week.  Just got to keep going and doing my thing.
