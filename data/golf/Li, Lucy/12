Q. Going for the dramatic finish, aren't we?
LUCY LI: Yeah.  Shannon just played really well.  She made three straight birdies.  The only bad swings I hit were the drive on 14, and then that wedge shot on 17 was really bad.  But other than that, Shannon just made a lot of birdies, and she played pretty well today.
Q. And you got up early in the match; just talk a little bit about that for me.
LUCY LI: Yeah, Shannon bogeyed the first two holes in a row, but then she came back, she birdied 4, and then she -- I made like a 40-footer on 5 to tie her birdie, and then I won a couple of holes after that.  She made -- she putted really well on the front nine.  She made a couple of birdies.  But I just putted really well.
Q. What do you think may be one of your keys to winning today?  What was iron play, putting, driving?  What was it today?
LUCY LI: Putting for sure.  I made a lot of really good putts today.  That was good.
Q. You basically are a veteran at 14; how do you think that your experience coming in, you're so young and even still young, has really gotten you to where you are?
LUCY LI: Yeah, for sure.  I've learned a lot about match play because I used to get really flustered or upset after I hit a couple bad shots or maybe started to let leads slip away, but now just learning to be a lot more calm on the golf course.
