Q. It was a long day of golf.  You don't look too happy.
LUCY LI: Yeah, I was 4-up through 8.  I was playing really well, and then afterwards just kind of went downhill from there.  But at least I got it done.
Q. I know you're young, but 43 holes of golf in one day is a lot for anybody.  Just talk about the grind, and then you had grinding matches today.  They weren't walk-overs.
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely the first two matches were really tough, actually, especially the first one.  She wasn't making any mistakes and I had to make birdie on the last hole to win that match, and that gave me a little confidence for the next two.
Q. And you had to come back in the round of 32 match.  You were down and I believe won three or four straight holes to get to 3 & 2.
LUCY LI: Yeah, yeah, well, she was playing really well at first and then I think -- yeah.
Q. What does it say about your game that you can grind through these types of matches?  Sometimes when you may not have your "A" game, especially down the stretch when it's a long day and you're still able to grind it out and win?
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.  I feel like this match could have -- I played really badly on the back nine.  Could have ended a lot earlier.  But I mean, making that four-footer on the last hole definitely gives me confidence.
Q. Gives you something to think about going into tomorrow?
LUCY LI: Yeah.
Q. Because obviously you've got potentially another long day tomorrow, but at least it will be -- you're done.  There are girls out here that are probably going to have to come back and finish.
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.
Q. Does it feel good to get --
LUCY LI: Yeah, I mean, I played so much golf today.  I had two matches go to 18.
Q. Have you ever played 43 holes in a day of competition golf?
LUCY LI: No, never.
