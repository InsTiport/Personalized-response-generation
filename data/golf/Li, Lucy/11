LUCY LI: This is the farthest I've ever made it in match play, and yeah, I beat a lot of good players the last three matches, so I'm really proud of that.  Played really well yesterday.  So I'm just proud of my week in general.   
 Q.  What are your plans for the rest of the summer?  
LUCY LI: I'm going straight to Solheim after this, the junior Solheim, so that will be really fun.   
I couldn't hit the ball straight today. I don't know if it was because I was tired after 36 holes yesterday or what. I'm very proud though, this is the furthest I've ever made it in match play. I beat a lot of very good players in the first three rounds, so I'm proud of myself.
