 Q.  So you think you played well today?  How are you feeling?  
LUCY LI: Well, actually I didn't play that great today.  I didn't hit the ball so good, but I made a lot of clutch putts, which was really good.   
 Q.  What was the final score of your match?  
LUCY LI: 4 & 3.   
 Q.  You've won a match at the Women's Am.  How does that feel?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, it feels great because I kind of struggled the first few holes, but then I got it back and I kind of hit the ball straighter, and that's good.   
 Q.  Was there any hole where you really felt you were able to turn it around or any moment?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, I think -- well, No. 1, I made like a 12-footer for par, which was really good, and then I was like 1-down after three because I three-putted, and then on No. 7 I think I hooked my drive into the rough and I couldn't really get the club on it, so I advanced it like 20 yards.  But then I hit it out, and then I had an eight-footer for par to halve the hole, and I think that was really good.   
 Q.  What's it like playing against all of these older high school, college aged girls?  Do you get maybe a little -- do you feel daunted at all by it, or is it just another match to you?  
LUCY LI: No, I think, because golf is score against score.  It doesn't matter who you're playing against.   
 Q.  Tomorrow is a two-round day.  Tomorrow is a long day.  How do you prepare for something like that?  
LUCY LI: Rest.   
 Q.  Rest and a good hamburger I'm guessing?  
LUCY LI: Yeah.   
 Q.  What are you doing tonight other than resting?  
LUCY LI: More resting.
