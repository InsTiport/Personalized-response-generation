 Q.  Want to talk about your match a little bit?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, my match, I started off a little rocky.  I made a bogey the first hole, which was the only bogey I've made all week, actually, and then we got called in for the lightning delay.  I think that kind of helped me get my mind off it.  I got to hang out with my friends, and went out there and then birdied the second hole, so that really gave me confidence in moving forward, and I didn't make a bogey after that.  Played really well.   
 Q.  Can you just talk about your stretch on 9, 10, 11, you won all three holes?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, well, I won 9.  She hit it in the water.  It's a tough hole.  And then I birdied 10, made a good 10-foot putt for birdie.  And then won 11.  She hit it in the bunker.   
 Q.  Obviously it's a long, grueling week.  How key is it to kind of finish off your match when you had the chance to early like that?  
LUCY LI: Oh, definitely.  You know, it's match play, and anything can happen.  I've had matches where I've been 5-up, 4-up and gone all the way to the last hole, so it's definitely really important to push down the pedal and try to get it done.   
 Q.  And then going into tomorrow's match, is anything going to change or keep the same game plan?  
LUCY LI: No, I feel like I've been playing really solid the whole week, and I've just got to keep that going.
