 Q.  4-under today?  
LUCY LI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Were you happy with your performance?  
LUCY LI: Oh, yeah, definitely.  I played really well today.  I hit all 18 greens, which I've never done, so that's pretty good.  I putted okay, but that putt on the last hole was good.   
 Q.  No bogeys today.  
LUCY LI: Yeah.   
 Q.  How were you able to manage to make pars?  
LUCY LI: Because I hit every single green, and I two-putted all of them (laughing).   
 Q.  What was the best part of your game today?  
LUCY LI: Ball-striking.  I could have made some more putts.  I didn't hit them super close because this golf course is really long.  Hit a lot of hybrids into the greens, but yeah.
