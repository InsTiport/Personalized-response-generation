 Q.  Lucy, firstly, congratulations on a good second round.  It's looking like you're going to make the cut.  Can you tell us a little bit about how you're feeling?  
LUCY LI: You know, kind of disappointed.  I played really well today and yesterday except the last four holes.  Bogeying three out of the last four is not good.  So yeah.   
 Q.  But you won the Junior Inspiration earlier in the week; how did that prepare you for the round and how did that set you up?  Do you feel comfortable out there?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.  I know how to play this golf course under tournament conditions and under pressure for sure.   
 Q.  How was it playing with Michelle Wie?  She was obviously at the top of the leaderboard for quite a lot of the round.  Did you feel any extra pressure playing with her and the crowds and everything like that?  
LUCY LI: No, it was a lot of fun playing with her.  She's really nice, and she kept it relaxing, and I just played okay.   
 Q.  As someone who -- Michelle Wie obviously did well when she was a young girl like yourself; did you learn anything from Michelle on the round?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.  She played really, really well the last couple of days.  She actually putted really well, and her short game has been really good, so definitely.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to this afternoon, is there anything you're going to do to prepare?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, definitely.  The last four holes I didn't strike it very good.  Hit a couple of pulls, and my putting hasn't been very good the last couple of days, so I'll probably work on that, too.
