Q. On to the quarterfinals.  What's kind of been working for you?
LUCY LI: I've been hitting the ball really well this week.  I've only missed like four or five greens the whole week and I've been putting really good.
Just been really confident.
Q. You're playing quick out there, confident.  What's the plan for tomorrow?
LUCY LI: Yeah, we played 17 holes in like three hours today.  That makes me so happy.  I like playing fast.  She's a good friend of mine and she plays really fast.
So I just got to stick with my game plan tomorrow just play my game.  I'm playing against my good --  probably going to play against my good friend, Kristen.
She's really good.  So honestly I just got to play the best I can, and whatever the result is I'll be happy with.
Q. Looked like a fun, comfortable pairing for you.  The commentators were talking about how she was kind of high fiving you after good putts.  Did that kind of help you stay focused?
LUCY LI: Yeah.  We're really good friends.  We've played AJGA tournaments together.  It definitely helped me being more relaxed.
But I feel like that's kind of the key that I've had the last couple weeks.  I feel like my mindset has been so much better, a lot calmer on the golf course, you know, even when things aren't going my way.
So that's a huge key.
