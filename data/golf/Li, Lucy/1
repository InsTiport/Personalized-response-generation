Q. Where is your confidence with match play?
LUCY LI: Yeah, I've played a lot of match play this year.  I won at Polo, which was all match play, and Wyndham Cup, so definitely did have a lot of experience with match play knowing that if you're down you can always come back.
Q. Talk about your putting.  We saw you make a lot of long birdies.  Missed a couple short ones, but how do you feel like you're putting right now?
LUCY LI: My putting has been getting a lot better.  These greens are a little tricky for me, but I started rolling it a lot better today, so I feel good.
Q. You've been in this position before.  What can you draw from your past to help you tomorrow?
LUCY LI: Just it's really important to stay patient and just play my game, and I know that I'll be fine.
