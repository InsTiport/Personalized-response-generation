 Q.  6-under today; what was working well?  
LUCY LI: I hit the ball really good today.  I hit all 18 greens, which I haven't done in a while, so that definitely helped.   
 Q.  Medalist at the Girls' Junior, co-medalist today.  How does that build your confidence heading into match play?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, it definitely gives me a lot of confidence.  I've been playing really well recently, and I think it just keeps the momentum going.   
 Q.  What do you like about the match play format?  
LUCY LI: You know, I played a lot of match play this year with Curtis Cup and Wyndham Cup last week, so I definitely have a lot of experience.  Really looking forward to it.   
 Q.  How do you think this course sets up for match play?  
LUCY LI: I think it's a really good course for match play.  There's a lot of birdies out there, and there's definitely a lot of places where you can make mistakes, so that's really good for match play.   
 Q.  What would it mean to kind of make a run in this championship?  
LUCY LI: Definitely would mean a lot for me.  This is the biggest tournament of the year, obviously, and just take one shot at a time and see how it goes.   
 Q.  Did you know where you stood and that that putt was for solo medalist?  
LUCY LI: Yeah, well, I saw the -9 before I teed off, but it wasn't really my main focus the whole day.  I was just trying to play my game.
