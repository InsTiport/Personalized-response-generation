 Q.  Suzann Pettersen.  Suzann, thank you so much.  How do you feel about a half? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I think that's pretty good.  I think the course was tough.  We made some putts and managed to get some balls going our way the last couple of holes, so very good point for us. 

 Q.  Two down with about eight holes to play. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Just have to fight.  Get the spirit up.  Play with your heart, and good things will happen.  It looks pretty good. 

 Q.  How aware are you of the situation with the other matches? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I looked around and tried to see the blue markers on the board.  It looks pretty good compared to what it did this morning.  So you have to go out there and fight again this afternoon. 

 Q.  You only lost one foursomes match in 11 tries.  What's the secret? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Great playing partners.  Rescue me when I hit in it trouble, and the other way around.  None of us give up.  We play for each other and play our hearts out. 

 Q.  Congratulations. 
 How important was it to get off to a good start today, this morning? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Didn't really get off to a good start.  We had to fight our way back and got a half point, which we never looked back. 

 Q.  How do you feel about a half point? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  It feels like a point.  It looks like it was the best we could get, and it was good. 

 Q.  You and Sophie compliment each other.  What worked really well for you? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  We both handle each other well and trust each other and play with our hearts, so it's no problem. 

 Q.  How is this one different, this Solheim Cup different for you? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I mean every Solheim is special. 

 Q.  Pretty close to home. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I'm pretty close to home.  It's always special.
