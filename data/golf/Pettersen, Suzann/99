Q.   Can you talk to us about your thoughts now, this is the first victory on U.S. soil.   How big is that for you, how big is that for Europe?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's massive for women's golf, it's massive for Solheim Cup, for us to be historical and win on American soil, in Colorado, in front of pretty much an All‑American crowd.   We took it to them and they couldn't answer. 

Q.   Talk to us about those rookies, because you've made a lot of their importance within the team and what they have done?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Our rookies, I don't even think we can call them rookies, even though Hedwall is still in her teenage period, but, I mean, she's one of a kind.   And what she's brought to the team this year, it's just fantastic humor and just no worries, no hesitation, and it's priceless. 

Q.   A word on the belief.   Because Lotta had a belief in herself and in the team from day one.   And she kept that quiet, but she had a confidence, didn't she?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I want to give Lotta all the credit for having the guts to actually pick all the rookies, to pick the youngsters, to pick Charley.   I mean, that could have been very controversial if she wouldn't deliver.   And for her to do it and for Charley to step it up. 
I just think Lotta, she's a fantastic player, she was one of my role models growing up.   She was the first one of the Swedes to really come through.   And getting to know her even better now in person, she's a fantastic person and I'm so glad we could help her win this. 

Q.   Hedwall, what she was able to do this week, going 5‑0.   You know how tough it is to go five matches.   How impressive is that?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Oh, it's fantastic.   She's just so much fun.   She's unbelievable.
