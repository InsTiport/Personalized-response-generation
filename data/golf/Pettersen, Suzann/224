 Q.  What was the difference? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I don't know, we both were consistent.  We didn't do many mistakes.  It always comes down to holes the last putt. 

 Q.  What hole was it on and what happened on the last putt? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Well, it was probably about 15 feet.  I was playing pretty solid all day, not many mistakes.  But it all comes down to who makes the least mistakes, you know.
