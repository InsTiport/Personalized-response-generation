PATRICIA MEUNIER-LEBOUC:   It was a lot of fun.  I was just delighted to be out there.  I just tried to have fun.  I knew with Suzann I would.  She's always into it and she wants more and more.  So it pushes you to give your best.  With a partner like that. 


Q.  I don't know if you know what's happening in the other couple of matches, but this could turn out to be quite an important point.  Momentum is always important in these matches. 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's always good to get one point after another.  We are looking forward to Sunday, and we will just do our best until then and until the end.  It's not finished so we'll do our best out there and have fun.
