  MODERATOR:   When we were walking up here you were saying that you weren't hitting the driver the way that you wanted to today.   Do you at least feel pretty pleased that you could at least come out with a 3‑under par?   I know you had it to 4 at one point, but overall.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's been two weeks with barely touching a golf club so it was so nice to get a round in today.  
Overall putting great.   Greens are very, very fast.   The course is in good shape.   I'm surprised there are not that many low scores for the perfect conditions.   
This course is challenging no matter what, I mean, if you feel comfortable.   You never really have a flat lie, so that's the one challenge.  
MODERATOR:   I know 3‑putt down towards the end of stretch not exactly what you wanted to do, but can you take me to the final few holes and what happened there.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Well, I felt like I hit a good shot into 15; gave myself a good putt for birdie and missed it just.   Then hit a good tee ball, didn't really hit a good second shot, and left myself a very, very fast putt.   Putted off the green way too fast, way too hard.  
And then didn't really have too good of a chance on last couple.   So 3‑under.   I think as you said it's my second best opening round in Evian, so I guess that's decent.  
MODERATOR:   There's been some slight changes already to the golf course, and there will be more dramatic ones heading into next year.   Do you notice them already in terms of how the course is playing?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I think this course plays longer now than it has in the past.   I think last year the rough was really tough.   This year the rough is doable.   
The length on a couple holes, the length on the par‑3, 14, which I'm not a huge fan of.   Par‑3 where you know none of the players can hit a long iron into.  
But we don't set up the course, so it'll be interesting to see how it plays next year with all the changes.   I mean, it's a good combo now.   I mean, there are a lot of short par‑4s, and I think it's good to kind of have some longer par‑4s.   
Some of these holes don't necessarily set up for it.  
MODERATOR:   Questions.   
   
 Q.   What have you been doing the last two week, organizing a kids  tournament?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   No, I mean, I was just seeing a lot of friends, having a blast.   Filled up the social card and not really the golf card.   So the tank [on the golf course] felt a little empty.   Usually the other way around.  
But it's fine.   Sometimes you need a refuel of a different aspect of your life to get your energy back on the golf course.   
So at least any inspiration and motivation is pretty good.   
MODERATOR:   Hee Young talked about that earlier.   She said for the last two weeks she really didn't pick up a golf club and took some time off.   Sometimes, especially after the stretch where you have the Women's Open and the pressure‑packed majors, it's nice to kind of have a little break.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, I really needed it.   I was drained after the U.S. Open.   It was a lot of golf in a three‑week stretch.   For me, not to pick up a golf club, that means a few painful days coming back.  
But it's nice I got going today and it felt good.   Another session on the range and hopefully I will be able to keep up the better form tomorrow.
