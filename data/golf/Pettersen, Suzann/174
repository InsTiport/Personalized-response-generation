   SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's a nice start. The wind is just -- makes it a little tough because it swirls and drops. I mean, you can hit some great shots and you get a little gust and it just carries it a few yards short or long and just releases outside that birdie chance. 
 So I think it was a pretty steady opening tee-to-green. Yeah. 

 Q. What do you think of the changes?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I like the greens better this way. 

 Q. Why? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: A bit more fair, I think. I mean, in the past you could hit some -- it was hard to get to certain pins. These greens are still a bit firm. They're rolling great. (Indiscernible) firmness of the greens, so... 

 Q. This is the first event where Lorena is no longer No. 1. Does it feel different? Does it feel like there is a chance, a door is open there?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It feels like we're in between two eras. It feels like -- I don't know. We've been so used to having first Annika being so dominating, then Lorena. 
 Now it's just a bunch of us trying to fight and get the most out of each week. It's fun, but it just feels like we're kind of right if between two kind of eras of players here. 

 Q. Did you go last night?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I didn't. It was too late for me. I'm in bed by 8:30. It's just very tragic and very sad. 

 Q. Thank you. Good playing.
