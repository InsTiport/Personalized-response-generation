Q.  You guys are unbelievable.  What did you guys say to yourself to keep in this game and turn the match around?

SUZANN PETERSEN:  We just told each other to hang in there and be patient.  We knew we had a few difficult holes coming up, the last couple holes.  We did what we had to do.  We did what we could do, and it was just enough, so I'm happy.
Q.  Describe how you're able to hole those dramatic putts at 15, 16 and especially at 17.
SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I don't know, you just get those moments and you want to grab them.

You hole the first one and you want to do it on the 16th, and Annika had a super shot on the 17th.  It just happens.
Q.  Exciting stuff.  Congratulations on your victory.
