   SUZANN PETTERSEN: I was hanging in there, you know. Taking a few chances. I got a few good breaks there. 
 You know what, it's all about putting a good score together. It's not always a beauty contest, but those days are also nice.

 Q. Have any thoughts about why you didn't have it today?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's just how it is right now. So that's the way it goes. See what I can find out and try and bring some good game tomorrow.

 Q. How much has the course softened up today?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Just a little bit with the wind. The ball has no bounce up through the bump anymore. It's playing a bit different. 

 Q. They say that wearing black is the worst color when the mosquitoes are out. Were they bothering you today?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I was so douched down with all the spray. It's pretty bad. It's very bad.

 Q. Is it harder to play a course when it softens up after it's been running hard and fast all week?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: No. It's not a very long course in general. But it changes how you approach the greens and how you put spin on the ball.

 Q. What do you think it'll take tomorrow, Suzann, to win this thing?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Oh, I have no idea. I'm surprised nobody has made a move today, to be honest. I mean the conditions are great. I mean it's been raining, but it hasn't been bother us. I should be lucky no one has made a move.

 Q. You're still very much in it, then, aren't you?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Oh, absolutely. You can go low on this course. 

 Q. Thank you. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Thanks.
