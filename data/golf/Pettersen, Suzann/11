 Q.  A little bit better on the back nine today.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Today I felt pretty good.  Some tougher pins on certain holes.  I had to be a little bit more patient and just accept sometimes two-putt is a good score on some holes.   
Course played a little bit different.  Hardly any wind at all, and then the finishing stretch, 18 a little bit longer today into the wind.   
So nice little variety.   
 Q.  You talked a little bit yesterday about the mental side of things.  How do you feel you were able to cope with it today?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: You know what?  Every day is a new day.  That's why we work and that's one of the skills you need to manage.  You need to wipe out whatever you did and start all over.   
We got one more day and I'm in a good position.   
 Q.  Like you say, you're in a good position.  There are a ton of people up there real close on the leaderboard.  What do you think of being in contention and what sets up for tomorrow?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Oh, it's a great way to finish off the season.  It's a really packed leaderboard.  Hopefully Park won't kind of run away on the last few holes.   
It looks like we're within shooting range.  Should be fun tomorrow.  Go out and make some putts and move on.
