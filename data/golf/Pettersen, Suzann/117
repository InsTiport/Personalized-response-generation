Q.   Nice way to spend your birthday with all those fans cheering for you, nice birdie at the last to finish up.   Talk about your day. 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It was a good day.   It's hard to go out of the box and really not push too much and almost make mistakes and try and be patient but still aggressive.   I felt like I got off to a good start, gave myself some nice looks, made a birdie on 5, made a few good par putts today actually and one bogey‑‑ two bogeys on two of the par‑3s, one poor shot on 14.   But overall my game is very solid.   It was fantastic to walk along the course on each hole and people wishing me a happy birthday and singing songs.   I can't really thank them enough.   I wish I could have given them something more to cheer for.

Q.   Talk about if you were watching the leaderboard, Inbee kept adding birdies on.   Was it tough to watch the margin staying about the same?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I haven't really paid too much attention to what's been going on.   I think I heard somebody say she started birdie‑birdie.   The way she's been playing, I know her, she doesn't make too many mistakes and she would have to have an awful day in the office and you would have to play out of your shoes on a Sunday in a major.   But you never know, and you've got to try and mutt some pressure on.   She's been playing good all year.   She's a good winner.
This is probably going to be my one and only opportunity to try and win a major championship on my birthday.   I don't know if that's going to ever happen again the way it's kind of mapped out.   Overall I'm pretty happy with the performance.   Like I said, you don't really win major championships with three good rounds and one lousy round.   But I felt like I kept my composure, my attitude pretty good all week.
