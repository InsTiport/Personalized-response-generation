Q. This was a strong round on a difficult course.
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know.  It's really just anything under par on this course, opening day, I'm pretty happy.
I tried to shoot my dad's birthday.  He was turning 67.  I thought 67 would be a good number to try to shoot for.  I played good, had a good couple of -- on the backside, our front side.  And then tough holes.  8 is quite a tough tee shot and a tough second shot.  Bogey, bogey finish, but overall playing pretty good.
Q. What do you think the challenges are?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Here?  Mental.  It's a mental test, for sure.  You are going to hit some good shots, but you have to shape it off the tees, which for me is pretty good.  But also you can choose how you want to play.  If you really want to out power it or if you want to try to play for fairways and greens and par is your friend.  And I think this week par is your friend.  So I might have to work on the strategy.
