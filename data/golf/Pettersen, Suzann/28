 Q.  Tied in second place, 5-under for the day.  Just talk us through your round?  
SUZANNE PETTERSEN: No, I've been playing really good all week.  I've had some stupid mistakes, probably like everyone else and giving away a lot of shots.  Felt like yesterday I gave away a great chance of winning this.   
 Q.  With the water shot?  
SUZANNE PETTERSEN: Yeah, I started strong yesterday and today, and seems like I'm going to fall a bit short.  But it's a good week.   
 Q.  Enjoyed yourself here in Malaysia?  
SUZANNE PETTERSEN: I always enjoy Asia.  I just wish I could win a few more here in Asia.  It's been really good to me.  I like coming here.  The crowds are good and the courses are good.   
 Q.  Do you think you played well enough to win it or you weren't quite there as much as you'd like to be?  
SUZANNE PETTERSEN: If I should say anything for me, hit it in the water on the par 5 -- I mean, if you hit a good drive there, you only have, well, maybe a 4-iron left.  That's maybe two shots in the wrong direction.  But I don't know, I still birdied 18.  I don't know, 15 I thought was a good number but it looks like Shanshan is on fire out there.
