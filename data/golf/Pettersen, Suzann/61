Q.   Gotta feel pretty good about where you are heading into tomorrow?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.   My game is getting better and better. 
Today I had a lot of chances on the Back 9.   Just couldn't quite drop the putts.   Birdied 16, 17 and got a good par out of 18 after being in trouble.   But it was a good solid round.   Yeah. 

Q.   What was going on in the trees?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Had a line of sight on the scoreboard.

Q.   5‑under yesterday on the Back 9, 5‑under today.   Gotta feel pretty good about where your game's at?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, and I still feel like the low one is still out there.   So gotta go out tomorrow and just try and birdie as many holes as you can. 
Doesn't look like the top players have kind of gotten anywhere, so I did my job and kind of managed to close the gap a little bit, and tomorrow just gotta step on the pedal.

Q.   You were saying maybe you were a little bit tired from playing four weeks.   Have you found a way to get over that?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, no.   I'm starting to have a little bit low days around Wednesday and Thursday.   Now I'm starting to feel a little bit better.   Yeah.   The adrenaline helps.

Q.   Will you have a number in mind tomorrow that you want to reach?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.   Probably.   I'm not going to tell you.

Q.   20‑under maybe?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Possible.
