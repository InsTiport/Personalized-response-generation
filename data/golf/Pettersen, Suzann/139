Q.   Are you pleased with the number or could you have gotten more out of that?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's hard to be picky.   Yes, I felt like I could have had maybe two or three better today.   It's a good score to start off, and the game feels pretty good.   It's getting better and better.

Q.   Up and down on the front nine today, four birdies, but two bogeys as well?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.   Started off a little tense.   U. S. Open, you just want to play well, and kind of took me nine holes to kind of get comfortable out there and kind of start executing golf shots, even though I hit some good golf shots on the front, or our front.
Very pleased with the opening.   Felt like I had a lot of good chances at the end, but it's a long day.   I can't wait to get some food and put my legs up.

Q.   (Inaudible)?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Even though I feel like I let a few slip, I'm in very good position.   Anything under par in a U. S. Open is very, very good.   Conditions were good today.   Even though the heat is tough, playing wise, I mean the little breeze there was was just nice to kind of cool things off.
