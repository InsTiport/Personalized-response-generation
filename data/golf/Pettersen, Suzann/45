 Q. All in all, disappointing but you played very well.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I had a fantastic week. I don't think I could ask for feeling any better. Obviously I could have had a few more putts drop. But I played great.   
Feel like the last two days, I haven't quite capitalized on how good I've been playing, especially on the greens. But overall, a very good week and hats off to Inbee shooting 7â€‘under today.   
   
 Q. So Inbee has won six of the last 14 majors. What are your thoughts on what makes her so good at these and her dominance out here?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: She's that good. She's a great putter and she's hardly in trouble, so, yeah.   
   
 Q. What do you take away from this week about yourself?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's been a fantastic week from my game. I couldn't have asked to feel any better. It's nice to feel confident under conditions like this. I wish I could have had a few more putts drop.
