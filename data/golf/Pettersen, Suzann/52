 Q.   I guess you like your position at the end of today a little bit better than yesterday, right?  
SUZANN PETERSEN:   Well, as far as I know this is a four‑day tournament.   It's always nice to get a good start.  
Played okay yesterday.   Just didn't get nothing out of my round.  
Scored well today.   Course is in great shape.   The greens are really, really good.  
Yesterday afternoon they were firm and windy, and solid (indiscernible), but just tough to hold the greens with the pin positions.   
It's plenty accessible, but you've got to play smart because the greens are getting firm and fast.   
   
 Q.   Is there something about this course that kind of brings out‑‑ since you won here before‑‑ your best game?  
SUZANN PETERSEN:   For sure.   I wish we played more courses like this.   This is a good golf course that sets up for different types of shots, different approaches.   
And the rough is up a little bit.   If you miss the fairways it's going to be hard to get close on the greens.   Fairways is going to be key.  
Overall very happy.   Get a little bit of rest, food, and a little bit of sharpening on my long game, and I think I'm in good shape.  
   
 Q.   What did you do right today?  
SUZANN PETERSEN:   I haven't lost it mentally so far.   If I'm like balancing on the line of just kind of going my way or the other way, it feels like I've kind of lost it mentally in the past.  
Just trying to stay on top of it and keep my eyes up and keep my head up.   Had a great group.   Played with Brittany and Sandra, good friends of mine, and that always helps keep a smile on your face.
