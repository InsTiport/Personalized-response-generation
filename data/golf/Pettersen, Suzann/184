   DANA GROSS-RHODE: 7? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 7, it was a 20-footer for par.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What did you hit in? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I was just short of the green so I three-putted.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. What did you hit in on 5? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I was in the bunker short, it was like an up-and-down from 20 yards probably. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. And then 8? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 8, two-putt, missed a three-footer for par.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What did you hit on? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 4-iron. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: 4-iron? No. 10? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Gap wedge to about 10 feet.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: And 11? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 8-iron to about 10 feet.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: 12? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Hit a 4-iron to the middle of the green, two-putted and tapped in for birdie.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What did you two-putt from? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: The middle of the greens, probably 20 feet. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Bogey on 13? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Hit it over the green, chipped it short and missed a 5, 6-footer for par. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. 15? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Chipped it up to about 12 feet and missed the par putt. No. That was a birdie. Birdie, a little gap wedge to two feet. And then next I hit it short and chipped it and missed that 10-footer for par.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Okay. And is that it? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: That's it.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: All right. I think we are ready to go. Suzann, can you talk about your round today? You were first out. Did it help having Anna score ahead of you or did you just play your own game? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I tried to play my own game. I got off to a great start. I had three birdies on my first three holes. 
 Just playing really good golf. I gave myself a lot of putts, rolling the putts nicely on these greens. 
 A few kind of annoying bogeys out there, especially had two on the last three coming in. But like I said, there's a lot more golf to be played. I'm glad this is not a two-day.
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Questions for Suzann.

 Q. Obviously you're sitting in good position so far, but do you think because of the bogeys today was a bit of a missed opportunity kind of round for you?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm just glad it's not two days for this tournament. There's a lot of more birdies out there, so -- I mean one was just -- 7 was just tricky and then I missed a short putt for par on the par-3. So it appears on these greens. 

 Q. How do you feel in terms of your energy level given that you've come off two sort of busy weeks, I guess, prior to this one?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean I think you mentally just prepare. You know what's coming. Usually we don't play the week after the Solheim. I don't know if that makes you kind of take out that little extra, because they usually feel dead on the Monday after the Solheim. 
 But I wasn't as bad this year at Solheim because I know there's another two quite important weeks to come after that, so you kind of probably -- you try to balance it out to save some energy in the tank.

 Q. Birdies and bogeys, birdies and bogeys today kind of thing. After your start you must have felt like maybe there was another course record in you. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean there's definitely another course record out on this course, so I'm glad there's another two rounds. 
 I don't think there's any par-4s, except 16 we're playing into the wind. There I had another 50 yards to the pin, but otherwise just standing wedge with a wedge pretty much, wedge 9-irons for most of the par 4s, and the short par 3s, I mean we had an 89-yard par. I don't think I've ever played that short on the LPGA Tour. 
 And we had some reachable par-5s, so if you put yourself in good position off the tee, you're definitely in a good solid position to make birdies out there.

 Q. What kind of toll does it take on you with the altitude and then the wind yesterday and then turning around and playing right away this morning or do you just get through it?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: The altitude doesn't affect me much. I haven't felt it much. 
 I don't know. I haven't played late-early in a while. It's been mostly early-late. But I mean when you're on a roll, you kind of keep going, and I had it going for a while, but I'm still very happy. I'm 9-under par for two rounds, and I'm in great position.

 Q. Judging by all the birdies out there, by the people that are topping the leaderboard like yourself, it looks like a low score will ultimately win this event. Do you mind playing tournaments where you gotta make a lot of birdies and shoot low numbers to win it?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean even though, I mean, like I'm saying, you have shorter irons into the par-4s and reachable par-5s, you still have to roll the putts in. It's not given that you're going to make 7 birdies. You still gotta hit solid putts. These greens you just gotta trust your line and try to hit solid putts. I had a few that dropped my way today, a few on the edges, but I mean you take your fair share and you walk off. 
 But I think these scores like last week, you will predict that somebody will go low, so you gotta jump up your game and kind of keep playing aggressive, I guess. 

 Q. Just finally, how important is it for you to get a win this year? I mean obviously you've had a number of high results. I believe you've been runner up three times. You've been in the mix many times. How important is it to get a win this season?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I play every week to win. I mean, in this game you lose more than you win. So all I can do is give myself a chance on Sunday. 
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you very much. Good luck this weekend.
