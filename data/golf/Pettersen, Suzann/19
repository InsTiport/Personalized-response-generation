 Q.  Suzann, obviously you this golf course really well.  What exactly is it about this golf course that inspires you to play so well?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know.  Every since I got here I feel like it's kind of -- a lot of the holes suit my eye.  I lost my yardage book before getting her.  I had to get all my new notes, which is kind of a big deal because I have a lot of good notes from the past.  Had to start from scratch.   
But there are some lines, especially the way the wind is coming now, I think it plays quite deep and in my favor.   
We woke up this morning to perfect conditions.  You can fire at pins and get to par-5s, which is fun.  I think it's the best way to set up a golf course and kind of get low scores.   
Very happy with the opening round I played.   
 Q.  You say you lost your yardage book.  You've also got a new caddie on the bag this week, Dylan.  How was he able to help you out out there today?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Well, he's got to think that this is the easiest bag on the planet, which itâs not (laughter.)  I'm usually a lot harder on my caddies and my team than today.  You know, when you play well, numbers are good, you're not too much in between.   
Dylan is a great guy.  Iâve known him for years.  I happened to lose my old caddie to one of the Korean players, so Dylan is a great replacement.  Just really trying to play more to the fat part of the greens and score from there.
