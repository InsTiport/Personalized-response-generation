 Q. What are your thoughts on this second match today? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know, I mean, we kind of struggled so much. We kind of fought back and gave ourselves a chance for half a point. It would have been nice to grab a half a point. 

 Q. And what are you thinking about heading into Sunday? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I think we have a very, very good chance. We played outstanding all day and had a great morning and pretty good afternoon, so it's going to be very tight tomorrow.
