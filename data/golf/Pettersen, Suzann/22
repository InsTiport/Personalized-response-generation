Q. You obviously played a few holes yesterday; how did you prepare yourself having to come back and finish off your first round today?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's absolutely fine.  I was better prepared to go up tomorrow morning, so at least we're going to finish today.  Perfect day of golf.
Q. So you're finishing with a birdie there to get to 4-under.  How are you feeling going into the second round?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Played really good.  I had a lot of chances.  Gave myself a lot of looks.  That's all you want on this course.  Par is never going to hurt you around this place, but you've got to try and capitalize on some of the holes when they set it up the way they do.
Q. What do you think you're doing particularly well, iron play or you're hitting it close?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm just thinking really smart.
