Q.   Great round, you started off with a bogey on the second and then you got it really going?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, there are a lot of birdies out there, if you hit a good tee shot, you will leave yourself a lot of good looks.   The greens are so pure.   So if you get it going, you can really‑‑ I feel like you can really go low here. 
Jet to putt one round together where you feel like everything clicks, but it's getting there slowly but surely.

Q.   Do you feel you're reading the greens really well and it's all coming together or you've been hitting it great almost all week?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's all getting better day‑by‑day and really just trying to be patient.   Just go out there tomorrow and enjoy. 

Q.   And for tomorrow, what do you think, you're obviously going to have to shoot a low score with Inbee on 12?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, would you have to.   You're playing against the best person in the world and you have to anticipate them to go out and shoot a low number as well.

Q.   What sort of score do you think is out there at the moment? 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I think you can probably shoot 7‑ , 8‑under if you get the par 5s going. 

Q.   And the wind to you hasn't been a factor?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's been the same every day.   It switches about now.   So people who is an hour ahead of me probably had downwind on 18 and people now have into the wind.   So it's pretty consistent.   It's been consistent for three days.
