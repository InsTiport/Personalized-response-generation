Q.  Suzann Pettersen, how are the nerves after that?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Well, it was another important point, and we were satisfied.


Q.  Three points out of 3 for you so far. 

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.  I've been lucky with my teammates.  It's working out great.


Q.  How important did you feel it was after what happened yesterday afternoon for Europe to go out and get some early points on the board this afternoon?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Absolutely.  There's a lot of blue numbers up there, so that's good.  We need those points.


Q.  What was the atmosphere like in the team last night after that pretty disappointing afternoon, to be honest?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.  But still it was a great morning.  If you win every day, we're going to have it on Sunday afternoon.  We have to stick in there and grab every point.


Q.  Suzann, it was a slightly shaky start, to be honest, this morning.  Then you got yourself back into the game.  It was a roller coaster ride.  You got a comfortable lead and they hit back at 13 and 14.  What were you thinking then?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   You need to make birdies.  Birdies is the only chance to win a hole, to be sure at least not to lose the hole.  We just figured out let's make a few birdies and we did it.


Q.  What did Catrin tell you when she paired you and Sophie together?  What did she think would blend together between you?

SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Probably distance-wise.  Sophie is hitting it miles.  I have a wedge left on all the holes.  I'm usually hitting 7, 8 on.  So it makes it easy.


Q.  I'm sure you'll need to go and have a bit of a rest or back to the range.  I'm sure you'll be in action this afternoon.  Well done to both of you.
