 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I'm extremely happy to hole that last putt.  Both myself and Annika would have hated to lose that match.  I think it was very important to get one more point on the board and take a three-shot lead going into Sunday. 
Q.  Did you do anything different coming down the last hole?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Yes.  I spoke to my caddy Simon, and he said that we should change the ball for a new ball.  And then he gave me the new ball and he wrote on it "birdie ball".  So I took it and when I approached the green I could see the writing "birdie ball" on it.  And when I lined it up, I just looked at that, thought of that and made the putt.
