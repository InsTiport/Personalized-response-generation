 Q.   How does it feel?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It feels great.   I felt like it was a good bounce back from last week where I kind of screwed it up on the last day.   
I was just looking at it happy to have a chance this week to play.   It held in.   I wasn't feeling too comfortable coming down the stretch, but I was putting really good.  
   
 Q.   Coming off the double bogey.   You turned it around and it all kind of went from there?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I decided before I went out just not have too many reactions, good or bad.   I knew there was birdies out there if you really get it going.   I just tried to put it behind me.   It was a disaster of a hole, 150 yards.  
   
 Q.   Going into Evian two weeks, you have a week off, you have your event, where does this set you up for the rest of the season?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's been pretty good.   I'm very happy.   It feels like I have been knocking on the door for the last three events weeks or three we've had.   
This is a good one and I love Portland.
