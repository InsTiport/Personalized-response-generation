   MODERATOR: Suzann, 7-under, 65, bogey-free. Actually been bogey free for 35 holes now. Just tell us a little bit about the round today.  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Just really trying to get something going early. Saturday obviously a good day to make a move.   
 I think there's quite a few who posted some good numbers out there, so just glad to be where I'm at. I'm in it for tomorrow.  
 MODERATOR: You've two seconds and a third so far this year. You're obviously playing well. Do you feel like you're really ready to break through and get that first victory of the year?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I've been feeling good all year and playing really good. I played a couple times and I felt like what I had was probably good enough, but that's this game. That's the beauty of this game.  
 So another round tomorrow. We'll see what that brings me.   
 MODERATOR: Questions, guys.   
  
  Q. Have you picked a number that you think you might have to shoot tomorrow to stay in contention and perhaps win the tournament?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Well, the number I picked before we started, I think that's running out of time pretty soon. I thought about 15, 16 would be a good number.  
 But I think you got to go low tomorrow, because there's reachable par-5s out here, some short par-4s, and people were knocking at that today.   
 So a little bit easier pins though, so that has to be kind of in the consideration for today's round. But I think you need another really low one tomorrow.   
  
  Q. First off, on No. 6 what did you hit for eagle?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Oh, I just hit a 3-wood. Driver, 3-wood to about four feet.   
  
  Q. And I understand you have a hip injury.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I just have a torn muscle.  
  
  Q. And you saw a doctor this week in Birmingham?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah. Well I've had this since Asia, our Asian swing. It went away and then it came back. It healed and I tore it back up, so I'm not resting enough.  
  
  Q. How much was it bothering you today?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean, I can't say it's not bothering me. I can't get to my left side. Somehow it feels like before I got here it feels like I can play and feels like I can practice.   
 But ideal, it's not ideal. I can make it work.   
 MODERATOR: We're good? All right. Thanks Suzann.
