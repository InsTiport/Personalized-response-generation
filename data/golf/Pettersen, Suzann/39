 Q.  You were playing really well.  Probably wanted to finish the round.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I was a bit surprised.  We were kind of trying to count how many dry holes we got in.  We didn't really see the suspension being (indiscernible) of play, but I guess it was just in time.   
 Q.  You kind of feel like the way you're playing you can play all day?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, it's just nice to play.  Nice to play some golf and do some of the stuff that you practiced over the winter.   
 Q.  Where are you exactly?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I have one more hole.   
 Q.  Are you on the tee?  So you're on the tee?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I just finished 8, so, yeah.   
 Q.  Got it.  Got it.  We're not even halfway through.  How important is it to get off to a good start?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's always nice to play good golf, at least have some scorable rounds in your body early on.  I've played a lot of golf at home during practice, but this year probably more so just go play golf and don't worry too much about the rest.   
 Q.  You and Butch working on anything new in particular in the off-season?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, pretty much all the same.  I mean, that's Butch.  Old school.  Which for me is very hard, because I want to make it more complicated and he keeps telling me, Just go play some golf.  I'm like, I don't do it that way.  I got to think about some stuff.   
For me, in that manner it's quite challenging for me.  I've been working a lot on my putting and been putting good these two days, so that's nice to see.   
Like I said, just nice to go out there and hit shots under the gun.   
 Q.  Lexi is putting with her eyes closed now, something you have done in the past.  Have you done that?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I do.  I still do it.   
 Q.  You still do it now?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah.  See, they're all taking after me.   
 Q.  I know, I know.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I guess that's why I am a little bit old or been around too long.   
 Q.  Do you go back and forth mid-round with it?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No.  For the most part everything inside of 15 feet is mostly closed eyes.  If it's a bit of a distance, somehow I just want to make sure I have contact and don't chunk it.   
 Q.  Right.  Do you think the course plays more difficult after it's got wet like this?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No.  I think it'll be easier.  Not that the greens have been hard and firm.  You'll probably be able to fire right at the pins.  Probably slow the greens down a little bit.   
This court doesn't need too much more rain.  The fairways were muddy to start.  Interesting to see how it holds up.   
 Q.  Five birdies in six holes.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, should have been six and six.  One ball was lying right on the edge.   
No, made some good makable putts, hit some good shots.  Yeah.   
 Q.  What do you do during delays?  Did you eat already?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm going to go home.  We have a house, so I'm going to go home.   
 Q.  You lucky thing.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, it's actually right next to the tee I'm going to tee off.  Don't have to come back to hit a couple of drives to warm up.  I can roll out of bed.   
 Q.  Who updates you?  You wait for an email?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know.  See how good the LPGA communication is.  (Laughter.)  If I'm not there, there's a lack of communication.   
 Q.  We'll come knock on the door.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'll probably still make it.
