 Q.  You had quite the round, sitting at the top of the leaderboard.  Birdied three of the four par 5s.  How do you feel?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I feel great.  I played fantastic golf all day.  You've got to be in the mood to fight if you're a little bit out of position, so I did.  I just felt like I deserved the last putt on the last there.  I've been playing really good.  3-under on the par 5s, yeah.   
 Q.  How much of a battle or how much of a grind was today?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: You've got to hit good shots all the time.  First you've got to hit the fairways and then you've got to kind of consider if you have a game where you can kind of attack where if 20 feet is good, and that's always a key is giving yourself the looks.  You'll drop some eventually.  Playing really good.   
 Q.  You've been in this position before going into the weekend.  How do you keep the play carrying over?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's going to be awhile before we tee off again, because I have to come out in the morning and finish the second round.  A nice little break now.  It's been two good days.  Still a lot of job to do and still a few fine-tunings to do, but I feel good.  I have a lot of energy and ready for a good weekend.
