 Q. Suzann, not the way you wanted this match to end. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, but I mean they made some great birdies. Sophie and myself, we haven't really been in any trouble. We just haven't made any putts, and that makes a difference.

 Q. You hit some good shots out there. Can you take something away from this match to get you psyched up for tomorrow?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm playing great. I feel very happy about how I'm striking the ball. 
 Like I said, we haven't had much trouble. They've had a few knock-in birdies. Kind of makes it hard to match. 
 There's a couple of matches out there that are quite crucial, and there's another 36 to go tomorrow, so there's a lot of golf to be played.
