Q. Big putt there on 18 for you.
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, it was nice to finish bogey-free.  Played a lot better today.  It felt like I had a little ground to catch up with the leaders kind of going deep yesterday, so hopefully I won't be too far back and go out early tomorrow and try and post another low score and see where that takes me.
Q. Did you have a number in mind this morning that you wanted to get to to get back in contention?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean, anything 5-under or better should be a pretty respectable score out here.  Any less than that, you kind of feel like you lose ground.  6-under was a lot of good work.  I had a lot of good looks.  Yeah, I mean, hopefully, like I said, they won't run away with it, but there's a lot of birdies out there.
Q. What's your game plan tomorrow heading into the final round?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm obviously going to tee off a little bit earlier than the leaders, obviously try and post a number.  That's all I can do at this point.  But this is a great golf course, and kind of the way they -- I love the way they set it up.  They invite us to make eagles, go for greens.  Hopefully they'll do that tomorrow, as well, and everyone will keep seeing low numbers.
Q. This has turned into a second-shot week kind of, hasn't it?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I think so.  Even though it's a lot of birdie chances, you've still got to make all the putts.  It would be nice to hit them to gimmes all the time.  I like the course.  It's very scorable, which is kind of fun, and very scorable par-5s.  You can make up your ground there if you kind of hit some good shots, and if you make a birdie or two or three on some of the par-3s and the par-4s, you should be in good play.  But like I said, you've got to go out tomorrow and try and shoot as low as you can.
