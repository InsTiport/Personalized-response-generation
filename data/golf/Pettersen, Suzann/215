   SUZANN PETTERSEN:  My 3-wood, my shaft actually was loose so I had to get it fixed.   
  
  Q.  When did this happen?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  It happened after I hit my shot on 9.  I could feel the shaft was loose.  I was afraid to kill somebody.   
  
  Q.  You'll be getting that fixed for tomorrow?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  It's already fixed.  I got it back when I was on 13.   
  
  Q.  Good timing, huh?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I didn't need it.  I was fine.
