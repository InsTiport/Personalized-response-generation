   MIKE SCANLAN: Suzann, thanks for coming in. 10 under par on the week. You're in second place. Can you just talk a little bit about your day today.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Today I just tried to kind of play my own came, stick to the game plan, and try to be aggressive where you can be aggressive on this golf course. 
 I haven't ready looked much on the leaderboard. Just tried to play my own game. Just got it going there and just kept it going. It was nice to finish with a birdie after that bogey on 8. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can we go over your scorecard?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Sure.
 THE MODERATOR: Started on 10, so birdie 12.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 12, I hit a 9-iron to about 20 feet. Made that putt. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey 14.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I hit in the fairway bunker and hit it short of the green and missed my par putt for probably about 20 feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. Birdie, 15. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Second shot from 66 yards to tap in. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: What club? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Sand wedge. 5-iron on the next Par 3 to about six feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie, 18. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: 8-iron from about 150 to about 20 feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie, 1.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: A 9-iron from 125 to six feet.
 MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie, 6.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: A little 6-iron from about 156 to probably 15 feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Birdie, 7. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Second shot I had about 70 to the pin and I had a little sand wedge to about 12, 15 feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Would you say 15? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I would say 15. It wasn't that long. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Bogey 8.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Bogey 8. Hit it short of the green and just didn't get up and down.
 MIKE SCANLAN: How far of your chip? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: My chip wasn't that far. I hit it -- my putt was about 20 feet. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Okay. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: And then a birdie on 18, 3-wood from about 225. About 25 feet short and easy tap in. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Questions. 

 Q. You talked about how you want to be aggressive as much as you can on this course. Talk about how you balance wanting to be aggressive but also having to play smart on such a challenging course. 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, at the same time you try to be aggressive you have to be like patiently aggressive. Because you just want to try to be aggressive, and you also want to make sure you leave yourself the best next shot. I mean, whatever outcome it may be.
 Like the Par 5s - depending on the wind -- but the Par 5s you can be fairly aggressive on. But at the same time, you got to leave yourself the best angles to get up and down if you miss the green. 
 The greens were quite firm today. I thought they would be a little firmer. But, I mean, if you hit good putts on a good line here a few putts will drop. So that's been good this week far so. 

 Q. When you head into the weekend in second place, does to give you more leeway to be for aggressive?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean, I'm just trying to play my game. Greg, my new caddie, he makes me feel very comfortable. I'm just trying to hit my shots out there and do my best.

 Q. How close you were you to making eagle there on 9, the final hole? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Of course I tried to make it, but also just take the easy birdie and get out of there. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: No. Of course I hit it to make it, but was just too low.

 Q. How much did you miss by? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know. Three inches. I don't know. 

 Q. You said you weren't looking at the leaderboard all day. Does it feel like the pace is really low scoring? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I remember I looked at the board I think after I played four or five holes and I saw 13 leading. I was like, What course is she playing? I thought it was good because it made my realize that there are birdies out there. 
 I was a little surprised when I say that number, because I thought maybe eight, nine would lead after the day. It just shows that it's possible. If one can do it, everyone else can do it.

 Q. Is there a favorite right now do you think? Do you look at the leaderboard and say maybe that player is the favorite, maybe you're the favorite? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm the favorite. 

 Q. You're the favorite? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm your favorite.
