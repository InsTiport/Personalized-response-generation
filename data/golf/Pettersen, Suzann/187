  Q. Talk about your match.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: This was a great match, again. All my matches seem to go to 18.   
 I don't know. It was just -- I think we played very steady and gave ourselves little chances. It was very close. I mean it was 1-up, level, 1-up to them. We got it back, and we never really gave them a leash too far ahead of us, so I mean we kind of got it going.   
 And then Anna makes her putt on 16, which was huge, and then I make a great birdie on 17. I think they both had 3-woods into that green, and again, Anna pulled it off again on 18.  
  
  Q. After the U.S. made a move on the 17th, how did you guys maintain your composure to come back on the 18th to finish strong?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean Anna hit a great putt on 17. It just hooked the edge and went out. All you can do is try to give yourself two good chances in four-ball and see what that can give you, because that definitely puts the pressure on the opponents.  
  
  Q. And how will this match set you up for later on today or tomorrow?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I think we're both going out later on in the foursomes. I think I'm playing with Alfie. I think Anna is playing with -- I'm not quite sure. But well, we're going to take this with us and bring it out to the afternoon.   
  
  Q. Thank you.
