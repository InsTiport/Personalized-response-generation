  Q. A 69 today, probably wasn't enough here. All week you've been saying you've just been getting it around the course, but not quite there. Just talk about your week.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Well, I got off to the start I needed. Kind of caught up the three shots quite quick, made those putts that I've been missing, and then gave myself a lot of great chances on 10,11, 12, 13. 14 I made a bogey, and then I missed a short one on 16. But I was still trying to make a birdie on 17. I was just happy to make a 2-putt on 18.   
 If I putt well, I win tournaments. I didn't putt my best this week, and I'm still top three, so hopefully I've knocked it up one level from last year.  
  
  Q. Just talk about the last two weeks, both top threes, you're probably going to be at the top of the Money List or close to it behind Ai. Is this the kind of start you'd hoped for, or is it close enough to the start you'd hoped for?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's close, it's very close. I'm playing good and I can be aggressive. Obviously last week felt a little bit disappointing but still playing well. And then following it up this week, having a chance again on Sunday; just didn't quite finish it off again. So two good finishes.
