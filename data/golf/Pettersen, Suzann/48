 Q. Your 14th go at this championship and the memories of last year I'm sure fueling your fire after that runner‑up at Birkdale. How much more comfortable do you feel on links these days?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Well, you never really feel too comfortable. It's hard to say you feel comfortable because the wind is obviously the challenging factor here. I think on this course, if you can kind of get it through the 11th and then the wind the wind is a little easier I think. And the finishing holes are a little bit easy the way the wind kind of came in today.   
Managed to finish strong. Hung in there on the front. Had a good start. Still, a couple of the par 5s, I didn't birdie, which kind of feels like you have to do under conditions like today. I stayed patient. My game is in good shape, so excited to go out again tomorrow.  
   
 Q. I'm sure you are, only three off the lead as we speak. In terms of your preparation, I was speaking to Lydia Ko and she was saying how much she felt the benefit of going to did you know Donald links just up the coast last week and challenging for the Scottish title. Do you feel the same?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I had never done it before. I had never played back‑to‑back courses in Scotland. It's nice to kind of break it up, try something new. It was very close to a very successful trip. I played really good.   
I think it takes a little time to adjust to links golf, the shot‑making and the distance the ball is flying. So yeah, so far it has not hurt me. I feel very good and it's nice to spend some time in Scotland.
