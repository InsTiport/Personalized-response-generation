 Q.   How were the conditions out there.   Seemed to get a little tougher as the day went on.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It did actually.   When we made the turn the wind picked up a little bit.   Just enough to get your attention.  
Most of the holes on the back side you actually play into the wind like the way the direction was of it today.  
So a little bit more challenging.   Kind of got cold and kind of dark for a while, so you can easily lose your attention and focus.  
Nice to birdie 17 and be right there.  
   
 Q.   Had a chance on 18, too.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah.   Kind of picture if that goes in it would be a nice little bonus.   
Had to give to a shot.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel good about where you sit heading into the weekend with what the scores have been out there?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I feel pretty good with my game.   Game is getting more and more solid.   I hit good shots, the shots that I'm kind of seeing.  
So you know what?   Sometimes it's hard to pull a super low one around this place, especially when the condition picks up like it did today.   Overall pretty happy with the two rounds, and in a good spot for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   Have you looked at the leaderboard?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Not really.   I think I saw that one of those Koreans was at 9 early on in my round, so I finished that's kind of where the score would be more or less.  
I think Brittany posted 10.   So, yeah, more than enough.   Keep everything straight in the fairways here and make some birdies yourself.
