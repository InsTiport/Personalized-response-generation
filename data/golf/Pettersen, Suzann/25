Q. Do you feel a little frustrated?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Well, didn't quite make any putts and I had a couple of 3-putts today.  So didn't quite read the greens that good today and that kind of cost me three shots.
Q. Was it hard to restart?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, you're quite used to it.  It happens quite a lot but play gets suspended by weather and so forth.  A little different situation yesterday which was unfortunate.
Just tried to come back out and finish where you left it.
