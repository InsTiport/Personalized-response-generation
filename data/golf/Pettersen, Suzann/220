 Q.  You guys did it yesterday, halved the match.  How does it feel to come back today and do the same? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Was a bit disappointing losing 15.  Had a good chance on 16 and 17 and 18 was a tough hole.  And Sophie did a great job.  She pulled it off. 

 Q.  How long was this putt here today? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Oh, about eight feet. 

 Q.  Why do you guys play together so well? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I think a similar mindset and similar game.  We don't worry we.  Hit it in the crap.  Each of us can take care of business.  Like she said yesterday.  Don't worry I've seen worse.  That helps. 

 Q.  The wind today, how tough was it? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  Seriously tough.  It was actually worse hitting straight into the wind than straight down.  You put some spin on the ball and no control.  It's all about control and trajectory and hitting fairways and greens. 

 Q.  Two-club wind?  Three-club wind? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  All depends.  Could be a four-club wind. 

 Q.  The crowds did, obviously you have a lot of people here to see you.  How much does that help you? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN:  It seems like the crowd finally woke up.  It's a lot more of them, and they're cheering us up, and it's just great to be here.
