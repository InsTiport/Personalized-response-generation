 Q.   Strong start, birdie, birdie start, set the tone.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, I 3‑putted three, and then just seemed to have like a birdie, bogey race out there for a little while.   Then just tried to kind of keep your head together and try and finish strong.   
So tried to get to five, six.   Just disappointing to bogey 17, and then the putt not dropping on 18.   But hoping I'm still within two or three.   
   
 Q.   No wind today?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It dropped.   There was a little bit to start.   
   
 Q.   Not nearly as bad as the other days?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   No, not as bad.   Enough to get your attention on the first nine I guess, and on the back nine it seemed to drop, which is a bit unusual.   Seems like we've had everything.   
   
 Q.   How much does winning twice here‑‑ you have to feel very comfortable here.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I would love to win this tournament three times overall.   It would be fun to have a chance going down tomorrow.   Obviously I feel like I have some great fans here in Korea, as well.   So even though I'm a non‑Korean, I feel like I have a lot of great support.   
   
 Q.   Give me a little bit on why the course suits you so well and your game.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I don't know if it actually suits my game, but you make it work.   Fake it till you make it.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about the finishing stretch of holes here.   Exciting?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   You can be aggressive on 16, or 18, obviously be an exciting finishing hole and you can get there in two.   
   
 Q.   Packed leaderboard.   Were you watching it at all today?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Not really.   I'm trying to just stick to the game plan.   I mean, I still feel like I have a low round on this course in me.   Hopefully we can knock it out tomorrow.
