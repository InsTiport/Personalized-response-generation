 Q.   How did it go this morning?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It was good, very solid, hitting a lot of greens.   Hit one bad iron shot on 11 that cost me a 3â€‘putt, but overall, very solid.   Felt like it was just a little bit harder to get that much closer to certain pins today.   
But overall, very happy and I'm in a good position.  
   
 Q.   Just outlook for the afternoon, obviously you're in the hunt?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I feel like I'm in a great position, I can go out, I can be aggressive, and it was just nice testing, playing 15, 16, 17, I really stepped up to the plate and hit good golf shots.   Sometimes the putts are going to drop and sometimes they are not.   It's nice to feel that a little bit, that's because what it's going to be.
