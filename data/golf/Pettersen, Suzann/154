   SUZANN PETTERSEN: It was tough. It was windy. The greens are so fast. You have a heart attack on every putt. You're just really trying to not mess up on the green. Some of the trickiest greens I've played on all year, especially with the bermuda. The speed obviously doesn't make it that much better.  
 But played pretty good. Hit my iron shots. Had a lot of good chances. It was good. Had one good par save and that was about it, so 4-under today was good.  
  
  Q. A lot of the low rounds have come in the morning. Seemed a little tougher this afternoon.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't think the wind was up this morning, and it's been steady now all since we tee'd off.  
 So hopefully we can get the better side of the draw earlier in the morning.
