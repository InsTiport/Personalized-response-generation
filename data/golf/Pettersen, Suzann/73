  SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It was a really good day.   Good conditions.   Hopefully in a good spot for tomorrow. 

Q.   We've got to ask, how did the back feel today?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I feel good, no complaints.   I had good treatment yesterday.   All good, no complaints. 

Q.   What is your pre‑round routine?   You said yesterday you don't get out there and bang balls on the range and all that.   What's your pre‑round routine these days?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I'm usually all stretched out and warmed up before I get out on the course, and then I putt a little bit, chip a little bit, hit a few balls and then putt again, and hopefully just bang on. 

Q.   The wind, was it a factor at all today?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's a little bit because it's a little bit hit or miss out here.   I mean, you're a little bit more exposed in certain places than others.   You've just got to pay attention.

Q.   Like you said, good position for the weekend.   Do you feel good about what you've been able to do the last few weeks coming back?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, I feel good.   Game is progressing and got a little bit of work to do on the greens, but know what I've got to work on. 

Q.   Still be patient, right?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, right.

Q.   How is the course playing?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's drying up a little bit, but you've got to hit your numbers and you've got to hit your spots.   It's tough to find the fairway on 18, but it's playing very similar to what it did last year.

Q.   14 I think is playing the toughest. 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, it's a little bit of a tough hole.   It's not the best tee shot in the world.
