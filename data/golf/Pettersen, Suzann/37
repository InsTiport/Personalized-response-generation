Q. Lovely round today, 4-under, you must be very happy with opening up your HSBC Women's Champions with that.
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, you know what, I played really well today.  A couple of bogeys, but this course is quite tough if you just miss a tee shot a little bit.  But overall very happy.  My game is starting to get in a nice spot, so very comfortable.
Q. Was it a little bit frustrating there towards the end, par, par, par, birdies not falling?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, you know, what but at the same time, you've got some tough holes there on the back nine.  It's not the easiest to get really close and par is not a bad score on some of those holes.  I executed the shot and hit good putts and good enough for par.
Q. Talk to us about the wind.  Seems to be picking up now in the afternoon?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, well, it's been quite windy all week.  A little bit more windy than what we've seen before.  A little bit different challenge this week.
Down by the water, it's definitely gusting and blowing harder.
Q. After the speed of the greens in Thailand last week, this is a bit of a change for you?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, you've got to be able to adjust.  That's what you've got to be good at doing.  Today they are rolling the best that they have done all week, so they must have had a good night's sleep and some good work on them this morning.
Q. What's the info on your eagle?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It was like boom, boom in the hole.  Drive, 3-wood, 25-footer, boom, in.
