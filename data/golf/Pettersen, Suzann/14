Q. You were runner-up last year and coming in this year, does it give you a lot of confidence?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean, I've always enjoyed coming here to Malaysia.  I've been here quite a few times and I've yet to win.  So would be nice to kind of give it a try this year.  And 4-under is a good start.
Q. A few of the guys in the studio were saying you look comfortable in the heat.  How did you feel out there?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know, I think I'm good at faking that.  Obviously it was nice to go off early today and get finished before any potential storms, or at least get nine holes in in a decent kind of temperature.  Just tried to take advantage of teeing off early and very good greens.
Q. You look a week off last week.  Do you feel that it really helped your preparation?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I played a golf tournament in Korea, so I feel like I've just kept the game going.  Just try to keep the momentum going.
