 Q.   You're struggling to come through when you needed to, but even though you were struggling, Suzann, you were amazing today.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   This game, this, it just never really gets old.   It just brings out the best of you.   And I, you know what, I'm just really enjoying playing with these youngsters.   I'm so proud of them.   It's not easy to go out there, first of all, you don't really know what to do when you step on the first tee, and then from there try to collect yourself and find your game and find a rhythm.   
Carlota, she was a super star, she hung in there tough.   That's why it's fourâ€‘ball, you play on your partners, and this is a fantastic point and I'm proud of her to get her first point.  
   
 Q.   I noticed you were giving her encouragement and that's probably why you started playing a lot better on the back nine.   
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   Yeah, it was very stressful at the time.   So I'm very happy to play with her, and it was a great match and we won.   And so that's the most important, so it's great.   
   
 Q.   What a day.   Tell me about it.   
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I didn't play my best golf today, it wasn't easy.   The greens were hard, they were fast.   I was a bit nervous and I couldn't get a good rhythm.   And then the back nine I played some better shots.   I was trying hard.   And I made good putts and 13 and 14.   So I think at the end of the day the important thing is that we won the point and Europe is winning, so that's a thing that I'm so happy to help the team.   
   
 Q.   How nervous were you?   
CARLOTA CIGANDA:   I was very nervous.
