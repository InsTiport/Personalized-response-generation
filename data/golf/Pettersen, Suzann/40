Q. Obviously probably disappointed, but still feel like you gave it a pretty good run there?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I played pretty good today.  I had one bad drive and it came on 18.  Had to play an unplayable.  But overall, pretty good.
Q. How were you able to turn it around so quickly?  I know last week was disappointing?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: That's the game.  That's golf.  Not much you can do.
Q. Feel like you're close heading into next week?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I mean, you don't know what you get next week with the weather coming in.  It's a good step in the right direction.
