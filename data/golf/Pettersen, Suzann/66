Q.   4‑under, how you feeling after 36? 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   3‑under today was a good score.   It is playable out there, but you've got to hit some great golf shots.   The wind is a bit choppy.   It bounces up‑and‑down all the time.   You've just got to try to find the right pockets and try to hit the right shots that gives you the highest percentage.   But overall, very happy today.   Nice to finish off with a par on 18 and good feeling for tomorrow.

Q.   After two rounds, what have you learned about this course that maybe you didn't think after the practice round or what are you learning about this course? 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It's always testing when you come to new courses.   You don't quite know where the scores are going to be.   I think what's protecting this course at the moment is the wind.   It makes it that much tougher and a few more tucked pins today as well.   It's just hard to get really close.   It just shows if you really play well you can score lower on this course, and that is always nice to know with the weekend ahead of you. 

Q.   Are you surprised that you can score low around this course?   The talk was this can be tougher than locusts. 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Right now the fairways are generous.   Even if you do miss the fairways, if you get lies on the rough, you can just bomb it off the tee.   You can risk the extra few yards even if you miss it you'll still be able to get to the greens somehow.   The par‑5s are playable, which is very fun, tough par‑3s, mediocre par‑4s, and good par‑5s.

Q.   It seemed the wind kicked up a little at the end of your round.   Are you fortunate that you're off the course now? 
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   It feels consistent with the wind since I teed it up yesterday.   This morning was a little bit breezy.
