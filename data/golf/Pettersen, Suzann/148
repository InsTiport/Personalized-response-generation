  Q. You've always wanted to play Solheim Cup. Try to describe the emotion that's going on on this green in?  
 MELISSA REID: Oh, it's absolutely amazing for Caroline to come back after being 2 down with two to play. We didn't look too great half an hour ago, but it's absolutely amazing. It's going to be a massive party in Ireland tonight. I can tell you that.  
  
  Q. What about the emotions during the day? It was swinging one way and then the other. What was going on?   
 MELISSA REID: It was difficult because obviously there are scoreboards everywhere. But Annika spoke to us and Ali last night, and said, obviously, you've got to play your own game. You've got to focus on getting your own point, and fortunately we got enough points today to take one over the Americans which was brilliant.  
  
  Q. In past Solheim Cups, we've ridden the horses pretty hard and they've gone into singles tired and we haven't been able to win the singles. How key was Ali's decision to rest everyone?   
 MELISSA REID: Looking back, it was a massive decision. They played a couple of their good players all five matches, and I think they might have shown up a little bit tired, whereas, everyone is fresh today, which I think really gave us a little edge.  
  
  Q. A word for Cristie, not able to play today, tragic circumstances?   
 MELISSA REID: Yeah, it is. It's disappointing. Even Karen was disappointed as well. She wanted to have a good battle out there with Cristie. But sometimes that's just the way it goes.  
  
  Q. You said once you play one Solheim, you never want to miss another. I'm assuming that's correct?   
 MELISSA REID: That's right. I'm definitely going to try to play as many as I can.  
  
  Q. Suzann, 1 down and 3 to play. Three birdies in a row. How do you produce that sort of golf under that sort of pressure?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know. I don't know. I seemed to be able to dig it out, but I seemed to get older every time it happens. I don't know I think I have more gray hair than when I started today, but this is just fantastic.  
  
  Q. A word for your captain Alison Nicholas?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: She couldn't have delivered better. We had a tough challenge ahead of us going into the morning, but this is just outstanding. Great for European golf.  
  
  Q. All the team members contributed. How important is that?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: We knew it was going to come down to the last couple if we had a chance, and this is just fantastic. Absolutely brilliant team and what a way to finish on home soil.  
  
  Q. And a word for the rookies? The rookie this is week, you never know how they're going to react, and they were just fantastic.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Superstars all of them.  
  
  Q. Laura, this is the first win for six years. How does this rank in all your victories?   
 LAURA DAVIES: I think this might be the best one, because we came in as the team to (Indiscernible). And we needed to win the singles, and we won them 7 to 5 or something and the girls played really well.  
  
  Q. It's amazing, it wasn't much of an atmosphere when there were thousands of people here. Lots of people seemed to go home.   
 LAURA DAVIES: Yeah, those last few holes, Suzann had some finish, Caroline won the last three holes, and then Aza holed that in. It was just incredible.   
 When that kind of gallery got excited, the players were excited. It was just a marvelous moment for all of us.
