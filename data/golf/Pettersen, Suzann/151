  Q. I guess it was groundhog day today for you. A tough match on the fourball again. What is your verdict on that?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It was tough, but we have a nice chance to get a halve.  
  
  Q. That putt on the par-3 really got you going, didn't it?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, it got us into the match again. Yeah, we had a chance.  
  
  Q. Is it tough to get into the intensity of the match once you've had a morning off?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Not really, no. I felt fresh, and I felt like it was the right move. I felt very good.  
  
  Q. What about Caroline today? She's played fabulous, hasn't she?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: She's a great player.   
 She's the future of our Tour, and she's the future of the Solheim.   
  
  Q. How do you feel about tomorrow and your chances?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I feel we have a good chance.
