  Q. Obviously the last two days are pretty crazy. Talk about how hard it is to come back out and play that well.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN : It's been hard, especially being on this side of the draw where we always been the first ones out in the morning.   
 Especially when they keep telling you, Well, you have to wait another two hours. You always gotta mentally be ready when they call you out, so you can't really let go. That's the hardest part.   
 After so many days, I mean, the patience is just out, and you just go whenever you get a green light. I felt great warming up. I don't know if that's just really being fresh having not played for a while.   
 The conditions are really easy. Well, easier than it has been for us. This is the easiest day. It's wet, but it's very playable. You can fire at pretty much any pin, and the greens are pure.   
 You can pretty much tee up the ball in the fairways. It's pretty nice.  
  
  Q. Were there any spots that were particularly bad out there, or do you think they made the right decision?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN : Yeah, it's absolutely playable. From where we're landing the ball, we didn't have too much of a problem. I think two of us had to get a casual drop twice.  
 Like I said, it's very playable. Good job they've actually gotten this far, and hopefully we can get three rounds solid in.  
  
  Q. Tomorrow obviously now it's a 54-hole event, so you kind of gotta let it all hang out in the last tournament of the year.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN : Yeah, you kind of knew you had to get off to a fast start anyway being -- the format being what it originally was. But 54 holes? You just gotta go at it.
