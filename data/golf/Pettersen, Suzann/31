 Q.  How long was that putt there?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know.   
 Q.  Was it over 20?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah.  Probably 20-ish, yeah.   
 Q.  Was that the longest of the day for you or...  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, that was about the longest.  I finally had a fantastic putting day today, so...   
Finally.  It's nice.   
 Q.  Finally.  Has it been a while?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah.  I mean, long game is good.  I feel like when I putt well I can put a good score.  Today I felt like I could make anything.   
That's a nice feel.   
 Q.  I know when you guys tee it up you're always thinking you can win, but are there certain courses you just know you'll be in contention, like this one?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Obviously there are certain courses you play well, but you can't take anything for granted out here.  You still have to go out and execute, no matter how much you like the course.   
I sure did find some magic on the greens today.  I felt like I played I great yesterday.  Maybe gave away a shot or two towards the end.  Tried to take advantage of little softer greens this morning and little purer greens as well.   
 Q.  At this tournament nobody is surprised when your name is at the top of the leaderboard.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: You're surprised otherwise?   
 Q.  No.  You're always in contention here seems like.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I just like it here.  It's a lot of hard work that is finally starting to come together.   
 Q.  Where did the round kind of get going?  You had four in a row on your first nine.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Probably the par putt I made on 16.  Didn't quite execute on the tee ball and missed it short.  Holed a good par putt, probably a 15-footer for par.  That was good momentum to keep that going.   
Then, yeah, just tried to birdie almost every hole.   
 Q.  What was the difference between yesterday and today?  Was it the putting, or did you hit it better, too?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No.  I felt like I dropped a few more putts; 15 greens in 26 putts.  For me that's record breaking.   
 Q.  You said you caught magic on the greens.  Have you been working on anything in particular?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, just putting in like millions of hours.   
 Q.  Millions.  That's a lot.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's starting to show results.  Yeah, just got a nice flow.  I'm excited for the game to kind of come around for this time of year; next week as well.  Just try and go out and play another two great rounds and then see where it takes me.
