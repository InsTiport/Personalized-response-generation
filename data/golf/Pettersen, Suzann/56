 Q.   You've had six Top 10s in your last seven starts.   How confident are you feeling in your game right now?  
    SUZANN PETTERSEN:   My game feels pretty good.   Kind of come back strong after having a back injury early.   
    Feel like I've been knocking on the door quite a few times in the last few attempts.   Been in the last group in most of them.  
    Just got to keep grinding.  
   
 Q.   This is about Race to CME.   Right now, you're 11th.   Top 9 have a mathematical chance.   Before you said there is not much you could do, but is there any pressure?   Do you think about it now that you know?   
    SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Not really.   Usually when I go to Asia I've been very successful here in the past.   So just make the most of the trip.   Playing the next three, so I'm ready to go.  
    I'm rested and I look forward to this final part of the season.
