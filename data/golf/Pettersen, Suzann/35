 Q.  Birdie on the last, feels good to finish?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Today was my lousy round, that's okay.  Didn't quite get it going.  Didn't quite hit it close enough but didn't play my way out of it, either.  Hung in there and finished with a birdie, so feels a little bit better.   
 Q.  Four off for right now.  That's still a real good position going into tomorrow.  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, if you can get it going around here, there's a low one.  A little bit of work to do.   
 Q.  Tomorrow what's the game plan, what's the thing to get done?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Ball in the hole.
