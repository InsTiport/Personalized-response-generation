 Q. Describe your day. Not bad, huh?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Today was a bit better. This is what I have been trying to do for the last two days. Went out early today, I thought it was going to be no wind, and try to take advantage of being early out, greens would be perfect. 
 I actually came to the range, and it was as windy as it was on Thursday morning, so, but, I mean, I just tried to play my game, make some birdies, try to make a move and hardly make a mistake today, and it helps when the putts are going in the hole.

 Q. When you came to the game, what do you think was the major difference compared to how you played Thursday and Friday?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's all putts. First two days I had 34, 35 putts, today I had 27, so that's a seven-shot difference.

 Q. What do you think this will do for you at the end of the day? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know, but I played myself into the tournament again. 7 under is pretty good on a Saturday in a Major. So, I mean, I am right there. 
 Hopefully, the wind will pick up, and it will make it a bit difficult for the ones that are teeing off late, so who knows? But, I mean, I have done my part of the day, so I am happy.

 Q. Did you have a thought in mind when you tee'd off this morning? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I tried to get back to level. I thought that would be possible, the way I have been playing, the way I have been hitting the ball. Once I got to level, I thought, well, now I can start to grind and see how well it will go. No, it was a good day, no bogeys; one eagle, a couple birdies.

 Q. When you walked off the green yesterday, did you think you were on your way home?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I hoped I wasn't, because I felt like I had much more game in me, so I proved myself that I am still there.

 Q. Did you see where the cut was when you finished yesterday? Did you think you still had a chance?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I knew it was 4 after the first day, so I would have been very surprised if it stayed at 4. But luckily, I made it, and that's what it shows, that in a Major you can make a move even if you just make the cut.

 Q. Can you describe your eagle on the 7th hole.
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I just hit a driver and a six-iron. One bounced right in the hole. 

 Q. How far out?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It was about 158, straight right into the wind. I had been close. I was like -- the first three holes, all the putts lipped right on the edge.

 Q. Did your birdie on 16 feel good? 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I hit a good approach, good putt, so that hole felt pretty easy today.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Six feet.

 Q. Were you distracted in some way with your shot into the green at 18?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: No, but I thought the wind was going to take the ball. I got the urge to ask for it, so I just said to myself, very hard first putt, so -- but, I mean, I can't complain. There was a lot of good shots. I couldn't make one shot on the last hole, just ruined my day, even though I made my par.

 Q. Would you say this was the best round this year?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Scoring-wise, yes.

 Q. (Inaudible). 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I have been playing great for a couple of good weeks now, just nothing happening, and the first two days I had no momentum, the putts I wanted to make I haven't made, so I think it's just grind, grind, grind and nothing goes your way, but today, I turned it around.

 Q. Did you adjust your putting today?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yes. I changed a bit of my posture after yesterday, so maybe that was it. 

 Q. How long was the putt, like three feet?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It was more like five.

 Q. (Inaudible.) 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Pardon? Yeah, it was nice to have that two-putt and finish the day off, the way I played all day, so --

 Q. All that hard work (inaudible). 
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, but I didn't.

 Q. (Inaudible.)
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, I could see that.
