 Q. Better today than yesterday, but are you still a little --
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know. I mean I had my chances coming in. 
 It was disappointing. I was hoping to have a better chance on 16. I just bombed the driver to try and get it in with a scoring club and just didn't hit that wedge anywhere good. 
 But I'm trying. That's all I can do. And even when I don't feel that confident with my game I'm still competitive, and I'm looking forward to a week off.

 Q. You'll take a bunch of seconds instead of a bunch of --
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah. I'm still competitive even though I feel so-so with my game, and that's important, too. You're not going to feel great all the time with your game. It's just about putting a score together.

 Q. How was this week for you?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's been a great week. It's always great coming here to Canada. I tried my best to defend my title, and I came up a little bit short it looks like.

 Q. It looks like Michelle -- oh, except for that one there -- is doing pretty well. Do you have any thoughts on her play this week?
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Obviously she's a great player. I'm surprised she's not up there more often because she's a great ball striker. When she gets her game together, she's tough to beat. She's a good competitor, she's a good friend of mine, and I wish her all the best.

 Q. Thank you.
