 Q.   Talk about your second shot?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I felt like I dropped two shots to the field.   But I'm hitting better golf shots, so overall, pretty happy.   But it's a shame to play so close to good golf and being so close to the lead.   
   
 Q.   Your play is getting better and better?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Yeah, my game is getting better.   It just feels like I need to test it in competition after practicing.   Overall it got better as the week progressed.  
   
 Q.   Can you tell me today the course conditions?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Conditions are great.   Greens are perfect.   A little less wind, wind comes out of a little different direction, as well.   This is probably the calmest day of the four days.  
   
 Q.   How were the pin placements?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   There were some dodgy ones, pretty close to the edge, right on some slopes.   But it was always nice to mix it up so it's not always the same year after year.   
   
 Q.   How were the iron shots and putting?   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   Overall, my overall game was pretty good.   
   
 Q.   Overall, how was this year's HSBC?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   HSBC always puts on a worldâ€‘class event and it's always a pleasure coming here and they look after us really well.   And just look out on the golf course, it looks like a prime event.   
   
 Q.   After this tournament, please tell me your schedule to play.   
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I'm actually going to China to play the World Championship for the Ladies European Tour and then I get a week off and then I go to Phoenix and start preparing for the West Coast Swing.   So a lot of golf ahead and I'm happy to have the game going the right direction.
