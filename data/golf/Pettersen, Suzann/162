  Q. Post-round thoughts, post-tournament thoughts?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: Another second-place finish. It sucks. Hit one bad shot and that cost me two shots. And she made a birdie on the last. It kind of -- it felt like I gave her a gap. But other than that, I'm making some great putts coming down the stretch.   
  
  Q. What happened on 4?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: I just -- terrible swing.
