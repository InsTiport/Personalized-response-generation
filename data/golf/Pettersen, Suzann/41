Q. Lydia making a double there and two bogeys on the back nine, do you feel like you're going to be in it going into tomorrow?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I don't know any scores.
Q. Right now you're three back?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Three back, she's probably going to birdie a couple.  But I'm playing solid.  I'm just trying to progress, move my way in the right direction.  Had a good kind of strong six last holes.
Q. I know you said when it's been good, it's been really good; and when, it's been bad, it's been really bad.  Why is that?  Is it taking time for the Butch changes to click?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I mean, I would say he would probably say, she should have had it by now.
But I'm learning every day and I'm learning to get out of the bad stuff and I'm learning to embrace the good stuff.  This week's been a good kind of week so far.  I've been doing what I need to do and the change of putter that I did last week has kind of seemed to help a little bit.
Q. What did you change putter-wise?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I just changed putter.
Q. Different Nike?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, different Nike.
Q. Is that encouraging to see -- I know you've said when it's been really good, it's been really good.  Is it encouraging to see that you're on the right track?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, especially ball-striking-wise, it was always good before.  Now it's even better.  But I've got my distance, if not even more distance.
Q. That's scary.  How far are you hitting it now?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: I'm keeping up with the long ones.  That's good for an old hag like me (laughing).
