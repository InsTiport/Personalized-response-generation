Q. How tough is it to come back out just for one hole?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's not that bad.  I mean, now it's hard to go back to bed.  I'm kind of up and going.  It's going to be a long wait.  So at least the favor of the draw kind of wasn't that obvious.  At least most of us had to come back up, so fair for everybody.
Q. What's the game plan before you tee off in the afternoon now?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Chill a little bit, and I don't know, have breakfast.
