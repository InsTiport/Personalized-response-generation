 Q.   All right.   Obviously not the last round you typically wanted?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   I mean I got off to a terrible start.   Took me about ten holes before I kind of got back into it.   Just trying to save myself from a complete disaster.  
   
 Q.   Did you think it kind of got away from you on the Front 9?   Did you feel like it was completely away from you?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   No.   I felt great during the warmup.   Just a little bit, I don't know, too much adrenaline or couple of wrong clubs at the wrong time.   Just couldn't really bounce back from it.  
   
 Q.   Anything with the back?  
SUZANN PETTERSEN:   No.   I'm feeling great.   Just very disappointed.
