  Q. Thoughts on your round?  
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's a little frustrating, I have three rounds and I can't really go -- had I putted normally, I should have been, I don't know -- I've made nothing.   
  
  Q. You made a couple of par putts.   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: But all of the putts I missed.   
  
  Q. Why are they confusing you, do you think?   
 SUZANN PETTERSEN: It's grainy, and just misreads a lot of times. It's not like bad putts. Essentially misreads and the speed is finally getting back, so that's one issue. I have one more day to go, and this course owes me a low one.
