 Q.  Suzann, things there at the beginning looked a little scary for team Europe, but you guys had to be happy coming up the third all square, especially after potentially being 2-down?
SUZANN PETTERSEN: Yeah, it's difficult when you get a putt like that against you on the first hole.  You try to get into rhythm then they just knock you down.  You have to stay in there, and take it shot by shot.  Every putt is important. 

Q.  They are a very tenacious team, but you guys have the physical strength.  It had to have been a super advantage to probably have an average two clubs less to most of the greens?
SUZANN PETTERSEN:  I'm not sure about that.  You have to play the game and play the shots you feel.  I think our team is quite strong.  So I think three days of a lot of golf is not hurting us.
