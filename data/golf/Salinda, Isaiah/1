 Q.  2-under, 68 on No. 4, first round of the U.S. Amateur.  Didn't finish as you would like, with a bogey, but overall pleased with the day at 68?  
ISAIAH SALINDA: Yeah, I was pretty pleased.  I really only hit like two bad shots all day.  I made double on 11, missed it long and then near on 18, missed it left.  But I was able to make a few birdies, make a few putts, so it was a good start.   
 Q.  Do you like your grouping?  
ISAIAH SALINDA: Yeah, I do.   
 Q.  You guys have all had success in the U.S. Amateur before.  
ISAIAH SALINDA: Oh, yeah, those are good guys, I haven't played with Alex before, but great guy, happy to be playing with these guys another day.   
 Q.  So the great success for the team this year, trying to follow-up what you did last year at the U.S. Amateur, what's the next step and how do you do it?  
ISAIAH SALINDA: Next step is to try and shoot a good score on No. 2.  Just try to shoot something around even tomorrow and then that should be safe.  So just trying to make match play and go from there.
