MIGUEL TABUENA: It was a great experience.  It's always a joy to tee it up in a PGA TOUR event.  Although I didn't like the way I finished today.  I'm still happy with my game.  I know my game is there.  I just lost the momentum early in the round and couldn't get back.   
I'm feeling a bit of the fatigue.  It's been six weeks in a row for me.  So I have to play my cards right next week and not overdo things.  I have to feel fresh next week.  If I play my cards right, I know I can do well next week.   
 Q.  Playing with the PGA TOUR players like Ernie Els, what have you learned from them and how hard do you think you have to work to get to that standard?  
MIGUEL TABUENA: It's just a matter of I believe my game is there.  I believe I have the talent to perform at a high level.  It's just a matter of fact of getting used to playing with these guys I guess.  I still tend to play against them and not against the course, which is a bad thing to do.   
I know my game's there and I have next week to prove it.   
 Q.  I think this week will be a good experience for next week?  
MIGUEL TABUENA: It is.  It is.  I didn't like the way it finished but I'm still in the red numbers, which is a good sign.  I've just got to keep grinding and I know my game will come through.
