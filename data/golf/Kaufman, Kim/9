Q.   Talk about having to get here early again, wrap up the round, what was your mindâ€‘set going in? 
KIM KAUFMAN:   Kind of had a rough finish yesterday, so felt I should just come out and focus on every shot.   It's kind of hard to split up your round into two days, but I think did I a good job of staying patient, made some good pars and fortunately made a couple birdies.

Q.   Speaking of staying patient, you're on the lead right now.   Going to be one of the last groups off today.   How do you stay patient during all that weighting? 
KIM KAUFMAN:   You know, it's tough out here because you get a lot of birdie chances and you want to make them but that's the thing, you are going to get a lot, so you will make sure fair share.   You can't make them all.   You can't make nine birdies in nine holes usually.   It's something my caddie reminds me of and we try to not focus on it and talk about other things and just keep doing what we're doing.

Q.   Did you realize the putt on 18 was for the lead?
KIM KAUFMAN:   Yeah, I thought we were tied on 17.   But she has a lot of holes left so I'm trying not to look at the scoreboard too much. 

Q.   And then finally, what's the game plan for the final two rounds? 
KIM KAUFMAN:   Exact same thing.   I think we'll play conservative, get in the fairway and just having birdie putts.   My putting has been a little shaky so I'm going to go work on putting a little bit.
