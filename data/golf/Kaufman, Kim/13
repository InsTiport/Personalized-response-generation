Q.   What does this do for you going into the rest of the season, and how big is this?
KIM KAUFMAN:   You know, I'm not sure.   I think I'm going to sneak in a top 5.

Q.   Tied for fourth right now. 
KIM KAUFMAN:   It'll be close, but it's what I needed.   I had a great week in Dallas months ago, and I haven't had a great week since.   I've been waiting for this for a long time, and I hope it's going to get me into Asia really. 

Q.   Is that kind of the goal the next two weeks, three weeks?
KIM KAUFMAN:   It is, yeah, for sure.   If you're kind of on the bubble that's what you're thinking about right now.

Q.   That was quite the fist pump on 18.   Did you know how much that putt meant?
KIM KAUFMAN:   No, but I know it usually means a lot.   I had three‑putted 16 for par, so I wanted one more real bad.   It was just downhill, kind of a tough putt, so I was glad to see it go in.

Q.   How is your rookie year going so far?
KIM KAUFMAN:   It's been pretty great, I think.   You know, I have missed a lot of cuts, it hasn't been easy, but I've been positive, and thankfully I've had a couple weeks like this.

Q.   What does this do for your confidence going forward?
KIM KAUFMAN:   It's huge because I was getting a little bit‑‑ I was kind of losing some confidence the last couple weeks, and it's hard to stay positive when you're missing cuts.   I think I'm going to feel great going to Portland.

Q.   Fourth is even bigger here because it's the biggest purse non‑major, right?
KIM KAUFMAN:   I believe so, yeah.   I hope so.   I don't know what the purse was in Dallas, but yeah, it's got to be a pretty good jump.
