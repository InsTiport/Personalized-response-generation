 Q.   Kim, another solid day out there today.   What's your mind‑set going into tomorrow, one of the last groups out?   
KIM KAUFMAN:   Yeah, you know, I've played with Hyo Joo and she's had a great day, obviously taken a little bit of a lead but that can happen to any of us.   The last few days, didn't feel I played bad, 2‑under out here but need a little more.   Feel good actually.  
   
 Q.   When you shoot 2‑under and you drop ground, what does that say about this course and do you change your approach?   
KIM KAUFMAN:   In Phoenix, the weather's great and the greens are soft and it's just super scorable.   The fields are really strong.   Going into tomorrow, might go for it a little bit more being the last day, if we have a chance to reach a par 5 or be a little more aggressive.   But overall, you've just got to make some putts.   I just didn't do that today.  
   
 Q.   You've got your mom in town, been hanging out with the old college team.   How much has that helped you stay loose with you being so high up there?  
KIM KAUFMAN:   It's really helped.   The college team here is great.   I went to the Suns game with them, been out with my mom and my uncle.   I think everybody from South Dakota winters down here.   It really helps take your mind off it, yeah.
