Q. You finished T11 here last year.
KIM KAUFMAN: Yeah.
Q. So you know what it takes to get the job done. When you can do something like that, how much, not easier, but a little less stressful?
KIM KAUFMAN: Yeah, you know last year I think I started off maybe shot 2-over the first day. Granted it was cold and it wasn't a terrible score, but if you can choose, even if there is a million holes left, it's nice to go out and make six birdies and no bogeys and see yourself hit good shots and just gain a little confidence.
I'll definitely take it.
Q. I think I looked at your past performances on the LPGA Money List. 45th is your highest 2016 I want say.
KIM KAUFMAN: Sounds about right.
Q. Is there something, when you look back on maybe the form you had there versus the past couple years, is there something you pinpoint trying to get back to?
KIM KAUFMAN: I think technically last year I wasn't -- it just wasn't great. This year it is. But, man, the hard thing to get back is your confidence and just visualizing yourself hitting those good golf shots.
I felt closer lately. I was struggled with my putting and actually went and just saw a putting coach with my coach just for a different look.
That was kind of the difference today. It's one thing to hit it to six or eight feet. If you don't make it, you might as well hit it to 40. That's kind of how I felt at the end of the year.
Today I made some of those putts which I've been waiting to do all year pretty much, so it was nice to just see to come together.
