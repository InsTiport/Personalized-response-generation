  KIM KAUFMAN:   It was a short day today.   We just finished on 12, first time I made a bogey.   Try to forget about that.   Wasn't as smooth as yesterday.   Felt like I was grinding for some pars but we got it done, 3‑under today, so going to focus on that.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday you mentioned that you had the whole day to rest and maybe go shopping.   Did you hang out for your mom's birthday?  
KIM KAUFMAN:   I found a lot of things for her birthday.   We went to the Scottsdale quarter and just shopped and ate lunch and was perfect.   Came over, got ready.   Didn't seem like such a long day.  
   
 Q.   Seems like you've been pretty relaxed.   Did that help?   
KIM KAUFMAN:   Last night I went to the Suns game with my old college team, which was great because you can't sit around and think about it.   When you're out, it's hard to stay focused all the time, so doing those things helped.  
   
 Q.   With the low scores throughout the week, what's the key to the course and what's been working for you?   
KIM KAUFMAN:   We've been playing, like we usually do, play conservative, not a ton of drivers and just keeping it in play.   The greens are soft so you can really go at some pins here.   The key for me has been‑‑ a couple of shots have been tap‑in birdies, so that helps.  
   
 Q.   Quick turnaround for tomorrow and then you'll be doing the long day tomorrow.   What's the strategy?   What are you going to do tonight?   Game plan?   
KIM KAUFMAN:   Going home, going to eat and got to go to bed.   I have to get up early.   Just going to keep doing what we are doing.   Start on 13, a little wedge hole, hopefully get it started quickly tomorrow and keep it going.
