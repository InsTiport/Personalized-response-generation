 Q.  I guess start off with, how key patience is this whole week.  Obviously that's what everybody is saying is going to make the difference?  
KIM KAUFMAN: Yeah, that's exactly what we said, way to stay patient out there.  I didn't make a birdie.  I made a couple early bogeys to start my back nine.  But I knew everyone else was going to play those holes, too, and going to be a bogey for a lot of them.   
 Q.  Was it worse today?  
KIM KAUFMAN: It was the worst day by far, yeah.   
 Q.  What were any of the highlights?  
KIM KAUFMAN: We made some really good par saves, and that's what you do out here.  We made probably a 10-footer on 6 and a 12-footer on 7 which kind of keeps it going on the front there.  Those are your highlights, making good par saves.   
CADDIE: Your 2-putt on 5.   
KIM KAUFMAN: Yeah, it's good putting.   
CADDIE: If you don't get on the right part of the green -- and it's hard in this wind.  Then you have to 2-putt from 40 feet or 50 feet over those big ridges.   
 Q.  Obviously a lot can happen out here in these conditions.  But three shots back, you have to be very happy going into tomorrow with that?  
KIM KAUFMAN: For sure.  That's the thing, there could be a lot of big swings out here on any hole or stretch of holes.  Just going to keep trying to do what I've been doing and see where we finish up.   
 Q.  Anything in particular that worked super well today or was it just all-around solid?  
KIM KAUFMAN: Pretty all around.  But we hit 14 fairways which is nice.  The rough is not bad out here but it's nice to be in the fairway.
