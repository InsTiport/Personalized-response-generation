 Q. Top amateur in the field of John Deere. Your second time through, a little bit easier this time. 
 PHILIP FRANCIS: Coming through this week I was confident I was putting well, hitting the ball well, worked on some things with my swing. I knew if I put some things together and managed my game well I could do pretty well and I did.

 Q. What were you thoughts going into final round. As I looked at the leaderboard, you were right there near the top?
 PHILIP FRANCIS: Obviously I came into the event with a mindset of winning, not making the cut. Everyone was making a big deal about me making the cut. I really wasn't any part of that the first three days. 
 I came into the event with the mindset of winning, not making the cut. Everyone was making a big deal about me not making the cut. I really wasn't any of -- I was working on creeping up the leaderboard, that's what I came in today to do. I didn't really get off to that good of start. Bogeyed my first two holes, got into some trouble. And didn't hit the ball as well as I would have liked. Just being out here for my age is really awesome. 

 Q. The more you do this, do you you get more of a feel that you belong?
 PHILIP FRANCIS: Yeah, definitely after 67 and 64 out here, that gives me some confidence. A few more years of maturing and getting older and physically stronger and everything else, you know, I should -- you know, I love to be out here.

 Q. Does this factor into your decision-making process and how well you're doing as to what could happen down the line?
 PHILIP FRANCIS: I mean, I want to play. I plan on staying all four years. I love UCLA. To win the National Championship this year was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it.
