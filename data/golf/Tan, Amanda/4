 Q.  What did you think of your round today?  
AMANDA TAN: It was better.  Ball-striking wasn't as good at the start but coming back it was a lot better.  And then holing more putts kind of helped, so yeah, better round today.   
 Q.  Take us through the three birdies you had.  
AMANDA TAN: I had one on the eighth, and that was a big one because I bogeyed yesterday and today birdied, so kind of helped.   
And then 9, I birdied 9.  And then I birdied 10, as well.  So that was the three birdies I had.  9 and 10, I just hit it close and make that putt.   
 Q.  What do you hope to achieve over the next two days?  
AMANDA TAN: To keep playing, better scores over the next two days.  And yeah, just keep maintaining what I'm doing.   
I mean, today, I kind of knew that I -- I knew that some things wasn't going right, so I kind of just hang in there, and the next two days, whatever happens, whatever happens.  I just want to deal with it as it goes.   
 Q.  And how did the weather affect conditions today?  Did it affect your play in any way?  
AMANDA TAN: That big rain storm first we had, I was lucky because I haven't teed off yet.  But subsequently, it was okay.  Like I wish we didn't have that rain storm.  I just kind of think, I just deal with it as it comes.  It definitely did affect like having to put the rain gear on and taking it off again.   
Yeah, I think kind of used to it since I know it's going to rain.   
 Q.  Any score predictions?  
AMANDA TAN: I don't think so, but in the next two days, hope to see some red numbers.  Yeah, I can't predict like a certain number, but I hope as the week goes, lower scores, more red numbers.
