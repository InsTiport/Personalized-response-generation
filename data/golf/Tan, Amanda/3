 Q.  Round three today, how would you describe your day?  
AMANDA TAN: I just struggled from front to back.  I didn't have anything going.  I wasn't striking it as good, so I just didn't have a good day out there.  It was disappointing, but I guess moving forward, been working on my putting and go out tomorrow and hopefully a better day tomorrow.   
 Q.  For the first time this week, way break in the middle at 12.30 for an hour and a half.  Has that affected you in any way?  
AMANDA TAN: I mean, I didn't play well until then.  For me it was kind of good so I kind of had a break.  At the same time, it kind of didn't help because I kind of knew where I was standing and stuff.  Regardless of that break or not, today, it didn't matter to me.   
 Q.  So last day tomorrow, are you going to change your approach in any way?  
AMANDA TAN: If anything, I'll be going a bit more aggressive, going at more pins and trying to get more birdies.  That will probably be the thing I change, but other than that, everything else will stay I think.
