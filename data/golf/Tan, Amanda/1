Q. So what do you make of your round today?
AMANDA TAN: I didn't play good.  I didn't score well.  I didn't putt good at all.  Yeah, so putting is something I need to work on.
I also didn't hit a lot of greens which didn't help, and then when I missed it, I missed it on the wrong spots.  So yeah, I mean, overall, not a good round, and hopefully better three days.
Q. So yeah, looking ahead to tomorrow, besides putting, anything else you need to work on?
AMANDA TAN: Putting and probably my irons and also, you know, just some course management here and there.
Q. Playing in the HSBC Women's World Championship, how do you feel?
AMANDA TAN: Yeah, that was definitely something else on the first few holes, but after that, it was just a little bit of a struggle.  So hopefully, you know, with the experience I had over the last two times I played can help me with the next three days.
Q. How is it playing the other two courses?
AMANDA TAN: Yeah, they were nice.  They -- we didn't talk much because I was a bit -- was more focused on my game, yeah, but they were nice and it was a pleasure to play with them.
