Q. Congratulations on a great tournament.  Tell us about today.
AMANDA TAN: Today was better yesterday, but made more birdies; had the most birdies among the four rounds.  It was better.  I didn't hole a lot of putts, again.
But yeah, I think I learned a lot during these four rounds, and especially today.  I think I'm happy to bring that into next week for the China Q-School.  Yeah, I think ultimately, a bit disappointing week, but I still learned a lot from my pro debut.
Q. What's your takeaway from this whole experience and tournament?
AMANDA TAN: Well, this week really showed me that I still have so much more to do to get to where these girls are.  But some parts are going in the right direction, but I still need to do a lot more work.
And ultimately, for this whole week, I need to work a lot on my putting going into the next week.  But the rest of my game, I want to keep maintaining it and fine tuning it.
Q. What was it like playing with all these big names?
AMANDA TAN: All of them have been very nice.  They have been nice to chat with and nice to play with, so yeah, I mean, it's an honor for me to play with them.  But yeah, it was fun.  I learned a lot from them.  Yeah, hopefully I get to play with them again.
Q. So what's up next for you and for the rest of the year?
AMANDA TAN: China Q-School for me, and ultimately, I'm looking at LPGA.  But for now I think I'm playing a bit in Asia first and then going to the States eventually.
For now, focus in Asia.  Hope to get on a few tours, and then I will focus a bit more in the States and ultimately the LPGA will be my goal.
