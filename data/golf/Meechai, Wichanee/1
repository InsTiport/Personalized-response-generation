Q. So if I was to look at your scorecard right, bogey-free, 6-under today.  How did you feel like you played today, obviously well?
WICHANEE MEECHAI: Actually, this week I hit it pretty solid, and I really have confidence with my iron.  But, like the second round and third round I cannot make a putt at all, and then today, final round, I made a lot of putts.  So it's a good result.
Q. Do you know -- did something specific change?  Did you practice something or what made the putter pick up today?
WICHANEE MEECHAI: I did little things with my putter and my caddie, he tried a lot to work with that, and he talked with it actually.
Q. Really?
WICHANEE MEECHAI: Yeah.  Like, if you don't listen to her, we're going to change, kind of like that.  So maybe the putter will listen to us.
Q. Love it.  So you're only 1-stroke back from the lead right now.  What are you going to do, just hang around?
WICHANEE MEECHAI: Yeah, just have something to eat and then hang around.
Q. What are your thoughts on the golf course in general?
WICHANEE MEECHAI: It's really nice and challenging, I think.  If you don't hit on the fairway, it's going to be hard to get to the green.
Q. And the fan support seems to be great.
WICHANEE MEECHAI: Yeah, yeah, thank you so much for coming, and the fans are really nice.
