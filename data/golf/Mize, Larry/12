Q.   Quick start off the back nine. 
LARRY MIZE:   Yeah, it was.   I bogeyed 8 and 9 to finish the front, which wasn't quite the way I wanted to finish. 
And then to get off to a good start, hit a really good shot into 11 and made a nice putt on 13 and a really nice shot on 14 to get three birdies real quick.   And another nice shot and putt on 16.   So it was a really nice back nine for me.

Q.   Compare and contrast the greens from this morning and also to yesterday, you got a lot of wind, much firmer. 
LARRY MIZE:   I think the biggest thing was the wind yesterday.   I don't know so much the firmness of the greens, but the wind was definitely a much tougher day. 
Today's probably a more difficult direction, but it didn't blow as hard.   Yesterday it was probably an easier direction, but it blew pretty good so it made the course play tougher.
