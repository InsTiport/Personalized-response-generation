  Q. First round under par today. What was the difference between today and your first two rounds?  
 LARRY MIZE: Well, let's see, today I probably hit it a little better today, made a few more putts, gave myself a few more birdie putts that were a few more makable birdie putts was the biggest key.   
  
  Q. How does this golf course compare to other ones you've played on?  
 LARRY MIZE: This golf course to me has very much a British Open type golf course feel and we don't get that very much over here.
