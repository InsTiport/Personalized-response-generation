 Q.   Can you give me a description of your round, how you felt out there today?  
LARRY MIZE:   At times I felt okay, just hit a few too many loose shots and shot 74.   
   
 Q.   How did you feel about the course conditions, the winds have been playing havoc with people.   
LARRY MIZE:   I thought it was a tough day, the wind blew pretty steady in the afternoon, maybe got even a little worse later in the day.   So it was not an easy day out there.
