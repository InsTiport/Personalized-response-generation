 Q. How is the course playing today?
 LARRY MIZE: I thought it played tough this afternoon. Tom shot 2-under, I thought that was a very good round. Anything under par this afternoon I thought was good because the wind gusted up pretty good at times and I thought it played hard. 

 Q. What adjustments are you going to have to make going into tomorrow?
 LARRY MIZE: Get the ball in the hole sooner. I played okay today. I just got to get the putter going a little bit better tomorrow and get a little momentum off that have.

 Q. Talk about the impact of the wind a little. Specifically what that did to your game. 
 LARRY MIZE: Oh, well it's been blowing every day we have been here, so we're kind of used to it. But it really does impact it. Some of those holes, 4 and 5 play really tough into the wind and 12 plays really hard. So -- and then the downwind holes it's just hard to stop the ball. 
 So either way the wind really is affecting the ball. And in the cross breeze the wind really is, at this altitude, I think it affects the ball a little more. So you really got to play it.
