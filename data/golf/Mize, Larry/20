 Q. Start with comments on your final round today. 
 LARRY MIZE: It was kind of a war for me out there. I didn't hit it very good at times, but I made some great saves and good up-and-downs, so I just didn't quite have enough to get up there to have a chance.

 Q. You finished at 3-under for the whole tournament, how do you feel? This is a tough course. How does it feel being 3-under for the whole weekend?
 LARRY MIZE: Well there are a lot of positives. I still got to work to get a little better but there are a lot of positives.

 Q. Did you have fun?
 LARRY MIZE: I had a lot of fun.
