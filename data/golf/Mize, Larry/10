  LARRY MIZE:   I've really been looking forward to this week all year, to be back playing on the weekend.   And I'm excited to be playing.   
   
 Q.   Did you see this coming, did you feel your game was in‑‑  
LARRY MIZE:   No, I didn't.   And it may have been a blessing in disguise.   I kind of got relaxed this week.   I said, you know, just play and have a good time.   Obviously do your best, but I've not been playing very well this year, but Mark Immelman, my instructor and I have worked really hard this week.   And I've got things going better.   I was hoping just to get some momentum for next week.   And I think I've definitely done that.   
   
 Q.   You're going to be in the top third, probably on this windy day.   
LARRY MIZE:   I know, it was nice playing this morning, because, I mean, the greens are slick.   And with the breeze this afternoon I think it could be real tricky out there.   So I'm happy I'm done.   
   
 Q.   Why as past champions are you able to come back here year after year and find form that you may not necessarily have elsewhere?  
LARRY MIZE:   Well, you know, I think anytime you come back to where you've won and had success, you have good feelings.   You know, there's definitely local knowledge here and experience is a big factor on this golf course.
