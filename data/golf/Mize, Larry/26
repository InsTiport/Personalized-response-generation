  Q.  How is the course playing today?   
 LARRY MIZE:  My short game was horrendous today.  I didn't putt very well and didn't chip very well.   
 I didn't bring a short game with me today.   
 I liked what I was doing with my putting today.  I had some misreads and my speed was pretty bad today.   
 I didn't hit the ball horrible, but I didn't hit it good either.   
 I made a lot of mental mistakes.  The fairways were playing soft and the greens were hard and fast.
