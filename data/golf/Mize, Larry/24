 Q. Tell me about your round, you played pretty consistent, didn't get into too much trouble. 
 LARRY MIZE: Yeah, I played two consistent rounds, a couple of birdies and a bogey yesterday and I guess today I had three birdies and a couple bogeys. 
 So playing solid and it was just another good round. I was very pleased with it.

 Q. What's been the key? Off the tee, your iron play, your putting, just a little bit of everything?
 LARRY MIZE: Definitely putting. I think you got to make a few putts around here and it's tough putting around here, these greens are difficult. 
 So I putted well for the first two days, I've driven the ball well, and that's a good part for me. And my irons have been pretty good too. I just, you know, I hit 13 greens yesterday, I can't remember how many today, but it's just been pretty solid all around. And that's what you got to do. It's a tough golf course out there. 

 Q. A couple of the players who played in the morning yesterday pointed out that the poa annua was really, you could notice the difference this afternoon from when you played yesterday morning. Did you find that to be the case or not?
 LARRY MIZE: Yeah, I mean it's, definitely it should be the case. I had putt on number 5 that the poa annua might have got me there. So I would agree to that, yeah, definitely.

 Q. You're in the final few groups heading into the weekend, what's your mindset now?
 LARRY MIZE: Just got to keep doing the same thing. Hit the fairways and greens and just give your self as many birdie putts as you can. And there's a lot of golf left. And I just want to keep playing solid and try and be there on Sunday.
