 Q. You talked about trying to get back to even after we spoke yesterday. Talk about the round today.   
LARRY MIZE: It was just not very good. You know, I struggled starting out. And just never could get the ball going where I wanted to. I didn't hit it very good. I didn't putt very good. And it was great to be here but very disappointing the way I played. I played pretty badly today.   
   
 Q. Hole 3, that was a bonus. Right spot.   
LARRY MIZE: That was it. That was the only bright spot. I turned around and bogeyed the next two holes, which was difficult. I thought I hit a perfect shot on 7, came up short and made bogey there.   
But that was just kind of my day. The few times I did hit a good shot they didn't turn out like I hoped, and they were pretty few and far between.  
   
 Q. Talk about coming here next year. You said yesterday your game is not where you'd like it to be?  
LARRY MIZE: Unfortunately I haven't had my game very good the past few years, I've just scraped it around and made the cut the last few years. But I haven't hit it very good. So I'd like to have my game better coming in here and play a lot better.  
   
 Q. You made three or four cuts going into this year, how difficult is it to watch on the weekend?  
LARRY MIZE: It's disappointing. But the way I played, I probably need the weekend off to give me a break and work some on my game. But, sure, it's very disappointing. I hate not to be here on the weekend.
