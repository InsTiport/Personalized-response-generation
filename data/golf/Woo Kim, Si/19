Q. What did you think of the way the 18th hole played today?
SI WOO KIM: I played yesterday a couple of back hole (Indiscernible).  I tee up, and just trying to hit it hard driver, but little missed right.  But ball go shorter and much better than second shot.  It played right.
And then I like front pin.  Easy little chip, I just birdie, that's it.
Q. How much was the wind a factor on that hole specifically?
SI WOO KIM: It made it easy (laughing).
Q. What do you think of the whole golf course?
SI WOO KIM: Lots tough, and then better windy, getting more hard.  But today the wind has come, and my tee shots I hit a lot of fairways, and that's the really easy thing, I think.
Q. How are you going to approach tomorrow's round?
SI WOO KIM: Tomorrow I play early morning and then I'll have a chance for no wind.  I'm trying to be aggressive and getting lower.
Q. This is your first U.S. Open?
SI WOO KIM: Yes.
Q. How is the U.S. Open different from anything else?
SI WOO KIM: This course like little links.  I've never played like this course.  But I like windy.  I hit it really lower and that's good for me, I would say.
Q. How were the greens?  What do you have to say about the greens, the putting?
SI WOO KIM: The greens are not really fast, but I like these greens.  I think it's -- today's no windy is much better than windy, yeah.
Q. How about your back?
SI WOO KIM: I'm a little still hurt now, but I'm getting better the last two days.  I'm getting treatment, and that's it.
