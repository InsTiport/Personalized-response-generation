  Q. Great round, bogey-free 66.  What was really special out there today for you?
 SI WOO KIM:   I felt pretty comfortable and, like, the last week, I didn't putt very well and I just focused on practicing harder and I putted pretty well.  That's why I think I saved par a lot, like, 15 to 20 feet I made the par and that's why I shoot very well.
 Q. During the off-season, during the break, what did you do?  Did you have a lot of time off?  Did you practice a lot?
 SI WOO KIM:   I didn't practice much in the time off.  I went back to Korea right after the Masters, so I had four weeks in Korea and then back to two weeks in Dallas.  So I just tried to figure out the feel last week and this week I feel pretty good.
 Q. What's it been like for you going back and forth between Korea with COVID around and traveling?  What's that experience been like for you?
 SI WOO KIM:   Yeah, it was like always have to go to Korea in the time off and two weeks in quarantine in Korea, so that was the most hard part.
 Then in the last two weeks being back, it was fine.
