  Q. (Answers to questions in Korean.)
 SI WOO KIM:   The flow on the first nine was really good.  On the 11th hole, during my second, third and fourth shot, some fans were yelling and startled me, so I ended up bogeying.  But I tried to come back from that, and I finished up pretty well.
 I feel like I'm quite far behind, but I think if I do well tomorrow you never know what's going to happen, so I'm going to do my best.
