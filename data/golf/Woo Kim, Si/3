  Q. Really nice round of golf today, five birdie and no bogeys in a round this golf course, not making a bogey is a pretty good stuff.  Your thoughts on how well you played today?
 SI WOO KIM:   Yeah, I thought that I played good and then the shot and everything feels okay and, but last two days I was putting pretty good, but, no, shot was much better than the last two days very well.  It's not the best, I think, my putter today, but I hope it will work tomorrow.
 Q. You hit 15 of 18 greens, so obviously your iron play was pretty strong today.
 SI WOO KIM:   Yeah, week before my coach came out here and then he checked my, something for my swing and then it feels much better and much more comfortable, so, yeah, I hope, yeah, much better.
