 Q.  No dropped shots, six glorious birdies, what were the keys to your round today?  
SEAN CROCKER: I putted really well.  I had five weeks off this last -- after, well, whatever tournament, and then I just went home and I just worked on my game and it seems to be paying off.   
 Q.  Is it frustrating having a break like that, or were you looking at the positives of this is an opportunity to get something extra into your game going forward?  
SEAN CROCKER: Sometimes it's frustrating, but for me that was a big key in kind of getting the season rolling in the right direction.  My game wasn't far off but it was sloppy and I wasn't making putts, so those five weeks off couldn't have helped me more.   
 Q.  Because you shot a closing 65 in Kenya, which was a wonderful way to finish.  You must have been chomping at the bit to play again, but were you excited to get out there today because something was clicking with your game?  
SEAN CROCKER: It seems like it's heading in the right direction after Kenya and then was able to refine it a little bit more back home.  I don't know, it's early, but it felt good to get back out here and play tournament golf.  It's been awhile.
