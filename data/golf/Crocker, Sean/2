 Q.  Thoughts on that performance today?  There was some ups, some downs, but you seemed to hold it together really well.  
SEAN CROCKER: Yeah, it always can go better.  I haven't been in this stage too many times, other than college and amateur golf.  It's still new to me as a pro, so thought I did all right.  Could have gone better.   
 Q.  What is the thought process going out, because it is new territory for you, it's your rookie season, etc.?  
SEAN CROCKER: Well, in Qatar of last year, I had a chance to experience the final group, so I learnt a lot of that from that last year.  Just kind of take it one shot at a time and feel my game early in the stages, which it was clicking early, so I thought I was going to be able to take it low.  Course is tough.   
 Q.  What do you think Nick Price to recommend to you now going into the final round today?  Perhaps you might have a chance to talk to him?  
SEAN CROCKER: Play better probably.  Probably just tell me hit the ball closer and make more putts.  I might reach out.  He might send me a text.  I'm pretty happy with what I'm doing and how I'm doing it right now, so not too many extra thoughts or questions.
