Q. Many congratulations on a terrific round of 5-under par, no bogeys on the card.  What did you do particularly well today?
SEAN CROCKER: Just kept the ball in play.  Hit it where I saw it.  Missed about every par 3 green but chipped it stone every time.  Didn't have too many stressful par putts, which was nice out here.  It was cold and wet and windy.
Q. How much experience of British links golf have you got?
SEAN CROCKER: One, maybe two tournaments, The Open at Carnoustie and then Challenge Tour in Scotland.  That's about it.  So kind of new to me but I love it.  I think it's so much cooler than American golf.  You have to do certain things and use your imagination.  I think it's more fun and a little bit on the easier side, depending on how bad the wind gets and weather gets.
Q. Five other Top-20s, second in Morocco.  What's been the secret to the consistently good form?
SEAN CROCKER: I've been hitting the ball well for the past few months.  When I'm playing well, it's usually hitting it well, but it's just whether the putts drop or not for me, and the putter has been working the last couple weeks.  It's taken a little bit of stress out of my game.
