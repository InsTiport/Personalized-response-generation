 Q.  Your last round on Tour, how does it feel?  Are you sad?  
VERONICA ZORZI: I'm feeling a bit sad.  I mean, because it's been almost 15 years on Tour, so it's a big part of my life.  When I was walking on the course today, I was just thinking all the time that I come here, you know, the memories that I got, stuff like that.   
It's a little bit sad, but I want to see in the future, I'm going to stay working in golf.  So it's going to be good, anyway.   
 Q.  How many times have you played in this tournament?  
VERONICA ZORZI: Ten.   
 Q.  And why did you choose this tournament?  Is it a special atmosphere here for you in Dubai?  
VERONICA ZORZI: Yeah, it's a big tournament.  It was the last one on the calendar, on the schedule.  I mean, good memories here, and yeah, I also like the course.   
 Q.  Do you have any regrets from your decision to become a professional golfer, or will you do it all over again?  
VERONICA ZORZI: No, no.  I'm going to do again.  Oh yeah, of course.   
 Q.  How is it as a career?  Enjoyable?  
VERONICA ZORZI: Yeah, it's not an easy life for a woman.  I mean, it's not so easy because we have to travel a lot and stuff like that.  But I think I was very lucky to be on Tour so many years, and play also well.  I'm happy in what I did in my career, so I'm happy.
