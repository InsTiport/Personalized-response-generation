  Q. Talk about how this pairing happened first off.   
 ANDY RODDICK: I kind of was coming here with some buddies and I said, wouldn't it be cool if I could caddie for someone. So we have some mutual friends who are business partners for a couple years and so not only did I get to walk with someone I got to walk with a former champion so it was pretty awesome.   
  
  Q. This is your first time at Augusta?  
 ANDY RODDICK: First time, yeah.   
  
  Q. I'm told that you're sort of a newbie to golf and you you've got the bug.   
 ANDY RODDICK: I've been playing a couple years and I love it. I play whenever I can. I play at home. First time to Augusta now. It's been a pleasure to take it all in.   
  
  Q. Does it bring you back to a place like Wimbledon?  
 ANDY RODDICK: There are a lot of parallels, with the tradition and the pride that everyone takes just being there, there are definitely a lot of similarities.  
  
  Q. This is definitely going to make you a better golfer tomorrow, right?  
 ZACH JOHNSON: Yeah, he gave me some great yardages early on and then he got tired.   
 We had a great day. We birdied the first three holes and went from there and it was fun. So we had a great time.
