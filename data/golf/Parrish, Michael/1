  Q. Tell me a little bit about the round that you had today. I know I was talking to your caddie, he said it was kind of tough out there.   
 MICHAEL PARRISH: It was very difficult. But I made a couple poor decisions and made a triple and three doubles and just from stupid plays. But putting was tough and just conditions were difficult.   
  
  Q. How much do you attribute to the conditions and how much just to the golf course itself?  
 MICHAEL PARRISH: It's probably I would say more -- well, it's hard to say. Some of the places I hit it in I don't think it was the conditions that made that much difference. I think it was probably the golf course. It was just very difficult.   
  
  Q. Have you played here before?  
 MICHAEL PARRISH: No, I have not.   
  
  Q. What kind of a score would you expect to be among the leaders today?  
 MICHAEL PARRISH: Oh, talking about after today's round?   
  
  Q. Yeah. Or overall. What do you think overall score would win this tournament?  
 MICHAEL PARRISH: I would think even par is going to be pretty good if the conditions stay like this. But it was really difficult out there today. So it's really hard to say. I would say even par would have a pretty good chance at it. But I think the weather's supposed to get a little nicer, so I think that the golf course is very fair and if you hit the ball good and play well, I think that the birdies are out there. It's just a matter of hitting the ball well.   
 You got to -- it's a ball-striker golf course, you got to drive it good and you got to putt it good. Off and on do those two things you should play pretty good.
