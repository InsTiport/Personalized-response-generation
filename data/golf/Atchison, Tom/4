  Q. Give us a few comments about the course today.   
 TOM ATCHISON: Just look at my shoes and my pants. That will tell you.   
  
  Q. You look muddy.   
 TOM ATCHISON: It's just really really wet. I'm actually from Ohio and we have had the same rains that they have had here and it's just saturated. The grounds crew has done unbelievable to get it even somewhat playable. It's just long, wet, and no roll and but it's good. It's great to be here.   
  
  Q. Give us just an overview of your day.   
 TOM ATCHISON: I played solid. I shot 2-over, but I actually, I missed a couple greens and didn't get up-and-down, I 3-putted once or twice.   
 Other than that, I played really really solid, I can't complain really.
