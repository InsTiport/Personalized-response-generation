 Q.   Your overall thoughts on the tournament and your round today.   
TOM ATCHISON:   Awesome, great.   Tough, really tough golf course.   The thing about this course you don't have to hit a real bad shot to get really kind of penalized.   That's what happened on the front nine.   I missed a couple putts starting out, some short ones for par.   
And hit it like three inches in the rough on a couple holes and you just can't get out of that stuff and I made a couple bogeys.   
But the whole week I played solid, great, and it's a good experience and I enjoyed it, every minute of it.   This whole place is wonderful.   It's a beautiful part of Michigan.   It's really, really nice.  
   
 Q.   Have you been to this area before?  
TOM ATCHISON:   No.   We were eating dinner last night over by the lake and it's a beautiful lake.   It's a nice place.   The whole thing is great.   
   
 Q.   Do you plan on coming back next in 2014?  
TOM ATCHISON:   Yeah.
