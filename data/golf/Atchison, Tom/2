 Q.   Talk about your round today and how things were flowing with the change of the weather as well.   
TOM ATCHISON:   Well, really it changed probably about three or four times, cold and the rain and at the beginning.   And then the wind came up later.   
But I played really solid from tee to green.   I hit, I mean, I think I hit every drive right in the fairway, I just played the par‑5s, I got a couple bad breaks on them.   
Actually, I shot 1‑over today and I played the par‑5s plus four with all good drives.   Just had some, a couple bad irons there.   
But other than that, I putted great, I don't think I've had a 3‑putt on these greens in the first three days, which is unusual.   
   
 Q.   That's different from what we have been hearing from others.   
TOM ATCHISON:   But, yeah, I'm happy.   
   
 Q.   With the two consistent rounds yesterday and today what's your mentality going into tomorrow?  
TOM ATCHISON:   I feel good.   I feel good.   Really I just want to come out and have some fun.   It's a great highlight for me to make the cut.   I think any club pro that really plays in this, I mean a realistic goal is we want to make the cut and then play good on the weekend, which I think I'm so far doing okay.  
   
 Q.   And what's it been like having people back in Ohio cheering for you?  
TOM ATCHISON:   It's fun.   I'm getting a bunch of texts from my members at the club and that, which makes me feel good.   It's exciting.
