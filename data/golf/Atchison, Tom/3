 Q.   Talk about your day.   
TOM ATCHISON:   I played steady eddie golf today.   
   
 Q.   After a tough round yesterday, can you tell me how you feel about that and how it helps you going into the weekend?  
TOM ATCHISON:   I feel great.   My swing feels really really good.   I struck it, I don't think I missed many greens today.   I probably had birdie putts that I probably could have made, some 10‑footers, but I don't think I've had a 3‑putt in two days and that's amazing on these greens.   
I maybe didn't get up‑and‑down from off the green, but as far as being on the green I haven't had any 3‑putts yet.   I feel great I'm really excited as a club pro to make the cut.   
   
 Q.   Do you want to talk about making the cut?  
TOM ATCHISON:   It's exciting.   That's really all I can say.   It's been a goal of mine and I actually played in it last year at Valhalla, I qualified and missed the cut by three shots but played good there.   We got caught in all the storms there and it took us a few days to play but, no, for my second try, I'm excited.
