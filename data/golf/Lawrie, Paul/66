  PAUL LAWRIE:   Pretty much the same as yesterday.   Played nicely and just putted like an idiot again.   Just a little bit better, speed wise was better, but just holed nothing out there, so disappointing.  
Well, typically you go out there and putt for 40 minutes and hole everything and the stroke is nice and the pace is good, and get on the course and it's different.   But it was a little bit better today.   Yesterday was the all‑time worst, so it couldn't be as bad as that.  
2‑over and should have been a couple under, to be fair.   Played lovely again.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, it's just inconsistent at the minute with the putter.   Thursday was brilliant, putted really well Thursday and holed out well.   Couldn't have felt a one, really, on Thursday, what you'd want again, and then since then it's been pretty poor.   So I've got a week off now before Bridgestone and PGA, so I'll not be playing any golf that week, because we're doing the walk, which will be a good thing, get away from it for a week and then come back and try it again.  
   
 Q.   Is it a matter of speed or seeing the lines?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yesterday it was a speed issue.   Couldn't get the pace of the greens at all for some reason.   And today I had an awful lot of just poor putts.   Just putts that were‑‑ I must have missed seven or eight inside ten feet today alone.   Really playing good, hitting the ball really nicely and driving it well, but just can't get the ball in the hole.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, I had French off, so I've only played two events.   But I feel as though I've kind of played more than that, to be fair.   I feel ‑‑ what's the word?   Ready for kind of just a bit of a break.   Even with the week off with the French, I was quite busy that week, whereas next week there will be no golf at all involved.   The next ball I hit will be in Akron.   
We start tomorrow.   Yeah, we go tomorrow late afternoon and then we finish Saturday, and then I fly Sunday morning to Akron.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Won't hit one ball, no, which will be nice.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, I don't know.   I mean how many Scots played this week, six?   I mean you're obviously looking for a few more than that.   And we all are, I'm sure.   But there's a lot of people that work unbelievably hard trying to get these guys better.   And all the players are trying to work hard and get better.   It's not easy out there to get on Tour.   But there's a lot of work getting done, so we'll see, hopefully.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   I think frustrated would be an understatement.   I think I've hit the ball this week, not as good as I can, but I've hit the ball extremely well.   Had I been top 10 this week, I think it would have been fair enough.   And to end up I think we're going to finish 40th I think it is.   But you get weeks like that where you kind of play good and don't putt good and some weeks you don't hit the ball very well and you hole everything.   There's not many people getting them both together.   But it's been a struggle with the putter this week.   But Thursday I putted beautifully, so it's just a bit weird.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, I mean I know I can, obviously.   But you've got to‑‑ this week you've got to get everything together.   You've got to get every part of your game playing reasonable.   You can't have one part way off, which is what my putting was this week.   You can't do that or you're going to finish 40th.   You can't give these guys as many shots as that every day.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, a bit firmer today to be fair.   All of a sudden it's running and starting to play a bit firmer, a little bit ‑‑ Thursday to Saturday the course was very soft, which is a pity because you want it hard and fast here.   A little bit more breeze today.   It was quite good this morning, so it's weird how it works.  
   
 Q.   How many putts today?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   34 today, so you just can't compete with that.   I played lovely today and shot 2‑over.   23, 31, 39, 34.   So hopeless.   Hopeless.   I played lovely to finish where I am, to be fair.  
   
 Q.   How do you putt on the greens here?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   Just the same as I putt everywhere else, I suppose, no differently.   I'm sure the greens are fast and they'll be lovely.   But they were lovely here; the greens were excellent this week.   And if you got the ball rolling, you could make a lot of putts this week.   But when you're not rolling it, then it's impossible.
