Q.   Are you disappointed?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Didn't play as good.   Putted the same.   Putted really poorly.   But it was bad luck.   It was just one of those days that didn't go well.   Martin is a solid player and I wish him all the best the rest of the week.   I hope he wins it.

Q.   Do you get the feeling sometimes it's just not your day.   You tried your best, obviously?
PAUL LAWRIE:   I played lovely the last two days and putted terrible.   And then today I putted the same and hit a few ropy shots and it didn't go. 

Q.   It's different in eight holes?
PAUL LAWRIE:   You give them two holes, the first two, it's hard to get back.
