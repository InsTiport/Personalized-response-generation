  PAUL LAWRIE:   I was not in it all day to be fair until I birdied 17 there.   It was a good battle.   Peter is a good player; he's ahead of me in the World Rankings, and I'm ahead of him in The Race to Dubai, so a good win this morning.
It's match play, and that's the good thing about it.   I got beat on a couple of holes on the front nine that he didn't have to work too hard with.   But I was proud of the way I kept fighting.   I didn't play good at all today and don't hole many putts and just kept going.   That's what you've got to do. 
Last year I got back in it the first time in years, and it's a huge event, IMG puts on a great show, and Volvo has been a great sponsor for years, so it's just great to be here. 
We've got Camilo tomorrow morning and obviously he's a good player.   Got a little bit lucky against Peter just now but hopefully play better and do the same tomorrow.
