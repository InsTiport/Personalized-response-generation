Q.   Paul, well done, first of all, what about the game today?   A few of the matches were a bit scruffy but how was yours? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Our game was high‑quality golf; I was 4‑over‑‑ no, it was poor.   It was tricky.   Obviously the wind is a bit stronger than yesterday and both of us played quite well. 

Q.   When you get into the closing stages knowing that a halve match is going to get you into the weekend and rest of the afternoon off, do you play any different?
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, not really.   Obviously I was two down and had a nice wee run and won three holes in a row and got a head, and then Camilo hit a lovely shot at 17 and I just missed my putt; then a serious horseshoe on 18. 
Obviously you don't want to play poorly, but you go through and play poorly, doesn't make a difference to me.

Q.   So now you can relax and look forward to the weekend; when you look forward to the weekend with 16 players, I don't know if you concur with Richard Boxall saying this is the probably the easiest event to win because there's only 24 players; that's easy for him to say, isn't it. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Very easy for Richard to say, but I know where he's coming from to be fair.   There's not many players here and there's eight less starting tomorrow so you have a one in 16 chance of winning a huge tournament.   I'll do a bit of practise to try to find the game.   I struggled yesterday and a little worse today, so need to get some ball‑striking going. 

Q.   Anything in particular?   Purely ball‑striking; is everything else okay?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Everything's fine, yeah.   I hit some nice putts that didn't go in today.   You know, that can happen.   But the ball‑striking is pretty poor.   But that can happen.   I struggled a bit in Seville and missed the cut for a while there and did a little bit of work last week, so we'll see what it's like this afternoon.
