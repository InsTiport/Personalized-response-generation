Q.   You won the playoff hole. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, I hit driver off the tee and I had 57 yards to the hole.   And hit lob wedge to about six inches and Camilo conceded my putt and then he 2‑putted from about 20 feet.   So I go to one in the group and Camilo goes to two.

Q.   And you therefore play‑‑
PAUL LAWRIE:   The second person in the BjÃ¶rn group, McCormack group. 
They are on the tee as we speak.   So we'll find out soon. 

Q.   Are you going to watch that?
PAUL LAWRIE:   I'm not.   I'm going to go back to the pool where I was about half an hour ago.
