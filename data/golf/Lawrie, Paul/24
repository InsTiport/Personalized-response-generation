 Q.  Talk about the way you've played over the last two days.  PAUL LAWRIE: I've actually played really nicely tee to green, a lot of good shots, driven the ball extremely well.  Given myself countless chances.  Putted very, very well.  The ball is coming off the putter beautifully but not going in.  I've actually putted okay, but because you missed a putt you get frustrated and you can't let that affect your putting.   Q.  It sounds like it's good moves, good intentions, things will come your way?  PAUL LAWRIE: It's the Scottish Open, what is there to be grumpy about?  It's great.  It's very nice.  I'm enjoying it.  The crowds have been great. My groin is a little tight, but I've been getting by with it.   Q.  You said that on the 8th at the Championship.  Has it gotten any better?  PAUL LAWRIE: A little bit.  I've been stretching quite a bit in the room at night.  It's just in the morning obviously when you sleep overnight and it gets a bit stiff, a bit tight.  It takes a bit to get going in the morning.  When you get to my age, it takes a bit to get going in the morning anyway.  Throw a groin in there, there's not much difference.   Q.  Excited for the weekend?  PAUL LAWRIE: Looking forward to it.  I know how I'm swinging.  If I can hole a few, I would like to think that I could get myself in there.  You can't ever know what's going to happen.  I've been playing nicely.  So I'm looking forward to it.   Q.  You know they will sink eventually?  PAUL LAWRIE: Yeah, they will.  I'm going to go work on it now for an hour before I go back.  I'll go on the property and I'll hole everything, which is just about right to add to the frustration of the day
