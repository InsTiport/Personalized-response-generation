 Q.   Talk about your round.  
PAUL LAWRIE:   It was a nice way to finish.   I hit a 3‑wood, 250 to the front, and just tried to hit a nice draw with the 3‑wood and it pitched up on the back and was 40 feet in for two.   Easy!  
I played lovely, Quite nicely.   I had it 1‑under most of the day then bogeyed 5 and 6, which are tough holes, and I had chances at 7 and 8 and a 12 footer at 9, so it was nice to finish like that.  
It s tough again.   Much more wind and softish greens, so it isn t easy out there.   But I m pleased with how it is going.   For me at the US Open, this is pretty good.
