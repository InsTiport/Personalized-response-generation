  PAUL LAWRIE:   Today, I started birdie, birdie.   Hit a nice shot at the first and rolled it in from about 12 feet and up‑and‑downed it at the second for birdie.   
Then really struggled, kind of played poorly, made double at 8.   Just couldn't get going.   Just couldn't get it close enough to give myself chances and then nice finish on the last three.   Turns into half a decent day.  
   
 Q.   What happened at 8?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   I hit it in the bunkers off the tee left which is just horrendous.   I had a good lie and tried to hit it on the green and came out right, hit the cart path, and in the knee high grass, made double.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel there's a good score out there today?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, it wasn't that difficult to be honest.   There's not a lot of rough and you can get on the green from pretty much anywhere.   The greens are a little bit firmer than they have been in the past few years, so there's a score out there.   
   
 Q.   Encouraging?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Encouraging the way I hit it, definitely, yeah.   I've been playing like that and shooting over par.   
   
 Q.   What do you make of the course with the new changes to it?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, the course is good.   Obviously the only thing about 18 is now there's two or three groups on the tee because everyone can get it on the green.   If you miss the green, there's a lot of working out and it takes time, so play backs up.   At The Ryder Cup it might be a problem; there's only four games.
