 Q.   Decent start?   
    PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, yeah, I played lovely today but missed a few putts out there and finished 3‑putt, 3‑putt, which leaves a kind of nasty taste in the mouth.   Really should have been 5‑ or 6‑under, but 3‑under is all right.  
   
 Q.   How tough is it out there?   Looked like the wind got up?  
    PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, breezy, breezy‑ish.   Not hellishly tough.   3‑under was a decent score to be honest.   But as ever, as it's been for a while, should have been a bit less.  
   
 Q.   A venue you enjoy?   
    PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, Martin's obviously played with me every year apart from every year where my son played.   We've played a lot together and we are good friends.   We have a few business interests and he's one of my biggest sponsors, so we have a good laugh out there.  
   
 Q.   Special memories, as well, having won the tournament and also getting to play Carnoustie?  
    PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, well, a long time ago now.   Obviously I won the first one, and obviously I won The Open at Carnoustie; so two of the three courses I've won on.   So it's always nice to play in tournaments that you've got a decent record in.
