PAUL LAWRIE:  I played nicely today. I struggled yesterday, didn't play well at all but managed to get it round Carnoustie in level par which was a good effort. Today was the opposite. Tee to green was fantastic. Only hit a couple of shots which were  a bit ropey which over 18 holes is very good.
Q.  Birdies at 11th and 14th going out?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Little wedge to 20 feet on the 11th and holed that with a bit of break. Three putted the par five next which was disappointing and then birdied 14. Hit sand wedge to 10 feet behind the pin.
Q.  The three birdies in four holes from the third?
PAUL LAWRIE:  3rd hit five iron to five feet and missed it for eagle, lipped out.

4 - gap wedge to two feet

6 - drove it on the green and two putted.
Q.  Eagle on nine?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Hit a beautiful three iron to about three feet. Nice way to finish.

I have been trying to get things a little simpler this week and not have so much going on in my head, just stand up and hit it and today was great.
Q.  Short game was great?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Anytime I was hitting it off line I was chipping it stiff which is what you have to do to shoot that kind of score. You are not going to hit every shot perfect, now and again you have to recover which is what I did perfectly today.
Q.  Sitting nicely at seven under in the mix?
PAUL LAWRIE:  A good day tomorrow and you are right in there. I was five under at this stage when I won. I had a very good Saturday and Sunday last time so we can do it again. Tomorrow will be great fun and I am looking forward to it immensely.
