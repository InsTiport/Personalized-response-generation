PAUL LAWRIE: The first eight holes, my ball-striking was awful, but managed to kind of get it out in 1-under par, which is always a good sign.  I found something kind of walking to the 10th tee what I was doing and all of a sudden started hitting it pretty solid on the back nine and putted again very nicely.  I've been rolling the ball pretty good this week.
Q. Great putt on the last to finish off?
PAUL LAWRIE: Yeah, I holed that putt when I finished second here a few years ago, so I kind of knew roughly the kind of line of it.
I've holed a couple of those this week of that length, which I haven't been doing of late.  So it's always nice to roll in a long putt.
Q. Have to go low tomorrow to win here; do you think you're mentally there to do?
PAUL LAWRIE: Yeah, I mean, I kind of feel as though I found something on that back nine.  I've been not hitting it all that great this week but been putting nicely.  My short game's not been the best.
So when you're 16-under par and struggling a wee bit with your game, that's a hell of a good sign.  I need to head out a little better tomorrow and keep rolling the putts the way I've been.
Q. How were conditions?
PAUL LAWRIE: A little bit cooler.  A little bit of wind out there.  It was still fine.  It's not tough out there.  It's reasonably warm.  The ball is still flying a good distance.  The wind didn't affect it at all.
