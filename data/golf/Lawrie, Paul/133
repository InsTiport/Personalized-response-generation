Q. Not quite the same result as last year but how have things been going for you?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Played nicely today but just holed no putts at all, hit some good putts but none of them went in. I had chances on all of the last four holes and the last sort of summed up my day, hit a lovely second shot in to about ten feet, looking in good shape for making birdie and then the putt just dribbles left of the hole.

Q. Has that been the story of the week as a whole?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Not really, yesterday I putted quite nicely but didn't play that great but today it was just hellish on the greens which was annoying because I played lovely.

Q. Still get a special feeling coming back to Carnoustie?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Obviously the 18th now is playing straight down wind and I've hit driver, wedge which is kind of hard to get the same feeling as it was in the Open in 1999 but it is always nice to come back and play here, sure.

Q. You had a nice group as well?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Yes, we had a great time, great fun. I always enjoying playing with Martin (Gilbert) and Steve (Redgrave) was a nice guy and Niclas (Fasth) is a good guy to be around so we had a good time out there.

Q. Schedule for the rest of the year, playing next week?
PAUL LAWRIE:  No I'm off on holiday with the kids next week and then I think I'm playing Madrid, Italy and the Volvo Masters.

Q. Sum up the year so far?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Well, I'm 15th on the Order of Merit which is kind of a little disappointing which is a good thing to be disappointed when I am that high up. Could have been better, should have been better but we will see what happens the rest of the year. That should be the worst I can finish because I'm looking to have some good tournaments towards the end of the year and hopefully win one more before the season ends.
