Q.   First time on the links, did it go as expected? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   I played extremely well the first 15 holes, and missed just about everything and then finished 6, 3, 6 for 1‑under.   I played good enough to shoot 5‑ or 6‑under but shot 1.   A bit disappointed, but first round of the year, it's always a bit rusty and a bit scrappy.   You get what you get.

Q.   Tee‑to‑green were you pretty thorough? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, pretty good.   I had mud on my ball on 16 and it went left in the bushes and made 6. 
And I hit it off‑line in 18 in the tall grass, so that's stuff's pretty tough to get out of. 
So, overall, not that disappointed but should have been better.
