 Q.   Good finish, tough start?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   I played very good all day to be honest, even early on I hit a good tee shot off the first and it kind of went in that little pot bunker and I made a bogey.   
Then I hit a good shot at the second and missed it.   Then I hit a really good shot at the third, about a yard short and in the water.   3‑over after three, a bit frustrating.  
And then played nice, battled back, not that bad a score really.  
   
 Q.   How are the conditions?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Much tougher, obviously cooler.   The first bunker, only 247 to carry it and I hit driver.   I hit driver 280, downhill, too, so it was pretty breezy.   
Club selection, that shot at the third, 5‑iron, I have 163 to the wind, a little up the hill into the wind and I hit 5‑iron short.   Tough day but just have to battle away.   The guys that shoot under par today have obviously played very well because it's not easy out there.   
Good day tomorrow, you never know.
