 Q.   Can you talk about your round a little bit, please?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, first nine played pretty nice.   Played solid, and 1‑under par going out was about right.  
And then‑‑ I left it short but a little bit left off 10, but it was about five yards left and had a shocking lie and ended up three‑putting, which was a mistake, obviously.  
12, same thing, I hit 5‑iron and pulled it about two yards, and you can't go long left at that pin, so I made double there, which was another huge mistake.   I think 1‑over par today was a good effort.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   I would have said the front nine there was no hanging on.   I played quite nicely and had plenty of chances.   And then the last few holes again I had a few kind of chances to come in.   And 18 there, I was disappointed to miss that one.   I thought I would stick that right in the middle.   
Hanging on would be a bit harsh.   But the course is tough out there.   Even with no wind, the scoring is pretty high.   If we get a wee bit of breeze over the weekend, hopefully we can still be there.  
   
 Q.   Is it still too early to determine how much of a distance (inaudible).   
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, there's 36 holes to go, and obviously Brandt Snedeker has played phenomenal golf to be 10‑under par.   10‑under par is world class, to be fair.   You've got to keep going and keep grinding away and keep doing what you're doing.   And hopefully we have a couple of under‑par scores over the weekend, and I think you're in there roughly with a chance.  
   
 Q.   Someone said these conditions are Americanised.   
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, I suppose a wee bit, yeah.   You're not going to get it any calmer than it is these first two days.   We've personally had, if it's been a four‑ or five‑mile‑an‑hour wind, that's all we've had for two days.   It would be nice if it blew a little bit over the weekend, I think.   But this course is so severe, you don't want to any windier than what we've had it.   The course is pretty tough, as you can see by the scores.   If you put a bit of wind in there, it's going to be pretty tough.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, you've just got to keep going.   It was a good performance, to be fair.   My head was a wee bit scrambled, as you can imagine.   10, I didn't hit that bad a shot.   Three‑putted from eight feet there; I mean, it's just a shocker.   12, I've hit ‑‑ two yards I've hit that 5‑iron off line and I've made a double there.   So going down 13 my head was a wee bit scrambled.   And then I fatted my second shot there short of the green.   All kinds of stuff going on.   
To come out of that and play under par from that point and in, it was a good performance to be fair.   It sets you up and gives you an outside chance at the weekend.  
   
 Q.   How does it change your mindset knowing that Sunday might be 30‑mile‑an‑hour winds?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, again I didn't know that, but 30 mile an hour around here, the course is going to be pretty tough, as you can imagine.   We'll have to wait until that comes.   But when it does come, we've played in the wind before, you take a couple more clubs, you hit it a bit softer and the ball comes out a bit lower and it's fine hopefully.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, you would have, absolutely, of course you would have.   Apart from '99, I've not had any chance to win this tournament.   So to go into the weekend lying tied third, it's a good performance again, a nice run, so hopefully I can keep it going.  
   
 Q.   Is your confidence still high?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   Absolutely, yeah.   I think to make double at 10 and double at 12 and come back and play under par from there shows you I'm in a good place.  
   
 Q.   Did you happen to look at leaderboards out there?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   I look at leaderboards every hole, absolutely.   People who tell you they don't, I'm not so sure they're telling the truth.   They're quite big, as you maybe have seen.   They're quite hard not to look at them.   No, I'm a leaderboard looker.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, it shows you how tough the course is that we've had no wind at all.   There's been very little rain when we've played, apart from overnight.   The course is mega soft, and no one's really kind of having a go out there, because it's just so hard to get the ball in the fairway, and you've still got a 5‑iron or 4‑iron to the green at a par‑4 after a good 3‑wood.   The course is playing tough.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, it's just‑‑ no, it's just something that I look at them, I kind of look and obviously early on I couldn't quite believe that Brandt had got to 10‑under.   You can't underestimate how good that is.   But I'm a leaderboard looker.   I like to know where I am.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, to be fair, the first one was a wee bit downhill, a wee bit left‑to‑right, and I just pulled it and it kind of went off a wee bit and went down there.   And the second one was only two and a half feet or three feet, so it was a poor putt.   It was an up and out like last week.   I hit a lot of putts right last week, and the only one this week I've done is the second putt at 10.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, I'm putting nicely.   Yesterday obviously I had two chip‑ins and I holed one with the putter from off the green.   So that's going to make your stats look pretty good.   Even then, apart from 10, that's the only poor putts that I've had this week, so the putting has been much better.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   It's huge support out there for me which I'm not obviously used to.   So it's been quite nice.   People shouting your name, and obviously you're in contention and people want you to do well.   You're a British player and you're playing in the British Open.   No, it's been really nice.   Got huge support.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, yeah, no matter how many Opens you've played in and how many Opens you win, like Tiger, you still get nervous, you still get situations where you don't feel your best.   18th putt just then, kind of a wee bit of nerves in there and just hit it a smidgen too high.   You've got to handle them and you've got to deal with it.   
The fact that I've been in a good run helps.   If I was coming in here and it was the first good week for a long time I don't think I'd kind of be feeling as confident.   But there's 36 holes to go and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Any comparison between this week and '99 so far?  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Not really, because I was well behind.   Maybe not so much after two days, but I was ten shots back in '99 with a round to go.   What am I now, six shots at the moment.   So you're looking to claw a few of them back tomorrow and give yourself a chance.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, they've got the Royal Aberdeen Junior Open today and the they've got the Bayside (phon.)   Junior Medal tomorrow.   The course was playable yesterday.   They played the Medal yesterday.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE:   Right now there's no plans for them to come, no.
