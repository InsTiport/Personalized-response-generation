Q. Conditions early on this morning‑‑
PAUL LAWRIE:   I struggled a bit to be honest.   It was hard going. 

Q.   But 2‑over at the beginning of the day, with the history of this place, it's not a bad score really?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Scoring is pretty good.   2‑over‑‑ it's weird how the course is pretty tough, I can't believe how good the scoring is.   Going to go hit a few balls and try again tomorrow. 

Q.   6‑under is a hell of a score, isn't it?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, it's an incredible score.   There's guys at 4,5,3, Christ, the scoring is unbelievable.   I wasn't expecting that around here.   In the practice rounds, I thought the course was pretty severe setup. 

Q.   Talking about your putting, how was that?
PAUL LAWRIE:   It was all right today.   Not great but all right.   I played poorly tee‑to‑green.   Hit a lot of really, really poor shots today, so 2‑over was about right to be fair. 

Q.   What are you going to work on this afternoon? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Going to hit a few balls and work on a few things.   I hit it left today and really struggled off the tee. 

Q.   With the putting, struggling with your putting, were your expectations sort of high this morning? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, I take it one shot at a time.   How you play is how you play and what your score is what your score is.   Have a good week is all you're trying to do.   You're not thinking about winning or making cuts.   You just try to play one shot at a time. 

Q.   If there was one part of your game that was pleasing, what was it? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   I struggled kind of all day with everything.   2‑over was a decent score.
