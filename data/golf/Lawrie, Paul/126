Q. A bit of an up-and-down day then?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Well, yes. I didn't get off to the best of starts. I didn't actually hit that bad a shot off the tenth but it bounced right and went in the hazard and then on the grass in the hazard and I hit in the hazard with my second shot and made double and I didn't hit a good shot at the next but it was plugged under the lip and made bogey there. Three over after two, not what you're looking for. But then I got it going a little and almost hit it stiff with a three wood at the 13th but I made a poor bogey at the 16th, hit it right off the tee and couldn't get it up and down.
Q. Was it a case of when it was good it was very good, but when it was badÃ¢ï¿½ ¦.?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Well, that is the way it is with me. It is either brilliant or not very good and that is why I am trying to get more consistency into my game.
Q. Disappointed with the sixth?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Well, I tried to hit a little cut off that tee and I hit a snap hook. It is strange for me because I have been hitting that little cut well but it was the opposite shot which came out.
Q. Do you see today as an opportunity missed or that you got away with it?
PAUL LAWRIE: Well, I think any time you shoot double bogey, bogey to start and end up with level par, you have to be happy. It is a different kind of happy. Yesterday I played well and shot low, today was level par but it could have been higher.
Q. Nice to make birdie at the last?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Yes, I hit a nice putt there. It was a little downhill sneaky one but I managed to squeeze it in.
Q. But you are still right in it?
PAUL LAWRIE:  Well, I need two good days now. Obviously I am going to be four or five shots behind, maybe more, but you can still do it if you play well at the weekend.
Q. Are you going to do a lot of work this afternoon?
PAUL LAWRIE:  No, I'll hit a bucket of balls with Adam this afternoon because I knew from where it came from today. No problem.
