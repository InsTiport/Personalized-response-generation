PAUL LAWRIE: I was 4-under today, similar story.  Struggled a wee bit with ball-striking and holed quite a few putts again today.  Just one or two short it would seem but much better week for me.  Obviously I've not had a great season.  I've been injured a wee bit again, so to come here and shoot 20-under is a good week.
Q. Must be lots of positives to take out of it?
PAUL LAWRIE: Huge amount of positives, yeah.  Obviously I was looking to win because when you give yourself a chance, you want to win when you're in contention, but Sully played lovely and made loads of birdies.  It's nice to see PÃ¡draig obviously back up there, too.
For me it's a good week and full of positives.  Need to just hit it a little bit better.  But putting good and that's a huge positive.
