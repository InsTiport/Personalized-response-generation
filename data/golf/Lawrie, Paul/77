  PAUL LAWRIE:   I played nicely today.   Thomas obviously didn't play his best, we know how good he can play at times but he struggled a wee bit which made the score look better than it was.   I played very solid and did what I had to do and hit the ball on the greens quite a lot.   It was a good day.

Q.   With all of these different rounds to play, I guess you have to get your timing right, and seems it's coming right for you. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   I struggled at the start of the week, and you see that quite a lot over the years where people struggle at the start and they get better and better, and hopefully that will be the case.   But this afternoon, have a match again, and 36 holes on a course that's hilly‑‑ but after last week, no problem. 

Q.   Retief Goosen, doesn't get any easier. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, he's obviously a world‑class player, two majors to his name. 

Q.   You've always been a great player in the wind and rain and looks like you're going to get that this afternoon. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   I don't know that anybody wants that to be fair but when it comes, it's like back home, just got to deal with it.

Q.   Between now and this afternoon, what will you do?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Now I'm going to go have a bite of lunch, have a bite to eat, and I'll hit a few balls.
