Q.   How proud to have won your point? 
MARC WARREN:   Very proud, coming up a great player like ThorbjÃ¸rn, I knew it was going to be a tough match and kind of turned out that way.   Threw a few birdies at them and it was nice to finish with that eagle.

Q.   How special to have been captained by a fellow Scot, Sam Torrance, a legend? 
MARC WARREN:   Yeah, all the stories; I worked with his dad, Bob, for a few years, all the stories from his dad and all the stories about previous Ryder Cup that Sam's played in.   It's been a great learning experience playing under him as captain, and even the teammates, as well.   Had a great laugh this week and can't wait to get back out on the course and support the guys.

Q.   A bit of Seve‑magic at the end, how was your game? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Seve would have holed that.   That's how good Seve was.   But that's good fun.   I played nicely.   Was pretty much up all day, which is always a good feeling.   But played some nice golf out there.   But it was a good game.   It was friendly, of course, Mikko is a good guy and had a great season, so it was a good win for me.

Q.   You were towards the back end of the field, when you were looking up at the scoreboard during the day, did you think it might come down to you or that you definitely had to win the point? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   I had to make sure that I got that to give Chris Wood a chance to tie things up.   Looks like he's our saviour at the moment, so he's a couple down. 
So I had to keep going.   If I had lost even half a point, it would have meant we had no chance.   You want to be in that situation; you play this game for a reason, you want to be in pressure situations and it's always good when you come through.
