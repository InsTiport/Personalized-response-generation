PAUL LAWRIE: No, you can move the ball fine.  Plenty of guys these days, Bubba moves the ball quite a lot in the wind and whatever.  And I don't think moving the ball is any tougher here than anywhere else, though.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE: Well, it's a tough day and it's a tough course.  The fairway bunkers around here are still some of the best we've ever seen them, and they're all in play off the tee.  So if you want to play safe, you're going to have a long shot in and it's tough.  And if you want to take it on, you hit a poor shot and you're in the bunker, then you're dropping a shot.  So it's a good test out there.  You've got to play half decent.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE: I played -- no, I played Tuesday Morning and Wednesday afternoon and the wind was opposite way both times.  But that doesn't matter.  You can adapt.  You can change.  You know exactly what it's going to do and you know where the wind is coming from, so that's not a secret.  If you play all right.  You can score.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE: You mean when I won or -- well, Carnoustie the rough was just -- the rough was obviously very thick that week and the fairways were not.  And whereas here it's not as bad here as it was that week.  It's a tough test and you've got to play well.  But if you do play well you can get around here with a decent number.  But if you struggle it's a proper test out there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PAUL LAWRIE: No, it's tough because the fairway bunkers are all in play.  If you take a shot at them you get in with a long club, and it's pretty breezy, pretty blowy out there.  So it's a proper golf course on a windy day.
