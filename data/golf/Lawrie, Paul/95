Q.   Tell us about the putt on 18. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Nice, I had 3‑wood up the hill, hit a nice shot, just trying to keep it around the pin and holed about a 40‑footer I would say.   Very unusual but nice to hole a putt of that length, nice way to finish the day.

Q.   7‑under for the championship after 12 holes of today's round and 5‑under for the last six; what was behind that run?
PAUL LAWRIE:   I played good all day.   Yesterday I really struggled, hit the ball awful off the tee yesterday but today was like the first day, got it going and just couldn't get the ball in the hole the first 10, 12 holes and all of a sudden just started rolling the ball in the middle of the hole. 

Q.   You said the other day you're hitting more balls at 42 than you've ever hit; what's fueling that desire?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, don't know.   I've never really been lazy.   I'm always someone who has practised hard and done the work but this last little while, I just thought if I'm going to step up, I'm going to work a bit harder. 
Tomorrow, looking forward to it, huge tournament.   Looks like Alvaro is going to be at least three ahead, if he pars in.   So big test but looking forward to it. 

Q.   Excellent way to finish an excellent round, tell us how difficult it was playing today. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, I hit it a lot better again today.   I hit it poorly yesterday, but that was back to how I played on Thursday. 
So hit some nice shots and when you hit nice shots, you kind of get rewarded.   If you struggle a bit, it's hard to get the ball near the pin.   And obviously to finish off the last was a bonus.   Just hit 3‑wood right at the pin, and holed a long putt, great way to finish.

Q.   Except for Alvaro, there are not much moves on the leaderboard and looks like you're going to be three shots behind him.   How aggressive will you go tomorrow?
PAUL LAWRIE:   Obviously it's a great effort from Alvaro today.   He was four ahead teeing off and I think he's 3‑under for the day.   He's three ahead so he's obviously played nicely.   He played well last week and had a poor last round.   So he'll be looking to put that right tomorrow, so looking forward to it. 

Q.   You must be excited about tomorrow now, this finish? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, yeah, it's one day at a time.   It's the old clichÃ©.   There's not much you can do but looking forward to what it's going to be.   Hopefully I can play the same as I did the first day and today and take my chances.

Q.   The actual tournament is on, but the actual Race to Dubai, looks like Luke has sealed that up. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   They have got their own little battle going on and so do other people. 

Q.   You're playing for yourself, aren't you. 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, it's my job to play as well as I can and get the ball in the hole as least as I can and see what happens.

Q.   Did you work on your putting last night?
PAUL LAWRIE:   I hit loads of driver.   I only hit driver on the range.   I drove the ball awful yesterday, one of the worst kind of driving exhibitions.   So I hit a couple of buckets of balls and didn't leave here until it was dark and played a lot better today.

Q.   What's the report from the boys after reading the papers? 
PAUL LAWRIE:   Well, they were chuffed.   Any time you see your name in the papers, it's always good, if you're that age.
