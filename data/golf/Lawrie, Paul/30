  PAUL LAWRIE:   Yeah, very happy obviously.   I started bogey, bogey today, so any time you start bogey, bogey and shoot 4â€‘under, it's got to be a good day.   I hit the ball extremely well, had loads of chances, could have been a few less but happy enough.   
   
 Q.   Was it just a matter of not getting into the rhythm?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   I hit a nice shot at the first and went into the fringe and managed to take three from 20 feet from the pin which is unusual for me.   Second I hit a poor shot off the tee way right to the sand and didn't have a shot to the sand and made a bogey there.   After that, didn't hit many poor shots.   
   
 Q.   There are a lot of low scores at the moment, any surprise to you?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   No, the course is in such good condition and the greens are perfect; if you get the ball on the green and you've got a decent stroke, it's possible to hole a few putts.   I holed a few myself today.   Once you get the ball on the green and get it rolling, they are to go going in.   
   
 Q.   What do you think you have to shoot to have a chance for the title?   
PAUL LAWRIE:   One less than the next guy.   No idea; who knows.   It's normally sort of about 18 or 19, probably a bit less this year because the course is excellent.
