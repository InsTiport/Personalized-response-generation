  PAUL LAWRIE: 2-putt birdies at the par 5s, a 3-footer at the eighth and an 8-footer at 12, and that was it, played lovely.  Decent score to be fair. I stretched quite a lot last night and stretching early this morning.  It's fine, not 100 per cent, but not a problem.  I stretched it this morning and never felt it really when I played.  Swung within myself.  When it gets like that, you just have to take a little power off it and chip it down there, which I did all day.   Q.  You said you were feeling as good as you have for 18 months?  PAUL LAWRIE: Yeah, and yesterday in the Pro-Am I hurt my groin early on and struggled a wee bit for six or seven holes.  Wasn't an issue today.  I know what to do, groin and lower right back, kind of struggled a bit, but it's fine.   Q.  Taking power off sometimes helps?  PAUL LAWRIE: That's kind of how I play better anyway.  I swing within myself all the time.  Very seldom hit a shot full out so when something like that happens, it's actually a good thing for me.  I kind of don't jump at it and just swing normal.
