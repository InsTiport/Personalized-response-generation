  Q. How did it go out there?  
 MICHAEL MILES: Great day. Shot even par and played really solid.  
  
  Q. How does it feel to be even par in your first PGA Championship?  
 MICHAEL MILES: It feels really good. I've been playing that way, so I kind of expected something. I thought 3-under was a pretty good score today. That was kind of my target score. But I'll take even par. Yeah, I'm pretty happy.  
  
  Q. Is this one of the longer courses you've played?  
 MICHAEL MILES: Yeah, it's very long. It got a little short today. The fairways firmed up. So that helped a lot. And they were a little bit helpful on a couple of tees. But it's a very long course, especially if it rains and it's wet.
