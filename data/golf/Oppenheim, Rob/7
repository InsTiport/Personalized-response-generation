 Q.  The last time most golf fans heard of Rob Oppenheim they said, that's the guy who didn't think he made it and he did.  Now they get to see you in the second event of the season right near the lead.  
ROB OPPENHEIM: Yeah, it's a great start.   
Just looking for any opportunity I could get, and this is my second event.  To get off to a good start, 5-under, yeah, it's exciting.   
 Q.  What were the keys to your round today, aside from avoiding any bogeys?  
ROB OPPENHEIM: Yeah, bogey-free is always a good way to start.  Just played consistent.  A lot of fairways, greens, made five birdies.   
Just a solid day.  We were lucky the weather held up and was pretty calm out there on the Seaside course.  The wind can blow, so took advantage of the good conditions.   
 Q.  Coming through the Web.com Tour and seeing the stacked field here, probably nothing new for you.  Doesn't phase you, does it?  
ROB OPPENHEIM: I think I was playing under so much pressure at the end of the year being on the bubble the last few Web events and the then the playoffs, I'm just excited to play and pretty happy to be here.   
The stage is a lot bigger, but still golf.  Like I said, I'm as excited as anyone to be here playing.
