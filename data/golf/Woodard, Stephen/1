Q. Talk about the match.
STEPHEN WOODARD: It was a really good match because we were making birdies, and that's what you want in those matches.
We both played well.  I enjoyed it.  It was a good match.  Came down to the last hole.  I had a chance, so that's all you can ask for when you start the day.
Q. And then 15 you birdie to go 1-up.
STEPHEN WOODARD: Yeah, we both had almost the same distance putts on 15.  He hit a great putt, and then I made about probably a ten-footer to go 1-up.
We both had birdie putts on 16; judge missed.
17 is where it got interesting.  We actually had to get the official to see who was away.  We were about probably seven or eight feet each, and he made a birdie first and I had a putt to tie and just lipped it out.
Then I was in the center of the fairway on 18 and just didn't close it out.  Yeah, so...
Q. Overall, what has this whole experience meant to you?
STEPHEN WOODARD: It's been awesome.  I mean, it's really been sentimental, emotional, fun, relaxing, too because playing two golf courses that I don't have to stress about learning.
Then again, to look around and see so many friends and family you want to win for them and for yourself as well.  It's just been an awesome week.  I'm just so proud of both these two courses.
