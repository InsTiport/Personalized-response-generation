Q.  I know you had, were minus 4 going into the last hole.  But probably not the way you wanted to finish up.  But what do you think?
MARK JAMES:  Well, I attacked off the tee.  I felt there was more to gain than lose by making a birdie.  So it was close to being in the fairway and just took a hard right.  So it goes.  I played pretty well.  Didn't putt great.  But played all right.
Q.  Are you glad they decided to go ahead to play today or would you have rather to get home last night?
MARK JAMES:  Well, no, I was lying about 11th at the start of the day, so I still done myself some good.
