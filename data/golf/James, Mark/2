 Q.   Talk about the course.   
MARK JAMES:   The course in general I like.   I think in this wind it gets a little difficult.   It becomes too difficult to get the ball into the compartments of the greens where the pins are.   So that make it's really, really difficult.   You're facing 30 footers with a lot of break and a difficult pace a lot of the time.   
But overall I like the course.   And my game is average, missed too many putts.   But four rounds here, so I can make headway.  
   
 Q.   Talk about going into tomorrow.   Any lessons learned from today?  
MARK JAMES:   Well if the wind stays in this direction I'll have definitely, I'll be able to cope with it a little better.   But there's just a lot of holes out there which are just playing difficult.   So there's a limited amount that you can learn, you just have to probably play better.
