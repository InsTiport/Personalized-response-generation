Q.   Talk about your round today. 
MARK JAMES:   I made a couple of birdies and I got a little bit lucky.   I hit a good shot at 6 ‑‑ or 5, but I dropped one at 6. 
But I birdied 7 and 8. 
Poor tee shot at 9 that I sort of got away with it.   So, yeah, a few birdies on the card, but I was a little fortunate over the later holes, so, yeah, it's a nice finish.

Q.   With the conditions today versus yesterday is it a tale of two courses?
MARK JAMES:   Very much so.   And I think that I got way, way the best of the weather.   It's obviously it's quite a difference, but that back nine was virtually no wind or what there was was really nothing but a zephyr, really. 
So it was definitely two different courses.   The pins are still tough, it's no push over when there's no wind on this course, but, yeah, it was a lot easier today.
