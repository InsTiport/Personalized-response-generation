Q.
It was tough out there, tell us about it?
MARK JAMES:  It was horribly tough.  The pins are tough, tees are barely moved forward.  There's rough.  It's blowing a gale.  A lot of guess work involved.  Wind up and down.  Really, really tough.
Q.  17, that took the cake.  You hit a great shot to the middle of the green, trickled over the back.  Watson kind of hit a little duff down there, hopped the bunker, up there to five feet.  But you made your par and that's the way this golf course plays, you got to hang in there, drive the ball well, get it on the green and make the putts when you can.
MARK JAMES:  Yeah, you got to do all you can.  It feels like you're not getting the most out of it, but obviously everyone had trouble.  It's sort    it's really a difficult course anyway.  But you have to hit the fairway if you can.  But I think the big thing is keeping it out of big trouble.  If there is gorse one side, just edge the other way.  And missing a green, if it's really bad up one side, just try to keep it safe and hope my short game is reasonable.  And it wasn't bad, not bad at all.
Q.  You're enjoying this senior stage, especially these Majors.  You got a couple coming up, you had a few of late, you're game's in good shape.  Tell us how do you feel with it?  Where is your game at?
MARK JAMES:  It was poor a couple of weeks ago in Detroit for the Players.  I didn't defend particularly well at all.  And I just went, ended up playing rubbish.  So I'm pleased to play better this week or today I'm pleased.  And my short game is reasonable.

So my game's okay and I would like the wind to be less.  I'm a good player in a breeze, but only fair in a wind this strong.
