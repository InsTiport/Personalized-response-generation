Q. Pleased with that start?
MARK JAMES:  Yes ,and it was a little easier this afternoon.  We had a really good draw I think. I didn't play great but not too bad either, hit a few good shots but it still wasn't easy. I hit a couple of three putts but that's the way it goes.
Q. Glad to get back in action?
MARK JAMES: Yes, I was a little bit creaky over the past couple of days in practice but it was better today. Hit quite a few good shots but still a couple of very poor ones so I need to get rid of them. There was a bit of all sorts in there. I hit a few good drives but other places it was here and there, overall it was nearly all right.
Q. Difference from last week in the commentary box?
MARK JAMES: That is much easier, commentating is a lot easier than that today. It can be hard work as well but it is easier. You still need to concentrate, because you can't come out with certain things. I do enjoy the commentary though, very much but playing is still the main thing for me.
