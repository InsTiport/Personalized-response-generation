  Q. So how do you summarize your first experience here?  
 KEVIN ROMAN: Obviously played very poorly. Kind of embarrassed. But it was a great week. The people from Minnesota are phenomenal.   
  
  Q. What do you take away from this, then, going forward?  
 KEVIN ROMAN: You know, I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't nervous. I know that championship golf is something I don't play and I need to learn how to play.  
  
  Q. Would this be the toughest course you've ever played?  
 KEVIN ROMAN: Yeah, it was pretty tough. The wind today was very, very tough. Major, you just have tough golf. It was very good.
