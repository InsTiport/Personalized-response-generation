 Q. How was your first PGA experience?
 KEVIN ROMAN: It was great. The guys I played with were great. I was just trying to get out of their way as much as I could the last nine holes.

 Q. With it being your first PGA experience, can you talk about the week and how everything led up to this and also talk about tomorrow a little bit? 
 KEVIN ROMAN: I'm good at looking forward to tomorrow even though this one is already over. I've always been good at that. Another five minutes, I'll be all right. Everything has been great. I've played with a lot of great players and everything has been good this week. The rough just kills me. 

 Q. The one thing I want to ask you about, I saw you have 14 holes-in-one; is that correct? How many years does that span and when was your most recent one?
 KEVIN ROMAN: My recent one was a couple of years ago. My first one was 13; so 28 years. Long time.
