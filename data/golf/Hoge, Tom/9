Q. Tom, great round of golf, clean card out there.  How difficult were conditions to keep the card clean because I know some guys with some low scores had a couple bogies in spots?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, you know, it was perfect the first 11, 12 holes we played.  It was soft with no wind.  You had to get after it because there were a lot of birdies to be made.
Q. Looks like you took advantage of the soft conditions.  Without the wind there, does it make this golf course, I won't say easier, but more playable?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, for sure.  It's meant to play firm.  With the rain yesterday it was soft enough where could you hit it in there, play for too big of a bounce.  The fairways are pretty generous, I think.  You get it in the fairway and with no wind and soft you can fire right at it pretty good.
Q. What does do for you and your confidence because I know it's been a struggle for you this season.
TOM HOGE: It's been a little bit off, different part of the game each week.  I've been looking forward to Colonial.  I live in Fort Worth, a little bit outside there.  I'm trying to play well and get my way in.  It's been a little bit of motivation for me last few weeks to work hard and try to get in there.
