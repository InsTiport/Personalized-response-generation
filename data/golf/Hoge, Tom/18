Q. Well, clean scorecard with all the birdies on there.  Got to feel good about that.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, it was a nice start to the day.  With the weather forecast didn't know how much we would play.  Just tried to make the most out of every hole that I had today.  Yeah, nice no bogeys.  First time in a while for that to happen.
Q. Yeah, four birdies on your front nine and two on your back nine, which is the front nine on the Sea Side course.  Just talk about one of those big par saves out there you had where it kept the momentum going for you.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, really only missed a couple greens today, but both par-3s on the back nine I hit a little long.  Tough up and downs.  Luckily I was able to him them up to about six, seven feet and make those couple putts.  Just big for the momentum.
Keep them going and was able to get a couple more birdies after that.  So nice way to close out the round.
Q. You mentioned what you were expecting weather-wise and if we were going to get it in today.  How did you feel when it got pretty docile out there, particularly towards the end of the round?  No wind.  Seemed pretty calm.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, it was great.  After the Monday finishes last few years, to be able to play a round with no delays it was nice to have some rhythm and keep it going out there.
Q. Look at the scoreboard, the leaderboard, there are a lot of guys in that neighborhood of 6-under par there.  Got to feel very confident going into tomorrow.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, it's a good start.  Long ways to go.  If I can just keep hitting the ball like that I'll be in good shape.
