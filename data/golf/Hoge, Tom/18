 Q.  (No Microphone.)  
TOM HOGE: Yeah, no real secret out there, just kept it in the fairway, that was the key out there.  The rough was pretty nasty.  So luckily I drove it really well.  Then on the North Course you get a few opportunities from there.   
 Q.  In your opinion, is it good to get that one, a good one on the North Course and then go to the South Course tomorrow?  
TOM HOGE: Definitely.  Any time you start making bogeys you feel pressure because birdies are so hard to find on the South Course.  So hopefully it will be a little more relaxed, but the key is getting it in play off the tee and getting it in the fairway because that rough is nasty.   
 Q.  Tell me about the round.  
TOM HOGE: Played pretty nice, but driving is the key.  Kept it in play on the North Course.  Had some opportunities from there.   
 Q.  Do you like playing that North Course first and South second or makes no difference?  
TOM HOGE: It was a little bit nice getting on the North Course so you could have some birdie opportunities, now going to the South Course tomorrow I'll have momentum going.   
 Q.  And you know the greens a little bit, too.  How are you on the poa annua?  
TOM HOGE: Yeah, luckily putted okay today.  The key is getting in the fairway because that rough is nasty, to have any chance out there, you got to be in the fairway.
