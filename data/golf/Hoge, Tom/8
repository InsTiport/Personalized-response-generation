Q. 13 points in your opening round.  What went well for you out there today?
TOM HOGE: I hit it really well.  Had a lot of looks.  Felt like I left a few out there with some putts but had a good start.
Q. Eagle on 8.  Talk about that.
TOM HOGE: It was a tough pin over there kind of right front of the bunker.  Got lucky.  Hit it up the left side, caught the slope, came down 15 feet or so and made a good putt there.
Q. Made a good chance for eagle on the last two.  Did you know where you stood?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, I knew I was having a good day but so early in the tournament, you just try to make every shot you can but a long ways to go here.  So I have to make a lot of birdies.
Q. Two top 10s at this event.  Are you a fan of this format?
TOM HOGE: Yeah.  I like the format a lot.  Kind of suits me well because I've always made a lot of birdies and bogeys.  And you don't get punished as much for bogeys here I which suits me a little bit, but I like the golf course and I like the area a lot too.  So happy to be here.
Q. How about the elevation, does that affect your game at all?
TOM HOGE: There's a lot of numbers that go into every shot.  But especially with the wind today, it got pretty tough.  But we managed it pretty well and for the most part kept it in pretty good spots.
Q. For players sitting inside the top 200 for the FedEx Cup rankings, how important is this event as we go to Wyndham?
TOM HOGE: And for me, I'm a ways back, I think I'm 170 or something.  I know I've got to have two good weeks and try and finish up there pretty high because I need a lot of points there.
