Q. Tom Hoge, that was an incredible 67.  Talk a little about how you felt about your day.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, it was kind of the tale of two days.  We got off to the start with no wind at all in the first six holes and I was able to take advantage of those with some about birdies.  The wind kicked up on 16 from us, and I kind of tried to hang on from there.  Scraped out a few pars.  I was up in the rocks, and luckily made a few putts to keep it going.
Q. You're looking like you can be only a few shots off the lead.  Obviously, you're pretty happy to be done right now?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, definitely.  With the wind coming up, I'm happy to be in the clubhouse and see what happens.
Q. Are you going to do any practice?
TOM HOGE: Probably not a lot of practice.  Probably head back and watch some football this afternoon.
Q. The guy who has turned in the round of the day so far, Tom Hoge.  How did you put together such a nice number?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, I got off to a good start there.  Three birdies off the bat with no wind out there.  The wind kicked up, and it was playing hard to get the fairway.  Hard to make the putts.
Q. You attack the course early knowing the wind was coming?
TOM HOGE: You know, I was very surprised (indiscernible) from the start.  I made some birdies, and I had a few chances, couple nice par saves.
Q. Compared to years past (indiscernible)?
TOM HOGE: Yeah, you know, you're used to having to make a lot of birdies here.  But I kind of like it.  Growing up in Texas, I kind of got used to it.
