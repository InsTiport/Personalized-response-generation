Q. Notoriously the toughest of the three you guys have to play this week, that's a really good round, in fact birdied four of your last six holes, finished at 6-under. Good start.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, I was a little bit sloppy there early on and then started hitting it better the end of the round. So made a few putts, nice way to finish.
Q. Talk about the one you just made at 18, that was a good putt -- excuse me the 9th hole, your 18th, but a good finish.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, really tough pin there too, kind of up in the top left, had to use the slope playing it left of the hole, but nice 10-footer up the hill and the course is in such perfect shape, you get those putts going on the right line they're going to go in.
Q. Some of the guys who played last week are just talking about it, it's just so nice to come out with calm conditions, the sun's out, how much of an adjustment is that for you guys, because you played well last week?
TOM HOGE: Yes, it's nice to see the sun here this week, yeah, it's been great. But for me it helped a little bit because I was a little bit rusty at the start of the year, not quite hitting the shot shapes right. But the wind helped me last week, kind of brought the focus in a little bit. And this week's all about making birdies, so get it on the greens and try to make a few putts.
Q. How much do you have to think about that? Do you ever look at the scoreboard and go, geez, there's somebody like 9-under par, 10-under, you know 25-, 26- is probably going to be the number.
TOM HOGE: Yeah, starting on the Stadium Course, and I was later off the tee times, you look up and you're five back right off the start there. So it's a little bit of an adjustment but just try and be patient and you know you're going to make some birdies out there for sure.
