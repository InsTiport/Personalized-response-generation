 Q.  I know you got to be happy with that round today.  
TOM HOGE: Yeah.  I got off to a slow start there, quite a few bogies off the start.  So I just kind of hung in there and the two birdies at the end was real nice way to finish.   
 Q.  What about that shot on 9 there, the approach?  You stuck it pretty close.  
TOM HOGE: Yeah.  That was the shot of the day for sure.  Made a nice putt on the 8th and probably 30 feet.  Nice to get some rhythm going there at the end.   
 Q.  Tom, just talk about no bogies yesterday.  Like you say, how were you able to overcome that stretch that you had?  
TOM HOGE: I knew it was a hard golf course.  I saw the scores weren't really moving that much.  I tried to hang in there.  At some point for the 72 hole tournament I would have a stretch like that having problems getting it in the fairway.  Luckily I made a few par saving putts, luckily found a few birdies at the end.   
 Q.  When you're out there today and really the last guy off, people are going home, is it kind of unique in that you're almost playing by yourself and here you are you're one shot off the lead with really no one was there to watch your last two holes?  
TOM HOGE: Yeah, especially on the back-9 was the front-9.  There's really nobody out there.  But such a nice night, it was pretty nice out there.   
 Q.  How often do you feel now because I know you felt good yesterday and as you said you make a move on the leader, it looked like he was going to be up there for awhile and now you're going to be in that final group tomorrow.  
TOM HOGE: Yeah, unexpected for sure from the way I started off.  Like I said, I've just been trying to play some good rounds.  Wherever that puts me, I'll take it.  A good start.  Happy to hang this there.   
 Q.  When you're in the final group do you feel any pressure for that as you tee it up here tomorrow?  
TOM HOGE: Yeah, it's different for sure.  There's no ignoring that.  Last time I was in this position I was with Tiger out at Wyndham.  That threw me into the fire for sure.  Hopefully it will be a little easier.   
 Q.  Have you ever played with Daniel before?  
TOM HOGE: I have a couple times.  We both came out of the Web at the same time and played a few times in our first efforts on the PGA TOUR.   
 Q.  What you've seen from him is not surprising.  
TOM HOGE: Yeah.  He's a good player and got a lot of confidence.  When he gets clicking he's going to go low, for sure.   
 Q.  You told us yesterday you weren't going to allow yourself to get too caught up because it was just day one.  Do you allow yourself to think a little bit more or, again, it's so much golf left to play?  
TOM HOGE: There's still a long ways to go and looking at the scoring briefly, guys are so bunched up that you really got to go out and play well for two more days or you're going to get lapped.
