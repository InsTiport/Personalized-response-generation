Q. Tom, you're on 21 points.  You've had two top-10s around this course in the past.  What is it about this course that suits your game so well?
TOM HOGE: I think that I just try to get in the fairway.  And there's a lot of opportunities from there with short irons, you can get to all the par-5s, some drivable par-4s.  It's a fun golf course to play and fun format.  I enjoy the week.
Q. You've been in a similar position before outside the top 125 with just a few weeks left.  What did you learn from those experiences that maybe will help you this week and the tournament?
TOM HOGE: In the past, I've been 130, 140.  I felt more pressure to play well.  It's almost a little bit easier being 170 this week, because I know I have to finish pretty close to first or second or right up there.
So just gotta go out play well and that will take care of itself.  My focus has been trying to win this week and we'll see where it falls.
Q. You've played a lot of events, your 31st event this year.  How do you manage your time?  Do you change your preparation (indiscernible) such a long year?
TOM HOGE: The last month or two, I don't know how many in a row this is, but just trying to take a few more days off earlier in the week and just rest a little bit, so come Saturday, Sunday there's a little more energy there.  It's been a long year, I would have liked to take a few weeks off, but I'm really starting to play my best golf, (indiscernible) the last few weeks.
Q. What was it that you did particularly well today?
TOM HOGE: The last two days I've really driven it well, and that set up a lot of opportunities.  A little bit frustrated with my putting to this point.  I had a lot of looks, but hopefully I'll figure that out here this afternoon, go practice and get a few more in.
Q. And coming down at the end, you finished on the front nine with a bogey in the par-5 eighth.  Can you just talk us through that a little bit?  What happened there?
TOM HOGE: I was in the fairway and just pulled it left, (indiscernible) the green.  It's just kind of a tough third shot, going over the hill and downhill to the pin and left it on top.  It's a tough putt, I three-putted from there.
Twenty-two points there with seven holes to go.  Would like to have a few more there, but a lot of golf left.
