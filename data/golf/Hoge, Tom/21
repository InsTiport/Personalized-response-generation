 Q. Tom, just talk a little bit about the day and what it was like out there.  
TOM HOGE: It was a blast. Obviously a lot different than any other I played in. It was fun to be there with Tiger, guy I looked up to growing up. Final group with him on a weekend and I played all right. Liked a few shots better. We're in good position tomorrow to have to try and go out and have a good day.  
   
 Q. Good learning experience for you heading forward?  
TOM HOGE: Definitely. Just get back in there and kind of handle things I need to handle.  
   
 Q. Tom, was it anything like you've ever experienced before doing that?  
TOM HOGE: No. It was crazy but it was great. Everybody was out there so supportive. The fans were awesome. Just gives me that drive to work harder and be back here and hopefully being in this position again.  
   
 Q. How was he playing?  
TOM HOGE: Striping it all day, tee shots off the tee. Every driver hammered down the middle. Thought he was hitting it good.  
   
 Q. Was it imagined what you thought it would be like or different?  
TOM HOGE: Pretty much -- I mean I felt a little better than I thought I would. I was probably a nervous off the start, you could probably tell. I settled into it the 6th, 7th hole. Like to make a few more putts.
