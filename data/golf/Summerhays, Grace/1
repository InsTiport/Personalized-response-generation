 Q.  So the championship kind of starts over at match play.  How did it feel coming into today?  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: It was good.  It went a little bit better today than I played in stroke play.  Felt good to play kind of a different format.  Match play is kind of its on challenge.   
 Q.  Have you played much match play before?  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: Yeah, I have.   
 Q.  Do you like the format?  Does it suit your game?  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: Yeah, I like the format.  I think you have to strategize, but then at the same time you have to play your own game and kind of whoever plays better is most likely going to win.   
 Q.  So you've played a few rounds here now.  How does the course suit you?  Do you like it?  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: Yeah, I think it's a really good driving course, which I like my driver a lot, so I think that's really good.   
And then I think the slopes on the greens, you have to be pretty precise where you hit it.  I like that because you have to hit pretty good shots in order to be rewarded.   
 Q.  Out here on the range already.  What is your plan for the rest of the afternoon?  Are you getting tired at all?  It's a lot of golf in one week.  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: Yeah.  No, I think I'm just going to practice a little bit and then go home and kind of chill, get ready for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Anything your caddie help you out with today?  
GRACE SUMMERHAYS: Yeah, he helped me with a lot green reading.  I think that's pretty important out here, especially as the greens get a little bit faster as the week goes on.  I think that's pretty important.   
And then we kind of just bounce off each other like where to hit it in the fairway and stuff like that.
