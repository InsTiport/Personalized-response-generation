 Q.  Birdie birdie finish for a nice finish overall?  
ROMAIN WATTEL: It feels very good.  Very happy to finish the tournament like this.  In the first round, I was almost on the same spot after my drive, after my tee shot, and I put it in the water.  I was very upset, and when I came back to almost the same position today, I thought, okay, what do we do.  We lay up or we go for the green, and I hit a very good shot.   
So I'm very happy to finish with two birdies.   
 Q.  It looked like it could even have been better, every day you've been moving forward until something happens?  
ROMAIN WATTEL: That's the same for everybody.  We all make mistakes, so at the end of the day, the winner is the one that makes less mistakes.  I'm happy I played this tournament.  I think I managed to keep focused and just trust myself when I had to, so I'm happy with it.   
 Q.  Getting a good finish here tends to be more significant than other places in terms of money, points, prestige of the tournament.  
ROMAIN WATTEL: Yeah, that's the biggest tournament of our season.  So for us, it's a very important one.  I never played very good in Wentworth.  I like the place.  I like the venue.  I like everything.  I'm happy at least this year to make the Top-10 and to play as I wanted.
