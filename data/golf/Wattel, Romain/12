 Q.   What are your thoughts on 5‑under par around a tough golf course?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, that's a really tough golf course.   I just tried to play solid today.   That's a good test all the time, Abu Dhabi, so really pleased with the 5‑under par and it's obviously really nice to start the tournament.  
   
 Q.   All the better to have no bogeys on the card, as well?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, that's for sure.   I tried to save all the bad holes I had and that's what I tried and that's what I did.   So I'm really pleased with that and I'm going to try to do the same for the next few days.   
   
 Q.   Lovely for a first competitive round for the new year, isn't it.   Is it expected?   Had you been playing well in practise?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   I played well at the ending of the year, but I practised one week in Dubai last week, but I was a bit sick, so I couldn't get a proper practise, actually.   So I wasn't sure about my form, and I'm really happy with the way I played today.   
   
 Q.   Recovered now, feeling healthy?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I hope so, but I think so.   
   
 Q.   Do you set aims and resolutions when you start a new year?   Is this the year that we see you right at the top?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   I hope so.   I hope so.   Now I'm going to try to do exactly the same thing as the last few years, nothing really is going to change, but yeah, I hope I'm going to see my name many times up the leaderboard.
