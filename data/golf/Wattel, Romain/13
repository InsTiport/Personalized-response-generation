 Q.   Some excellent numbers on the scorecard, tell us about how you put them together.   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   It's a really good start for me.   I always struggle with the first round in the French Open.   That's a lovely start.   4â€‘under on this course, that's really, really good.   I made some really good putts.   That was the key for me today.   
   
 Q.   One of those putts, was at the 8th hole, that was a tremendous roar.   Tell us about the putt and the roar.   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, exactly.   I got a really good feeling on the greens today.   The pace was every time good.   So it was much easier for me to play the course.  
   
 Q.   Irish players were telling us last week the expectation of the crowd is quite heavy on them, the pressure they feel; what about you?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Of course, you are in front of the French crowds, so you want to be good, you want to play great golf and so there is pressure on me.   But I'm trying to play my best and just focus on the shot I have to play.   That's the only thing I can do.
