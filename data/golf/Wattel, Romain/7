  ROMAIN WATTEL:   6‑under is always a good score.   We've got a really perfect condition, actually.   I thought it would be not easy with the rain at the beginning, but we didn't get that much rain today.   So that was a good scoring course, I think. 

Q.   Nice way to finish and nice to play alongside Colsaerts that was playing well. 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, it was nice to play with him.   We could speak a bit of French together and he was playing well, also, so that was good to be with him today.

Q.   Better tell me about your driver?
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, just realize on the third hole that the clubface was broken, so didn't know what to do but I just hit my drive on the fourth and on the fifth and I realize that was not that bad.   So I keep on using it. 

Q.   You carried on using it despite the crack?
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Exactly.   Maybe I'm going to change for tomorrow but for today, that was not that bad. 

Q.   Easy enough to get a new driver out here I take it? 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, we've got the Titleist crew, so I could get a clubface for tomorrow. 

Q.   What does it tell you about yourself that you can play with broken clubs? 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I didn't know if I could use it, actually, but the refs told me there was no problem because it was just in the act to use it.   So there were no problems.   Actually, I got lucky to use it and nothing was wrong with it actually. 

Q.   I take it you need it out here.   It's a long course. 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, really long, especially with the rain.   The ball is not going that far from the tee.   Yeah, so I think it could be easier because the ball stopped quickly on the green but from the tee, you can get‑‑ you don't get that much distance.   You have some really long second shots.
