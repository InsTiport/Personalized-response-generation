 Q.   This tournament has worked out for you.   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I really like this course definitely.   I played really well last year already, and you know, it fits really well to my game.   I really feel comfortable on this   track.  
   
 Q.   That's a very nice way to finish, as well, bogey‑free for the final day?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, bogey‑free, I'm really happy with the way I played today.   Not many mistakes.   My long game was really, really good.   Well, could be better with the two putts to finish on 17, 18, but that's golf.   You know it's going to be for next time.  
   
 Q.   And at the same time, you played alongside Rumford and Fraser, so you knew what you had to do and you knew what they were doing?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, exactly, I was playing over there, I was playing with them, so I knew exactly what I had to do.   But you know, I just tried to play my own game, because I can't‑‑ I don't know what they are going to do.   So I just tried to play my best.   That's what I did, and I'm happy with that.  
   
 Q.   And fourth place is a lovely finish, isn't it, good points, good money.   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, Top‑5 is always a good finish.   I'm really happy.
