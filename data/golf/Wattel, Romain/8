Q.   How good is 5‑under par? 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Really good.   It's always good to start well, the tournament, 5‑under.   That's a pretty good score on this course.   The greens were quite firm, so I was happy to get the good place on 8 and I managed to make some good putts to shoot a good score today.

Q.   And the weather is perfect, isn't it; you feel that you have to take advantage. 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Exactly.   I think they were expecting a bit of rain this week but if it stays like that, I will be the first happy.   It's beautiful weather.   I hope it's going to say like that.

Q.   Nicely in control of your game at the moment?
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Well, I played well last week, finished 21st, still a good week.   Did not play my best on Sunday.   Didn't make putts actually, so that was the big difference with the three first days.   I'm going to try to play as well as last week and to be more feeling on the greens and I hope that I could have a good chance this week.

Q.   All building up for The French Open, as well. 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Exactly.   I know I have a big week coming and a lot of expectations.   All my family, friends, they are going to be there.   So when I play good, that's a tough course, strong field.   So I want to be ready and in good shape for next week.
