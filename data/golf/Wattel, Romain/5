 Q.   What do you think of 5‑under par around here?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   5‑under par is always a good score.   Sounds good all the time.   I'm really happy with my day today.   I made a really tough putt with the first bogey on the par5, but then I played some really great shots and I'm really, really happy with this 5‑under.  
   
 Q.   Which shows good attitude, as well as good play, doesn't it?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I've tried to keep a good attitude all day long.   Even if I was a bit frustrated after the first bogey, I tried to keep doing what I've been doing the last few weeks, making some good shots, and I knew I could have some chances, but it was a good day.  
   
 Q.   Doing what you've done the last few weeks; you're in some lovely form, aren't you?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I'm playing some good golf.   Last week I didn't do much, I didn't practice that much, because I wanted to be really in good form for these two weeks.   So I think I'm fresh enough and I hope my game is going to be good this week.   
   
 Q.   I take it this is a nice place to play, as well, isn't it?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, that was the first time for me in Turkey and it's a lovely place, lovely weather.   I've heard they are expecting some rain for tomorrow but, no, for today, that was a lovely day, and even more when you're playing good. I really enjoyed the weather.
