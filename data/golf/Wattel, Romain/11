 Q.   A lovely round and almost a spectacular finish?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I'm really pleased with these rounds.   That's nice to finish by a final birdie on the last.   I'm looking forward for the next few days, because I'm playing good golf.   
   
 Q.   Well, you started well in Abu Dhabi and it was obvious that your game is it in decent shape?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, I played one good round in Abu Dhabi, the first round, and then I didn't manage to play as good as the first round, but I'm going to try to play exactly on the same way.  
   
 Q.   I know it's only halfway but did you look at that board when you were in the recorder's area, and thought, that's a nice little position for the weekend?   
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, exactly, I was looking to the board to see how far I was behind, and it makes me motivate for the holes, so I'm really, really happy with the score today.  
   
 Q.   How tired are you, because you must have had the earliest alarm call of anyone today?  
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, but I tried to sleep quite a lot the last few days, so I'm in good shape.   
Yesterday, it was quite dark to finish, so I couldn't‑‑ I couldn't manage to read properly the line of my putt, and to start with a good greens this morning, that was a big help for me, so I was quite happy to restart.
