  ROMAIN WATTEL:   I'm really pleased with the round today.     I didn't make any bogeys, so that helps a lot and my putting was actually really good today.   I found a good pace on almost every putt, so it helped me on this 66.

Q.   How aware were you of leaderboard and knowing that there were chances on that way home?
ROMAIN WATTEL:   I'm feeling more and more comfortable on the leaderboard, because it helps me to be more focused and concentrate on the good things.   So I was quite happy to see my name on the leaderboard.

Q.   Did you sense that you should go for things at the last, that you should try and get a birdie or even eagle? 
ROMAIN WATTEL:   I just tried to do as I always do; to focus on every shot and just to do my best at this time.   That's what I did. 

Q.   Whatever happens from here, it's been a decent Desert Swing for you?
ROMAIN WATTEL:   Yeah, actually I love to play in The Desert Swing.   These are courses I like and I like the greens even more this week.   I always play decent actually.
