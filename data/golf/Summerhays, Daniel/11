Q. So last time around, you were kind of in the hunt for everything.  Can you kind of just speak on that, what was going through your mind?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS: I knew I was going to be pretty nervous today, but I was very pleased with how I handled my emotions, how I felt.  I just didn't quite play as well today.  A lot of putts slid right past the cup.  I drove the ball really well.  I wasn't out of position too often.
My iron play was a little off, but overall, I'm pretty happy with how I finished and hung in today.
Q. How different was the course today, being so dry, compared to when we started out with the rain delays on Thursday?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS: It definitely had dried out a little bit, but there was still some receptive greens.  I thought it was -- I thought, besides a couple hole locations, it was -- honestly, it was still pretty fair.  It's just very difficult.
