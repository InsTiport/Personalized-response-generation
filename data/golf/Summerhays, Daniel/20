Q.   What a great round for you.   Tied second and what is it about this place, this course, you enjoy so much?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   If I could play every event at the Valero Texas Open, in TPC San Antonio, I'd have a pretty high World Ranking because it seems to be pretty good to me.
I think I capitalized on a couple of good wedge shots in there, made a few putts today.   But this golf course, it can jump up and grab you at any moment. 

Q.   Let's have let's go to 15.   Talk us through this putt. 
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   I bombed a drive down there.   It probably rolled on in 80 yards, hit a wedge in there and I guess it was only the second birdie of the day there.

Q.   This is 16. 
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   This is an 8â€‘iron.   You're just guessing what the wind is doing at the time, whether you catch a gust, just wait until it lands to see.   Fortunately it landed just up on top and checked up.   Yeah, a couple of deep breaths after that.

Q.   Really nice way for you to finish, as well, coming up 18.   Talk us through how you were feeling. 
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   I kind of botched 17.   I chilly dipped a wedge shot in there and left myself a really good number.   I had a full swing 60 degree wedge and it stopped just perfect. 

Q.   Congratulations.   We have someone out in front who is set to make a really big number this week. 
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Yes, Jimmy is tough to catch.
