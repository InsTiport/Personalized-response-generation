Q. Daniel Summerhays, in your life, what type of pressure is that to be right on that top-30 level?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS: You know, it was a lot of pressure for sure.  I've dreamed of playing at Augusta National my whole life, and a berth in the TOUR Championship would do that.  But I thought last night about some of the pressure-packed rounds that I've had, and after I lost my card my rookie year I was right back in Q-school, and going into the sixth round I was in about 15th place, and that was certainly probably the most pressure.  But I felt fine out there.  I was a little disappointed in a few shots, but yesterday I tied for the low round of the day and gave myself a really good chance today where if I just did a little bit better, I probably wouldn't be right on the bubble.  But I'm proud of myself the way I've played these Playoffs.  I came in about 67th and had two top-10 finishes and this week, kind of battled really hard, so I'm proud of myself and the way I finished off the season.
Q. Are you going to sit here all afternoon or head home and let things take care of themselves?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS: Oh, I don't know.  I don't know exactly what my plan is, but my brother Boyd is here and I'll probably go sit and chat with him and reminisce a little bit.  It's nice to have some familial sport here in Chicago.
