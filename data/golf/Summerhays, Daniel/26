Q.   Talk about the day.   4‑under is a good start here?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   For sure.   This golf course is very tricky.   You can land the ball left center of the fairway and have it kick into the rough and then you have a flier lie and trying to keep it on these greens.   I was very pleased.   I made some good putts early on, and then I started to hit the ball a little bit better as the round progressed.   But yeah, if you would have told me I'd start out with 4‑under and just be three behind the lead, I'll take that for sure.

Q.   Talk about your off‑season a little bit. 
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Yeah, I had six weeks off from MÃ©xico to now, and I really didn't do much to be honest.   I went down to Phoenix and worked at Ping for three days, worked on my equipment, and then had Christmas over here on the island here over at Ko Olina.   I honestly didn't do too much, which was really nice.
I think when I'm at home, I like to just be at home and kind of recharge the battery, so when I do get back out on the road I'm excited.   And I am, I'm excited to be here and I'm excited to practice and play.

Q.   And you talked about the whole deal with the toboggan run.   You built that for your kid?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Oh, yeah, I'm a semiprofessional bobsled hill maker, if that's a term.   After a big snow you build this track and you send the kids down on these straight sleds and they just go where the hill goes.   It gets a little dangerous if you get going too fast, you can't build the bank up high enough to keep them in the track, but we have our security and safety team on that. 

Q.   Christmas was over here?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Yeah, we did.   We had 37 of my family over here.   I'm the youngest of seven kids, so I had six of the siblings and all of our kids, so 37 of the Summerhays clan were here.

Q.   Bruce was here?
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   No, not Bruce, just my immediate family, just my parents and my brothers and sisters and their kids.
