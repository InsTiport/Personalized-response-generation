 Q.   Daniel, talk a little about being here at THE PLAYERS for the first time?   
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Oh, it's amazing.   It's the home of the PGA TOUR and they roll out the red carpet.   It's one of those events where, for me, the feeling I've gotten this week is the PGA TOUR loves its members.   I really feel that this week.   It's like, man, the set‑up of the course, all of the time and effort that everybody's putting in, the clubhouse, the player services, I mean, it's just incredible.   They really make you feel‑‑ I mean, we feel special every week, but this week it's like, hey, these are our TOUR members and we're going to take care of them.  
   
 Q.   Have you played the course before this week?   
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   I played it a few years ago when we played the Web.com event here, and I missed the cut and I played the Stadium Course.   But yesterday was my first look at it.  
   
 Q.   Pretty good closing three‑hole stretch.   Comment on those holes, if can you?   
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Yeah, you've got a great kind of risk‑reward on 16.   Then 17, luckily, is only a pitching wedge or a 9‑iron, but it's still, I mean, it's a cut‑and‑dry thing.   Either you're okay or you're dead, you're toast.   
Then 18, it's just all of the golf hole that you want.   Hopefully I can get the little draw working with the driver off the tee.  
   
 Q.   Lastly, just comment on your season up to this point?   
DANIEL SUMMERHAYS:   Yeah, I think it's been a little disappointing, especially coming off of last year.   I had some good momentum, but I feel like I'm really close.   I'm making more cuts this year than I normally do.   I just haven't quite finished the weekends off.   So little bit slower, but I think I'm well‑positioned to make a good run late in the season.
