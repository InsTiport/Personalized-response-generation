   BAE SANG-MOON: My putting was very good. Took only 26 putts. It was a mixture of long and short putts. On the first two days, I shot 70s and I couldn't hole many putts. I had so many chances in the second round but kept missing those chances from one to two meters. After yesterday's round, I spent an hour at the putting green just trying to read the lines better and it worked today. The stroke feels good and I could read the lines better today.
 I'm driving it really nice and hitting a lot of good shots. If I can shoot another 65 tomorrow, I'll have a chance to win this tournament. I'll be trying but I'll need to concentrate well in the final day and play well on every hole. 
 I've been good on the 18th hole the last three rounds where I'm five under alone on this hole. I have shot birdie, eagle, eagle and who knows, maybe I can shoot an albatross tomorrow. I hit a three wood in there today which ended a foot from the flag.
