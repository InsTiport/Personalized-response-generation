  RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I got a good break.   I chipped in on 18 for birdie, and I holed my third shot from about 115 yards on number4 for birdie.   So that was a turnaround there.   I was struggling to make par, and I ended up making birdie, so that kept the round going.  
   
 Q.   I almost came over and helped you at number 6.   You were in the natural area there.   You experienced the rough terrain, didn't you, the cactus, and the rocks?  
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I'm still struggling to get the cactus out of my leg here.   I'm itchy.   But, yeah, I hit a very bad shot there.   Only a 3â€‘wood off the tee and hit a snap hook.   Lucky to get away with a 5.  
   
 Q.   It's good to see you playing well, and I know you had the back issues.   How is the back right now?   Is it a hundred percent?   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I would say my back is feeling as good as it's felt for at least five years.   I'm not really having any issues in my back at the moment.   Just got to find some game and get some consistency going.   I've probably hit more balls in the last month than I've hit the whole of the last two years.   So I'm slowly working my way up.  
   
 Q.   For those of us who had a tender back, I see you gingerly taking the ball out of the cup.   So I guess you're still taking it easy?   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I work out.   I see a physio still every day, and I'm trying to keep myself in the best shape I can and as supple as possible.   Yeah, and I hit balls, but I'm still not quite standing out there for hours and hitting balls, but I'm practicing well.  
   
 Q.   Excited about the weekend?   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.   I like the course.   It reminds me a little bit of South Africa, the area here.   It's a bit like Sun City.   So looking forward to the weekend.
