 Q. We will played out there today, was the golf course any different today than yesterday? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Quite similar in a way. The greens are rolling a little bit better. In the morning, the greens are always a little bit better. But yeah, conditions were fine. Just one-club breeze out there. 

 Q. How have you found the changes in the golf course so far?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I think it's great. I think Arnold's done a great job here. He's flattened out some of the greens and so you can put the pins closer to some of the bunkers and water hazards. 
 Some of the run-offs are a great idea, too. Sort of gives the guys a little bit of preparation for Augusta. I think the course is certainly really set up perfectly now.

 Q. You seem to be putting some good rounds on the boards these days. Feeling pretty good about your game? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. I need four good rounds, you know, that's the thing. You need four good rounds to win. Hopefully this week. 

 Q. Talk about your round today. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yes, got off to a bit of a slow start but my last 11 holes, I managed to get six birdies in my last 11 holes. So it was nice to finish that way, especially the last five, birdieing four of the last five holes. 

 Q. What was working at the end? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Putting really. I hit it on the par 5 -- I made a good putt on 5 for birdie. The par 5, I knocked it on in two and 2-putted. And 8 and 9 I probably holed two 20-, 25-footers for birdie. 

 Q. How is the course playing differently today?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Quite similar I think. Wind is quite similar and same sort of wind as yesterday, maybe slightly different direction. This morning the greens were obviously rolling a little bit better playing in the morning. 
 The course is a fraction softer than yesterday, but overall the course is playing very nice.
