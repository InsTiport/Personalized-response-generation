 Q. How was it today? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Very disappointing. My putter let me down. I didn't really putt well all week, and especially today on the back nine. I missed a lot of short putts, and that cost me the tournament. 

 Q. You're 14-under, final score, not very far from the leaders right now. Very disappointed? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, the tournament's over for me. I'm done. Like I say, I missed a lot of short putts coming in, and that cost me the tournament.
