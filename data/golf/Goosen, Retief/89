   RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. Been a long round, 13 hours from tee-off to finish, yeah. It's been a long day. I've been up since 4:30, so with the jet lag. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: You find a good chair and just sit back.

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Conditions, similar to last year. So very wet. Playing similar to last year. 
 We got lucky this afternoon. You know, when the storm moves through the conditions were perfect, perfect playing conditions. So after the first three holes this morning, which was raining, it looked like it was going to be a really long day, but this afternoon the course played fair. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. Seven was about three feet. Yeah. It was a good shot.

 Q. You seemed dialed in to your irons all day. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. I played a par-5 very well obviously on that one, on the Back 9. And today I had a lot of birdie chances really to get a really low round going, but I didn't quite do it, but I'm happy in the round. 

 Q. Do you think you're playing a lot better golf this year, ever since you won back in March?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. I've been playing very well since November last year, and my game has turned around nicely. I've been working hard on every part of the game, and it's paying off. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: We finished the par-3, No. 12 when play was suspended.

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: 10, 11, 12 there, and then 13 was the first tee shot after the delay. And hit a good drive and a good 3-wood to about 15 feet away from the flag in the fringe and chipped it in. So that all got it started.

 Q. I think you were 5-under on the --
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. Set a par-5 for very time today.

 Q. Do you still get nervous (Indiscernible).
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No. The Tour is pretty good about that. They get us off pretty early. 
 Like I say, we could get some more rain this afternoon, but turned out to be perfect.
