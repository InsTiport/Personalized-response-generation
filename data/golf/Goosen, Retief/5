Q. That must have been fun.
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it's been a struggle on the greens for me so far this week.  I'm missing a lot of putts.  But it was nice.  When I bogeyed 13 going up there, I said to myself, you know, I've got to try to finish at least with three birdies to get me back into the thing.  And I managed to finish with four.
So, yeah, now I'm back in it, and just this weekend I'm going to have to start making those eight-footers.
Q. Is this a different mindset than all the U.S. Opens that you've played in where par is absolutely great in a U.S. Open, but here you have to make birdie?
RETIEF GOOSEN: So far, yes.  The greens started firming up this afternoon.  Especially on the back nine.  The ball was actually releasing and not spinning back anymore like it was on the front nine.  So if it's going to start drying out, these greens are going to start getting a little different as the weekend goes on.
Q. What changed from 13 on as far as mentally turning it on and making putts?
RETIEF GOOSEN: Try and make good shots.  Try and get it closer.  Try and hit it like that (indicating) and hit some really good shots coming in.
Bad read on 18 and a bad second shot on 17.  But managed to get it up-and-down.  Just going to have to try and looks like go low again this weekend, and hopefully the frontrunners get a bit nervous and don't make all the birdies.
Q. Does anybody get nervous on this Tour anymore?
RETIEF GOOSEN: No, no, no.  We're all competitive out there and we all get nervous and we want to beat each other.  So there's definitely some nerves involved.
Q. Does a round like this give you more confidence heading into the weekend?
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, no, it's nice to have that finish and five behind with two rounds to go is, you know, easy, makeable.  Just got to get on the good run.
Q. It's manageable, as they say, right?
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah.
