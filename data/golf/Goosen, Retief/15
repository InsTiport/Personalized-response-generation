 Q. You had so far the best score of the day: 16 points; 8 birdies. I mean, what was going so well for you?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Putting at the end of the day, you know, besides hitting a lot good golf shots. It was nice to get in that flow again. I had a good round last week first round in Quicken Loans, and then after that fell apart.   
It's nice now to actually have it on a Saturday and actually jump right up on the leaderboard. With this points system, you know, shooting 8 you move up very quickly.  
   
 Q. How confident do you feel going into tomorrow?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: I'm looking forward to it. The weather sounds like it's going to be great. I've got a good feel for the course at the moment. Try to get in that same rhythm tomorrow.  
   
 Q. What would it mean to you to be able to hoist the trophy tomorrow?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: It would be great. It's been a while since I had a trophy in my hand. No, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It's going to take another low round to pull it off, and hopefully we can do it.  
   
 Q. How do you relax and prepare for tomorrow?   
RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, you know, just relax. Going to go have a glass of Goose Wines tonight and a nice meal somewhere and just chill.   
I'm sure tomorrow is going to be the same sort of tee times. Weather sounds like it's going to be great, so just try and get back into that same rhythm and feel tomorrow.
