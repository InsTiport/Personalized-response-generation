  Q.  What does it mean playing in the Presidents Cup?  You've had a few experiences.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, very few, hopefully I think I'll make it this year.  I've been playing so bad but I think I'm in, which is good.   
  
  Q.  What does it mean to you?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Oh, it's great, obviously to play something similar to the Ryder Cup, play a bit of a team event, something different to the everyday stroke play.   
  
  Q.  Have you ever played course?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  No, I haven't.   
  
  Q.  Not many have, actually.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  No, it's going to be a bit new for everybody but should be a good track.   
  
  Q.  The team as it stands now, obviously Gary is announcing captains's picks tomorrow, but as know the team that's already in, what do you think of the quality of the team?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  I think normally the Presidents Cup side on paper looks pretty strong but we just don't seem to perform as well as the Europeans.  They always look the weaker side on paper and win and we look pretty strong and we don't.   
 So hopefully this year we can give them a little about pit of a run.   
  
  Q.  What was it like to be back at Southern Hills this week is this?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  It was nice, thank you.  It's good.
