Q.   It looks like you'll finish the season with a win and a second and a third?

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it is great.  I started off great today and I was only one shot behind.  I felt comfortable out there.  And suddenly in the middle of my round I was dropping shots, five shots in the space of 8 holes.  But then it was a great finish, yeah.  Obviously, it's nice to have that sort of finish.  It looked like maybe I could walk away with second. 


Q.   How hard is it, when a guy is playing as well as Chad is, to catch him?

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, when I got off to a great start I thought I had had a chance of finishing 16-under.  And for him then to catch me as to -- what did he shoot?  3-under?  But then I made those bad mistakes in the middle of the round and it was all over for me.  And so second place was the best I could think of.
