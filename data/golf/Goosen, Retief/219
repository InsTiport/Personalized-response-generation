Q.
Essentially you had an up-and-down day with three straight birdies and then three bogeys in four holes.  For you, what do you take solace in, the fact that you were able to really take this course a little bit or that you gave some back?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I just seemed to have a problem with the back nine.  I was probably ten under for the front nine and five over for the back nine.

I need to work something out tomorrow and turn that around and then I can get a low round in.
Q.  As far as how Tiger is playing, what's it going to take to catch him tomorrow?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  It all depends on what conditions are like tomorrow again, but I need a good low round, probably 8-under or something like that, in order to catch him.
Q.  For you, you obviously haven't played as much after your injury.  What does it take to get back into the top form that you seem to be in?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I'm feeling fine.  My swing is probably not up to scratch.  I'm a little bit wayward at times.

It's sort of a slow road back, but I'm confident that I'm ready to get going again.
