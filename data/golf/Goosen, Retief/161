Q.  You just couldn't quite get into it it looked like?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I made a couple of birdies on the first two holes and thought finally I'm starting to make some putts because I haven't done anything this week.  Suddenly it looked like the only two I was going to make all week, and it just dried out.  I tried and tried and hit a lot of good putts, and nothing went in.
Q.  It was just one of those days, wasn't it, kind of frustrating?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, yeah, it happens.  That's how you win match play is putting.  Zach putted very well today, made a lot of good putts, and that's how I lost.
Q.  You have a break now, don't you?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  No, I play Doral next week, and then a week off and then all the way through until Augusta.
