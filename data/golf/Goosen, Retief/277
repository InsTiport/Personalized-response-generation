Q.  Retief, nice match.  You've been playing well your golf game the past six or seven months, is since the U.S. Open, is it's carrying over day-to-day?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I'm hitting the ball a lot more consistent.  I think I'm driving the ball better.  I'm more in play off the tee, and that gives me more of a chance for birdies.  Otherwise, I've been putting pretty well.  So it's a combination of everything, really.  It's been great.  Irons, as well.

Q.  Everybody we talk to says "he's the quiet champion," what do you think about what the public's thinks of you?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Well, I don't know, I suppose because I don't play as often they don't really know much about me.  I enjoy coming to play over here now.  This year, I will be playing 15 events, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.

Q.  Do you have a sense of what other tournaments you might be at, besides the majors and World Golf Championship events? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   I'm planning to play Honda, Bay Hill, TPC, BellSouth.  Pretty much before the majors, I'll be playing in those events.

Q.  There's a possibility you could play against Ernie.
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I haven't actually looked at what side of the draw yet, if we're going to meet sometime before.  Yeah, it will be nice.

Q.  Was there a turning point out there in the match?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   I was 2-up  -- I went 3-up after the sixth hole.  Then he won the 7th, and then I made a very nice up-and-down for birdie on 9 which I think really got me 3 ahead .  Then he hit it very close on 11.  Those three holes, 11 through 13, I played well, and then to go 4-up with four to play.
