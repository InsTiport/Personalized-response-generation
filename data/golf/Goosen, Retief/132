  Q.  Tell us what happened out there?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Didn't play well enough, simple as that. Started off good and then suddenly it went a bit pear-shaped. Five shots off the lead now, I think the tournament is pretty much gone for me. I just try to play a good round tomorrow and see where we finish.   
  
  Q. Perhaps good to get a bad round for the week out of the way today?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Not really. 72 today is not going to get you no where.   
  
  Q.  What happened on those three straight bogeys?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Hit into the trees on 5, plugged in the bunker on 6 and three putted on 7.   
  
  Q.  Did you lose concentration there?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  I hit good shots besides the tee shot on 5. Hit a good lay up on 6 from the rough but just wrong club and plugged on the face and couldn't get it out.   
  
  Q.  Does it surprise you that there are rounds like from Richard Sterne with a 64?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: It's out there, definitely today. Those rounds happen.   
  
  Q.  Bogey on last wraps up your round?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yes.
