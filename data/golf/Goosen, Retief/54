  Q. How did the course play the first nine to the second nine?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: The front nine certainly played a lot easier than the back played. They set it up on the front nine for a lot of good scoring and that's what I did.   
 Then the back nine, I was in the trees too much.   
  
  Q. How frustrating was it, because you got it back to 5-under.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it was, it was. It was nice. And then two bad, three bad shots, really, in the last three holes that cost me bogeys. So I got to get away from those bad ones.   
  
  Q. Most parts of your game were you happy overall?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Front nine I was happy. Back nine I wasn't, no.   
 No, I struggled this year so far. I hit the ball terrible, and I'm really struggling with my game mentally wise too. So I'm actually taking a month break after this just to try and see if I take a bit of a break I might freshen up for TPC.  
  
  Q. So tomorrow, how does it set up?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well hopefully I can pick up where I started yesterday, not where I finished. But, yeah, if I can just get a nice solid round in tomorrow and be up there for the weekend.  
  
  Q. And what did you use on the first hole? What club?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: 8.   
  
  Q. And how far were you?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: 161 yards. Decent shot.
