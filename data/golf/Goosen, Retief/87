  Q. Five birdies, one bogey, then that eagle at 18. Great way to finish.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, definitely. You're always hoping for maybe a birdie on 18, but an eagle was a bonus. I hit a good drive and a solid 6-iron into the green and tried to get it close, and it went in.  
  
  Q. How would you assess your round today?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Pretty solid, obviously better than the last few rounds. But I've been working pretty hard on my game. I was hitting balls here Monday morning already. Nice to see that the hard work is paying off. Obviously today the three of us combined were 19-under par, so we were sort of dragging each other along.  
  
  Q. Were you familiar with how good you guys were playing in relation to the rest of the afternoon rounds?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Jim Furyk got off to a great start, and then we were sort of dragged along. It's nice that we managed to keep up with them. Yeah, the three of us sort of played off each other today.   
  
  Q. What was working well in your game today?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, I hit the ball very poorly last week and have been working very hard on my game since last Friday, Thursday and Friday last week, to try to find something. I think I found something on sort of Saturday, Sunday going into the last few rounds last week, and I was here on Monday morning hitting balls and I played Tuesday and in the pro-am. It's nice to see that the work I put in is paying off.   
  
  Q. What did you find?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it was just something I changed in my setup which is helping me a little bit better on the takeaway. I didn't really hit a lot of bad shots today, but none of them ended up in bad positions, so I managed to get them up-and-down.
