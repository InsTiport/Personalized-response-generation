  Q. Talk about being in position for tomorrow.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it's nice (smiling). No, obviously tomorrow I need another low round. I think Jim is probably going to finish up today 2 ahead, and tomorrow is going to be an exciting day.   
 A lot can happen tomorrow. Nobody really knows who's going to win it yet, and we're going to have some different weather, as well. So overall it's going to be quite a turnaround day tomorrow than what the last three days has been.   
  
  Q. Tell us how badly you want to win this tournament.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, yeah, it would be nice to get another win under my belt, especially over here in this event, a great event to win. Yeah, and I can't believe it's been six years since I last won it, so it would be nice to pull it off tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Let's say you're paired with Jim tomorrow. Knowing him as you do, how tough is that going to be? He's a tough competitor.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, Jim doesn't put it in too much trouble. He's always there giving himself a chance. Yeah, he's going to be a tough guy to beat, and in a way I feel like if I finish ahead of him tomorrow, I win.  
  
  Q. What are you doing well that's got you sort of right up the leaderboard?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, I'm hitting the ball a little bit better and I'm putting well, getting it up-and-down, although I didn't get it up-and-down three times out of the bunkers today. Overall just a little bit more consistent. Putting well, obviously, making a lot of good putts.
