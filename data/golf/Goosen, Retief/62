 Q. You had a great opening nine that springboarded you into this round. What was that like?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I played a lot better than yesterday. The front nine I had a lot of birdies. Yesterday I was up-and-down on every hole and today I had a birdie chance on every hole. The back nine was up and down. 

 Q. At 13, your first bogey, you bounced back with a great par save at 14 hitting out of the shrubbery there. How important was that particular hole in terms of momentum?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, (inaudible), even taking an unplayable lie. I took a chance with a 4-iron out of there and actually hit it to 15 feet but didn't get it up-and-down. 

 Q. You're only one of a handful players here that's a past champion of the TOUR Championship. How much can you hang your hat on being a past champion? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, I mean, you're going to have to play well. It doesn't matter if you're a past champion. 
 But I think the advantage comes on the greens, but over the years they break more than they used to. But on the greens there's a little bit of an advantage.
