 Q.  How good a 66 was that considering the conditions conditions?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Could have been a lot better 66 if I had a warm putter, beautiful the last two days my putter let me down and I made nothing on the greens, really.  Even today, I only made three putts, really.  Would have been nice to make a couple coming in.  I hit a lot of good putts but nothing was going in, so it's a positive going into the next event.   
 Q.  You had a good save on 15, a good up-and-down.  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, 15 is all I've been struggling on this week.  Yeah, it was a good up-and-down to give myself a bit of a chance.  I thought, okay, if I can finish with two or three birdies in the last few holes, I had a chance.   
You know, I hit three good putts on the last three holes, but none went in.   
 Q.  Overall it's been a good week for your first Senior Open?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: I enjoyed it.  Pity the weather turned out the way it was.  Would have been nice to have a sunny weekend, but this is links golf for you.   
 Q.  This is Tom Watson's last Senior Open today.  Are you going to miss him on links golf?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, Tom, eight-time British winner.  Amazing achievement and such a nice guy.  It's a pity he has to go, but all good things come to an end.
