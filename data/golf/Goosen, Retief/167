RETIEF GOOSEN:  I got off to a good start, two under after three holes but I went a bit 'dead' until the 11th when I made a nice putt for a two. It was a bit of an up and down day, really, especially on the back nine with three birdies and three bogeys. They were stupid bogeys, to be honest. I felt the chips were all makeable, but instead I dropped shots which is really disappointing. Having said that, at the end of the day I am still just a shot off the lead and right in it.

I don't know why I struggled to get up and down coming home. Maybe it was a bit of rustiness - lack of practice over the last few weeks. I feel disappointed right now but I have another chance tomorrow.

The wind definitely got up over the last four holes and made it trickier and it will be interesting if the conditions are the same tomorrow. I hope I can get off to a good start because with so many players in contention I feel I am going to need that. If I do that and make a few coming in - who knows?
