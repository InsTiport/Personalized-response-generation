Q.
You've got to be pretty happy with today.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it's nice to get a nice round under the ground.  Today the hit the ball very nicely for a change.  I still had two three putts out there today.  It could have been a really low number.  I didn't birdie one par 5, actually played 1 over on the par 5s, so the possibility was there for a very low round.
Q.  Is there something you feel like you've been struggling with, not necessarily today, but has the ball striking been what's been getting you?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, a bit of everything at the moment.  I'm not hitting it well, not putting well.  But today I didn't miss too many fairways.  I probably missed four fairways and was struggling on the par 5s.  I played them 1 over today to shoot 4 under, and if you shot over par on the par 5s, you played well.
Q.  Obviously you have to feel like you're in the mix now, depending on what they do this afternoon?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, the breeze is picking up a bit now.  It's a different wind to the first two days.  The last three holes are playing long.  They're playing into the wind.  What am I, 5 under?  Yeah, if I can be hopefully no more than six or seven off the lead, I've got maybe half a chance.
