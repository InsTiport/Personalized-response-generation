 Q. Retief, a solid round out there. A little bit better conditions today for most of the field. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: It definitely felt a lot easier this morning so couldn't have been any tougher. 
 So, yeah, got off to a good start. A poor finish, but, yeah, I'm going to be quite a bit behind after today so I'm going to shoot some lower rounds on the weekend.

 Q. I understand the greens are perfect, if you put yourself in position. Are they still perfect after all the rain they took?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: The greens are really good. The fairways -- it's obviously very muddy. They couldn't cut the fairway so it's very long in places. But, you know, for us playing yesterday afternoon, it feels a lot easier this morning.

 Q. Only blemish on the scorecard here at 9, your 18th hole, but looked like you hit a pretty good aggressive shot there, just a little off line?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I probably hit the wrong club. I was trying to cut it in there a little bit and came out a bit. You don't want to hit it right of the flag so I deserved a bogey.

 Q. A solid round nonetheless.
