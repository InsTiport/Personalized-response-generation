RETIEF GOOSEN:  On the back nine, I hit a couple of bad shots off the tee and didn't really give myself any birdie chances.  You know, struggled with my swing out there so I didn't hit it as good as I would have liked to have hit it.  Yang played very well, consistent.   He made those good run of birdies there on, whatever it is, 6, 7 and 8.

I hit a lot of good putts, just didn't make things.
Q.  When that happens, do you feel momentum is running away from you?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  No, at that stage, he was only one shot ahead    I had a bad flyer out of the rough on 10 that went 20, 30 yards over the green and that sort of stopped the momentum there for me.  From there on, I struggled to get it near the pin and couldn't make a putt to save my life.  I knew I had a chance coming down the stretch.  Could have made the putt on 16 and he bogeyed 17.  He was only one shot ahead come down the last.  I just couldn't make a putt to save my life.
Q.  Have you played with him before, in the Korean Open?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  We played a practise round; he played well; he won that week.
Q.  Shows the depth of the game now?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  He's a good player, he proved himself winning over here.  It's his first win on The European Tour, so we'll be seeing more of him next year.
