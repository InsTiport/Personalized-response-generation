 Q.  Your first round in a senior major.  Are you satisfied with that round?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: I am happy with the round.  It was a good round but disappointing round.  I made a lot of mistakes out there today, and saw a lot of birdies, a lot of bogeys.   
So tomorrow, I need to just find a little bit more consistency going out there, and just get something in the red numbers tomorrow.  But yeah, I'm happy with the 70.  It looks like I'm going to be probably four or so behind, maybe more, who knows, somebody could go out this afternoon and shoot a low one.   
 Q.  I noticed you drove on 6 and you were unlucky to go in the bunker.  Helps when you hit the ball that far.  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Every day so far in practise rounds, I went for the green on 6 and today I thought, I might as well go for it.  Yeah, I hit a good drive and it nearly stayed up.   
18, I hit a good drive and actually hit a good second, but it really misjudged the bounce in front of the green.  Yeah, I'm excited about the rest of the week.  Hopefully I can, as I say, just get a bit more consistency going.  I drove the ball well, but my iron play wasn't so good, so I need to work on it a little.   
 Q.  If the wind picks up, I don't think there's going to be many players under par, so is it quite satisfying to get off to a decent start?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, you can play yourself out very quickly here at this course.  Even par is a good score to get off to.
