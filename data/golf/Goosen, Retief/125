 Q.  Last time beater Tiger, this year beating Furyk; two pretty good matches. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, that's true.  It's been an exciting week but we lost in the foursomes, so better luck next time. 

 Q.  As far as you said you played pretty good, what went well for you this week? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  It went okay this week.  I putted terrible this week but today I hit the ball nicely and made a few putts.  Jim Furyk was 2-up very quickly on me and suddenly I started making a few birdies.
