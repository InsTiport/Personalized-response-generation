  Q. How pleased were you with the way you played?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I didn't play that great. Things were a little gruffy out there. I didn't really make a lot of birdies out there, but at the end of the day you've got to just try and stay ahead.  
  
  Q. How different is your approach to match play like this, an 18-hole match play, as opposed to going out in a stroke play in the first round?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, you very much -- you're trying to hit the shots. You're very much looking at what the other guy is doing. That's why it comes down to big numbers and sometimes some eagles. And you're definitely keeping your eye on the guy you're playing with to try and steady play him.   
  
  Q. Is it a nice change from stroke play?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I like it. It's a game that's very up-and-down pressure-wise. Really keeps you on your toes on every shot.   
  
  Q. Ernie tomorrow. How much experience have you had at playing against him in South Africa and match play tournaments or around the world?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, obviously I'm up against one of the big match play players tomorrow. But you've got to go out there and try to make a birdie on every hole and see what happens.
