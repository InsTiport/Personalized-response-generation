RETIEF GOOSEN:  I think the bad finish has put me out a little bit unfortunately.  I can't see myself  -- I'm seven shots off the lead now.  I needed a good finish.  I needed to finish about 5- or 6-under to have a chance.

Yeah, I played well, I putted well.  Just the last two holes I had two bad drives and cost me two shots.
Q.  How difficult is this, you got a chance to complete a round today but a not of people are not going to have a chance to complete a round and have to come back early tomorrow.  Is it difficult with the schedule not being as set as it normally?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yes, it's been a tough week, 5:00 every morning.  So it's nice to have the morning off tomorrow so I'm looking forward to it.
Q.  Are you surprised to be back after a 78 the first round?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  The first nine holes was a bit of a joke; I don't know what happened, and from then I started playing more solid.  And obviously today I played well and especially this afternoon, and unfortunately just messed up coming in.  So threw my chances away a little bit.
Q.  A lot of guys have bailed out in the tournament, not finishing the round and stuff; how important is it for you to come back after that 78 and play hard.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, I knew I could play better than that.  So I had to come and try to prove myself a little bit.  It gives you an opportunity to work on your game and try to find out what happened.  You know, with important tournaments coming up, I'm working on a few things and hopefully I'll be ready come Augusta.
Q.  Were you not feeling well the first day?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I've had a bit of a cold, but no real excuses, no.
