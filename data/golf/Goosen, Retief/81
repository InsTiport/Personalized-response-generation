   RETIEF GOOSEN: Everything at the moment is sort of working, so it's nice to be up there on the leaderboard again.

 Q. Does the golf course suit your eye?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I like the course. It's a great golf course. You need to drive it well around here, a lot of water around. Like I said, the greens are a bit slow so you can be I little bit aggressive in some respects.

 Q. You travel a lot around the world. How long are you with us this time?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: This week. No, I'll be back for World Match Play, HSBC and The Race to Dubai.
