Q.  Your thoughts on the day?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Bad ball striking is what it was.  Never really gave myself any chances.  The holiday stared to kick in. I started losing my timing since Saturday, really.  Some things to work on, get my timing back.
Q.  Is it normal for you to take a little while to get rid of the rustiness and get into the groove again?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, hopefully next week I'll start hitting it a little bit better.
Q.  Have you played the Vines before?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I was there the last time Cambo won, 2000.
Q.  This week has done your game a lot of good?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I hope so.
