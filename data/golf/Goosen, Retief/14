 Q.  Retief, I know it was a long day with the long stoppage, but you managed to pull a 7-under 65 out of it.  Just a few comments about your round.  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I find it hard to really remember the first nine, it's been so long ago.  But yeah, just got off to a great start, birdied the first couple of holes, and just played really solid for the first sort of 13 holes.  Really I missed two greens, and then when the weather came, I hit a couple of bad shots coming in, unfortunately, but I managed to save pars.  It'll be a long wait now until my next round.   
 Q.  What have you been most pleased with or what are you most happy with right now that's going on?  
RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, like I said, the first 13, 14 holes I drove the ball great.  I hit a couple of bad tee shots coming in, but it was really the putting.  I made a few good putts for a change.  I felt good on the greens.  I saw the lines good, and my speed was great.  The greens were rolling beautifully this morning.
