Q.   Quick on how much your back played into today?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Not really.   It was the same as yesterday, my back.   Yesterday hit a lot of bad shots and got a way with it and today I didn't.   So I won't say that the back was any different to yesterday.   It's just a lot of shots going right. 
So just can't get on to my left side.   Played like a dog, simple as that.   I could have done better than that, working with the issue on my back, but I wouldn't say my back was any worse.
