Q. Early this morning, pristine conditions out there, weren't they?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I suppose so.  You know, the wind was pretty calm out there compared to the last few days.  Scoring conditions were pretty good out there.  I got off to a pretty bad start.  I was 3 over through five holes, so I wasn't looking to go, so I played well from there on.
Q.  Some guys made rallies on the front side today.  You obviously started off poorly.  What was it that you were able to get back and put up a 69?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I made eagle on 16 that sort of got me back to 1 over and then made a good putt on the 1st and a good putt on the 2nd that sort of put me back into the red figures.

Then I made a nice birdie on 4 and a good birdie on 5.  So I'm very happy with the round overall.
