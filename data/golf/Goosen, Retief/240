Q.   Did you think a 61 was out there today?

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Obviously it is a great round of golf.  I played really well today and I felt like I probably could have gone a few shots lower today and really couldn't make the putts.  So obviously everything dropped in for him today and it's a great round of golf. 


Q.   What's your mindset for?

RETIEF GOOSEN:   Obviously you're going to have to get off to a good start to put some pressure on him.  And then just go from there.  Tomorrow the pins will be definitely in the toughest positions on every green, so the low round is not going to be easy.  But then again, there's more bogey chances for him out there.  So hopefully tomorrow I can get a low one in and see what happens. 


Q.   Do you mind going out one group ahead and putting the pressure on?

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, I would have liked to have gone out in the last group, actually.  I pretty much hit my worst putt of the week on number 17.  It was such a bad pull.  So it's disappointing to drop a shot there.  But three behind I'm just going to need a low one tomorrow. 


Q.   Does experience count for something as far as the guys in the hunt, Campbell, Howell, they really haven't had that experience going into a final round with a chance to win.  You have experience.  Is that a plus for?

RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, I hope so.  Hopefully tomorrow my experience can help me out a little bit.  But if I can hit the ball like I hit it today, give myself lots of birdie chances, I just need to make a putt.  And then I'm going to have a chance to win it tomorrow.
