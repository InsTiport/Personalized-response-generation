  Q. A 6-under 66 today, how did it go for you?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it was nice to get a good round in today. I didn't feel all that comfortable with my game today. I changed putters and tried a different putter today and I made a few putts. Yesterday was bad on the greens. Today was a little bit better.   
 So, nice to get a good round in. Hopefully I won't be too far behind going into tomorrow.   
  
  Q. The wind has not blown as what has been expected; has that sort of interfered with your club selection?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: The wind has been tricky because it's playing out of all sorts of directions. You can play one hole into the wind and the next hole you play into the wind in the opposite direction. The wind is swirling at the moment and struggling to find a direction.   
 Yeah, it's not blowing as we know it can blow around here and it shows on the scoring. That's why the scoring is so low.  
  
  Q. You're right up there on the leaderboard as we speak and it's a competitive field. Your thoughts on that for the South African Open?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I reckon about 12-under is going to lead by the end of the day. So you know, four or five behind going into the weekend is not a bad place to be.   
  
  Q. Your general thoughts on the course itself?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: The course is in great shape. They have done a great job here this week.
