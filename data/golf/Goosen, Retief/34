  RETIEF GOOSEN:   Played a little bit different today, they didn't cut the greens this morning because of the Frost, but the greens before a bit more bumpier than they would be, you know, if they had been cut.   
So the greens wasn't easy to putt on today.   But I played much better today.   My iron play was good today.   I had a lot of birdie chances out there.   If I made a few more putts, I could have had a good score.   
   
 Q.   3â€‘under is pretty good.   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   I'm happy, only four off the lead, so it seems that all the last winners came from behind here, so if I'm back in the pack, it sounds like it's a good place to be.   
   
 Q.   So what do you think your chances are of moving up even further tomorrow?  
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I need a good round tomorrow, something in the mid 60s is probably going to be the score you're going to have to shoot to win.   Brandt is playing very well at the moment and his game is on fire, so he's going to be a tough guy to catch.   
   
 Q.   How is your back?   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Back's feeling great.   It's feeling great.   So I can't complain at the moment.   
   
 Q.   What are your predictions for the rest of the season?   You're just getting started.   
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, first event back here, so I'll just keep going.   As long as I'm feeling great, I want to get back into playing and I'm sort of excited to get back out playing.   It's not that every shot is painful anymore, so it's fun.
