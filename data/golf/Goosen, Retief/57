   RETIEF GOOSEN: Played solid, just a very poor finish unfortunately. But yeah, with two rounds to go, still well in it.

 Q. You are absolutely still well in it because the nature of the scoring has put you in a very tidy finish at the weekend. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it would have been nice to finish a bit better, finish at 6-under or something. But I messed up on 17 and really got penalised.

 Q. Was it considerably easier in terms of the conditions out there today? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Definitely. Yesterday, a three- or four-club wind and today a one- or two-club wind. 
 The greens are just so long now. It's like putting on fairways. 

 Q. I remember your putt to win this at the 18th those years ago, that was a wonderful putt. Is that the kind of memory you do look back on on this course?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I would like to give myself that chance again maybe on Sunday. Just hang in there tomorrow, get another good round in and see what happens Sunday.

 Q. Judging by the experience of two weeks ago in Abu Dhabi, your game is there?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I'm playing okay. Just a poor finish, and hopefully I'll learn a little bit from that and finish better tomorrow.
