 Q. Are you happy with today and how you played today?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I'm happy with the score because I didn't play all that well. I missed a lot of greens and I got it up-and-down quite a few times from around the greens. So chipping and putting saved me today. 
 The back nine, I sort of played solid. I need to work on my driving a little bit. I was missing quite a few fairways. 

 Q. So it's a good score?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I think 71 is about as good as I could have played today. Nobody is really burning it up today so it's tough for everybody. 

 Q. Why do you think that is?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, the pins are tough today. The course is still playing really long, for me, anyway. So it's not easy. 
 A lot of the flags were on the high points today. So it was sort of difficult to get close to the flags.
