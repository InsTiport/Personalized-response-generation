 Q. (Do the rookies seem nervous)?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Y.E. seems to blend right in at the moment and Camilo, he loves it. So I don't see any guys really showing a sign of nerves.

 Q. Last year's American Ryder Cup Team had a lot of rookies, as well, and they were credited for jump starting them and getting the enthusiasm going. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Like Ernie said it's nice to get a bit of young blood back on the side, new blood in there. The new guys that's in there, two of them, one won a major and the other can't stop winning in Japan. It's nice to have young guys in there that's on a winning role at the moment and maybe by the end of the week they can help bring the team through. 

 Q. Is there a different vibe or atmosphere with the team from last year, not only with the rookies? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, obviously Gary was great as a captain and Peter Thomson. Greg is a good guy, funny guy. I think Greg is maybe trying to be a little bit different this year in the way of being a little bit more trying to get us a bit more psyched up and keeping us positive for the week. Gary, he was just a really nice guy to be around, full of -- very friendly, talked a lot, but Greg, I find he's a little bit more serious.
