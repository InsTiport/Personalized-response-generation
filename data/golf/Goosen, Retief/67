 Q. Do you feel like you got the most out of your round out there today?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No, it was a bit of a disappointing finish. I would have liked to have get it going a little bit in the last few holes, but finished poorly unfortunately. Pretty much out of it now, so hopefully just get a good round in tomorrow and try and finish up in the Top 5.

 Q. What do you think about Louis holding on? I don't think people expected him to hold on through today. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, Louis has actually been playing some really good golf this year. He's probably had a chance to win four or five European Tour events this year, and he just failed in that last round or somebody else shot a great round. He has one of the best golf swings on Tour, and he's a good wind player, grew up in an area that's very windy. Wind here is pretty normal for where he grew up.

 Q. Is he someone that you think can be a major champion?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I mean, the guy has got a really solid head on him. He's very focused, very nice guy, one of the nicest guys on Tour, and like I say, tomorrow, yeah, it's going to be tough, but you know, you've got to get out there and do it. Somebody has to do it.

 Q. Based on just coming from Pebble Beach and seeing what happened there with Dustin Johnson, a similar experience for Sunday, can you go into tomorrow even though you say you shot yourself out of it, thinking, hey, it can happen again?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, he's going to have to go out there -- if he can get through even par for the first six holes, if the wind blows the same, then now you've got a chance at 7, 9, those holes you've got a chance for birdie. 
 Yeah, but I think Paul is playing well. He's probably still going to have to shoot maybe somewhere around par or something under par to win.
