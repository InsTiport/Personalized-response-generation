Q.   Well, you said yesterday that your short game has been saving you.  It looked like it was the same story again today.  Was it?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, pretty much.  Unfortunately I had a bogey on 17, only had a wedge into the green and just blocked it a fraction and left it a bit short and three putted.  That was disappointing.  Instead of being one behind I ended up being three behind.
Q.  How would you describe your game right now?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  It's terrible.  It's all over the place on the golf course off the tee.  I'm scrambling, well, that's the main thing.  I'm holing a lot of good par putts, so tomorrow I'm going to have to scramble better or play better, one of the two.
Q.  It's actually quite remarkable that you say you're swinging so poorly, yet you're out there close to the lead.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, like I said, I've been up and down this year, but I just need to somehow find the fairways.  That's the key.
