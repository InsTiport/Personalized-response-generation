RETIEF GOOSEN:  I suppose a got a bit lucky.  In this game, we both didn't make anything on the greens.  I made a good putt on 16 to go 2 up and then messed up 17.
Q.  Tiger and Vijay both go down today.  Shows anything can happen in match play?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, the greens are extremely difficult to putt on.  I made probably two putts in the last, you know, two days.

So you can hit the ball well and not really do anything.  It's just whoever makes the mistake, the other guy wins the hole.
Q.  Are you happy to get back out there or would you rather have some time off?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I don't mind playing.  I'm going to go hit a few balls quickly and see if I can find something.  I didn't really drive the ball all that well today.
