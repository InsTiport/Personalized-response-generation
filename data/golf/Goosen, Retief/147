Q.  How does it feel to end the season like this on a positive note?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it was good.  It was nice to    this week I've probably hit the ball the best I've hit it for a good six months.  The putter was ice cold.  I didn't make anything on the greens all week.

At least I know the things I'm working on and my swing is coming right, and I need to start making a few putts.
Q.  Did you find the conditions a little easier on the weekend?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Not really.  I think it was sort of maybe just getting used to the conditions a little better.  The players were sort of feeling what clubs to hit and so on in the cold conditions.  I wouldn't say conditions were any easier this weekend, no.
Q.  You've kind of played in cold weather all year.  Does it change your game at all?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, the ball is not going anywhere, that's for sure.  It was bad, but it could have been worse.  It could have been really blowing and powering down rain as well.

But overall I think it's been a good week.  The guys played well, and it looks like Adam is going to win it.  A well deserved champion.
Q.  Was the ball on a sprinkler head on 18?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, just like four inches away from it, so I just needed to get some    I think it was definitely affecting my follow through, yeah.
Q.  What's next for you the next two months playing wise?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I'm playing in China the next two weeks, flying out here tonight, and I go to South Africa and playing two more in South Africa, the Million Dollar and the South African Open in December, and then holiday.
