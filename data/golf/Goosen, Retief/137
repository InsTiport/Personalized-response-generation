  Q.  You bogeyed 15 first up and didn't look so good and all of a sudden birdieing 17 and knocking that putt in on the last for an eagle for a round of 69 to win this thing must have been a nice feeling?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, obviously after 15, I said to Colin, you know, we somehow need to get to 15-under.  Hit a good 3-wood on 16 and went for it back, poor chip shot, poor putt.  But made two great finishing holes for me.   
 18, it never hit the fairway once all week and finally hit a good drive and hit a good 3-wood.   
  
  Q.  Obviously winning a golf tournament, it's great to win, but where do you feel as though your game is at right now?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, I've still got a long way to go, the last few months working on my swing a little bit.  Still a lot of bad swings at the moment but I'm sort of scrambling well at the moment.  I know how to scramble well I suppose.   
 Well, it's a great feeling to have a win under the belt again.  It's been a while since I last had a win.   
  
  Q.  You must feel a bit sorry for Nick O'Hern, you did that to him on the last but his short game today was phenomenal, but there's only one winner, and we congratulate you on winning the Qatar Masters.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, thank you.  Nick played obviously great.  He didn't drive it as well today as he normally does which was surprising.  He missed quite a few fairways but he did get it up-and-down a lot, which kept him in the game.   
 Obviously it never looked like winning, I thought if I could get it to 14 tied with him, but hit a great putt on the last.
