   RETIEF GOOSEN: Today for the first time in the last six months my body was starting to fire but the last two holes then spoilt it. Yesterday my putter let me down but the putting was much better today and after 16 holes I was five under par for the round and very happy. But then I blocked my second shot on the 17th into a bush, had an unplayable lie and had to take a drop. I ended up with double bogey there and then on the 18th I went into the water. So, overall, very disappointing but my back has felt good over the last two days and the physio that I have been doing is clearly working - helped by this wonderful warm weather, of course. Considering that I didn't know whether I would be able to play this week I suppose it's encouraging.
