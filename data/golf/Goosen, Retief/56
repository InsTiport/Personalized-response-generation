  Q. Just a comment on the day out there.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, it was disappointing that the rain came in, but the course actually played nice after that. Can't complain. I mean, it was nicer playing than that this afternoon than it was before the round started when it was quite windy.   
 So the course played nice out there, and that's why the scoring was so good.  
  
  Q. And your round, what you finished of it?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: 15 holes, 3-under, so, yeah, try to get a good finish in tomorrow morning and then get a good round in in the afternoon.   
  
  Q. Birdies that stand out?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Nothing really. Just mainly par 5 birdies. So that was it for me really. Nothing really too exciting.
