Q.  Speak to the round today.  You had a pretty nice round today.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I played better today, still had a few bad shots out there, but I made a few good putts today to get the round together.
Q.  In terms of this year, what would it mean to cap off your year walking away with a trophy here on Sunday?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  That would be great.  The year has been a bit slow since really U.S. Open, British Open time, but it's been a good year, and I'm probably not playing as well as I would like to play, but yeah, if I can keep it up over the weekend it would be nice.
Q.  (Inaudible).
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, Tracy is pretty much expecting in about two weeks' time really, so I'll have my hands full next week.
Q.  (Inaudible).
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it was a good putt.  I thought I hit a really good tee shot.  The wind died on us, me and Vijay both came up short, and it's just one of those that you're trying to get close, and we did.
Q.  (Inaudible).
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, 18 is obviously a tough hole.  I made a poor tee shot, and you're going to get punished for it on these greens.  I got a bit confused by Vijay's ball.  I couldn't quite make out where his ball landed.  I thought he was past the pin.  I tried to hit a soft shot in there and really came out of it.
Q.  What does this golf course demand and what's your game plan playing this particular golf course?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, you've got to drive it in the fairway first of all.

Today three times I hit it on the fairway and didn't have a shot.  The ball is picking up a lot of mud still, and I had a couple of shots that went sideways.  Some places you're probably better off in the rough.  At least you know what it's going to do.
