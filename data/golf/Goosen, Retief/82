 Q. Looked like a really tough day for you guys. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I never really got anything going. I think the real turnaround was on 12 when we hit it close and they made a long putt to halve the hole. That was sort of the end of it for us. 
 But overall, it was a struggling day. I'm hitting the ball really bad. I mean, I played okay, but that's how it goes. 
 Hopefully we can pull in 3-2 or something like that and pretty much square it going into this afternoon, which is great.
