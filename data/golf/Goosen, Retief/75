   RETIEF GOOSEN: It was disappointing, I played poorly, especially the front nine, I think I was 3-over par on the front nine. You're always going to lose when you play like that.  
 I never played really well all week. But I kept it together the first few days, and together I just missed it in all sorts of bad places. End of that.  
  
  Q. Played good the first few days?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I did. But today was disappointing. It would have been nice to get something going.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: He played solid. He did what he needed to do. He made pars and I made bogeys or double bogeys.
