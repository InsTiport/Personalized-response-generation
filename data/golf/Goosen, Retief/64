  Q. 4-under par today. You mentioned in another interview that you struggled a little bit tee to green, but you holed out a couple bunker shots and got it around nicely, 4-under par, just two out of the lead.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah. No, I'm not going to complain. I missed a lot of greens. I holed a bunker shot on the 3rd and the 14th, so those holes, that obviously helps. But yeah, I need to start hitting a little bit better from tee to green to stay up there.  
  
  Q. As far as your season is concerned, I know you haven't had a win, but you've had eight top 10s, and the ultimate goal is a win, but do you feel like if you kind of find something with your swing you can make that happen this weekend possibly?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I've been working my ass off the last three weeks trying to find something. I'm just struggling to start the ball on line. Everything is shaping away from the flag and not towards the flag or away from the fairway. It's just hard to get something going and feel like I've got a bit of a stress-free round out there. The way I'm playing now, every hole is a bit of a fight.   
 Two weeks left, hopefully this week and TOUR Championship, to get a win under my belt.
