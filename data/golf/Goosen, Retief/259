Q.  Struggling with your game? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah, I'm playing pretty bad.  Today, hitting the ball terrible, but putting well, which helps.  Otherwise I would have shot 80. 

Q.  Did you play well last week?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Better than I'm hitting it now. 

Q.  Do you know what the problem is? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   No.  Otherwise I wouldn't be playing so bad. 

Q.  Change anything or anything you need to work on? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Well, practice this afternoon, see if I can find something that might help. 

Q.  Any thoughts on what you're going to work on? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   No. 

Q.  How long has it been like this? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   This week. 

Q.  Because of Padraig, you're closer to the No. 1 spot than you were at the start  --
RETIEF GOOSEN:   He's got nothing to do with it. 

Q.  Was that on your mind this week? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   No, I'm sure when I went through the U.S. Open, there's a lot worse than trying it win an Order of Merit.  So there's no extra pressure.

Q.  Your focus is still pretty good? 
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Yeah.  Just got to keep trying.  That's what I can do. 

Q.  Is it the driving or the irons as well?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   Everything unfortunately, except putting. 

Q.  Is this as badly as you've played this year?
RETIEF GOOSEN:   I would think so, yes.
