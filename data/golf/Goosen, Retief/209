Q.
Nice way to finish up there?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  It was a tough match.  Me and Ian both played very well.  On the back nine we were both about 7 under.  It was a good match, good for the confidence, and at least after yesterday's disappointments, nice to finish 3rd.
Q.  Talk about your schedule coming up in the next month or so before Augusta.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  At the moment I'm playing next week Doral, Bay Hill, TPC and then Augusta.
Q.  And just in general does your form feel good?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, I played nicely today, especially off the tee.  I hit all the fairways except on the playoff.  Yeah, it's nice getting back after pretty much a long layoff.
Q.  As far as going back to your form, is it a little bit different playing match play because you hit some shots that you really might not hit in stroke play, because if you lose the hole you just move on?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, that's true.  Obviously from next week on, it's back to the really grinding standard, to really grind it out.  But it's been fun this week, I've enjoyed it.
