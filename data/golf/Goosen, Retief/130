 Q.  1-under, nothing spectacular but no bogeys, the only player in the field to do that today.  Maybe talk about your day. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Really?  I made a few good saves.  I didn't drive it very well.  I think I hit four fairways, so it wasn't that I was in play a lot off the tee.  But I hit a lot of greens.  So that was good, out of the rough.  Got it up-and-down quite a few times. 
 The only birdie came on 16, when I drove it in the rough, laid up and hit a sand iron to about six feet and made the putt. 

 Q.  So while you didn't have any bogeys, it sounds like it wasn't a stress-free round.  Like you said, you had to make a lot of kind of recovery shots if you weren't in the fairway that much? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, probably got it up-and-down about five times or somewhere around there.  But I missed a lot of putts.  I didn't make anything on the greens, either.  So it could have been something less than that, really. 

 Q.  As far as putting, is it kind of relearning the greens again because they redid them?  You've played this tournament for a number of years now, but they're all new? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  I mean, the greens are definitely the slowest they've ever been, yeah, since I've played here.  I think if they were as quick as they were last year, we wouldn't be playing today because the ball would have moved on the greens.  So they are definitely a lot slower than they were in the past, and I think it probably shows in the scoring.  The scoring is a little bit better than I think everybody thought it would be in this weather. 

 Q.  5-under is the lead, and you're four off the pace.  Pretty decent position to be after 18 holes? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, hopefully tomorrow morning get something going, make a few putts, get a good round in and see what happens.  I presume tomorrow is going to be similar weather-wise.
