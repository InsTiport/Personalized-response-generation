  Q. On No. 2, did you see the big guy over there?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I did. I saw it over there in the Pro-Am, as well. We got a bit closer than you did. We got within ten yards of it, had a good look at it before it wandered off into the water. I'm sure it's pretty used to humans walking past there by now.   
  
  Q. But getting back to golf, five birdies, two bogeys today, you're at 7-under, just another solid round of golf. Obviously this is a golf course you feel very comfortable on.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I seem to read the lines pretty good. I hit the ball better than yesterday, which is good. I found something in the last few holes playing, made a few good swings, so I took it on the course today and made it a little bit better. But a couple of bad ones here and there.   
But I'm looking forward to the weekend.  
  
  Q. When you look at the leaderboard, Harrington with three major championships, yourself with two major championships; it's a course that lends itself to that type of player that is a patient player and a smart player.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, you've got to strike it well and shape it well around this course, definitely. And the greens, they are going to get even hairier, or scarier on the weekend. They are starting to dry out pretty quick. I'm looking for it to be tough this weekend.
