RETIEF GOOSEN: Obviously I am delighted to be in this position, but it's also fairly obvious that Jeff did not play his best this morning. I got off to a good start and got some momentum going, but he just could not seem to get going and whenever you fall that far behind it gets more and more difficult with every passing hole to get back into things. Nevertheless, I have to concentrate on my own game and I was very pleased with my play this morning. I made seven birdies and only dropped one shot and if I can keep that going I can hopefully close out matters quickly this afternoon.
