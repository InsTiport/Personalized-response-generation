Q. Comment on the day?
RETIEF GOOSEN: I didn't play all that great and didn't putt all that well at all but the greens are difficult, there are a lot of heel marks on them, but I am pretty happy that I am still in with a shout at the weekend.
Q. You must be looking forward to the challenge of the weekend?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yes I am, I am only two shots behind which is nothing, especially on this golf course, so if I can put together a couple of decent rounds this weekend then I still have a good chance of winning.
