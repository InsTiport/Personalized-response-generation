  Q. Talk about the round today, it almost kind of got away from you on the front side, you made a great five on the par 5 out of the bunker, hit the cart path on the next hole and got a nice bounce there. All in all, you birdied 18 and you're right there.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: It was a very up-and-down round. Got off to a nice start, and really struggled with the wind all day long. I was struggling to judge which direction the wind was coming on. So I lost a bit of confidence in my iron play out there today.  
 I just knew I had to keep hanging in there. Obviously Jim Furyk got on a bit of a roll but it was nice to birdie 18 and be three behind at the moment.  
  
  Q. Talk about that birdie and also the one at 9; that was an 18-footer you curled in there.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I hit a good drive and a 9-iron there, and no matter where you hit on that it green, it's going to be a hard putt.   
 Tomorrow morning, obviously playing early, you probably expect the greens to be a lot better tomorrow morning than they are now, and maybe the wind conditions, you don't know what it's going to be like. You might have to shoot a low one tomorrow to win.
