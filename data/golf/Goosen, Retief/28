Q. The course wasn't yielding much today, but how was it different for you?RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it's very tough today.  I actually didn't play that well today, tee to green.  I missed a lot of fairways, but I got a bit lucky in that wispy stuff and I made a few great up-and-downs.  I made a lot of very good up-and-downs.  Today it was probably my worst ball striking day, but, yeah, I managed to score well, the putter worked today.
Q. Windy, hot, which means it's dry, we didn't get any rain last night, what is ahead for the people who are playing behind you?RETIEF GOOSEN: Well, actually, less wind.  It was quite breezy this morning out of the north.  Now coming up these last few holes it's completely died.  So it looks like the guys playing this afternoon won't have to deal with the wind, but they are going to have a little bit dryer greens and so on, but today they made sure that there's no low scores out there.  That every pin was pretty much in its toughest position out there today.
Q. What was especially efficient in your game today that made the difference?RETIEF GOOSEN: Getting it up-and-down.  I made a lot of good putts for pars.  A couple of 15 footers for pars.  And that always keeps the round together.
Q. What do you think about trying to get anywhere near the top on Sunday, I mean, is that a reasonable expectation?RETIEF GOOSEN: No, I'm nowhere -- I hope for another, if I can get a nice low round in tomorrow and get myself back in the top, what is it, the top 14 or something, that qualifies automatically next year, because this year's my last year of exemption for the U.S. Open.  So a nice round tomorrow, enjoy it, go out there.  I've had a good run in the U.S. Open and if I make it into next year, great.
