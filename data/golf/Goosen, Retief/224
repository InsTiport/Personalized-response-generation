Q.
Coming back after an injury and you seem to be in pretty good form.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Not really.  I scrambled well today.  I'm pretty happy with the round.  I had a good finish to get a good score.  We'll see if things are going to improve today.
Q.  What kind of things are you working on, just hitting it straighter?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  My swing is a bit raw, feels a bit out of timing.  The timing is way off.  I've got to get into the flow of things again.
