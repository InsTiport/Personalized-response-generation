RETIEF GOOSEN:  I mean, the first few holes I hit it very close and didn't make anything and three putted the 3rd, the par 5.  So it's a very, very disappointing round in a way.  You know, I shot 4 under and it felt like I shot 75.
Q.  I guess that's in context with the first day when you were happy with the way the putter had gone.
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, first round yesterday I made a few putts, especially my first nine holes, and today I couldn't wish it in the hole.  Hopefully tomorrow it'll turn around.
Q.  Just the nature of golf?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I mean, that's how it is.  These greens aren't the best greens, and then in the afternoon they do get a bit bumpy.  I just couldn't get the damn thing to go in.
Q.  I suppose to an extent it's remarkable the course has held up as well as it has and looks as green as it does after the same heat they had in Hoylake?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, it's looking a bit greener now after we had a bit of rain last night, so scoring today was a bit better than yesterday.
Q.  What do you reckon it will take to win this target wise?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I'm probably looking at somewhere around 23 under.
Q.  That's in your own mind?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, if I can get a solid round tomorrow and give myself a chance on Sunday.  Depending on weather obviously, but if it stays like this the scoring is going to be low.
Q.  I'm sure I'm reading too much into this after one victory in Germany last year, but it does seem you enjoy the place?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I love Germany.  I always play golf here.  Hopefully we can add another one.
