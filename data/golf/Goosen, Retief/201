Q.  
You gave Adam a good chase?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I supposed I have to be happy. It's better than third but I would have liked to have putted better this week, especially today. The chances were there to catch him but I didn't take it. Just nine pars on the back nine, missed a lot of putts. Good for him, well played.
Q.  Would have been nice to birdie a hole after you got to within one?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  He bogeyed nine and 10 and 11 was probably an important hole for me to make a birdie there and I didn't and then I made a bad club selection on the par five on 13 and then missed a short one on 15 to get a bit closer but didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t' do it.
Q.  What's next for you?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I'm going back to South Africa for two weeks for a holiday and then I'm back at the Byron Nelson in the US.
