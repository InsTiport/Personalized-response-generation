 Q. We've been hearing that the rough isn't quite what it was last year, gives you a little more of a chance to get up-and-down. Does it feel different to you? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: True, definitely it's shorter rough. A few times I missed the fairway because today I drove it quite nicely. The couple times I was in the rough, it wasn't just a chop-out.

 Q. There's a mental task involved. You want to win this tournament, it's a big one, but you're also looking forward to next week. How do you keep yourself in the moment?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No, I would love to win this week and then take next week off (laughter). It's a big event and we all would love to do well. 

 Q. A terrific opening round. What was the secret to success today? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: I went to go and see Gregor on Monday and Tuesday in Orlando and got in here lunchtime yesterday, hit a few balls and cleared it up this morning. Yeah, ball-striking was a lot better today, holed a few putts early on.

 Q. Give us a sense of playing conditions out there today?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, the course is in great shape. Obviously it's playing long, probably the longest I've seen it play. There's no roll-out in the fairways at the moment, and the greens are soft. So you're coming in with a longer iron but you know the greens are softer.

 Q. Is the rough less penal this year?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Definitely, yeah. It's a little more playable. Last year you just chopped it out. This year you can somehow work something out.

 Q. You've had a mixed bag this year. You've had some good performances and some not so good. Is that because of the transition in your golf technique that you're making?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, it's a combination of everything, a bit of time off, as well. Yeah, it's not been great, but yeah, I've been working on it.
