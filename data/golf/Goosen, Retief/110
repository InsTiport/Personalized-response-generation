   RETIEF GOOSEN: Disappointing round. I could have done better. I never really hit it close enough to the hole. I made a bad mistake on, what was it, 6? I'm going to have to play better on the weekend.

 Q. I know you've been working on your golf swing a little bit. How hard is it when you're in the middle of a round not to think about it?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: It's never easy, but it's starting to feel better. And my putting consistency is still there.
