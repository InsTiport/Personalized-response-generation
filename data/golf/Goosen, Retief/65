 Q. Was it seven bad shots or --
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No, I actually hit a good tee shot, only a wedge into the green and then mis-hit the wedge and chipped it over the green and chipped it and came back down and took about two minutes for the ball to stop moving. It kept moving, just like a slow-motion move. And then actually I got on the green and then two putts. 
 So it wasn't a good way to start unfortunately. You're never really going to come back from that, but I was trying. Would have been nice to birdie the last hole and maybe get in at 6-under and could have only been three behind. But bogeying the last now I'm pretty much out of it.

 Q. That start really put you on the back foot. 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, you always struggle to find your rhythm after that, and it's never easy coming back from a bad start, especially on a course like this.
