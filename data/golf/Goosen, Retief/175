Q.  Three holes, 3, 9 and 12 where you turned it around completely, looked like you might lose and won; was that the key?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I think so.  I've been putting very well all week, seeing the greens very well.  When I stood over one, I always felt like they were going to go in.
Q.  Do you feel any different playing against Tiger than anyone else?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  It's the same as playing with anybody else, it's behind the ropes as you walk around, there's so much noise and stuff getting thrown on you, that you really need to work hard on blocking it out.
Q.  Five points, unbeaten this week, you must be satisfied; did that exceed your expectations?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah, I played very well.  I started playing better in the last few events.  Yeah, it was nice to have a good week.
