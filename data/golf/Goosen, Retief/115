 Q. Welcome to Wentworth Retief, are you looking forward to playing here again?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: "It's nice to be here and hopefully I can finally play well around this wonderful course. It looks like the weather is going to be great and it is good to be at The European Tour's flagship event. The golf course is in great shape and hopefully I can do well this week.

 Q. Are you feeling confident going into the next four days? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN: "I feel like I am playing well at the moment. It is just a pity that this is a course that I have never performed well at so far but hopefully that will change. I feel like I'm coming here in good form and it would be great to win. 

 Q. What does the tournament mean to you Retief?
 RETIEF GOOSEN: "This is our biggest event outside of the Majors so we all want to do well here this week and hopefully I can."
