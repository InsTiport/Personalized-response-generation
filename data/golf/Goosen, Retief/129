 Q.  Retief Goosen, 68.  Talk about the conditions, obviously.  Looks like you warmed up a little bit as the day went on.  How tough was it with the wind? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Tough.  Tough.  That's for certain.  It was nice to, you know, strike the ball quite nicely overall, so I made it a lot easier playing in this wind. 
 Hit it pretty solid on the back 9 and so I got a good round in.  The conditions were tough and so I'll see if I can do that for the rest of the week. 

 Q.  Given the wind and the conditions today, is 2-under, is that good right now for you? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yeah.  2-under is a good score.  I played solid.  I hit a lot of greens in regulation which is nice and the greens are tricky, too.  Tough pins out there, as well, with this wind.  So very happy with the round. 

 Q.  Will conditions like these help you get ready for the Open next week? 
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Oh, obviously, everything, if it plays like this next week.  It was tough.  You know, especially when we teed off I thought the ball was going to move on the greens.  The wind was blowing.  It's tough.  It's great preparation, obviously, for next week.  We'll see what happens this week.
