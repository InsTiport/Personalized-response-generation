  Q. 4-under going into the weekend. Unfortunately, even as good as you're sitting right now, you're going to have to tee off early tomorrow morning. Tell me about your ball-striking today. You said yesterday you weren't real happy with it. Were you a little happier today?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yes, I hit the ball a little bit better today. As it is, this game, one day you make putts and the other day you don't, and today I didn't make a lot of putts. Disappointing all in all. I hit a 5-wood into the bunker there and there was just no sand in the bunker and I couldn't get it up-and-down. So I'm happy where I am, only two behind.  
  
  Q. And the guys that we've talked to earlier that have been playing out here are not crazy about the changes that were made on the golf course. A lot of guys are saying it's really hard, really difficult golf course, especially with the greens, and you're a guy that's known for rolling the rock. How are you feeling about this course overall?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, well, they've had a tough summer. You can see that. The course has suffered. Some of the greens are a little bit on the raw side and the fairways, too. So yeah, it's not easy. The greens, they can't make it too quick because there's not a lot of grass on it. The greens are slow but very firm. Some of the shots downwind there's no chance of stopping them.   
  
  Q. They're expecting a little bit of rain tomorrow. That doesn't change the strategy, does it?  
 RETIEF GOOSEN: No, it sounds like it's going to be rain but no thunder and lightning, so we're going to be playing in it, so it's going to make the course even tougher.
