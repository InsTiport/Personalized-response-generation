  Q. Just talk about the day as a whole, tight match with you and Matt there, just your thoughts on the day.   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I lost the hole first hole to him and then I had a great clip in on the second hole to go all-square. From there on, I played okay, pretty solid. He made a few mistakes, and got 3-up to him very quickly and then he played great for a couple of holes and I made one bad mistake.   
 And, yeah, I had to go -- the first time I went to 18 this week, so first time I played 18 this week since the practice round on Tuesday. It was nice to pull off a win.  
  
  Q. Did either of you have an idea of what was going on around you?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN: At one stage it looked very close. There was a lot of blue on the board, and then suddenly the last four guys, really, seemed to go down, and then pretty much when I finished 17, I knew what was happening.
