 Q.  Long day, tiring day, tough conditions out there?  RETIEF GOOSEN: Yes.  No, it definitely was tricky.  You know, the greens were extremely slow this afternoon.  I suppose with all the rain and the last time they cut the greens this morning, if they even cut the greens today.  I don't know if they did.  I struggled on the greens today, two or three putts, so that's where I lost my shots today was on the greens.   Q.  Still a level par round, you've got to be pleased with that?  RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, no, would have been nice to finish with a birdie on the last but I hit a poor tee shot and a poor second.  But yeah, I mean, we've got a long way to go, and tomorrow is going to be just as tough conditions, so tomorrow need to get a good round on this course in those conditions.   Q.  A lot of guys are going to have to finish up their rounds tomorrow morning.  RETIEF GOOSEN: Yeah, I don't really have any idea what's going to happen tomorrow by the time they go out again.  Threeballs probably, two-tee start, are they going to do it?  But yeah, generally, I would imagine it would be around 2:00, 3:00 tee time, yeah.   Q.  How do you approach that then when you get going in the third round?  RETIEF GOOSEN: You know, just play the course the way you know it should be played.  Try and stay out of the bunkers and try and get it close to the hole.  It's going to get tricky by the sounds of it.  I mean, when the rain came through, it was pretty blustery, especially at the far end of the course it got pretty tough.  So expecting that again tomorrow.  Just if you can drive it well, keep it out of the bunkers, you've got a chance to get it close.
