Q. Who do you feel after that -- it was a bit of a roller coaster?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yes, much the same as yesterday, lots of birdies, lots of bogeys. I didn't play as well as yesterday and whenever I had a bad shot I made bogey and whenever I had a great shot I made the putt for birdie.

Q. Bit disappointed not to pick up any shots on the last three holes?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yes, it was a disappointing finish because you feel like you want to pick up two shots over those three holes so it was a poor finish. I'm four behind now so hopefully I can do something on the weekend.

Q. Does not playing well but still being right in it give you encouragement in a way?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Yes. I don't think anyone is going to run away with it the way the course is playing. Obviously Paul put in a great round this morning, but it's going to be tough on the weekend.
