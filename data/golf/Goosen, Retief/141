  Q.  We can see that you played well today, but where exactly is your game at the moment?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  Ball striking-wise not very good. Putting-wise, very good. I putted really well today, had 21 putts and that will always help your score. Otherwise, I was hitting it a bit sideways. Hit a few good iron shots coming in and hopefully the rust will fall away as the week goes on.   
  
  Q.  How much store do you set in how you play at this time of year?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  I've had a month without any golf, apart from the odd round of two, but you need to take a break and the swing doesn't feel all that settled, but hopefully I can keep it up.   
  
  Q.  Do you set goals?   
  GOOSEN:  I am very keen on playing better this year. I've been working with Gregor Jamieson on the swing and working to give myself a better chance. Last two years my ball striking and putting were bad but I found something in my putting at the end of last season, so I am looking forward to this year.   
  
  Q.  How difficult to topple tiger?   
 RETIEF GOOSEN:  I don't know! If we knew that we would catch him. We need to play better. His game has gone to another level and hopefully this year someone will get hot and give him a bit of a run for his money.
