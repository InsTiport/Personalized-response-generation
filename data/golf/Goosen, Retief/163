Q.  Congratulations.  Your thoughts headed into the third round here?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I didn't play all that solid today.  We didn't do much, me and him.  I thought of maybe cruising in here, and then he made the one on me, and luckily for me he three putted on 17.
Q.  What was that like to think you've just got to lean on him these last few holes, and then all of a sudden one hop?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  I hit a pretty good shot into 16 into 16.  I hit it exactly where I wanted it, just left of the hole, gave myself a chance for birdie and it went straight in.

Yeah, it was a bit    shakes you a little bit knowing what's coming up, and then I didn't hit a good shot in here.
Q.  You said you feel like you didn't play that well today.  Is that one of the nice things about match play, that it all starts over tomorrow, going into tomorrow?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  That's right.  Yeah, tomorrow hopefully we can get back on track.

I actually didn't drive it too badly, but I just didn't make any birdies out there today.
Q.  Luke Donald tomorrow?
RETIEF GOOSEN:  Well, Luke is going to be tough.  It's pretty much guaranteed he's going to hit it down the middle of the fairway every hole, so I need to hit it nice and straight tomorrow and get a bit closer with my irons tomorrow and give myself chances for birdies.
