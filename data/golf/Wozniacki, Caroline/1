  CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   It was fun.   I enjoyed it.   It was a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Your favorite moment?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   You know, it was just‑‑ I just enjoyed it.   It was my first time out here, so, you know, it was just a great experience.  
   
 Q.   And would you trade tennis for this?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.   I think I will stick with my tennis.   
   
 Q.   And who got more attention today ‑ you or Rory?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Rory did, definitely.  
   
 Q.   Were you nervous out there?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, not really.   He kind of put me on the spot, so I didn't really have a ‑‑  
   
 Q.   How often do you get to play?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Not often at all, but I enjoy it.   I think it's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   You were joking with him about the bad reads on the green?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Yeah, that was his fault.  
   
 Q.   What would be the equivalent for him in tennis?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Well, being a ball boy.  
   
 Q.   Did you enjoy that out there?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I really enjoyed it.   I thought it was a lot of fun.   He couldn't blame me for giving him the wrong club.   
   
 Q.   How did she play out there, Rory?   
RORY McILROY:   She did well.   She did great.   It was just great to have her right there.   It was a nice way to spend a Wednesday afternoon.   You know, it's her first time here at Augusta, and I just wanted to show her a good time and I think she really enjoyed it.  
   
 Q.   The best part is you nearly lifting the wrong bag on the first tee?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No.  
   
 Q.   Are you sure?  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   No, I don't think that was me.   
   
 Q.   So is the regular caddie going to get the sack then?   
RORY McILROY:   Maybe for this day every year, yes.  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I would say JP should be nervous.   
   
 Q.   Did he pay you today?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   Of course.  
RORY McILROY:   Yeah, we negotiated a little bit.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I'm a good negotiator, so‑‑  
   
 Q.   And finally, what about that tee shot there at the 9th?   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   My tee shot?   
   
 Q.   Yours.   
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   I don't remember that.   Do you remember that?   
RORY McILROY:   I do actually.   The divot nearly went farther than the ball.   She wasn't warmed up, so I mean it would have been nice‑‑  
CAROLINE WOZNIACKI:   He put me on the spot.  
RORY McILROY:   They get second serves in her sport.
