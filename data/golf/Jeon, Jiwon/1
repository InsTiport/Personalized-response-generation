Q. How is Pinehurst No. 6 playing? What's the difficulty level? Some of the easy parts? What fits your game?
JIWON JEON: Well, I think the fairways, like some holes are pretty tight so you got to find a good landing spot on the course.
And of course here the greens are -- some greens are very tricky here, so you really have to find like good landing spot, and then you need to have a good strategy to play, I mean, avoid the long putts here.
Obviously there is a lot of like slopes on the greens and a lot false fronts, so got to have good distance to the pin, too.
Q. When you can have this consistency out of gate to get to 4-under, do you start to think about climbing the leaderboard?
JIWON JEON: Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, I had some trouble on -- what hole was that?
Q. 15?
JIWON JEON: Yeah, 15. Hit it out of bounds. It was just a bad shot. I mean, other than that, if you really focus on each shot, then this is definitely like doable and then you can go low, I guess.
So, I mean, if I keep playing like this for the rest of week, I'll be fine.
