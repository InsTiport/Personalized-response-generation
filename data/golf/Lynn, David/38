RODDY WILLIAMS:  Birdie eagle finish capped a very good round. Can you start by telling us about those?
DAVID LYNN:  Tee shot off 17 to the right with a 2-iron, behind the palm trees, and had a difficult shot and had get it up, which was quite difficult out of the sand, and pitched it and hit it to about three foot. 
The last one, I hit 3-wood and just tried to take a lot off of it.  Finished just about pin-high to the left, ten feet and holed it. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Third eagle this week.
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, third eagle this week. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Your form has been good since Heineken.  Pleased with your game at the moment?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, just the same, really.  The way I feel isn't great.  I'm hitting it good.  I just keep telling myself not to worry about it and just get on with it, and I'm certainly scoring well.  I'm not really hits disastrous shots, a few pulls but it seems to be fairly tight again.

Q.  Do you find this heat comfortable?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, I've been away for six weeks  and in Australia it's hot -- you get used to it again, like you get used to the cold after ten weeks at home.  It's getting warm now.  This afternoon will get quite hot.  The sun kissing your arms, yeah. 

Q.  Do you feel confident after that Aussie run?
DAVID LYNN:   I am, yeah.  It's a great way to start the year, yeah, to get up there and stay there over the weekend.  I've been quite  on when I have had the lead, just have to focus a little bit more.  I've been on a few leaderboards now over the years and I find that I enjoy it. 

Q. Have you learnt much from those tournaments?
DAVID LYNN:   What I normally do, the way Ernie is going at the moment, you've just got to go as low as you can.  It just seems to depend at the moment.  There's a lot of guys shooting very well. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Thank you very much.
