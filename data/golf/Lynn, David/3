  DAVID LYNN:   It was really good obviously to follow up a round of 65 yesterday.   It's always a little bit more difficult to get a really good score going, and I managed that quite nicely today.   Sort of caught fire early on in the back nine, making a birdie at 11 and eagle at 12.   Got really good break at 14 hitting some rocks and coming back into the fairway but of course you need your breaks and currently sitting on 12‑under which is sharing the lead.   So all in all, really good. 

Q.   And it probably means you chuckled to yourself when you come back off the rocks like that?
DAVID LYNN:   Well, you get enough bad breaks in this game.   You've got to look‑‑ when you get the good breaks, you just say to yourself, well, I deserve the odd good break.

Q.   What's not to enjoy about playing in Portugal, as well, even though the winds have been up a little bit from this afternoon?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, that's to be‑‑ you always know that the wind is going to get up in the afternoons.   You just always get the weather here.   It's stunning blue skies, I haven't seen a cloud all week and long may it continue into the weekend.

Q.   How much better a player are you from your experience in the United States?
DAVID LYNN:   Hard to say really.   I still feel like the same sort of player.   Just going about my business but I guess playing over there, different tournaments, whole different scenario, then you can gain some confidence from it.   I've not really brought it into Europe this year.   I'm sort of in the middle of the year‑‑ I played in Europe where I was a little bit tired.   I played an awful lot at the start of the year and hopefully coming good towards the end of the year. 
I've been enjoying the tournaments I've been getting into and the situations I've been getting myself into, and like I was saying this week, trying to get back into the Top‑50.
