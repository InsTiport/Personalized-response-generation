 Q.   You got to 1‑under today.   Walk me through your round a little bit.   
DAVID LYNN:   Well, a nice birdie down the first and then I had a few chances, but my game wasn't feeling great to be honest.   I was still hitting some nice shots but sort of hanging around there (indiscernible).   
My game started to feel a bit better when I changed to my black rain glove because it was a bit humid out there.   Maybe that's the thing to use it all the way around.  
   
 Q.   I think it's going to be that way tomorrow and then Saturday and Sunday hopefully cool off.   You've had a pretty good run here at the PGA the last five rounds.   To be under par, are you happy with that?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, I mean, it's quite easy to drop shots out there once you start hitting it in the rough.   It's funny, I played all four rounds on last year with a black glove.  
   
 Q.   When you woke up this morning you saw it was a raining a little bit wet, did your mindset change at all for you going into the round?  
DAVID LYNN:   No.   I knew the rough was going to be a bit tougher when it was wet first thing this morning, so it was just a case of trying to keep it out of there.   But you want to do that anyway.  
   
 Q.   How were you off the tee today?   I saw you were playing right around 50percent fairways there?  
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, that's probably about average for me really.   Never been a proper fairway hitter.   I made a couple of mistakes hitting irons off tees which is frustrating.   The short hole on the back nine just a 2‑iron, wedge, I missed the fairway.   Managed to get my wedge on the green and 3‑putted it.
