Q. Good effort, especially with no bogeys.
DAVID LYNN:  Yes, I'm really pleased with that, because there are a couple of tough holes out there. It was a little strange going out there today to be honest, both me and Gary (Emerson), coming off wins and having a week off, we both said we felt a little bit strange, if anything you are put under a little more pressure, different sort of pressure, so to go out there and shoot that, not really feeling great about my game is awesome really. If anything, with the chances I had on the last three holes, I could have gone into the lead really.
Q. Was it a big surprise to shoot 5-under?
DAVID LYNN:  No a big surprise, but it is nice, having felt the way I felt this week. A lot of my time has been taken up shaking hands and stuff and that can take your mind off what you are here to do. But it is nice, don't get me wrong, but I sort of looked forward to going out in the pro-am to have a minute to myself and getting out there again today allows you to have a few more minutes to yourself.
Q. Once you get on the first tee though, the thoughts of Holland must be gone?
DAVID LYNN:  Well, I suppose, but you do think about it and you do still smile about it.
