 Q.   Curious your impressions of the FedExCup so far and the first Playoff event, how this week has gone and how were your expectations meeting how it's going so far?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, I guess you know that you're turning up and it's the start of some big events.   But you know, for me, it's a case of trying to secure my way into the third event, which I'm not safe for.   And then obviously‑‑ well, you know, I could do that this week and secure myself into THE TOUR Championship.       
I guess it's one of those things that you're trying to just build your way up slowly is the way I'm sort of thinking about it, just try and progress, and I guess it's not until the last week that it comes, when the hype really picks up on the FedEx, is the way I'm thinking.   
   
 Q.   With the amount of money you've earned versus 2012, when did you start becoming cognizant of the Playoffs throughout the season?   Was it something you were kind of anticipating or excited about a different type of format?  
DAVID LYNN:   No, for me, it was all about the experience coming over here and it was just, you know, just play.   It's all bonus, really.   I haven't set a full schedule over here, so I was playing my 15 early, and then I was going back to Europe, and it was like, okay, if we can do a bit of damage in those 15, and sort of then I could come back at the end of the year a bit more relaxed, which is what happened, really.   
Yeah, it's exciting.   There's four big events here which all come together to create the FedEx, and you can certainly tell there's a little bit of atmosphere about the fact that we have gone into the Playoffs.   
But like I said, I'm trying to sort of take small steps into insuring that I play in all four.   
   
 Q.   Have you had any experience in the New York area?   
DAVID LYNN:   The only time I've been to New York was last year after the PGA.   PÃ¡draig Harrington gave me a lift to New York because I missed my flight from over there, and so he gave me a lift into New York and I just ended up hiring a limo for the day because my flight wasn't till the evening.   It was a whistle‑stop tour of New York.   That's the only time I've seen the place.  
   
 Q.   What did you do on this whistle‑stop tour?   
DAVID LYNN:   Oh, I wanted to see Ground Zero.   I wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, just driving around all day.   I was pretty tired to be honest after a few hours.   I had not had an awful lot of sleep that night.  
   
 Q.   The day after Kiawah?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Interesting way to celebrate a second place finish.   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, it was nice.   I had my girlfriend with me.   We went for a nice lunch and it was all just a mad dash around, and I think I had to be at the airport for 5:00.  
   
 Q.   How many different places, you went to Ground Zero‑‑  
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, went to the shopping district.   I wanted to see the Chrysler Building, just the sights like you do.   
   
 Q.   Are you in Jersey this week?  
DAVID LYNN:   I'm on this side this week.  
   
 Q.   Have you been over there?  
DAVID LYNN:   No, I haven't.   No.   
   
 Q.   Do you plan on having another whistle‑stop tour?  
DAVID LYNN:   No, it's going to be a bit too‑‑ not enough time.   Need to rest up, really, for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   What score do you think is going to win tomorrow?   What's it going to take?   
DAVID LYNN:   Well, I think someone shot 62 out there today in that wind, which was just like, wow, I don't honestly know.   
It just depends.   I think there's three guys, isn't there, in double digits.   So it just depends how they decide to play tomorrow.   I mean, it could be 15, 16, if one of those puts up a solid round, or it could be 11, 12.  
   
 Q.   Every day there's generally been one big round from one guy who has skyrocketed up the leaderboard.   Could that be you tomorrow?  
DAVID LYNN:   Well, I mean, yesterday, I bogeyed my first hole of the day and then made seven birdies and an eagle, so there's obviously scores to be made out there.   So I suppose that makes for a more exciting finish.   
Yeah, I hope I can pick up those birdies and eagles again tomorrow and then no bogeys.
