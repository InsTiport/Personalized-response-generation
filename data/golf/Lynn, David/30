Q. Thoughts on your round?
A. Very solid. I think I only missed one green and did not make a bogey. It is always pleasing to get around Carnoustie in a decent score. The weather has been perfect. Here and Kingsbarns are the toughest courses if there is any bad weather.

Q. How do you rate your season?
A. I got off to a good start but it has not been great really the last few months. I have been struggling a bit. I have still been making cuts but I have not got myself in a position to win like I have done for the last couple of years. I am still in the top 50 on the Order of Merit but after two decent years I was hoping to move forward a bit more. There are still three events to go so I could turn my season around if I have a good week somewhere.

Q. How did you enjoy the company of Ruud Gullit?
A. It was good, but unfortunately he didn't manage to improve the score!

Q. Do you follow football?
A. Yes. I support Wigan. We had a little chat about a few things. He is a good bloke and good fun.
