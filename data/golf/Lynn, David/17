 Q.   Just talk about your round today and what was going well out there?  
DAVID LYNN:   Well, just played really solid.   Hit a lot of fairways, was hitting a lot of greens, and gave myself plenty of chances.   The greens are fast and especially downhill, and there are a lot of spike marks and footprints, so you've got to be careful.   
Easy to 3‑putt from nowhere as well.   I'm a player that likes to knock it in quite firm from three feet, so having to really tell myself to dial back and just dribble, because you don't want a three‑ or four‑footer back.   So everything was really solid.   
My bogey, hit a nice shot and came up really short and I 3‑putted from just off the green, and other than that I wasn't having trouble anywhere.     
   
 Q.   Starting on the West Coast, is it kind of what you expected so far?   
DAVID LYNN:   It's better than what I expected, making new friends.   The difficult thing I found the first few weeks is more than one course, whereas I sort of have been used to‑‑ because I played European Tour for 15 years, you know every course inside out and that's something I've missed a little bit, and these courses it's just a little bit of an edge maybe for other people who have played it a lot.   Just hope I can sort of start putting a few rounds together.   
   
 Q.   Where is home base for you?   Do you have a place in Florida?   
DAVID LYNN:   My base is my suitcase at the moment, week‑to‑week.   
   
 Q.   If you have an off‑week, have you been going back overseas or staying in the States?  
DAVID LYNN:   My girlfriend came over last week, because I didn't play Pebble, because I'm playing four in a row now and we have a week here in L.A., staying in Santa Monica.   It was a nice week, never been to L.A. before, so hit all the sites and went up to Malibu.
