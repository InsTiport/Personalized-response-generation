  DAVID LYNN:   Good finish in the end.   Managed to knuckle this yesterday, shot 5‑under for the remaining 14 holes.   So it's just a little bit of a reflection on that start yesterday, and how close I've come this week.   
You know, I've got to take the positives out of it, and I needed a good week in there obviously to get my rights up for next year.   I think that should just about do it this week.  
   
 Q.   And you knuckled down the back nine here, you still had a chance with the birdies that you were compiling.   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, I actually thought going into the last four holes, I thought, you know, hell of a four holes here, wouldn't it be great to birdie all four.   I was thinking that would be enough.   
But obviously looking at the scores now, might not.   That was my focus.   I was focussed on trying to birdie the last four, and gave myself‑‑ well, birdied 15 and gave myself a chance at 16 but not to be.   
It's a great golf course.   I was saying the other day, it deserves a Ryder Cup, and it's one of the best courses we play all year.   It demands some good golf.   
   
 Q.   Onwards and upwards from here?   
DAVID LYNN:   I hope so, yeah.   I hear the weather is not going to be too good next week in Scotland, but it was a nice place last year, so hopefully they have got that wrong and we'll have a good week.   
Starting in Germany at the BMW, I knew I was starting to hit a bit of form.   Started the week poorly and managed to finish 12th.   Didn't get anything out of last week, which was a disappointment because I felt good again.   But carried into this week and hopefully carried into next week.
