DAVID LYNN:  Started off fairly good, two early birdies, and then gave them back pretty quick with two 3 putts from 25 feet, which is quite disappointing.  Same thing as I said yesterday;  I've been struggling a little bit with pace and distance, and my first putt from 25 feet was sort of eight feet past.  It was pretty tricky after that, when I had a long putt, I was conscious of the distance.

Then three birdies in a row from the second on my back nine and a couple more chances coming in.
Q.  Apart from having to rub the sleep out of your eyes, any noticeable difference getting up early and playing this course at that time of day?
DAVID LYNN:  No.  It was a nice morning, not quite as much breeze.  It started picking up roundabout sort of the 13th hole, so it wasn't continuous.  They will get some of the wind that we did yesterday afternoon.

But good score again.  You've still got to play well to shoot your scores.  There's some good par 4s out there.
Q.  That wind is picking up again, nobody is going to get that much better.
DAVID LYNN:  Well, you always think that, but it can surprise you.  There's a lot of good players going out there this afternoon, who knows, get the blade going, people are capable of shooting 63s in these conditions.
Q.  A nice position going into the weekend?
DAVID LYNN:  Yeah, so, no complaints.  Will work on my putting this afternoon, take it easy, get ready for tomorrow.
