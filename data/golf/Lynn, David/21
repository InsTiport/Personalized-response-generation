Q.   There are some amazing numbers on the scoreboard.   What's the story behind that?
DAVID LYNN:   Steady bit of golf, really.   Obviously trying not to take on flags when they're cut by runoffs and things like that, and obviously keeping it in the fairways off the tee, it allows you to play where you want to into the greens.   I just played pretty steady and made a few putts, three, four of them.

Q.   Was there a sense coming into this week when you first saw the course that you fancied your chances?
DAVID LYNN:   I have been feeling quite good, yeah.   My game has sort of turned a corner a few weeks ago.   Practice has felt good.   I feel like I'm hitting it well.   Yeah, I came here this week thinking my game feels pretty good, so why not. 

Q.   What about tomorrow and your expectations and goals for that?
DAVID LYNN:   Well, I'd just like to come out just in the same frame of mind as I have done today.   I was pretty relaxed out there.   Obviously it will be a different day tomorrow, so just try to get off to a nice start then hopefully get back in the zone and see if I can post a number.
