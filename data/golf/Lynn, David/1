Q.   First of all, what's it like coming back to the scene of a victory?   Must be pretty special. 
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, obviously you see the shots is that that you were hitting last year, the spots you were hitting from in the fourth round and reliving those moments yeah.   Obviously I'm hoping that there's going to be some sort of inspiration there again to sort of get me going again this week.

Q.   Winner last year, third in 2011, so a course you like to play; what's going to be key to shooting low?
DAVID LYNN:   When you get the morning start times and there's not an awful lot of wind around, you need to capitalise on that and get moving fast and make a few birdies because the scoring is right low around here.   When the wind does come up, obviously you have to manage your ball flight and try to keep picking off some birdies then, too. 

Q.   Any extra pressure being defending champion?
DAVID LYNN:   I suppose there's a little bit but every week comes with its own pressure.   You've got pressure on yourself to try to perform week‑in, week‑out.   So again, I'd like to perform again this week.

Q.   And just finally looking at positions this year, probably not been the best of years as far as you're concerned so you must feel you're due a good performance at some point?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, there is that but I haven't played an awful lot of golf this year.   This is going to be my 13th event in Europe, so to be expected to find myself down my Order of Merit, but this week if I can find a bit of inspiration from last year and crack on, who knows, maybe go back‑to‑back.
