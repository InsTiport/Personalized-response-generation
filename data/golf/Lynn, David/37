 RODDY WILLIAMS:  David, very well played.  You're in a three-way tie for the lead going into tomorrow.  Give us your thoughts on today's round and tomorrow.
DAVID LYNN:   It took me eight holes to get going today.  I was really struggling over the first six.  The back nine, I had a different thought and started to hit a few shots.  I started to putt well towards the end, after a couple of 3-putts early on. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  What made the difference? 
DAVID LYNN:   Just trying to keep more height through my swing through impact. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Joint leader going into tomorrow, Ernie Els and Alastair.
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, great place to be.  Good challenge.  I'll be playing just before, so all eyes will be on Ernie at the back, so I can just go out and try to see what I can do, really. 

Q.  The course was much tougher today?DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, the greens, as well.  On the first green I said to my caddie, I said to my caddie, "These look a good yard quicker."  I 3-putted I think. 

Q.  Were you saying you haven't played as well over the weekend as you would have liked?
DAVID LYNN:   I would not say I haven't played as well as I would like, but I'm just not really going low enough.  That's what you've got to do.  You've just got to keep going forward. 

Q.  So from that today was encouraging?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, it's very important to stay up there.  It gives me a chance tomorrow to just go out and just play hard and try to make some early birdies. 

Q. Was there a fear that Ernie would run away with it today?
DAVID LYNN:   There's always that fear at the moment. He's always up there at the moment.  It doesn't seem to be happening.  I mean, the scoring in general didn't look too good today.  So it's going if it's going to be the same sort of thing tomorrow, it's anybody's guess, really, what it's going to take. 

Q.  Are you excited about what might lie ahead tomorrow?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, it's great.  Dubai Desert Classic, it doesn't get much better than that.  I'm looking forward to it.  It's a great challenge. 
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Thank you very much.
DAVID LYNN:   Cheers.
