 Q. Have you had any like that before? 
 DAVID LYNN: Probably, I can't remember. That was just a great shot down 8, just down the stick. Rolled just to the back of the green and caught the slope and went off down the left. It was just like a horrible putt from there, which I 3-putted. Then hit two great shots straight into the flag on the last and very nearly three-footed that, as well. 

 Q. The other nine was good, wasn't it, great start, 6-under. 
 DAVID LYNN: The first nine I was just hitting it nice and then just holing the putts. 

 Q. Eagle what did you do?
 DAVID LYNN: I hit it.

 Q. What did you do on the eagle on 18? 
 DAVID LYNN: I hit it to just on the left fringe just past pin-high. Putted in from there. 

 Q. Somebody who has never been 7-under par in his life, what's it like to do be 7-under par and then do something like that? 
 DAVID LYNN: It's like a noose around and pulling myself up. That's how I was feeling. I was still 5-under, wasn't I, and that's just the cycle. As I say if I just birdie to go to 5 -- you have a double, so that's a five. I felt like I could really get a good one in. But, that happens. 
 This season, started to play well and got some confidence going. I've had three Top 10's in five weeks and pulled my intercostal muscles and haven't got my confidence back since then.
