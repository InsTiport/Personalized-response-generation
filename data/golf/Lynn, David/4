  DAVID LYNN:   Wanted to get out of the traps quick and did just that, birdieing three of the first four.   Picked another one up but things went stale.   The 18, my 9th, that was disappointing and dropped me back to 3â€‘under.   Managed to find a few birdies towards the end, so 65 is nice and puts me in a nice position.  
   
 Q.   After the illness of last week at the Seve Trophy, I have to ask how you are.   
DAVID LYNN:   I was feeling good yesterday, better, and then this morning I wasn't feeling too clever again.   It's just one of those things, the more of the days pass, you hope the more you're getting over it.   But 65 cures any elements.   
   
 Q.   You probably think the sunshine cures ailments, but makes it pretty hot when you're not feeling at your best.   
DAVID LYNN:   Well, it's a nice thing.   The sun is going to help, as well.   It is quite beautiful out here, ever since I got here Tuesday, and it's set to continue well into the weekend and I'm looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   An event you like, enjoy coming here?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, I always like coming here.   Staying in the hotel, Tivoli just up the road and I've done well here in the past.   I think three years ago I finished third when Tom Lewis won.   
   
 Q.   As a man who spent so long in the States across the season, is it nice to be back on The European Tour amongst all the friends and stuff?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, it's always great to come back and have a bit of craic with the lads and banter.
