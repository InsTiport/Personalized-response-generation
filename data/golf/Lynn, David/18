  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   David, welcome.   If you can just start us off by going back a few weeks and what's been going on since the PGA, if you can reflect on that, the week itself and what's gone on since.
DAVID LYNN:   Just prior to that, I had two weeks totally away from the golf course at home.   I protected my World Ranking position by not playing in Austria, so that I got into the PGA, which I found out Tuesday the week before.   It was at that point, I thought, I'd best start doing some practise now. 
Didn't do an awful lot of practise and went to Kiawah and practised again.   I had one practise round, which is what I do at every tournament.   I know a lot of guys like to practise quite a lot when they turn up at a major but the two I've played in, I try to treat them the same as a normal event, and just have one practise round. 
That went well, and then obviously came out on the Saturday and shot 68, which threw me right up there into the Top‑10.   What surprised me was how calm I felt on the Saturday, shooting that score and turned up on the Sunday and just thought it would be great too get into the same mental state as I was yesterday.   I did just that, and I was absolutely calm and just enjoyed it. 
I enjoyed the crowds out there, were brilliant.   I enjoyed having a bit of banter with a few of them, because they do like to try to talk to you, as well, which I guess it might be a bit different if you were playing really bad.   I might not take on as many as I did, but I enjoyed that.
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Any memorable exchanges? 
DAVID LYNN:   On the Saturday, I walked up to get some water and there was half a dozen guys sat there drinking beer and they said, do you want a beer and I said, I would love a beer, but I'm working.   And, in fact, I would love a glass of red, and they just started doing that, for my red wine. 
The following day, it did make me laugh going up the same hole, I was walking up the fairway, the same guys were shouting over to me, Lynny, do you want some red wine, and they are all going like that which was really funny.   When I came off the 18th, as well, I was walking over the bridge to do my card, they were all under the bridge doing it again, more red wine.   (Laughter).   So it was funny. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   How has the reaction been back at The European Tour and back at home? 
DAVID LYNN:   I had the same party I had if I had won, my house was full for three days solid.   Yeah, reaction has been brilliant.   It's sort of a win for the underdogs, really and I've enjoyed it.   It's still quite surreal.   I have to sort of pinch myself that I've done what I've done, but I've said before, that I've known that I have some golf in me that's capable of doing some good stuff but tapping into it is infrequent, which is the frustrating part about the game. 

Q.   Did you discover on the Monday‑‑ the happy state of calm that you found on Saturday that you didn't know how you had done it but you found it again on Sunday, so what's the answer? 
DAVID LYNN:   I don't know what the answer is.   I just felt really comfortable.   It's obviously a combination of all sort of things that are going right at the time, because I don't tap into it every time I play golf like that.   It doesn't happen like that.

Q.   How would you describe how you felt before the Saturday? 
DAVID LYNN:   Sometimes I might be anxious how my game feels and it's just maybe trying to play a bit defensive, whereas I was just real calm about things and I was just‑‑ the golf swing was flowing, and I was hitting all of the shots that I wanted to. 

Q.   You spoke yesterday about your frustration of The Ryder Cup qualifying, do you have to take inspiration from Edoardo Molinari who came here two years ago and won the event and got himself The Ryder Cup?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, of course we can think about that.   And it would be lovely to come out and emulate that.   But you know, first thing's first.   Got to turn up tomorrow and I can't qualify tomorrow or win the tournament tomorrow, but I can certainly lose it. 
You know, my track record says that I've only won once in 371 starts, as everyone keeps telling me, so the odds of it happening are quite slim.   Obviously I have thought about that and I have thought about how nice it would be to do, that but just to be talked about in the conversation when it comes to The Ryder Cup, is nice in itself. 

Q.   The bunker shot on 18 in the last round, was that the shot of the week for you?   Did you know where you stood and that you needed to get a par to finish second? 
DAVID LYNN:   I knew I was second and I watched Poulter putt out and I thought his putt was for birdie so I didn't realise I was in sole possession of second.   
Yeah, it was 7‑iron, cut about 180 yards, and it never left the flag.   Tee shot into 17 in the last round, I hit 5‑iron, which just went straight as an arrow, 20 feet left of the stick.   That really is quite intimidating. 

Q.   With the points system, how disappointing was it when you found out‑‑
DAVID LYNN:   I actually wasn't disappointed because I thought it was mathematically impossible when I turned up, anyway.   That's what I had in my head.   So I sort of got the news all in one that Peter had pulled out and you could have got in, but now you can't.   So that's where I was at. 

Q.   Looking forward to going to Augusta next year‑‑ inaudible. 
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah‑‑ that is a good question, I can't answer it. 

Q.   On a serious note, your schedule next year, will you play the week before Augusta? 
DAVID LYNN:   Well, I know this is the bizarre thing how the doors have opened up, because I believe I've got my U.S. Tour card, as well, next year, so it's just a case of getting everything down on paper what I can do.   The U.S. Tour is something that's not really interested me over the years, or else I would have tried, gone and qualified. 
Even still now, the thought of having to relocate over there; I know there's a lot of impetus for going and doing it, but is it still what I want to do; because I still want to enjoy myself at the end of the day and I enjoy playing in Europe, and the camaraderie that we have out here. 
It's not good for the Tour if guys all keep playing in America n all the time.   There's going to come a point where‑‑ not that I'll make much difference, but if guys just have that attitude all the time, like I've got the right to go and play over there, I've got in over there or I'm going to go and play over there, it seriously doesn't do a lot of good for The European Tour in the future. 
I've not made that decision of yet but when I've got everything down on paper‑‑ but as my head stands at the moment, the likelihood is that I won't.   That's my initial gut reaction.

Q.   Based on that, do you feel this requiresfewer events in Europe to play in The Ryder Cup ‑‑
DAVID LYNN:   It's the fact that you've got those World events and those Majors which make up eight‑‑ or is it 12 that you need these days?   So you can certainly get most of it done out of those.   Guys come over for Wentworth and a few of the other bigger ones‑‑ it is a vicious circle where America keeps getting stronger and Europe keeps getting weaker.   All of the guys in America play in golf tournaments with more World Ranking points, so it never gives us a chance to catch up, which the players could help it if they looked at it that way.   But it's quite a selfish game in that respect and I suppose with everyone else doing what is best for them, I have to look at what's best for me. 

Q.   Weren t you bitten by a scorpion once?
DAVID LYNN:   That was a long time ago.   It was in the bed, as well.   I still managed to finished fourth that week. 

Q.   Away from the Tour, what is it like for you in Britain?   What do you enjoy doing over here? 
DAVID LYNN:   I enjoy just pottering about, going to the gym.   I've recently got involved in a sort of‑‑ well, for the last few years, I've been sort of learning about the property world, as well, and it's been something that I've been looking to get into for quite some time.   I've recently started getting into some stuff, started traveling around and looking at a few bits and bobs and going to auctions and things like that. 

Q.   Do you do it yourself‑‑
DAVID LYNN:   It's a mixture but depends what comes up to be honest with you. 

Q.   What can you do‑‑
DAVID LYNN:   Nothing like that.   Where we are at at the moment, there's a lot of stuff‑‑ well, it's a business.   So it's something that I've been really interested in for a long time.   And it's only recently‑‑ it was more so for should I end up finishing playing golf, and what am I going to do.   And I've sort of started‑‑ I've done a lot of research over the years and now I've started actively purchasing at auctions and stuff. 

Q.   What have you bought? 
DAVID LYNN:   I bought 14 flats about eight weeks ago.   I've got some commercial premises, as well. 

Q.   Do you watch all of these property programmes? 
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, half‑heartedly.   It's different sort of stuff.   I'm trying to get stuff that's gone into repossession and stuff like that.   

Q.   Where are the flats? 
DAVID LYNN:   They are in Lancaster‑‑ I've given too much away‑‑ (laughter).   No, they are tied up at the moment.   That's probably where I'd better leave it. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Many thanks and good luck this week.
