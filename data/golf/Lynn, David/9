Q.   You finished the first round even par, second round 65, you have to be proud of that?
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, made bogey on 10, wasn't the best start to the round.   I hit a great shot into the par3, 11th, in there close, and that just sort of started‑‑ it was a bit of a birdie, bogey run with an eagle thrown in there. 
I think I had five birdies and an eagle today, so there was plenty of fireworks going on.   Then a few dropped shots, as well.   So delighted with that. 

Q.   How many holes did you play overall today? 
DAVID LYNN:   I had ten holes to finish off this morning, so 28 holes. 

Q.   Would you have preferred to do what you did, or like some of the guys that played the first wave? 
DAVID LYNN:   I think the thing with yesterday was playing with no wind, and then we turned up this morning‑‑ well, there was a breeze in the final ten holes, and then obviously for the whole of the second round, we had a bit of breeze, which is still left for those guys teeing off now.
I guess I'd have preferred teeing off the way we have and we've got it all done now, so we can look to the weekend now. 

Q.   Nice finish, hit it stiff on 8 for a kick‑in birdie and pretty dramatic par on 9.
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, shocking second shot there.   It's such an easy flag, as well, because everything feeds into it from the right, and of course that was the last words from my caddie.   So what do I do?   I go and pull it left into no lie at all to get it close and make the putt.
