DAVID LYNN: Played quite nicely again today. Kept it on the fairways which is the key here. If you do that you can hit it close. Didn't hole anything outrageous and missed quite a few as well.

Q.  You've stayed close to Thomas?

DAVID LYNN: I was trying not to think of that and play my own game. You've got to keep it on the short stuff or you can start making bogeys right, left and centre. Augurs well for the weekend, especially after my practice. I wasn't quite firing until the second nine of my  practice round and I was thinking it was going to be very tough but things have dropped nicely into place. I had two struggling weeks in South Africa but I've worked hard on things. I've hit it on the fairways and hit it close but the putter has let me down a bit. It's tough reading the grain. You allow too much or too little for the grain.

Q.  (Season?)

DAVID LYNN: You just keep try to improve and give yourself chances and hopefully one day.I learned a lot from two years ago when all I was trying to do was win and if I didn't have a chance I basically wasn't interested. If I was off the lead, mentally I became disinterested. This year coming out I am trying to play my own game and try as hard as I can. I've written out a few goals but I will keep them to myself.
