 Q.   Well played especially through the green mile for the week.   I mean what is it with David Lynn and those last three holes?   
DAVID LYNN:   Well, to be honest with you, I've been scrambling all week.   I can't say as I've been flushing it tee to green, so just another three holes for me.   Yeah, I had a couple of chip‑ins down there, one today on 16, and then a good one yesterday on 17.   In fact, I chipped in on 18 as well, I think day two.   So, yeah, I chipped in at hole 3 there.   
So, yeah, it is tough, just grinding away.   Probably because it's not a ball striking sort of week, it's probably helped me.  
   
 Q.   It appears that scrambling and short game is the key this week as Phil Mickelson is leading the field in putting and getting up‑and‑down, and you're tied with him right now.   Your thoughts if it goes to a playoff?   
DAVID LYNN:   Yeah, a playoff, anything can happen.   It's going to be tough with the weather.   Yeah, fingers crossed, I hope to get in a playoff and give it a go.
