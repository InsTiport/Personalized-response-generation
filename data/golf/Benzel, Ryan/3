  Q. What was today's story?   
 RYAN BENZEL: Same as yesterday. Just I drove it better today but didn't putt well. Didn't hit good iron shots when I needed to. Just same as yesterday.   
  
  Q. What will you take out of this?   
 RYAN BENZEL: Well, not much from the golf really. (Laughter) Just enjoyed the week. It was a lot of fun. Hazeltine's tough. It played a lot harder in the tournament than I expected it to after the couple practice rounds. It's a good golf course. It's hard.   
  
  Q. What else will you play in the rest of the year?   
 RYAN BENZEL: I have a sectional championship at home and then I'm on the PGA Cup team, so I'll play that in September. A couple of small things at home. Our season really winds down end of September.   
  
  Q. Will you go to Q-School?  
 RYAN BENZEL: Yeah, I'm exempt second stage. Just got to keep playing golf.   
  
  Q. Did you learn anything on what you need to work on?   
 RYAN BENZEL: Yeah, well, I've been inconsistent all year. I need to -- whether it's been putting or irons or ball-striking, I've been inconsistent, so I need to get better at it, improve my consistency and just putt better. If I putt better I do have better scores, not great scores, but better.
