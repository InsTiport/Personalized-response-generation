Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Not really, I was definitely the most nervous I've ever been on the golf course this morning when I looked up at the grandstand and it was just packed.  And Darren walked on in front of me and the roar was just unbelievable.
I was very nervous for the first and the second.  I birdied the second, it set me in a little bit.  And just enjoyed it really from there on in.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, we kind of just -- I just didn't want to put myself out of the tournament on the first day, show like a big number or something.  Obviously I bogeyed 16 and 17.  They're playing tough, and I'm sure there will be a few bogeys there today.
All in all I'm fairly happy with the score.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, 4 o'clock alarm.  That isn't great.  I wouldn't get up, only for this.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I saw that.  Darren said I think we were 1 and 2 or something, so it was pretty cool.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: It's a proper links.  The good shots will be rewarded, bad shots will be punished.  I didn't feel like I stroked my irons that great today.  Something to work on maybe later this evening if the rain stays away.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I putted fairly decent.  I wasn't doing anything too crazy.  I was pretty happy with the putting.  I left a couple short.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Don't hit it out of bounds.  I was on the range this morning and my thought was -- and thankfully I hit a good drive.
Q. You and Darren seemed to be talking quite a lot as the round went on.  Was it mentor-mentee?
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, he was an absolute gent for the whole round.  On 9 I had a 4-footer and he tapped his putter off my back and was like, Role that one in.  He was an absolute gent for the whole round.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I've never heard roars like that on a golf course before.  From the first to the 18th it was just incredible.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, a heard a couple of lads, a couple of voices that I definitely recognized.  On the 17th tee was a giveaway.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I didn't really want to look up too much because I didn't really want to be going over to them.  So I kept my head down, obviously delighted to hear them.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: It was unreal.  Even hitting the second shot in, I remember we came around the corner and I said, That is ridiculous.  It was just packed.  From end to end it was just jammed.  It was classic.  So I've played in front of a few people before, but nothing like on this scale.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, it stopped after five or six holes.  Then through 9 I was doing okay.  I was like, There's nothing to be nervous about.  It was really on the first and second I was a bit nervous.  Other than that I tried to be a bit cool.
I can't wait for tomorrow, though.  I can't wait to not set the alarm at 4 o'clock, as well.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, it was kind of the same.  On a few holes I hit it left on 16 and there was people like as close as I am to you away from me.  So it was kind of like Portmarnock but on just a way bigger scale.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, it was definitely a good experience at Portmarnock, without a doubt.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, definitely.  The 3-wood into 12, hit a 3-wood into 12.  I had 245 meters, and hit off to the left.  My caddie Conor was just, Hit it at the TV tower, on the left edge of it.  I usually fade the ball.  I knew it was going to fade and I was just straight on it.  And it was probably one of the best I've ever hit, to be honest, with the wind and everything.  Hit it maybe 16 feet.  And the eagle putt sat on the lip, I still don't know how it didn't drop.  That was probably the best shot of the day.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I probably -- I want to watch a bit of Tiger, really.  I love Tiger, so I want to watch a bit of Tiger.  Then I'll hit a few balls.  I don't think he's off until the afternoon.  I'm going to get some lunch, maybe go back to the apartment for a bit and watch a little bit of Tiger and do some practice.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: It's definitely lived up to what I thought it was going to be, if not surpassed it.  The crowds playing yesterday, but today blew it out of the water completely.  Obviously Darren being from here, everyone loves him and all the fans are very respectful.
Q. (Inaudible.)
JAMES SUGRUE: Yeah, I hit 9-iron.  I saw Darren hit it right so I better do the same.  So I hit it kind of just on that line.  I thought it was too far right, and he was, Oh, no, that's fine.  And it was fine.  And I just kind of left the putt just short.  I was happy with it.
