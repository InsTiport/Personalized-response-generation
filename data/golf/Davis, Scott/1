  Q. Can you describe some of the emotions you have the last couple days for your debut?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: Yeah, well starting off the Tournament I was nervous. I was nervous mostly because the golf course is very difficult. And I didn't really have my swing this week, so without having a swing and a tough golf course, that will make you nervous.  
  
  Q. Did you feel like the conditions were a bit easier today compared to yesterday afternoon?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: Absolutely. The morning conditions were definitely easier than yesterday. We played the last group off and this morning the greens were softer and a little bit slower.   
  
  Q. Did you have a certain mindset or maybe a swing thought you were thinking about today?   
 SCOTT DAVIS: I was just trying to drive the ball in the fairway. You got to shape your drives. And I was trying to hit the fairways. It's a tough driving golf course.  
  
  Q. Did you have a certain club that maybe you felt most comfortable with?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: I putted pretty well. I wanted to just try and get on the greens, which was difficult to do.   
  
  Q. Well, if you're putting good, that's the most important part, so, yeah. Thank you very much.   
 SCOTT DAVIS: Thank you.
