  Q. This is your first Senior PGA Championship, what were your thoughts coming into today?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: Well, I was hoping that I could play well enough to make the cut. But you have to be hitting the ball a lot better than I did. This golf course is really hard, really difficult, and I just didn't hit it good enough.  
  
  Q. Are you going to change anything up for tomorrow? Change the strategy or anything?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to try to find my golf swing.  
  
  Q. When you talk about the course being hard, your first nine holes, you made some doubles, was that just nerves or the course?  
 SCOTT DAVIS: No, I had two 3-putts and I made a bogey and a double bogey on the two par-5s. That's what did it.
