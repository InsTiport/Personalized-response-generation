   STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Stewart, thanks for coming down.  One of only three under par scores today and I think it's the first below 70 since Thursday.  What are your thoughts after a fine round of golf? 
 STEWART GINN:  Yes, it's not easy out there, as all you guys know.  It's a course you have to be patient with and do the best you can out there.  Do the best you can. 
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Tell us about your caddie this week, Alan (Morin). 
 STEWART GINN:  Well, he goes back, I met Alan about 1970-something when I played The Open here, with the Aussie contingent, Bob Shearer, Ian Stanley.  We stayed with Alan's father, and they are from Gullane. 
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Is it true this is the first time you've seen him since? 
 STEWART GINN:  Yes, first time yes.  He's a local boy, I trust him out there, he tells me where to aim it and it's good.  

 Q.  What is his surname? 
 STEWART GINN:  Don't ask me that, I knew you'd ask me that.  That, I can't give it to you, sorry. 

 Q.  How has your season been up to now this year? 
 STEWART GINN:  I've had a few chances early on in the year but I haven't nailed one over yet on The European Tour, but looking forward to have crack tomorrow again. 
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  You've been on this stage before, winning the Ford Senior players in 2002. 
 STEWART GINN:  Yeah, had a good time in America with that, it was lovely in Detroit.  Those boys know how to play hard, so I feel this is a little bit on our turf now.  I feel this is a bit more my turf.  It's hard to beat them over there this their place, but it's just nice.  Looking forward to it. 

 Q.  Was this Alan your caddie back in 1972? 
 STEWART GINN:  No, he was a boy. 

 Q.  
 STEWART GINN:  This year? 

 Q.  How did you first meet? 
 STEWART GINN:  An old professional golfer from this area, from Gullane was the head professional in Barwon Heads in Australia, Barwon Heads Golf Club, by the name of Bud Russell.  Bud was staying over here doing some business and he was a great golfing Scotsman and he introduced us to the family. 

 Q.  Where are you based at the moment? 
 STEWART GINN:  Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur.  Still commuting. 

 Q.  What's your experience on links golf courses? 
 STEWART GINN:  I played a bit over the years.  I haven't done stoutly well on links, but I guess as you get older, you mature a little bit and you sort of understand it a little bit more. 
 But I've played here probably since the 70s on and off, and it's been a lot of fun.  I've always enjoyed links golf courses. 

 Q.  What's the largest cheque you've won? 
 STEWART GINN:  I would say the Ford.  The one in Japan, that was 300,000 plus, but I guess the Ford Senior was close to 400, so I guess that was the biggest check. 

 Q.  Were you concerned when you started with two bogeys? 
 STEWART GINN:  No, because I know -- I know everyone is going to make bogeys, and it's got to be a patient week.  You are going to make bogeys out there.  I mean, there's no question of that.  So you just have to be patient.  I mean, you've got some of the best senior players in the world here.  I mean, Watson is an Open champion, Mark O'Meara -- I know who's here and what it's going to take.  

 Q.  Would this be a bigger win for you than the Ford Senior? 
 STEWART GINN:  Yes, I think any -- this is an Open Championship, just like what was was played last week, and I think everybody, doesn't matter any part of the world, this is an Open Championship.  Ford Senior is not an Open Championship.  I class the majors, this as a major, yes.  

 Q.  Do you think about who is chasing you tomorrow? 
 STEWART GINN:  Too many bloody boys out there chasing tomorrow.  No, I haven't got time to think about that now, haven't got time.  What's going to be is going to be.  You've just got to play golf and you're in the golf God's hands, so just got to play golf. 
 STEVEN FRANKLIN:  Play well tomorrow.
