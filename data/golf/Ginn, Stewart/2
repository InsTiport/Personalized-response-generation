 Q. Well played Stewart, a great round in the conditions, what was the key? 
 STEWART GINN:  Staying patient. You've got to be patient - 15 or 20 under is not going to win this week - so you keep it in play and if you take a bogey, take a bogey, and keep at it. I made a fantastic eagle on the 5th - hit a seven wood to two and a half feet, and two great birdies on 16 and 17 to make up for 14 and 15. 14 I hit into the last bunker on the left, so had to take my medicine, and on 15 I three putted. But great to respond with those two birdies, and I just tweaked my six iron on the last. Shame to finish with a 5, but we're in contention. 

 Q. Tell me about your caddie and old friend, Alan Morin. You've not seen him for over 30 years, but you're working together for the first time here at Muirfield, and doing well as a new pairing. 
 STEWART GINN:  Yeah, we go back to 1972 and Open qualifying for the Open here. I came over with a few Aussie pro's, Jack Newton, Ian Stanley, ? Shearer, and stayed at Alan's father's place in Gullane. So I thought I'd ask him to come on the bag. He knows this course far better than me, he lives in Gullane, and it's working well so far. We're both enjoying it. It's exciting. We're right in it, so we'll just have to see what happens over the weekend.
