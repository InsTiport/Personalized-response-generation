RODDY WILLIAMS:  Miguel, thank you very much for joining us, two shots off the lead and a lovely way to finish.  Tell us about your round today.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I played well.  It's difficult today under these conditions.  You know, there's rain, wind, stop the rain, cold.  I finished very well.  I birdied the 16th, two shots and a putt from six meters.

Then the 17th I hit a driver and a nice 3-wood and I holed a putt from 40, 50 meters there.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  It was a good up-and-down on the last, as well.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Good up-and-down on the last, and also make some chips on the golf course.  That's good.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  You're clearly suffering from a cold, and this weather no doubt doesn't make it better.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, I feel now cold, I feel bad.  I don't feel very good.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Two shots off the lead at the halfway stage, a good position to be in.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, it's not far away.  It's difficult to play and you never know what's going to happen.  I go to the golf course and I'm just trying to play as smooth as I can, on the limits of my energy, not to push myself to do anything.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  You feel like you're on the limits of your energy --
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  When you feel like -- you are not feeling well, it's difficult.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  You had a week off last week after the Ryder Cup.  Is this some of the after-effects?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, it's the flu.  You take the medicine, everything is push it down.  I'm strong like a rock.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  You've come close to winning this tournament once before, lost a playoff in 98, 99.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yeah.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  Would it be nice to go one better this year?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Hopefully I can make it up, yes, it should be good.
Q.  Do you feel that you're underestimated maybe as a player by people in general?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  That is not because me.  I love myself everybody, but maybe because you don't write enough for me.  It's not my problem, it's your problem that you don't write enough.

You know, everything happens -- depending is behind who your back, who is looking for your back, you are more or less, and you know that about me.  Miguel Angel thinks about what happens to other people, and it appears different from what you are sometimes, or sometimes it doesn't appear, like myself.  But here we are, 16 years on Tour.  I'll keep going.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  And playing very well this year.  You've won more tournaments than anybody else this year on the European Tour.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Four times on the Tour, yeah, but the people, you like to talk -- you write more or less.  You always like to see the same people.  It's not my fault.
RODDY WILLIAMS:  We'll write about you if you win on Sunday.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Of course, but people don't say you want to write for me, for your magazine?  No.
Q.  Are you planning on playing the Madrid Open in a couple of weeks?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I will try to play Madrid Open, yes.  I have a week off this week and then I go to Match Play, and then we play Madrid Open and the Volvo Masters.
Q.  How about the World Cup in Sevilla?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yes, with my people behind me.  I live one and a half hours from there.  I will play there at home, yes, I will.
Q.  Are you looking forward to playing with Sergio in the World Cup?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yes, of course.  We play very well, partners.  I will hit the irons and he will play from the tees, no?
Q.  Everybody has praised the greens, the condition of the course, and for Ireland on the 1st of October.  How do you rate the greens?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I think it's great greens, but it's raining too much, and all these leaves are coming today and everything.  It's quite soft, the golf course.  This course probably it's nice to play with a little bit less water, you know.  It's raining too much and you can't do nothing about that.  I think it's a great golf course, and the greens, they are superb.
Q.  Aside from the golf, you have, without question, the best golf shoes of any golfer on Tour.  I'm just curious as to do you get them specially made?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, these are made from an Italian guy in Milano, Nubuloni, very nice.  It's like a glove for your hand, it's a glove on your feet.
