  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, it's a little boring the first nine holes, no pars, no birdies, nothing happened there.   A few chances for birdies, first, second, and then the fourth, fifth.   But you know, I was playing well, hitting well, not putting very, very close to the hole, I have to say that, too.   But always chances, four, five, six metres.
At the end I make a birdie from four metres on hole No. 10, first birdie and then I make a long putt, eight metres on 13 for a birdie, the two birdies I make all day.   Not satisfied but happy. 

Q.   And the last?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I made a very good save on the one on the last.   I hit my 3‑wood, just blocked it a little bit and then I had to play a slice, jumped a little bit from the club and then a very good recovery and chip to a metre. 

Q.   Your playing partner said it was a little trickier on the greens today and couldn't get the pace. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's difficult because you can see the ball and the greens moving to one side and then moves to another side but then the ball is not doing what you expect it to do. 
But you know, I believe it's the same for more people and we have to deal with that, too. 

Q.   You said you were looking to enjoy this.   I take it you're excited about the position you find yourself in? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I'm fine.   I'm fine.   I love to be in contention.   It's been a long time since I've been there and I'm happy and I like this golf course.   I like to be in contention on this golf course and you have to have patience and let everything happen.   And that's what's going to happen tomorrow, stay patient because anyone can win. 

Q.   Nice to have young men contending with you, Zhang and Campbell up there. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, we are all in our 40s, no. 

Q.   As I say, young. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   When I show up there with Manassero, he made 6‑under par today, no, he played very well, he was just in the mood.   And, well, going to be very interesting tomorrow, the final.

Q.   Any indication of a winning score?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Maybe 13 probably if the weather is like today, 13‑, 14‑under par probably.
