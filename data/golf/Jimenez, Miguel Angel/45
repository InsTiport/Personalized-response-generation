  SCOTT CROCKETT:   Start with you, give us your thoughts as you look ahead to first day of play tomorrow.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   I think very consistent players, very consistent‑‑ players on that team, they have played really well.   I think that a couple of matches, maybe it's an important one.   
I know one side, we do have a bit of mysterious pairing, but facing Paul Lawrie, we all know how good he is on the greens and with Steve Gallacher there, another consistent player.   We will have to wait and see.   
And then the third match, Paul Casey is very good.   Simon Khan is a very consistent player from tee‑to‑green.   I think that all the matches are pretty close to be honest.   
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Miguel, you're the only player to play in every Seve Trophy, give us your thoughts on that and also your match tomorrow.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's a great honour to be playing all the matches in the Seve Trophy.   And playing with Thomas, we know Thomas, he shot very well and we played together many times and we both are hitting very well now.   Tomorrow will be a nice match, because Stephenand Paul, they both play very well.   It's going to be a very solid match tomorrow.   It's going to be very interesting.   At the end, we are going to see if we get the points.   We hope tomorrow that we can get the first point for us.   That's what we are looking for.   
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Gregory, nice cheer from the home supporters, must be nice for you making your debut in this event in your home country.   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, first time I've played the Seve Trophy.   Like Miguel, it's a big honour to be in that team and I'm very proud to be in that team because in the name of Seve, he was an amazing player.   And I watched him many times on TV.   I met him once and I will remember a long time this moment.   He was very different, even when he was at the end of his career; I saw him during the Spanish Open and I've never seen another player with the charisma like this on the ball.   It was amazing, so charismatic.   
And I remember also the bunker shot he made‑‑ every shot, I've never seen that before and after him, and he was at the end of his career, and not the best time.   
But so especially for this, I'm very proud to be here and also to have a captain like JosÃ© Maria is also a big honour for me because he's a friend of mine and he's helpful for me.   He's a great champion, one of the best we have in Europe and one of the most‑‑ he's very, what do you call, he's simple and very kind with everybody.   
He's also like Seve, a special one and I'm very proud to be in this team.   And I do my best this week in France and to be playing in my first Seve Trophy with JosÃ© Maria as my captain, it's an honour for me and I will do my best in the competition.   
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Two recent winners on Tour, yourself and Joost, are you looking forward to playing with Joost?   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Yeah, I think it's going to be a good team.   I don't know him very well but he's in good form and I won also recently, and I think, yeah, together we like this course and we need just to hole more putts than today, because in the practice round, we played quite good and we can play also better than this.   
Yeah, we have a chance, we have a big team against us and like all the teams actually, it's never easy, but yeah, we will do the best to get the second point after Miguel and Thomas.  
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Nicolas, we saw your debut Ryder Cup in fourballs; looking forward to getting back in that format?  
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   Well, yes, I am.   I'm looking forward to play a team event again.   We don't really get a chance to play that format quite often.   The atmosphere in the group is fantastic.   Everybody gets along really well.   There's a lot of laughter.   We fancy our chances and obviously fourballs is a very exciting format in match play.   You know, it can go one way or the other.   So, yeah, quite excited to play.   
Gonzo and I, we get along really, really good.   We know each other a very long time.   He's also a fantastic player.   I mean, he's got a pretty good resumÃ©.   He's won a bunch of times on The European Tour and he's quite acclaimed in match play.   So I'm really looking forward to play with Gonzalo.  
   
 Q.   Having played in all the Seve Trophies, are you fed up with the winning run Great Britain and Ireland are on.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I never say fed up, because the balance is nice‑‑ we won the first one and you know, every year, we have good teams and I think people give 100 percent of what they have, at the end, the clubs and the golf balls say the things and have 6 to 1.  
   
 Q.   I think it was Paul that mentioned that he played in the Seve Trophy before he played in The Ryder Cup, and there's a number of players on both sides, I imagine an opportunity to see what they can do with next year in mind.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Yeah, I totally agree.   There is a bunch of players that have a chance to play in next year's Ryder Cup or future Ryder Cups.   We do have young players in the team in both sides that do have good enough game to be part of the team, and in that regard, as Paul said, I have always looked to this event as a great learning experience for all those players.   
You have to really get to know the team atmosphere.   You need to know how to gel with the rest of the members.   You have to adapt yourself to the format of play.   It's not easy to play foursomes.   And I think all those little things that you might learn from this week can be very handy if you make the team into The Ryder Cup.   And in that event, I think this event is always a nice one to play in.   
   
 Q.   You guys play golf as a very individual sport all year long, could you describe the emotions you feel when you play?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The emotions, when you play for yourself, you make birdies for you, you make par, your birdie, you're just for yourself.   But those things, it's completely different when you play for a team, because the team is not, if I win a point or a lot of a point; it's 'we' win a point or 'we' lost a point but the main thing, you have to be there to be part of the team.   
And then when you focus on that, everything is much more emotional, much more sensitive.   It's more‑‑ it's more inside, there's more pride for when you miss something or when you make something good and do something good for the team.   Sometimes you miss a putt or whatever, it's not like you are yourself in a single tournament.   When you play in a team event.   Something more happens there that probably you feel more responsibility on those matters.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   I think team events, you really have this feeling of respect of your teammates and you try your best, like Miguel said, you try your best not to disappoint everyone, because everyone works in the same direction for the same goal and it's obviously to win as a team.  
So for me, respect really stands out because you know everybody is going to do their best to win the trophy.   
JOSÃ MARIA OLAZÃBAL:   Well, it's pretty much what they said.   I would add that the experiences that you leave between the players, it is special, and as years go by and you create a bond or a relationship with those players, that otherwise you wouldn't, just playing individually.   And that is something that I cherish through all these years since the very beginning when I played with Seve, and I did have a chance to play with all the great players.   Those moments are more special or unique because of that, because you are playing under the same flag or you're playing for your team.   That is something that doesn't happen when you're playing individual.   
GREGORY BOURDY:   Actually they said everything, but for me, it's also very different to play for myself than in the team. As Miguel said, it's much more emotional.   When you play for yourself, you are under control, your emotion is not the same at all.   You can't being too happy; you can't be too sad.   So you can't to show this everybody, and in team events, you can see when you watch on TV ‑‑ I watch on TV Ryder Cup and Seve Trophy, and you all the guys are much more emotional and they are more happen and more with the crowd and the other guys, so everything, it's so different, and when you win, I think, yeah, it's even better.   
NICOLAS COLSAERTS:   It's usually a very good party.   (Laughter).  
   
 Q.   Is there more expectation on you being the only French player, more weight on your shoulders?   
GREGORY BOURDY:   No, I'm not thinking that way.   I'm just proud to be on that team and I just do my best.   Yeah, happy to be on that team but actually I don't feel more pressure because I'm alone here.   Like I said, I'm very happy to have a captain like JosÃ© Maria and guys with a good, big chance like Miguel.   It's an honour also play with him on the same team; and Nicolas, also, had a very good, very nice Ryder Cup last year.   
Yeah, I just feel very happy to be here and I hope maybe the next time they are going to have more French, but I'm happy to be here.   
SCOTT CROCKETT:   Thank you very much.
