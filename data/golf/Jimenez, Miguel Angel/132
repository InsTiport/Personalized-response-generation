 Q.  Going along nicely, playing well again? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yes, hitting very good the last couple of holes, the petrol is finished.  No, I hit it very good and I was 11-under par, three holes to go and made a bogey, I didn't hit it very good, 5-iron from the tee. 
 And then chip shot, straight back.  I was unlucky that one.  And then I missed a shot on the left.  I have to make a hook from the sands and in the semi rough and I had a bogey there.  I had to work a little bit too much on the last three holes. 
 Overall I played very well, hit very good shots and very good putts. 

 Q.  Up until those last three holes, you're right up there, you're still right up there.  So there's plenty to play for over the weekend, isn't there? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yes, of course, I will try to do my best every time.  I hope to make some more birdies and less bogeys. 

 Q.  You've got a good record here, came close, you've been very close. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I've been close so many times. 

 Q.  Try and get over the hump. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, we'll see.
