  Q. How did you recover after being two over after five holes?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ The first few holes, I wasn't very good. I didn't hit the fairway on the fifth and in this rough, it's very difficult. Got it to the front of the green and three putted from there. I tried to recover and made an earlier bogey on the second. I missed a driver on the right into the palm trees and then to the bunker and then outside the bunker and then two putts for bogey.   
 But after that, from the eighth, I started to hit it good, hit it solid. Made birdie on nine from six inches. And then hit it close again on 10 and birdied the 12. Hit a driver and a nice five iron to three meters. On 13, hit a great three iron to a meter and half for birdie.   
  
  Q.  Conditions much different from yesterday?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: There was a breeze. It switched a bit and on some shots, it's tough. This morning was a bit calmer but it's the same for everyone.   
  
  Q.  Fancy your chances for the weekend?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Three shots are not many. Two more rounds to go and I have to keep hitting the ball good and we'll see. We'll keep fighting.
