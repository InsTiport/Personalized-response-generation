 Q.   You saved the best until last, run of birdies on the back nine.   I thought the birdie at 15 was the highlight.   
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I hit a very nice driver there and then a great putt there, right‑to‑left.   I hit a beautiful second shot.   With the 4‑iron and 5‑iron, with the 5‑iron, I have a very similar distance the second round and then the ball is coming just to that point.   I feel like the distance, it's not that strong as the second round.   And at the end I take the 5‑iron, I need to hit it very solid and I hit a beautiful shot.   Just needs to bounce one more meter and will be in the hole.   Then I make a great putt and I make it in the hole.   It's a very good shot.   
   
 Q.   This is your 26th consecutive PGA Championship.   How much do you enjoy coming here and playing in front of these fans?   
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I love it.   I love the fans here, it's unbelievable.   They are very knowledgeable about this sport and I enjoy very much coming here to play and I feel the support always during the week.   Always fantastic.   
   
 Q.   Your greatest highlight this week, describe this one again for us.   
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   A beautiful 3‑wood, it's a 9‑iron, 137 metres to the hole, beautiful.   
   
 Q.   Have you enjoyed the last few days?  
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I enjoyed very much.   I enjoy very much the golf here and this week here.   Playing very well.   And the crowd, the people is unbelievable.   I feel all the support of all the people here.   I enjoy very much and very happy.  
   
 Q.   Looks like you feed off them.   A fantastic performance today.   Your 26th consecutive PGA Championship.   How did you play today?   
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I played very well, very solid.   It was slow start, I start with first birdie on hole No. 8.   Playing very solid.   
   
 Q.   Will you take a lot this week and looking forward to next week?  
    MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I'm taking a lot, because I don't know what I'm going to do‑‑ it's very important for me to get my spot for the U.S. Open.   I think now with this second spot here, it's going to be in the higher in the World Ranking‑‑ also I commit to play next week, I have to play Sweden.   Then you have to go to the States and then probably you need to, I don't know, probably have to week off because it's going to be too many tournaments.   I will decide.
