  THE MODERATOR: Miguel Angel Jimenez shot a 68 and is even par for the Championship.Q. Hello.  Talk about your round today, some of the highlights of it.MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well, it's been very nice, hit very solid.  Couple of missed shots, okay, nobody's perfect.  But I hit very well, play very well, very solid.  A couple more putts supposed to go in, but that's the game.  [Indiscernible] If the putt is good tomorrow, then I'm good.  I would say the same thing.Q. You're right there after two rounds.  I'm sure you're not unhappy about the position overall.MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Not unhappy, no.  But yesterday afternoon was very hot day, not play very well.  My putt didn't go yesterday at all.  My game is so-so.  But today, it was very nice, my game, and a little bit of feeling with the putter.  Still the putts show the way I play really. It's good.  I'm happy, as I said before.  Even par, I think, is four shots, five shots behind the leader with two rounds to go is not far away.Q. You haven't played many Champions Tour events.  Do they feel different to you than the regular European tour?MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: No.  The people play very well.  Probably not have the amount of the guys on the Tour who probably can win the tournament, but they are very good and top players.  They are very good players.  And always competent.  Then you have to deal with the golf course. I want to play in three tournaments a year.  This is my fourth tournament on the Champions, and I still feel like I have to give myself an opportunity.  I feel when I play well, I can still beat the young people too. Then I divide myself.  I don't know what I'm going to do next year, but I want to keep doing it this way.  I'm going to play this one, I'm going to play the British Senior Open also, and then see I'll see how it's going in Europe, and I will make a decision.
