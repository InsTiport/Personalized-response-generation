  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Played not bad, you know, but I was in a very bad mood with my game.   That probably made me too much pressure on myself not to pull it to close, and to probably make it very worried, you know. 
Missed a couple of shots, both on the par‑5s, and that caused me to bogey one par‑5 and then I bogeyed another par‑5.   Those two par‑5s, they are supposed to make birdies.   You are four shots away from the number if you make the par‑5s here.   And that made the difference, you know. 
Anyway, on the back, it's okay. 

Q.   Essentially it's a good score overall on a difficult track. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, it's not a bad score, you know.   I had a lot of chances for birdie, and I'm thinking every time I miss a shot this cost me a lot. 

Q.   What are your thoughts when you see your playing partner shooting so low?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   He played so well.   He's playing very solid from tee shots to the end, too.   Very nice, and today he played so solid, very nice.

Q.   And you said prior to the event that it wouldn't be easy regardless of your one win in one appearance. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   No.   I know he's not nervous.   I always say you have to respect the players.   Maybe I am the youngest, but to me the rest of the guys know how to play golf.   They know.   And you see it.
