Q.   Probably pretty happy with two over in those conditions? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, it's fine.   You know, it's a pity, I'm coming here and I'm sick.   But I tried to do my best today and 2‑over. 

Q.   Was it dinner last night?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Don't know if something last night or the night before.   I'm sorry for that, but I'm a professional and I'm coming here to play but my body‑‑ it was something that I don't eat, something not very good and I've been not sleeping, nothing at night, and I've been all day (indicating ill).

Q.   Is it hard to get around? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, you have only two slopes on the second and the third, and on the way to the tee‑‑ that's it, but it's a pity.   Three more days.   I'm going to rest this afternoon and hopefully I'll be back tomorrow. 
I'm going to get something that helps now.   I think my body now can sustain something. 

Q.   What was it you ate? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I had seafood before.   Last night we have some‑‑ I don't know, maybe the ice, I don't know.   I've been very sick all night. 

Q.   Are you confident that when you get better, you can move up the leaderboard?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I think so.   I think so, yeah.   I've been hitting good.   I make only one birdie but I saved a couple of good pars, and then I missed a couple of birdies, also.
