MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I played very well, very solid from tee to green. All day long and that was the key today. On the last I hit the driver left and then hit a four iron from the sand to get on the left side of the green. Got a free drop from the stand but not a brilliant chip and two putts. But that's the game.

But pleased with the way I am hitting the ball and just need a bit more luck on the greens. But I am satisfied. I am rolling the ball well but it's not dropping.

I am in a good position. 14-under par is okay and you never know what might happen. Still one more round tomorrow and see what happens.
Q.  Do you think back to last year?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I think a little bit as I have similar feelings to this year, hitting the ball well and feeling good on the golf course. I enjoy the course very much and the weather and the people. I like the place.
