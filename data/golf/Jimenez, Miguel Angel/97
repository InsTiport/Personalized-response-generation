 Q. Terrific round out there today, but first of all, the big question: Is Spain going to win today? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes! That's the main thing now. After the day today I have on the golf course, that will be a perfect day for Spain, win, I don't want greedy, 2-1 is enough. 

 Q. As you said it will cap off a great day for you, terrific round out there today?
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I played very well, very solid into tees, and today the ball wants to drop in the hole and makes a difference today with the rest of the round, 66 today, 5-under par, and that's it.

 Q. Obviously a long day this morning because of thunderstorms, but you got off to a terrific start with birdies on the first three holes. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, I hit it very solid, driver on the first and a wedge to less than a metre on the first hole. Beautiful 6-iron on the second hole, two metres to the hole. And then nice driver, missed the green on the par 5, made a good chip and two metres and a half, something like that. That's the start. And it's been chances for birdie all through the day.

 Q. The last hole, your favourite club in the bag? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, my beautiful 5-wood there, to three metres -- 200 metres to the hole, 220 yards to you. But I got a little breeze into off the left and I say, okay, it's quite soft because of the rain we have this morning and just a little soft 5-wood against the breeze and it's perfect, pin-high. 

 Q. Do you need another round like that tomorrow to take this title? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Why not? Why not? No, we'll see; Alejandro is playing well, Kaymer is the defending champion playing very well, playing very solid. To me those are the two maximum candidates at this stage of the tournament, but you never know; 18 more holes to go and anything can happen.
