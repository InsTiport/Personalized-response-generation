 Q.   Did you enjoy that as much as you enjoyed the hole‑in‑one?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, it's very nice when you make a hole‑in‑one.   It's very nice.   One there, no prize (laughter) but no, it's fine.   I'm happy and I finish level par today.   My clubs, it's a little bit likeup‑and‑down.   
   
 Q.   Talk me through the hole‑in‑one.   What was the club?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I decided to go with 7‑iron, through the palm trees.  
   
 Q.   Tom Lewis has walked away with your car, and you get nothing, as you say?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Who did?   On hole No. 7‑‑ maybe that car for me‑‑ (laughing)   it's nice.   Enjoy the car.   
   
 Q.   How has winter been?   How prepared are you for 2015?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I played in South Africa at Nedbank and then spent time at my house in Vienna and had six, seven days also in MÃ¡laga.
