  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I played hitting the ball very well.   The putter is better.   It's better than it's been through the year, but I'm hitting the ball well and in these conditions, quite windy yesterday in the afternoon and a little busy also this morning.   5‑under par is always good.   More under par, more good. 

Q.   It's a course we usually expect a whole wealth of birdies out there and I know you have three on the front nine and seem to be having this lovely flawless run. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, well, I holed three birdies on the front nine and one on the back nine and only one bogey on hole No. 7, that was my hole No. 16.   That's the game.   I'm hitting it well, leaving a couple birdies there. 

Q.   Do you like your position on that board? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, it's a good position.   Putting my breath on the neck of people is not bad; it's good. 

Q.   How do you reflect on this year, because essentially in terms of Race to Dubai, you're not bad, you've had some nice consistency, but we haven't seen you right at the top. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   No, but that's it, you are still there, still some results, so‑so.   At the end of the day, I'm around 40 on The Race to Dubai, but like you say, it's nothing happen until now until this week, and maybe everything will change.

Q.   And it's Spanish National Day, isn't it?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's a bank holiday in Spain, and my son is coming, he's coming last night, and it's good.   It's nice to be here with my two sons and my friends.
