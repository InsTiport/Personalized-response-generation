   MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: I have never been in Scotland before at this time of year and seen such weather as this. It is fantastic and obviously the conditions were so nice today - superb. In conditions like this you have to shoot under par, keep the ball in play all the time and avoid mistakes so I'm pretty happy with my score. It was better than yesterday and I'm looking forward to playing the Old Course tomorrow.
