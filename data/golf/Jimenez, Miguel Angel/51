Q.   How happy does 5‑under make you? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I always say the same thing, when you make under par, you are happy, more under par, I am happy.   Make 5‑under today.   I played very solid.   I think the scores reflected what I did today on the golf course.   I make six birdies and one bogey.   Played very solid.   Made some good putts.   Putting it close and only bogey I made on 16, because I was a little aggressive on the first putt on the big hump where I am there, by a metre and a half I missed and that's the only bogey I made today. 

Q.   This is your 600th event, we spoke about it yesterday; do you still get the same buzz of excitement that you did when you first came? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, you are more experienced now.   Before in the things, the dreams start coming, you're playing, and now with experience, you much more handle everything around.   I'm glad, all these 25 years moving around, yeah.

Q.   What's a good score for the leaders?   What's a satisfactory score for the leaders going out now in these conditions?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   These conditions, it's not very strong wind, little breeze.   The greens is holding very well, not very high rough.   I think the leader is going to be maybe 12‑, 14‑under par probably at the end of tomorrow, we'll see. 

Q.   Tell me, and I don't mean this disrespectfully, but are you surprised? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   At what? 

Q.   To play this well, in your second tournament back. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   You are cocky with a professional golfer‑‑ what are you thinking about it ‑‑ (laughing).

Q.   That's why it wasn't meant with disrespect.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I think I'm hitting well.   I've been practising the last few weeks a little bit, and I feel comfortable.   I feel nice on the golf course.   You know, good shots, make some putts.   That's what you need to do to shoot low. 
Made 5‑under par today, only one bogey in a situation that I got on the 16th hole, the flag is short left and I'm not used to missing the flag on the right side with the big hump there.   And you have to come into the grain, the hole is downgrain and everything, and just a little bit too much, a metre and a half missed that one.   But other than missing that one, I feel like I putted well and played well.   Strange?   No.   I think it's a lot of experience. 

Q.   Does the experience of playing here and winning here help?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   This golf course, very important thing here through the years, we are learning you have to keep patience.   It's a golf course that you have to put the ball in play every time and give yourself chances for birdies.   If you are a little bit aggressive, you are going to make‑‑ tough. 

Q.   How much different was it today not so tough, presumably? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's not tough.   Yesterday the conditions we played in with a lot of wind, raining all the time; today is nice, much better.   It's nice.   The golf course is not very high rough.   It is holding very well.   It's perfect, you hit it well, you are going to shoot low. 

Q.   And you're in a lovely position on the leaderboard. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, I am putting my breath on somebody's necks (laughing).
