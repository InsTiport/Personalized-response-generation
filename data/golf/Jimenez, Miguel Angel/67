 Q.   How pleased are you to be into the third round?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   It's nice.   I'm very pleased.   I've been playing well.   Hitting the shots.   The shots have been looking good.   It's a little disadvantage, because everybody hits so long here, and it's a disadvantage.   People going over the bunker had to go sideways of the bunker.   People going in with a wedge had to go with a 6‑iron, 5‑iron, 7‑iron.   
   
 Q.   Sometimes in match play, though, it's not a bad idea to be going in first.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   It's not a bad idea, no.   But I don't mind going second or hitting second with a wedge in my hands, much better, not with this kind of approach.  
   
 Q.   It was a tough match today, but you battled away well?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Yeah.   On the first three holes, 3‑up.   It helps a lot.   
   
 Q.   Another tough one tomorrow with McIlroy?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Yeah.   He beat Anders Hanson?   
   
 Q.   Yes, he did.   Your thoughts about that one?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Well, tomorrow we'll see what happens.   That's the only way.
