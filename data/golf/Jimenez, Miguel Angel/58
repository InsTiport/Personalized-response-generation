  SARAH GWYNN:   Miguel, welcome back to Wales and thanks for coming in to see us this afternoon.   You've won here before, albeit on a different course, but just describe how it is to be back here in Wales. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, always I never miss this tournament since I play the first time in 2005 and that I won, and I'm always coming to play here.   It's nice a resort, it's a nice golf course, the one we play now.   The one where I won is a nice course; hilly, not really tactical golf course.   This one is more long and more flat, apart from the last three holes, they have some hills.   But the golf course, it's a great golf course and it's in superb this year.   If the weather stays dry, I think we'll have a nice week here. 
SARAH GWYNN:   Does it bring back amazing memories of The Ryder Cup in 2010? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Two years ago when we played here in The Ryder Cup it was nice, walking in the fairways, you think of shots you hit here.   It's nice. 
SARAH GWYNN:   How would you sum up your season so far this year? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's so‑so.   A couple of times in the Top‑10 but that's it probably.   That is the point to start this week. 
SARAH GWYNN:   We've spoken to a few people already, and as there are players in their 40s who are coming back into some of their best form, what's the secret for you for playing so well? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, they take care now more of themselves.   It's a sport that you can live a long time through, and that's the thing that helps, and also the materials, you can hit it longer now and enable you to be more competitive also with the young people.   It's nice, I think it will be more fit than years ago.   (Flexing muscles). 

Q.   How many years more do you see yourself playing on for?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, if I enjoy myself on the golf course, I will still keep playing.   I love the game and I enjoy myself on the golf course.   I think I keep playing.   I don't know; I'm 48, I don't know what's going to happen in a couple of years' time.   But if I keep playing and keep enjoying myself, if I can keep up with the guys, I will still play. 

Q.   Can you explain how your scheduling works at this time of the year and how this tournament fits in with it? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I don't know, the Tour schedule is very, very tight, because all the majors, there are majors every month now and we have been coming from the BMW PGA last week. 
And to me, this fits perfect, because I have two weeks off before the PGA, then play the PGA, play this one, and then have a week off and then go for the U.S. Open, so to me it fits perfect. 
Some people are playing, when they share the tours, they play both tours and it's more difficult.   Some people maybe go this week to play the Memorial and then maybe a week off next week and play the U.S. Open; or stay there and play there.   I don't know, to play on both sides, it's difficult for scheduling the tournaments, for them. 
For me, I only play here and the majors and the World Golf Championships, and this tournament fits perfect for me. 
SARAH GWYNN:   Good luck this week.   Thanks for coming in.
