  Q. Talk about your round today compared to yesterday.   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: I feel very fine. I played very well. Not as good as yesterday. It's definitely tough today, 1-over par. But as you know we played with a different wind, and yesterday bogey-free round; today I made four bogeys, and today three birdies. That's not bad for a links course and the conditions we played in this afternoon.  
  
  Q. You have to be very happy with your position.   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: I'm happy. Always around the lead is very happy. I'm one shot behind. I put my breath on the back of the players, and they're going to feel myself coming from behind. Be careful.   
  
  Q. Do you like coming from behind?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: I like to come in from anywhere, man. (Laughter.)  
 Conditions tomorrow, I hear it's going to be quite -- tomorrow is going to be nice because it's going to rain, cold, and we're going to have a typical, typical Open day. I prefer this typical, today, with the wind, but the other one is also the bigger but nobody likes. We'll see tomorrow but I'll try to concentrate and try to have patience and enjoy yourself. That's the main thing.
