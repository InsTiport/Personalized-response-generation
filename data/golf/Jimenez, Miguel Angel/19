 Q.   How good was that one?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   9‑under par on this course, only first round, it's a good start.   It's nice, making a low score.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about the eagle at your very first hole.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I hit a nice lob‑wedge on the green.   
   
 Q.   When you get into that scoring mode that you're in, when you were 6‑under through your first seven holes, what were you thinking as you kept going through your round?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   You play very well, you just try to enjoy yourself, and it's the way to shoot very low, still exciting and I managed today to do that.  
   
 Q.   Does this golf course fit your style of play?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I think so.   I like the golf course with trees on it.   It feels nice and you have everything, you have some long holes, you have some short holes and you have a mix.   I feel comfortable on this golf course.   
   
 Q.   Tell me how special a round that was.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   9‑under par, very nice.   It's special because I've been struggling a little bit the last few months and you shoot under par, you feel good.   Everything is getting close, you know.   
Start to roll the ball better on the green and everything starts to go more close and that helps especially keep you safe on the golf course.   I start with eagle on my first hole today and played very solid.   
   
 Q.   Elaborate on that start because that was special when you hole out for an eagle; doesn't happen every day.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   No, this doesn't happen every day.   What better way to start.   I hit a beautiful tee shot and five metres, 52 lob‑wedge.   
   
 Q.   We are right by the Mediterranean; does it feel Spanish?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Feels very, very Mediterranean, feels very similar to MÃ¡laga, these kind of trees, same kind of the soil there.
