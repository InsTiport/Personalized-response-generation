  Q. Verdict on the day, if you would, and on this wonderful, glorious weather today.   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes, look at out there, the desert. It's nice. It was very good, and a little more breeze now, but it's a beautiful day.   
  
  Q. It's hard to believe we are standing here with jumpers getting wet, but how difficult was it out there in this weather?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: No, it's not difficult. I think it makes it a little softer, the greens, and that makes it easier. But at the moment, the conditions are superb and you can see what you can do when you come to the desert.   
  
  Q. It has not badly affected you with your little injury there?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, the finger still has pain, and it's difficult with the gloves and my swing and going through the ball.  
  
  Q. Any particular highlights out there?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, not really. Made two bogeys, one with a 3-putt on the 11th, and a bogey on the fourth. I got a wedge and I blocked my shot a little bit and put my ball on the back. That's a mistake I made.   
 I played consistent. Good par on the last hole, hole No. 9. The rough is very tough to play from with a long club. I had 169 meters to the hole, and it's not easy. It's good.   
  
  Q. And a very good foundation for the weekend?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, there we are.
