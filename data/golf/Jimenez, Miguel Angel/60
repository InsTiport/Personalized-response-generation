Q.   How was your play today?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Played very well.   Played very solid from tee‑to‑green.   On the greens, many chances for birdies.   Made a few birdies, no bogeys, and that's it.   That's the game today.

Q.   How will you play tomorrow? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Tomorrow, I tell you how I play tomorrow, try to do the same thing as today.   Try to do my best on the golf course and hope my game is in the same level and I improve a little bit on the greens. 
Played very well, made 32 putts for 3‑under par, a bogey‑free round again today.   So playing very well on the greens, many, many chances for birdies.   You know, you have three, four, five metres all the time; three, four, five metres all the time, you need to hole those. 

Q.   You are obviously playing well and confident at the moment? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I'm playing well and very happy.   I hope to play the same way as today but hole a couple more putts. 

Q.   Your verdict on the way you played today? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I'm happy, the way I played, I played very well from green‑to‑tees, very solid, very good shots.   I missed only three shots really, and the second shot on the 18th, and I missed one with a sand wedge and a lob‑wedge on hole No.4 and 5.   Yeah, the two shots were not very good but I still made par there.   But the rest, chances for birdies, and that's it. 

Q.   Presumably you've got to take a few more of those. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I need to hole some more putts.   That's my chance to shoot low.   I hit it very good from the tees, but then you need to hole putts.   With 32 putts, you have nothing to do in the tournament. 

Q.   What's that down to, need a little bit of lady luck on your side? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   We need some luck on the greens, but it looks like still very solid looking at the lines. 

Q.   Looks like you had some fun with Felipe out there. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   He's very nice, he played very well, finished 4‑under par again.   He's a nice guy to play with.
