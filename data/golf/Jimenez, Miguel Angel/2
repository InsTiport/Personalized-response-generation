 Q.  Obviously, today didn't go as planned.  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: No, it didn't go as planned.  No, unfortunately, we had a little thunderstorm and rain today.  Heavy rains out there, of course, it's very tough to put in conditions to play this afternoon.  They cancel today and then we come tomorrow.   
 Q.  How did you spend your time?  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Well, like everybody here, watching the TV, watching the Olympics a little bit, had lunch, and now we just try to organize the room for tonight.  And change the trip for a different time because we miss the flight tonight and everything, you know.   
 Q.  Do you think this will affect you much?  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: I think all the people have the same effect, you know.  And everybody wants to finish a tournament on Sunday.  That's with everything.  It will affect hotels, flights and everything.  So anyway, we have to do what we have to do.
