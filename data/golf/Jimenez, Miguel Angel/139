Q.  One of those days, nothing seemed to go right for you out there?

MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, I didn't play as well I did yesterday, obviously not.  Every time I missed a shot, I had nothing to do. The thing is, it didn't help on the 6 when I missed my driver, but he just kept running away.  But, then I bogeyed at the 9th hole there.  The shadow from the trees there and then never get the pace of that, missed a short one, missed the next one.
Q.  You needed to try to put a bit of pressure on David?

MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I tried to, you know.  He's playing very solid, very well.  You know, he's a great winner for a great tournament.  He's the winner, that's it, very nice.
Q.  Overall for your game, third is still a pretty good week.

MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  It's a very good week.  I tried to win but the last couple of holes just looking to try to make some birdies and finish second.  Not third, it's a pity.
Q.  And next week, you're defending next week.  You'll have a lot of confidence?

MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yes, we'll try.
