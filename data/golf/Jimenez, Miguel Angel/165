THE MODERATOR:   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Miguel Angel Jimenez, once more a great round.  You like Munich, I think so?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I love this place, yeah.  I play very much in Germany.  I used to play a lot in this country and the course conditions, the weather is fantastic.  The people are so great and I think I'm very happy here.
THE MODERATOR:   The only thing that is missing in the moment, you won a motorbike on Tuesday, you bought a car on Thursday, so what will happen tomorrow?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Tomorrow try to get the hole-in-one on the 17th.  I don't know where I put all of them, so many cars, but doesn't matter.
THE MODERATOR:   You will find a solution then.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I will.
Q.  Were you conscious at all of Thomas Levet or were you just looking at your own score?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  What, what?
Q.  Were you conscious of Thomas Levet coming past you on the leaderboard?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yeah, you can see on the leaderboard on the golf course.  I said, I look at that, I say, well, Thomas, he is playing very well.  I'm very happy because we need people playing very well in two weeks time.  I said, hey, we have to make some birdies because we don't want to be too far away from Thomas.  You are conscious of that.  You are human; you can see it.  I told my caddie, well, Thomas, he's playing well so, we only need three or four more.  On the other hand, we have to make birdies now.
Q.  What do you think about the Ryder Cup race taking place behind you?  It's kind of dominated the tournament.  Do you feel above it all now?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No.  How are the other people --
Q.  There are still five people trying for four spots.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  You think they are going to get it -- the 10th, 11th spot is 45,000 between them.   At 11-under par, someone has to finish Top-5 or Top-6, they don't win anything, if you don't finish with a win, it's not going to happen.

No, I don't think the list of the Top-10 of the Ryder Cup is going to move anything, not at this moment.  I don't know how he finished, Ian Poulter?  8-under.  There's not going to be any movement.  The 12th is Joakim Haeggman and I don't know if -- I don't think there's going to be any movement.  Because they are all playing, they are all playing all rounds of this tournament, that I don't think it will make any difference.

Jacobson, I don't know, even if he wins, he doesn't get anything.  How much is --
Q.  If he wins he would definitely get in.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  How much money does he have at the moment --
THE MODERATOR:   300,000.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  -- on the Order of Merit.  I don't know, he's just on the edge.  Jacobson is the only one who can get in there if he wins tomorrow, yeah.  That's the only one.  If he won or maybe he finishes -- if he won, he's got a chance to get there on the team.  He's the only one who can make that team.  How did he finish today?
THE MODERATOR:   12-under.  So three shots behind.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  That means I have to play well tomorrow.  No, he's a great player and everything can happen tomorrow, you know.
Q.  How will you play for tomorrow?  How will you attack?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I will try to play the same thing I played all week.  I'm hitting it very well from tee-to-green, and I hope to make everything on the same level and I still make a few under par.  I feel very well and I feel nice and at peace on the golf course.  I feel great.  I hope I keep the same for four days in a low and try to get a victory tomorrow.  Two BMWs, the BMW Asian Open I won this year in China, so I try to win this one.  It would be very nice.

I will push myself tomorrow to have the victory here.  If I come, don't worry.  If not, don't panic, I still have the three other wins.
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow for the double victory.
