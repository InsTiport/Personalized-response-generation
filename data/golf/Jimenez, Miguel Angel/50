 Q.   Thoughts on how this week has panned out, particularly that finish?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   My thoughts on the week, it's great.   It's great to come back again officially, and to finish with that, at the end of the day I played very well all of the week, apart with my start on the first round but hitting very well and the main thing, I still got my patience on the golf course; still me, that's the main thing.   
At the end, to play well on this golf course, you need to focus, you need to concentrate, you need to put the ball in play to give yourself chances to make birdies.   I told myself that I can still play after my injury.  
   
 Q.   And an eagle to close, it doesn't get more thrilling than that.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's nice, that finish, a birdie to finish is very nice on this championship, three shots in the last two holes, and 18, birdie, birdie, it's one more step.   That's nice.   
   
 Q.   6‑under, and to mark it in such a stylish fashion, does it make it all the more special?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   For me it's special.   If I don't make the 3‑putts I make on hole No. 4 and hole No. 5, and I miss a metre putt on 7 for birdie and I miss a metre putt on 11, then probably I will be with the trophy.   
But that's golf, I understand that.   But we are human and we can miss.   But I'm very happy, I finish in the appropriate style there, finish the tournament with an eagle, making a nice result.   I know that things are coming around, very nice.   Of course, it's much better with the trophy.
