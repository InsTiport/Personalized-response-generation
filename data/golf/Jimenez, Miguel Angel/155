MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I came back this morning all square on the ninth green and played really nicely. On hole number ten I made bogey but won the 11th and 12th to go ahead and made a nice birdie at the par three (14) and another on the 16th. Overall I hit it very good from tee to green. Good morning for me and for a lot of my Ryder Cup teammates.
