   MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, I finished 3-under par today. The conditions of the golf course were very nice and superb conditions. 

 Q. Like being at home in Spain. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Nearly. (Laughing).

 Q. Have you seen it like this before? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I've never been in Scotland with this weather at this time of the year. This is unbelievable, fantastic. 

 Q. Probably the toughest of the three courses, Carnoustie, got it out of the way now? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: With these conditions, the par 5s, you need to keep the ball in play all the time, that's the main thing, and Carnoustie with these conditions. 

 Q. Looking forward to St. Andrews tomorrow? 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: We'll see what we do tomorrow with the weather and things.
