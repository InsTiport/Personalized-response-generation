  Q. So you finished well?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Finished well, finished with a birdie on the last hole, except I've been missing so many putts all through the whole day. And today, I made 3-putts on 13 and 3-putts on the 16th, had chances on 15 and 17. And then I make a birdie on 18 to finish minus 19.   
  
  Q. And you got a replacement putter?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I had the same putter as I had the other day. I put in a new shaft, but  
  
  Q. But it wasn't your friend today?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: No. It's not my friend all week.  
  
  Q. Break your shaft again.   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I'm supposed not to do that.
