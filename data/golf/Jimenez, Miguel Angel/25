 Q.   Well played today.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   1963 Sam Snead tied for third here over the age of 50.   Now you're fourth place by yourself.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Fourth or fifth?   
   
 Q.   Fourth.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Fourth?   
   
 Q.   How does it feel?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   It feels nice.   I was playing very well, playing very solid all the week.   Today my putting is a little bit too cold.   It's not enough putter.   But I was playing very well, very solid from tee to flags and that's it.   
   
 Q.   Why do you think so many 50‑year‑olds not only made the cut but played so well?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Well, the people, they take care of themselves.   They are being more healthy.   If you don't want to be here at 50, you shouldn't be here.   I love the game, I love competing, and probably that is the reason.  
   
 Q.   You seem to be enjoying your golf more than ever.   Is that true?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   I always enjoy the game, of course.   I enjoy competing.   I enjoy the Masters.   It's very nice.  
   
 Q.   How many Champions Tour events do you have planned?   I know have you this week?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   I'm going to play only next week.   I plan to focus myself for the Ryder Cup and then I need to play in the European Tour for that.   
If you don't play over there you won't have as good of chances.   I would like to play on the Ryder Cup and I would like to help Europe defend the Ryder Cup.   I would love to do that.  
   
 Q.   Do you think this week kind of gives the idea that some day a Champions Tour player could be the reigning Masters champion?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Why not?   Why not?   Fred Couples played nice, Langer played nice, I played nice, too.   To win a tournament you need to play hit the ball well, putt good and go play.   If you are able and ready to play, you got a chance.  
   
 Q.   Technology helps, too, I guess?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Yeah, technology helps, too.   Of course.   But if you don't know how to hit the ball then technology don't do nothing.
