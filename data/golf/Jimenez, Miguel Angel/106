 Q. Your thoughts on a round of 68 that included two 6s?
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well, coming on the two par fives where they are supposed to be the recovery holes, it is not so good, but apart from that it was pretty solid, pretty good. I am happy with my game at the moment and the fact I walked off the course with 68 feeling that I perhaps left a couple of shots out there, shows that.

 Q. Is this a course you look forward to coming back to each year?
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well the golf course is very fair. You need to play very well here to score and it tests every club in your bag right from the driver to the putter, you need to do everything well. If you have made a good score it shows that you have done well right through the bag. 

 Q. How will you spend your time before you play again tomorrow?
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: I will eat first, smoke my cigar and then hit a few putts then perhaps go to the swimming pool.
