 Q.   Where did that come from?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   That was the back nine, I made my first birdie on the 8th and then started to hole some putts on the back nine, and that brings you up here.   The back, playing okay.   It's difficult to put the ball close to the holes, and then you need some support from the putter and that's what I did well on the back nine.  
   
 Q.   What is it, at your age of 50, about your game or about you as a person, that allows you to compete with these young guys?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I still enjoy what I do, that's the main thing.   I enjoy what I do in my life and I enjoy to play golf and I enjoy to compete.   That's probably the main thing.   Then I'm not lazy to go and go to practice or go to the putting green or go to the gym work.   
But you know, the main thing is that you have to enjoy what you do in your life and I do.  
   
 Q.   You're going to be three or four off the lead tomorrow; how do you rate your chances of winning?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Winning or not winning, what I will try to do is still enjoy myself.   That's the main thing.   That is the only way you can catch someone.   You know, whatever happens, it's going to be not far away, probably is going to come into your mind on the golf course all the things, I'm human.   But just concentrate on what you are doing and try to enjoy yourself.
