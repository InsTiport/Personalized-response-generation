Q.   How does it feel, first shot of the 2015 Race to Dubai?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, it's nice.   I'm the oldest guy in the field, probably the guy who played more years.   Now I start my 27th season today on the first tee.   It's nice to make the first shot of the season, 2015 season. 
This place, it's beautiful, beautiful landscape and everything and weather is very nice. 

Q.   First round is nice? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Still struggling a little bit with my putter like last season but make four birdies and a couple of bogeys.   But, well, waiting for a little more confidence rolling the ball on the greens.

Q.   You got it going on the back nine, four birdies in seven holes. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Played very well, very solid.   Lots of chances for birdie on the golf course.   A couple of mistakes cost me bogey, but that's the game.
