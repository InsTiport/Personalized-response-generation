  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Very disappointing.   When you're not playing well, it's disappointing and it's disappointing when you're playing well and you don't score.   But disappointing for my physical condition.   Just got sick before last night.   Yesterday was hard, today was a little bit better but still my condition is not fit to play.   It's something that I can't do nothing about it.   
   
 Q.   Still struggling today with the heat?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I feel a little in the stomach and on the golf course I have to run to the toilet‑‑ on the buggy have to find the toilet‑‑ and it's something that it's very disappointing, defending my title here this week.   These two days, I walk the golf course like a phantom.   I'm trying hard, make some birdies but also make too many bogeys.   My condition is not 100 per cent.   It's a pity.  
   
 Q.   Do you still want to come back next year?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Of course.   I love this place.   I love Hong Kong.   I love the golf course.   
   
 Q.   Did you think the eagle‑‑  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The eagle, okay, I need to make three more birdies.   It's very difficult.   The fairways, it's very difficult.   You miss the fairway a little bit and you get a flyer, it's difficult to make a score.   
   
 Q.   The guys you're playing with were struggling; does that make it harder?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's hard.   The golf course is a great golf course.   You have to be very precise.   If you are not in the fairways‑‑ you get a lot of flyers and it's difficult to recover.   Nice golf course.   
   
 Q.   What's the plan for the weekend?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Stay in the hotel, feel better for tomorrow and coming to practice tomorrow.
