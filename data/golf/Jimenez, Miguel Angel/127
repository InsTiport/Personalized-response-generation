   MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I played very well, and I played -- on the greens I holed some putts, like four-, five-footers for birdie on a few holes, and that helps a lot.   
  
  Q.  Have you been playing well of late, or were you expecting to shoot 65 today?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  When you're hitting it well and you have some putts, you expect to shoot 65 any time.  I've been hitting good.  Probably the result has not been what I expect, but I'm hitting the ball okay.  When you're hitting good and I hole putts, that's the only thing you need to do.   
  
  Q.  Your lead objective going into tomorrow, you want to --   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Tomorrow is a different type of golf course from today.  Today you just enjoy yourself.   
  
  Q.  Would you rather have rain or would you rather have clear, calm conditions?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I like if it rains for other people.  If it rains, not right for nobody.  I don't mind.   
 The golf course is good.  It's in very good condition, very good condition.
