Q.   Comments on the day?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Well, the round is not as good as yesterday.   It's a little bit harder, it's pushing a little bit there.   I didn't do anything very well today compared to yesterday, but overall happy. 

Q.   In terms of the scoring, 73 is not bad today. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Is not bad today, no.   My tee shots not as good as yesterday, and that make for me very difficult.   Today I didn't hit it fantastic, made it difficult if you are not in the right spot. 
I never let down myself, no good concentration, good focus, and that's what I do.

Q.   Fred Couples says he can win at age 52, so can you win at age 48? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Well, the two old guys could be here on Sunday, no? 

Q.   Two shots off the lead, you're in a good position going into the weekend. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Yeah, two shots is fine.   Two shots is not far away.   You know, there's going to be a lot of attention here, a lot of drama here.   It always happens here on this golf course, and you never know what can happen on the weekend. 

Q.   Did the conditions change much today?   It started out this morning so cold. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   No, this afternoon is beautiful.   I think is fine.   It's not much different here, I don't think so.
