Q. What a start, talk about it?

DARREN CLARKE: We got off to a good start and gave ourselves chances and I made a couple from just outside Chad and he missed them and we got the momentum early.
Q. Do you ever miss any?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Sometimes of course but we played well today and it was important for the team.
Q. The Americans have not led in any matches?

DARREN CLARKE: Well we got off to a good start, it was the start we would have wanted and I am sure the American guys would have wanted that start too. It has gone for us but there is going to be a lot of swings both way IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½m sure before it is finished.
Q. Hal said it was the greatest American putting team assembled, did that sink in with you guys?

DARREN CLARKE:  Well, we were just trying to make as many as we could and that is all you can do, that is all anybody can do in any Ryder Cups.
Q. What was on your mind on the first tee?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I wasnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t really nervous no. You feel the pressure because playing in the Ryder Cup is amazing but I felt great.

DARREN CLARKE:  You always feel a little bit nervous but whenever you are playing against Davis who is one of my best friends on the US Tour, that makes it a lot easier, and Chad is a gentleman too so that makes it a lot easier too.
Q. How were the galleries?

DARREN CLARKE: They were fantastic, clapping us as much as they were clapping the American guys so we couldnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t ask for more.

DARREN CLARKE:  I donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t think we could have wished for a better start. I hit five iron to eight feet for an eagle at the second, which we didnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t actually need in the end but it was a great shot and then I birdied the fourth and the fifth when Chad was just inside me so that was a big momentum thing for us. We were very comfortable with each other and Miguel played great Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ you only need to look at the season statistics to see that wasnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t going to be a surprise Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ and I really enjoyed it. IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½m excited and looking forward to this afternoon.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  The key today was the way we started, it was absolutely fantastic and we felt like we were in control right from the start. My last Ryder Cup was in America too and the crowd was good. The way we have started gives the guys a boost for this afternoon too.
