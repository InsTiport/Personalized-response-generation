Q. Tell us about a marvellous round of golf?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I played very well, very solid from tee to green, but to be honest on the greens some putts didn't go in. But it was still a good round. I put a few shots close to the hole but didn't make them all.
Q. You don't sound very happy?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  No, I am happy but I missed two chances for birdies on the last two holes there which if I had holed them I would have been right up there with the leader. That was a little frustrating especially when you think you see the line of them and hit them where you want to go and they don't go in but that's golf.

Overall I am very happy at the way I am hitting the ball and this is pretty good having been away from golf for about five or six weeks, I am feeling very comfortable on the golf course.
Q. I take it you had a good Christmas then?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:   Of course I did. I was at home with the family and I didn't have to go near any airports or take any flights. The batteries are nearly recharged but not quite. I felt like perhaps I needed another two or three weeks.
Q. But this is a nice place to start the year though?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Oh, yes, it is very nice, the condition of the golf course is excellent and they look after us very well.
