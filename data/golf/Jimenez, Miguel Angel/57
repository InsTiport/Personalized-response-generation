Q.   Just tell me what you saw on the course and how you felt.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I felt very well, very solid from green to tee.   Also I felt good on the greens.   Not good enough, and I got 31 putts, and I missed a few for birdie.   Not playing very well, but that's the game of golf, no?   But I played very well, very solid, and I like the way I played today.

Q.   What did you think of the course?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The course was perfect, super.
