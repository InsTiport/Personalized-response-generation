   MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's 9-to 5 now and we have four points to play for this afternoon, and now it's very important, anything you can do this morning for the team is critical. 

 Q. Playing with Miguel this afternoon against Rock and Wilson; your thoughts on that? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: Well, my thoughts are to be positive and just keep working like we are working together, we are doing correct and wait for the luck to arrive. I am not holing putts, and this is probably why we are a little trouble to win the match. But this is like it is, everybody is going to fight until the last putt. 

 Q. Which club was it? 
 ALVARO QUIROS: 5.
