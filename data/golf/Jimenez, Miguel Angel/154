Q. How are you feeling after that marathon day?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Obviously I am very tired because I played 44 holes today and I think you always feel a little bit more tired after you lose. But I am pleased with the way I played and I am proud of the way I played, especially this afternoon when I battled back and to take it to the last hole was a good effort. I never give up, I am not that type of player, and even when he was five up I was still in there fighting. I knew if I could start hitting the ball a bit better I had a chance and that is what happened. When I got the momentum going on the back nine and started to win a few holes, I thought I had a chance of winning, but it was not to be. But Lee played well today and it should be a great final with him and Ernie. I have never played 44 holes in one day before and I don't want to again!
