 Q.  Pretty good round today with the exception of No. 8.  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: It's 1-over par.  I put out of bounds on the third hole.  I made birdie on No. 1.  And then I hit a beautiful drive on the 8th hole.  Then just lost the ball down there, out of bounds also.  A mistake there.  But 7 down, is it.  Simple. Two birdies on 16 and 17.  I lost something on 18.   Q.  Very, very outside chance that you might make the cut.  Your preparation for next week.  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Always good preparation playing this tournament.  No question.  I love it.  It's pure golf. You saw this week I'm not at the level, through the months.  Especially on the greens, I've been struggling a lot on the greens.  Especially today, I play very well.  I start to hole little by little better on the greens.  But two lost balls, you cannot score.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: No, today is much more hard.  Today is much more hard, two shots.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: No, you go to the referee, and explain the referee.  I don't argue with referee.  He is going to explain you the rules.  I would disagree.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: No, a decision is made, a decision is made.  You have to take it.
