  STEVE TODD:   Many thanks for joining us here at the Ballantine's Championship.   You were runner‑up of course last year, a very good performance and were very close to winning.   A couple of putts in the last round, if they had dropped, you might have been holding the trophy.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, you're right, I remember from last year, they people, they were very nice and I played very well all through the week.   And like you said, my putting in the last round‑‑ but the last hole I had some chances and I played beautiful second shots over the pin and then land to a downhill lie.   
But it was a nice experience, it's a great golf course.   I really enjoy it very much and we have a nice field in the tournament, and that's it.   Very nice, happy to be here again and hope to make a little better than last year.   
STEVE TODD:   Miguel, you've had a couple of Top‑10 finishes already this year and success previously in Asia.   How are you feeling about your game coming into this week?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, my game is not at the best form at the moment but still hitting good.   If I can get that sweet combination, the combination of the game and the ball getting to the hole, holing putts at the moment, to get that sweet combination.   Right now, it's floating away, it's not getting on the right pace.   That's combination, probably is what I need.   I'm hitting it good, doing okay, but it's coming and I'm happy to be here and the greens here and the good results and hope back again this week.   
   
 Q.   If you would tell you go about the course and the challenges this week.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yesterday I played nine holes.   I arrived from Europe Monday afternoon, and yesterday I played nine holes in the morning and practice.   The golf course looked in super condition.   The greens, they are perfect, bunkers very good, fairways.   The golf course is in super condition.   
I don't know what's going to happen today after the rains today, but the golf course, it's a nice golf course.   Most of the holes you can see from the tee.   It's a great golf course.   
   
 Q.   You're known to be a very romantic person, you enjoy cigars and wine, and also when you go on overseas tours, I'm sure you're a person that is interested in the culture of that country.   This is not your first time in Korea, so what sort of things are you looking forward to enjoy here in Korea this week?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I always like to enjoy myself any part of the world I go.   We are fortunate to have a chance to see all of the cultures for one week.   But also you are here, you are playing golf and not much to see.   
For example, this week, one thing we are lucky:   The people here is always nice, always smiling, always.   In this part of the world, you know, the people is like a disposition that they are here, they are always nice, it's pretty good and I like that kind of feel, that you are pleased to breathe.   
On the other side, I like cigars, of course, I like win.   Well, you have to enjoy yourself.   And also, you have to work, no.   Nobody see me this morning at 7.30 in the gym, running.   This morning, I'm working in the gym a good bit.   You cannot compete with these new people coming up if you want to keep longer through the time and that's the other part the people don't see.   They see you always me around the golf course, when I'm here, have a cigar, have a glass of wine.   But not working hard, at 48, I would not be here.   
   
 Q.   So I think of all of the players this week on this course in particular, you've had the best results, and so how do you approach this course?   What sort of approach do you take to get some good scores?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, what I try to do, on any golf course I play, I take time to enjoy myself, that's the main thing, enjoy myself on the golf course.   I like to feel happy.   Of course when you are on the tee you have to concentrate yourself on that shot.   The golf course, that's the way it is, the holes, hit the shot and enjoy yourself, and that's the main thing and then the results are coming.   
Of course, if you are hitting good, it's nice and easy that you can enjoy yourself, if not, you pack your bags and go home.   I'm feeling well and the only thing is to enjoy myself.   If there's more birdies, there's more to enjoy.   But obviously enjoy.   
   
 Q.   So I'm sure that when you travel around the world, you have to get over jet‑lag.   I would like to know, how do you keep in top condition, and is there anything you eat maybe in particular to maintain your good health?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I eat everything.   It's no problem.   For the jet‑lag, what you need to do, you try to stay awake during the day and when you go to bed, take a sleeping pill and your body can rest while you are sleeping and you are sure that you are going to sleep for seven and eight hours in a row, and then in a couple of days, you feel much better.   
Yesterday, for example, island on Monday afternoon from Europe.   Yesterday I feel like in a cloud, but to go to sleep, I took a pill, sleep all through the night.   Next night, I have another sleeping pill, sleep all through.   Of course, you have to exercise.   This morning, I work out.   I also work out Monday afternoon when I got here.   Everything helps to get your body clock used to where you are.   And then it's normal.   No need to make any special thing.   
   
 Q.   So I think on this course you don't have to be really super at hitting long distances but there are a few holes where you have to hit very long tee shots.   I think in the world of golf, you are not known to be very famous for hitting very long distances, but when you do need to hit long distances, you know, what do you focus on?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I have what I have.   The distance I have, I have.   The golf course, it's very important to hit on the fairway from the tee, this golf course.   They have quite long par 3s, and then the par 4s and par 5s, I can reach the 18th and I don't know if there is another one there.  
But it's very important to put the ball on the right place on the greens because the greens are very, very tricky.   Of course the longer you hit, the easier it's supposed to be, because you hit it long and straight, you are going to be not very far to the green and that is a big advantage.   
But, you know, you have the skill there, and you have to play and you have 14 clubs in the bag to play with.   So it's not only the driver, the sand wedge and the putter.   
   
 Q.   So I think that you are known as a person who enjoys life, you enjoy golf and life at the same time.   But for some of the young Korean players, they are very focused and immersed in golf and they really push themselves hard.   Is there any advice you can give to these young players?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, the last two decades, we have seen a lot of good players coming up and it seems that they like what they are doing, you see that on the golf course, you can see how they are strong in golf, and I think that they enjoy what they are doing.   You have that high level of golf on the ladies tour and now on the men's tour.   You are very, very healthy here with the game, and so I cannot accommodate anything, because you are doing the right thing.   You are doing it yourself very good, and seem to be enjoying the right way.   
STEVE TODD:   Miguel, thanks for joining us and I hope you enjoy the week.
