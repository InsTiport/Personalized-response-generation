  STEVE TODD:   Miguel, many thanks for joining us again today.   I think we saw two quite different rounds in terms of the conditions from yesterday to today.   But you really took advantage of it today.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, well, today I played very well.   
Yesterday I played very well, too, but like you say, the conditions of yesterday is brutal with the wind.   Sometimes you are in the middle of the fairway and you can feel the wind one moment coming one side and the other moment coming the other side. It's always a little bit of a struggle with the wind and the conditions yesterday.   
I'm very pleased with my round yesterday afternoon, but very long; five hours and 45 minutes to play, that's a lot.   That's a long time.   Today it's very nice this morning, other than I have to wake up at 4.30 in the morning.     And played very well this morning, beautiful conditions, and first nine, is totally calm.   
Then, well, good conditions and it's there, 4‑under par, good round, more under par.   
STEVE TODD:   You were second here last year, and looks like we are going to have good conditions on the weekend.   Your game is in good shape, a couple off the lead at the moment; you must be feeling very confident about your chances over the weekend.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:     I feel nice.   I feel very good, I'm feeling very good on the golf course.   The only thing I need to improve is my sand wedge and my lob‑wedge, I didn't put them close enough.   
But the rest of the game is pretty good.   Nice shots from the tee, nice shots to the greens.   Putting is decent, too.   That's everything you need, just let everything be floating.   And like you said, a couple shots behind at the moment, you never know what's going to happen at the end of the day.   
But, you know, 36 holes more to go.   Well, I feel nice.   I feel nice.   Very good.   I feel calm, I feel peace, and they don't feel very good because they feel my breathe on their neck (laughing).   
   
 Q.   So you were the runner‑up last year, and I think you've been playing very well; so does this course suit you very well?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Looks like it.   It's the second time I've played here.   I played very well last year, finished second.   And at the moment still doing very well.   Looks like we are on the right mood, the golf course and myself.   I like it very much and I hope that we can make a good deal during the weekend.   
   
 Q.   Obviously you know the course quite well now; could you tell us a little bit about how important it is to get your approach shots right here with multi‑tiered greens, because the greens look very, very tricky.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, that is one of the main things here.   You see all the greens on the golf course, they have some plateaus and things, and you have to be on the right plateau to try to make some birdies.   
If you are on a different plateau, it is difficult to adjust the distance.   Also you need to be careful to know or you can have 3‑putts and that is very important on the greens.   You need to be on the right plateau, at least to have your chances for birdies.   Because hitting good from the tee, you know, that's very important on this course, but then also, you need to put the ball on the right plateau.   
   
 Q.   So last year's green speed was set at eight feet, so a lot of the players felt in the greens were slow last year, and this year I'm sure that they feel the greens are much more faster.   So which type of green is better for you in terms of getting your scores?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I really prefer always fast greens.   You know, this means better condition.   If they are slow, that means probably they are not as good and then you cannot leave it short; you have to hit fast.   
Also it's much better, it makes a better difference between the best game at this moment with not the best player of that moment.   I think the golf course, it's in super condition this year, perfect fairways, the tee; the bunkers, the greens, they are in super condition and the greens have the right speed I think.   It's pretty good.   If you hit a good putt, you will make the putt.   
Sometimes when the greens when they are too slow and not that good conditions, sometimes if you hit a good putt, not in the hole; and you hit good putts and the ball goes in the hole.   That's not fair.  
It's much better the way it is, nice and fast.   
STEVE TODD:   Thank you, Miguel, best of luck for the weekend.
