Q.  That run around 11, 12, 13, really turned you around?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yeah, the turning point there, yeah.  The first nine, I didn't hit that bad.  I made bogeys at 7 and 8 and I missed the second shot on the 7th.  On the 8th, I hit 3 iron and sand wedge and made 3 putts.
Q.  How far were those putts?
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  It was quite long, ten meters.

I made 18 putts on the first nine holes, and the second nine holes, things were getting much better.
Q.  Tell us about that run.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I hit a 3 wood and sand wedge at 11 and holed a five meter putt.  Next I hit driver and putt for eight, ten meters.  The next I hit driver, wedge    meter and a half, so I have two meters.

Then chance for birdies on the back.  15, Made bogey, 3 wood on the bunker, and I had to lay up with a sand wedge.  Chipped it around and made 4.

17 I hit 3 wood, and I had six, seven meters and made two putts on that.

18 hole, you see I hit driver, 3 iron, I miss on the left, I chip from to four meters.

I had a good finish and hit the ball quite good overall.
Q.  What were the conditions out there?  This course always has a swirling wind.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Yeah, the fairways sometimes it gives you some different targets but that's the way it is.  The golf course is in very nice condition, very nice setup.
