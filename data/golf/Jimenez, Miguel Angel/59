  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, playing very well again on this golf course.   On the 18th, on my backswing someone is talking just behind and I cannot stop the swing and I blocked it to the right and this caused me not to make a birdie with the second one, and instead to finish third by myself, probably going to finish four or five.     
Playing very well, very solid from all the week, very solid.   Make only three bogeys all week.   The first two bogeys is with two putts in the first round and the first hole on the first.   A pity, because I'm playing very solid and very happy with the way I played.   
   
 Q.   A nothing way to finish but I take it it is good to go into Sevilla?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, I hope I can keep my on the same level and I will be in contention next week, also.   I feel comfortable and I feel good and that's the way I like it.   
   
 Q.   Lovely to play at home again?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I love it.   Sevilla, it's a nice golf course, always in super condition.   Well, we'll see what's going on, what destiny is.   
   
 Q.   I take it that's still an event that means almost more than any other?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Spanish Open, of course it means a lot.   It's a nice tournament and I would love to have in my career and I will try any best to win that one.   
   
 Q.   It's a big week next week because of everything that's happening, the 40th anniversary of The European Tour, 100 years of the Spanish Open, and obviously Seve, as well.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   A lot of things, as you say, but well, we'll see what's around there, and I will try to keep the mind on the game and trying to do the best.   As you say, we miss Seve now, and it's sad.   
   
 Q.   Nice to have a Spanish winner?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, it would be very nice.
