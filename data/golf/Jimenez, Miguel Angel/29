Q.   Your verdict on a very, very tight match? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:     It was tight.   It was very close, and you know, I had the feeling yesterday it could be down to me.   I know this Asian Team is strong and they were going to come out fighting and that's exactly what they did.   I tried my best. 
Unfortunately it wasn't good enough.   At the end, a tie, I think it's a very good score considering what a great come back they have done today. 

Q.   So what's the feeling?   How is the heart rate when you know all the teammates are around you following the last couple holes? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Let me tell you something, that's the most expensive putt I've ever hit.   It wasn't only mine but the rest of the team.   I'm happy the way I performed under pressure.   I have to say this is the most nervous I've ever been.   It has nothing to do, playing for a team than playing for yourself.   I do regret that bogey I made on 15.   I came back with a fantastic eagle on 16 holing a very good putt.   Then he had a fantastic up‑and‑down on 17.   Overall, it was a very fair result.

Q.   As a cup competition, something that we want to grow, but it's good beginnings? 
GONZALO FERNANDEZ‑CASTAÃO:   Look at this; this is big.   This is going to be the next big thing and I'm really proud of being part of this first edition of the EurAsia Cup.

Q.   Special for the tournament, isn't it, nice to have it with this drama on the last? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's nice, the tournament, it's the first one and it will carry.   I think it's good for both teams at the end.   They made a couple of points and they go up to the end and I think we have to be happy.   It's the first one, halve the matches, very nice.

Q.   Give ten was 5‑0 after the first day‑‑
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, we are thinking that we are going to do a lot of things, that we are going to win.   But we have to keep playing, keep playing and let it happen.
