  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   65, it's very good.   I've done very well, very solid position the first nine holes, I made 5‑under par from 1 to 9, and playing very well. 
65 on the back nine, I made one birdie, one bogey, a birdie on the par5, just on the edge of the green in two.   And bogey on the par3, 15th, with a good shot.   165 metres to the hole into the wind, I hit 5‑iron pitched it pin‑high just past, a little bit, poor chip and poor putt and just a bogey.
Apart from, that game is quite good, very good all day, and happy. 

Q.   And that was a lovely start, wasn't it, that front nine was terrific?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   That helps a lot.   I start with a birdie and birdie on the third and birdie on the fifth and the sixth.   The ninth, it's very good.   A couple more birdies left on the golf course today.   But it's pretty good. 

Q.   You've been coming here year upon year, have you known it as cold and blustery as this? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I don't remember playing with that cold‑‑ well, cold.   It's not really cold, but gusting winds, they are always below the trees and it's not easy.   You've seen the results, the golf course this year is not that easy.   It's never been easy, but it shows that the conditions are a little bit tough. 

Q.   It is a course that you've thrived on quite clearly in the past.   Have they changed it so much ‑‑   but you're clearly thriving again?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The par3, second hole now, is a par 5 now and before it was a par 3.   It's a small one but you need a very, very precise shot. 
And going to the 15th hole, I remember the first year I played here in 2004, I played on that green, that hole, it's a good hole, also, a par 3.   Not good for me today.   I made bogey there.   But it's very nice. 

Q.   Still one of your favourite tracks in the world?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   One of my favourites.   It's an old track.   It's not a long course.   But you need to get the ball always in position.   If not, you're going to be in trouble.
