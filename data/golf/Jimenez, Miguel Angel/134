   RODDY WILLIAMS:  Miguel, thank you very much for joining us, and what an excellent start to the week.  Is that a continuation from last week? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Looks like it, very good, yeah.  I'm feeling well and after my break in the winter, I hit very solid, very good, tee to greens and the putter is working also, and that's what you need to make low rounds. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  You were saying you hit every bag in the club very well today. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, I hit very solid from tee to greens and the putting, holed a couple of putts. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  You got a new putter as well. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, from last week.  Putting with this club from last week. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Highlights being the eagle, could you talk us through the eagle on the 16th? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I hit driver just to the edge of the green, just one metre from the edge of the green and at the same time eight metres from the hole.  I hit that a nice putt, beautiful putt right in the middle. 

 Q.  How long of a break did you have over the winter? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I didn't hit a shot in one month. 

 Q.  December? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, December.  I finished the World Cup in Barbados, and I started last week playing.  I started practising the week before. 

 Q.  Where were you practising? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  At home. 

 Q.  Which course? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Guadalhorce.  And also La Silla Delgado (ph). 

 Q.  And during that month, what you like to do is being the family man on the south coast of Spain, just enjoying and relaxing your family and everything? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, I think it's many weeks in the season when you have been away from home, and when you have a rest and holiday, also away from home.  So you need to stay home.  

 Q.  So give us a typical day when you're not playing golf?  You get up at 11.00 or? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  No.  I get up with my kids, you know the kids need to go to school.  Sometimes I have to go bring them to the school, sometimes pick them up in the afternoon.  And lots of things going on there.  I work with a school of golf in the area and also try to get involve in the designs of courses and then we are working like people, when they stay home, there is always something to do.  In that month, I'm not doing nothing at home, and two weeks ski. 

 Q.  Is that your first time skiing? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  No, Last year was the first time. I'm on the golf course and I am looking at the snow in Europe now, and it's all the snow in the Sierra Nevada. 

 Q.  Where did you go skiing? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Sierra Nevada in Grenada. 

 Q.  And what level of run have you reached on the way down, black runs? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  No, no, no black runs yet.  I go on the blues, some reds, but not in the black.  Black....only Johnnie Walker in the evening with with ice. 

 Q.  Are you hooked by skiing now, do you like it? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I love it.  I cannot wait to have another break and go skiing. 

 Q.  What gives you the biggest rush - winning tournaments or flying downhill? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Different things.  My life is golf and golf gives me everything, you know.  Of course I cannot compare things.  If I compare, of course, if you play well, and you win tournaments, that's what you're looking for, you know.  I go to -- I am an amateur at ski, handicap 36; 33 now.  (Laughter.) 
And I love to spend my free time doing some things, at this moment I like to ski. 

 Q.  You say about golf being your life.  Let's say you had not been a golfer, what would you be doing now? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now it's tough now to say you can do what you like.  You can do what you like.  When I stopped studying at 15 because I had to work because we had seven brothers, we had to do it, I had to help the family, you know, and you never thought of things, what you want to do.  You just go and work, you know, it's service sometimes. 
 Now I wouldn't mind to be a pilot. 

 Q.  You would like to be a pilot? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I like racing cars. 

 Q.  Are you thinking of doing the exam to be a pilot?  You have to do -- 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I don't want to do now.  I'm 43 now.  I don't want to do now.  A few years ago, I've been around the Euro Cup (ph) in Spain, the finals but it's no point to do it now.  Too old. 

 Q.  In terms of golf, you're a man who has very good streaks, is this the start of another one?  You were second last week, you're here now. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  We'll see.  I don't know.  The week has just begun.  I don't know.  I'll give it my best, 100% to be up there on the top.  But I am not the only one who it playing here, there is too many players and you never know what's going to happen. 

 Q.  But in terms of your form, could this be a start of a streak because you have had periods where -- 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I feel fine.  I feel fine.  I feel strong enough.  I feel good.  I feel fine. 

 Q.  You and Monty, the two 43-year-olds, you're going to take Europe by storm this year? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  No problem.  We'll see. 

 Q.  Have you tried skiing in Dubai last year? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  No. 

 Q.  Are you planning to do it this year? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Skiiing has to be in the open air, not in a tube. Here you come to the desert and the desert is very nice. Let's get things normal, you know. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Why had you not been skiing before? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I went once before in 1991, 16 years ago. I went skiing this way and that but so as not to hit people I fell over. I would put myself on the ground. I took the skis back and said I cannot ski any more. I was thinking if I broke anything, 
 But now last year, when we went there in the Ferrari and we enjoyed it very much.  I go down sometimes but I saw my sons, the way they landed so good.  They have so much fun, I don't want to miss out. 

 Q.  How old are your sons now? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  11 and 8. 

 Q.  And the skis are growing on their feet, are they? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  The gravity is so low and they never fall down. 
 RODDY WILLIAMS:  Could you give us the details on the birdies. 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I started on the 10th.  I birdied the 12th, driver, 5-iron, 2 1/2 metres. 
 13th - Par 3, 3-iron from the tee and six, seven metres. 
 16th - Driver and one putt just from outside the green, eight metres from the hole for eagle. 
 1st - And then driver, 3-wood, sand wedge, four metres. 
 4th - And driver, sand wedge, and another four metres, four or five metres. 

 Q.  What kind of putter is it? 
 MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Ping.
