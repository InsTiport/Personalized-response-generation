  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thanks for joining us again.   A tougher day today.   Give us your assessment of the day's play. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I have to say, very hot, very humid here in Malaysia.   But we have a very tight match today, three points for Asia, two points for Europe, no.   You look on the scoreboard, it looks like the other side of the coin of what happens yesterday, no, but at some moment we don't have any point, but at the end we manage to halve two matches and win a point and it's 7‑3 for the tournament. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   You must be very happy with how the boys are playing. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Very happy, what I said before, the scoreboard, it looks very nice.   The players, they are doing the best they can and as a team, also make the best they can and make the three points and they played very good.   The tournament is still alive,7‑3, ten more points for tomorrow. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   You have the singles draw in front of you. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Thongchai is going to be in the first‑‑ inaudible‑‑ in the second, behind (laughter).   I said, hey, you don't want to play with me, you are afraid‑‑ (laughter).
No, playing with Nicholas Fung, and it will be nice.   It will be a nice match.   As you see, all the players are able to make birdies and at the end of the day you need to be yourself on the golf course and you need to keep your focus on the game.   That is the only way you can win a match, and respect your opponent and he's going to do the same thing you are going to do, that's the main thing.   That's the great thing of golf, you know, you start with the golf course and the golf course. 

Q.   Thongchai was saying that you are playing‑‑
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   (Laughter) (clapping).

Q.   Four eagles‑‑
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Two yesterday and two today.   Well, that's the game, no.   You need to do everything you need to do, you hit shots and get the ball into the hole, that's it, that's the main thing.   We are working very well, and the par 5s, they are very reachable.   You hit the shots and make yourself able to do that. 

Q.   It's obvious you like the course. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, of course I like the course.   I am not a very big hitter but on all the golf course you have to hit it straight and that is where I'm defending myself more than anything on the golf course.   You need to hit very straight from the tee and be able to be to the flag.   I defend myself very well on this golf course. 

Q.   Does this golf course remind you of any course, say, back home or in Europe?   Not the weather but the course condition, the layout, the grass, etc.?   Anywhere else?   You're playing so well. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I play in this kind of golf course, we have this kind of course in the Caribbean and this area.   This is not the first time that we play here.   We are here and we play in Malaysia and we play in Singapore, same type of grass in Hong Kong and we are playing on the same kind of grass. 
Now, well, I don't mind, I like this kind of grass, too.   It's a nice golf course. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   We will see tomorrow.   Same as Thongchai, he hopes, our players play well.   You have to play the game and you have to win points to win the trophy, and I believe also that Thongchai‑‑ as I said before, you need to play golf and concentrate and focus on yourself, and going to do the best you can. 

Q.   You are totally relaxed and you enjoy life; if you didn't have a cigar‑‑
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I always say the same thing.   It's very important, the main thing is I love the game and I love to compete.   Of course, I like to enjoy my life.   I tend to have the best possible‑‑ I like to have the wine, have a glass of wine   when I eat and I like to smoke and enjoy myself, and I also like to work, because I don't mind.   I love the game and I go to the driving range and I don't mind to spend one, two, three hours at a time I need to to fix my swing and I don't mind to go out and play or spend my time on the putting green.   And I go to the gym and I work because I need to be fit, because to compete with the guys‑‑ you have to be happy with what are you doing. 

Q.   As you reach 50, do you have to work hard on your body to keep fit? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The more old you get, the more hard you need to work.   You need to have some cardio to keep‑‑ and you need to lose some weight to keep the strength of the muscle and the elasticity, because the older we get, the more stronger we getbut not if you are lazy and sitting on the couch, you are getting old quickly.   Just pushing things, pushing things, moving, stretch, walking, running, doing things, keep you alive and keep you happy. 

Q.   It was 18 months ago you broke your leg skiing.   Are you surprised how you've come back, obviously Hong Kong, and played so well? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I broke my leg in December and away from the competition for five months, I start to working and I see‑‑ I start to working and the doctor make a joke, and I recovered and I do what I told to do‑‑ like I said before in my answer, I love what I do and I have a purpose to get back in the game.   I don't want to lay down. 
And then, well, the life give me all the presents, playing well at the start again, win Hong Kong, getting back here, I played in this fantastic trophy here, and going to the majors this year, in two weeks' time I'm going to be in the Masters.   That is the present that they give you for what you do, and I'm so pleased with that. 

Q.   Talking about Nicholas, tomorrow's rival. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I'm not understanding‑‑
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   He's the youngest player.
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   (Laughter) it's nice, how old is he? 

Q.   23. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   As young as him‑‑ he could be my son.   (Laughter) you know what, a couple years ago, I've been playing with Manassero and (inaudible) with both of them don't reach my age, 47‑‑ unbelievable, it happens‑‑ but until my birthday‑‑ but it's nice. 
Playing with Nicholas, it will be nice.   I don't know him personally.   I don't know him very well but we'll see tomorrow.   I think it's going to be an interesting match and we are going to have a lot of people with him from Malaysia that will be behind him tomorrow. 

Q.   I see three Ryder Cup players to start tomorrow for Europe; why? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   What do you think?   Put some pressure there at the beginning, it's very important.   Put the players that are in the front‑‑ in the back and the middle, that's what I think, because there we have‑‑ all the players are playing very well. 

Q.   You said earlier in the week that you would like to make The Ryder Cup; especially with your play this week, I think you'll definitely be in the team. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I don't know.   You know, I still have to qualify.   But I'm going to do the efforts to get there.   I'm going to work for that.   That is my goal in the long term.   In the short term, the goal is to tomorrow win this EurAsia Cup.   In the long terms, to the end of August, I will try to play my best and get a spot on the team.   That would be a mission for me. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Miguel, I'm sure we would all love to see you do it.   Good luck tomorrow.
