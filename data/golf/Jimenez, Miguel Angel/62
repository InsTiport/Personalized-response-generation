 Q.   Level par today, in the conditions, quite a good round?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's okay.   After the first start, I make double‑bogey, two easy putts, but with the fairway and slopes, it's not easy, only two bogeys I make today.   A couple more birdies in the round.   You know, it's not an easy day in the wind.   It's okay, four shots behind the lead is not that bad.   
   
 Q.   How tough was the wind out there today?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Some situations, you know, I think it makes it difficult, because you go for a club and now‑‑ it's not easy with that thing.   You are on the fairway and the wind is on top of you coming different ways, tough to see.   But, no, it's okay.   It's okay.   
   
 Q.   You said yesterday you thought you were swinging it well.   Did you feel that out there today?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I feel I swing well.   Swing well and hitting good.   I hit it good.   You know, I make a mistake but anyone can do that.   But happy with the way I hit the ball.   Happy with the way I hit the ball.  
   
 Q.   So less wind tomorrow and go low.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes.
