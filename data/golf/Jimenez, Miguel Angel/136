   MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I hit some very good shots and even if I missed the greens I was able to get up and down. My putting and chipping were good and overall it was a nice round of golf so early in the season! 

 Q.  How have you managed that? 
  ANGEL JIMÉNEZ:  I don't know. One month without hitting a club. After I finished the World Cup in Barbados, I packed the clubs away and went off to the mountains for a bit of skiing with my family and didn't play any golf. I wanted to do something different. 

 Q.  You went skiing? 
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÉNEZ: Yes, in the mountains in Grenada. I am not worried about injuries - well, a little bit - but I had a professional coach and I was doing things properly, and it was great fun with the whole family. Dubai might be good - they have an indoor ski centre. 
 I am looking forward to tomorrow. I've been close in Dubai a few years ago, so it would be nice to get a win in the UAE. If I can keep playing the way I have over the past thee days, I should have a chance to get my year off to a good start. I will do my best and hopefully I can get a victory.
