MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  I played very well. Hit the ball solidly, but the greens were very damp because of so much rain and we both suffered. Luckily the ball is rolling okay and I made a couple of important putts at the 15th and 16th from 8 metres and 6 metres. Things like that help a lot.

STEVE FLESCH:  That was a nice way to end the morning (birdieing the 18th to win the hole). It gives me a good feeling to take into the afternoon. However, I am going to have to drive the ball a lot better this afternoon to have a chance of winning. If you don't find the fairways here you won't win holes and that is what happened to me this morning. However, you shouldn't take it away from Miguel, he played good golf but I'm glad I hung in there and I still have a chance.
