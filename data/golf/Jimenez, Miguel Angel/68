Q.   You were paired with Sergio Garcia.   What was the key to play today? 
MIQUEL A. JIMENEZ:   The key, I think, is to keep myself ‑‑ keep telling myself to stay with him.   Everything after that is within yourself.   I hit it very, very well.   My irons shots were very good.   I'm hitting very well and I ‑‑ like I told you before, I just kept telling myself to keep up with him and keep focused.

Q.   This golf course to me seems to suit you.   You are a precision iron player and you need that here, don't you, to get it to the right parts of the green and at the flag? 
MIQUEL A. JIMENEZ:   The greens are very tough.   If you are in the wrong place, you can have some messy putts here.   You need to be very aggressive with the shots to the greens.   I hit very well my irons.   Just try to hit it on the right flat form and have some luck.
