  Q.  70 and 68, put you in great position, but it wasn't the fastest of starts today was it because you were a couple over after three?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yeah, my start is not good.  I started with a bogey on the first.  I went into the bunker there and the ball is just two fingers from the edge and made bogey from there.   
 The bogey on the third hole, I hit 4-iron and the ball was a few feet from the hole and I hit my first putt, it goes on the lip, lips out.  My second putt, same thing.   
  
  Q.  And the putt on 17?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Yes, then something new happened on the green, no.  I hit a 5-wood just in the rough, got on the green and holed like an eight-metre putt.
