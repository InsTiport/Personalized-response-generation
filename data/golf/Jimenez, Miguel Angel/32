Q.   How satisfying is that to get that win under your belt? 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, it's very nice, start the match winning the first match, it's nice just to lead the team like that. 

Q.   You seemed to enjoy yourself, played well, a couple of eagles. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I played very good, played very solid.   As you say, a couple of eagles and a couple putts at the right moment. 

Q.   Nice partnership, did you enjoy it? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it was a very easy job.   I work like just on three or four holes.   You know, he played fantastic.   I mean, he made like, I don't know, 8‑under par or something like that.   So it was amazing how he played. 
I was there when he needed me, and you know, trying to help him in everything.   He was the man of the match.

Q.   Are you both coping nicely in the heat? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   We are not used to it.   It's tough.   It's tough conditions to play in this heat and this humidity.   It's tough but we know what to do and we did. 

Q.   Overall, a nice sea of blue so far. 
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, you see four matches we are up and one is half at the moment and just going to follow the last match and continue and see what we can do at the end of the day.   Thank you to Pablo, playing a nice, solid partner there.   It's nice to play with a partner like that that you have confidence.
