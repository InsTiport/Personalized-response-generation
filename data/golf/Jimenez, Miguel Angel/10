  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, well, it was the same thing, under par is good and more under par, more good.  5-under par, very satisfied.   Q.  And a birdie at the last, that was lovely, wasn't it?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, make a nice 3-wood from the tee and just a little punch with a wedge and hold five meters putt, nice, solid in the middle.   Q.  Is this the start that you expected?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's a good start.  It's a good start.  The target is still at the end of the week and the thing you need to do is keep enjoy and having fun like I did today on the golf course.   Q.  Is Sunningdale playing as you expected?  Is it the same challenge you remember?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I remember the golf course.  At the beginning of the week, you feel like a few holes missing but the golf course, it's a great golf course.  It's firm fairways.  The greens, they are really softer than what we played yesterday and the day before in practise but the golf course, it's a very good golf course.   Q.  And a strategic one.  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: You have to think.  You have to put the ball in play every time.  The fairways, it's easy to get a flyer, and it's not easy to put the ball on greens for birdie.   Q.  Fun playing alongside Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, nice.  We know each other a long, long time now.  People know who they are.  They are top players.  Bernhard, he's playing very solid as you saw.  And Fred Couples, he make a couple of bogeys there, but he's 2-under par, played very well.  Enjoyed very much.
