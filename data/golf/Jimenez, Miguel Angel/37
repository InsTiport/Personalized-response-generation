  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, very nice, I always say under par is always good, under more par, more good.   The golf course, conditions, very happy, 5‑under par today, but I make six birdies, one bogey, very happy, very consistent.

Q.   You're playing all the events that you missed last year, so I take it that it's good to be back at Abu Dhabi and be right up there?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Very nice.   This is a great golf course.   It's a little bit too long, but the rough is very tough this year, but always very happy to be here in this beautiful building, nice conditions.   It's good. 

Q.   Does that mean that you are finding the fairways more often than not and giving yourself chances?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Lots of chances.   Actually miss a few fairways today.   Hit very good a driver, but you miss by one meter, you miss in the short semi rough that is the beginning; you miss like a three‑foot from the fairway you have to lay up and maybe on the stats it looks different. 
But quite happy the way I'm hitting my driver today from the tee and I'm very happy with my irons, they are like arrows to the flags today.

Q.   Excited, as usual, to find yourself in a position where you can contend?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, I love it, I love it.   I love feeling that knot in my stomach, I love it.
