Q. Fabulous back nine to bring you to 2-under par 70.
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Under par is good.  I always say the same thing, more under par, more good.  I thought under par was good on this course.  I've been struggling in the middle of the round with my putter and then I holed a couple of good putts, since I made the eagle.  I made a nice putt for eagle on hole No. 14, and also a good putt on 15 and also on 17.  That helps keep the balance of what happened in the middle.
But overall I played well and minus two I think shows a very good score for today.
Q. I don't think you can ever call it easy conditions around here but you had the good side of the draw, didn't you?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: The conditions is perfect.  The wind is changing a little bit on the par 3, No. 13, and then was changing back to the southwest.  But the conditions are amazing to play golf.
Q. Feeling positive for tomorrow?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I feel positive for tomorrow and day after tomorrow.  I feel like I'm hitting good and I hope I can still work on the greens the same way I'm working the last four or five holes.
