  Q. That was a superb recovery?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Yes it was, I was very pleased with that. I really had to make an effort after what happened at the 11th, 12th and 13th and I really needed that. At four under par it was not so good but now I am back to seven under par I am back on track for tomorrow. I was trying to be aggressive at the start of the back nine but there are two sides of the coin when you do that and sometimes you can make mistakes which is what I did.  
  
  Q. Are you looking at Simon's score?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Of course you have a look, it would not be natural not to. You want to know what is going on but in all honesty I never really saw him on the board until about the 16th. Then I looked up and saw the name Dyson and I started to think 'wow'. But then you think there is nothing you can do about him or anybody else, you just have to play your own game. Simon is a good player but I know what I have to do and I can only really worry about myself.  
  
  Q. Have you heard how the wedding is going?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well, I just about to go and call them now to see how the day has gone. They were due to get married at 11 o clock this morning so hopefully all has gone well for them.
