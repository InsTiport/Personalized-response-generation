 Q.   Second round of 70 for 6‑under par total.   What has pleased you most about your play?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Very pleased with the result.   Under par was good, more under par more good.   Always say the same thing.   Today playing not as good as yesterday but different result.   
On 17 I hit a solid 52‑degree wedge there, decided to hit a solid one there and not very good decision there.   Missed the green but then a good recovery.   When I miss in some place, then I'm recovering well.   It's nice.   Been good.   
   
 Q.   A highlight from 16.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Beautiful shot.   Very good with the wedge.   
   
 Q.   This is your 26th occasion that you've played the PGA Championship, showing you one of your favourite moments, your victory back in 2008.   Where does this rank in your achievements, winning the PGA Championship?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's one of the most important things.   This is the biggest tournament we have on the Tour, and everyone wants to win this one.   It's great, and to have been in position in 2008 and win in a playoff‑‑ at the moment my game is very sharp.   
   
 Q.   How pleasing is it to be involved like this in a championship you won in 2008?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's very nice.   I always say under par is good, more under par, more good.   I played well, probably not as well as I played yesterday, but I played well.   When I missed a shot, I made a recovery and that's the main thing.   The two bogeys I make on the first and the 12th, slow yourself a little down, but it's good.   Very beautiful day, very beautiful weather.   
   
 Q.   Your playing partner Thongchai Jaidee said you've had near perfect weather, perfect draw.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's very nice, yesterday, small breeze, affecting maybe half a club in the afternoon, it's very nice.   He plays very well today also.   Going to have a nice, interesting weekend there.   
   
 Q.   It should be exciting given your form last week and the way you're playing.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, exciting of course.   I feel like I win and everything is moving nice.   
   
 Q.   Any expectations?   Do you set goals for the weekend?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   My goal is the same thing, keep enjoying, keep enjoying myself, keep hitting the ball well, and on Sunday, give my self chances to fight for the tournament.   That's why we are here.   Try to do my best.   Every people, we are thinking the same.   This is very important for us not only to win the tournament; it's the purpose in moving up.
