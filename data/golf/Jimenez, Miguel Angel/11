 Q.  What are your thoughts on playing this Senior Open when you could be in Switzerland this time of year?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's my hardest problem.  I already give heartfelt message from them.  A lot of people miss me there and I miss Switzerland, too.  It's the first time I miss since I have my Tour card and it's a tournament I play year after year.  It's a pity.  It's very important to play there and the Senior Open and I'm make here.   Q.  What is your thinking on why this event and not Switzerland?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, this is a major and I want to play.   Q.  Are you excited by the challenge of it, as well, because there's some star names.  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's a beautiful golf course.  Last time we played here was qualifying for the British Open I think.  It's very important to keep the ball in play all the time because if you hit the ball in the right place to the greens -- super golf course.   Q.  We are just down the road from Wentworth where you've enjoyed success.  Is it that similar kind of golf course?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Similar, position off the tee is very important.  Feel very comfortable.   Q.  Do you feel comfortable with your game after playing links golf courses to come and change to a heathland like this?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, but you need to also run the ball.  It's very comfortable.  I like this course and I like this kind of course.  I think this is a masterpiece golf course, beautiful.   Q.  What do you think of your chances this week?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I feel good how I'm hitting the ball.  The tournament starts tomorrow, but I feel good, and I'm playing well.   Q.  What are your memories of playing here?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Last time we played here I think was the first Seve Trophy we played.  Some of the holes I don't remember very well but playing yesterday the golf course comes to mind, the holes and things like that.  I think it's beautiful and the way they set up this golf course, you need to be very precise off the tee.  It's not about hitting the ball long.  It's about putting the ball in play.   Q.  What would a senior major mean to you?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, it would mean a lot.  I didn't have a major yet.  I would love to have a major, of course, and why not this one.   Q.  Some reflections on St. Andrews.  How impressed were you with Zach?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, it's nice, he's playing very well.  It's nice, his second major.  It's a pity the weather we have to finish on Monday and also the bad draw, Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.  Sometimes it happens on links course.   Q.  Tiger is down to 258 in the World Rankings now.  Is there any way back for him?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, if he can get some confidence -- I think it would be very good for golf if he is coming back.   Q.  And in a few weeks, what do you think of Jordan Spieth at Whistling Straits?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, he's one of the players that you have to consider to be in the tournament.  He's playing very well.  He's one shot behind for the playoff last week.  This kid has a very good heart and a lot of talent, very good.
