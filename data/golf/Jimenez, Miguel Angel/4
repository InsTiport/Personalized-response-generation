 Q.  (No microphone).  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, well, looks like the (indiscernible) are not coming, letting us finish the later round.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, so we should go down and finish today.  Because tomorrow, you know, I hear we're going to have bad weather tomorrow, and we're going to start early, two starts, to try to beat the storms.   
 Q.  How was today?  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Quite difficult.  Gusting wind there, and it's difficult to use the clubs sometimes.  And, you know, with these firm greens and fast greens, it's not easy.   
 Q.  You started to look down the fairways.  It's browning a little bit.  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, but it's good.  It's fair conditions, yes.  Good position, good selective.  You need to play well.   
 Q.  You've got to like where you are.  
MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I'm fine where I am, 36 holes, three strokes back.  It's good.
