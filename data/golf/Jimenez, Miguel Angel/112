   MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: It was a good win. Played very well, very solid especially on the front nine. I was four up after nine then made a couple of mistakes and at the end won two up with one to play. He holed some putts to halve some holes and the only one he missed was on the 16th. But he made a lot of two, three four metre putts to halve holes but on the other hand I played very, very well and the first hole I lost was on the tenth when I missed a two foot putt for par. And I made three putts on the par three 12th and that's the game.
 The greens are very undulating - you feel dizzy when you finish 18 holes. But it is the same for everyone and it is good for match play.
