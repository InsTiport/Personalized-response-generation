  Q. Nice start for Spain, wasn't it?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: We started out very nice today. We started with under par with two birdies no row on the first two holes and then we made birdies to finish last four holes and that helped a lot. Hole No. 12, we both bogeyed and dropped one shot there. Apart from that, we played very well, we complemented each other very well and it's nice, two shots behind the lead, it's nice. It's nice to feel the breath on the neck (laughing).   
  
  Q. What's it like to play with Miguel, great character on the golf course and great player, it must be a lot of fun out there.   
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: It is. It's a lot of fun to play with him. We enjoyed it all day out there. If we keep on doing the same, trying to have fun out there, well, let's see what happens.   
  
  Q. Foursomes, it's a difficult format, your thoughts about that?   
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ: Foursomes is more sensitive. Well, the most important thing is you need to be yourself on the golf course, and see what happens. Of course, whatever happens, my partner, I know he would like to hit the best he can, and me, I'm going to try to hit the best I can. You know, we are human, and things happen. We will see what happens tomorrow. The format is one shot alternatively, only one tee shot, and it's nice. It's nice to see how people move in that kind of game.  
  
  Q. When is the last time you played foursomes?   
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL I played a lot of foursomes when I was an amateur. So I know the way you need to play foursomes, and I know my partner has a lot of experience. So with a bottle of wine, we are going to talk later over dinner.
