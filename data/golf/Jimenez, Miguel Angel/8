 Q.  What is your verdict on this week?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, okay, finish under par, that's good.  I always say under par is good.  It's a pity that my putter is not at the level of the game, some circumstances, and I did not make some pressure on the leaders.  They played very well.  It's a very good tournament.  At the end, we were able to finish the tournament after the weather we have here.  It's nice, great golf course, good tournament, great champions.   Q.  Some good fun for you on the final day, as well, almost an albatross and you chipped in, as well.  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes, well, I had to hole the ball somehow, and that helps.  It was very nice, the chip on the hole No. 7, hit a beautiful second shot with a 5-iron there.  I hit it, it's a gusting wind that stopped the ball and make a nice up-and-down. And then a 3-wood, second shot with a little draw, looking for the flag, and helps to shoot low when you need it.   Q.  You've played a lot of golf lately.  Do you have a little break now?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I'm going to have a break for a week and then I'm going to play Calgary in two weeks' time just before the PGA and then three weeks off.
