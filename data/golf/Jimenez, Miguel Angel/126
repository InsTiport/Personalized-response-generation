  Q. Right now you're tied for 11th. Talk about your round today. How satisfying was that?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: It was very satisfying. That was the goal, no? For the weekend, you know, just to make the cut on Friday and then hope to jump up as much as possible. It was a tough day today there. And with under par, I believe it's going to be tough to do.   
  
  Q. That last chip, where you just chipped in, Chris Di Marco was there a couple years ago against Tiger Woods and you seem to have perfected it?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Well it looks very nice there. It makes a nice turn. And I don't remember what club it was at the moment, but you know, it was nice. It was very important. I thought that with another par would be also fine for that pin, for the hole, going into the weekend, you know, but the birdie on 18th helps much more.  
  
  Q. All the wind and the conditions, to shoot a 68, it's extremely difficult out there, isn't it?  
 MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, it's not easy. Because you have to look at the wind, take care of too many things that are going on on the golf course to play with the wind, no? But I hitting the ball very solid, as you see all the stats that I hit it very solid from the tee to greens all the week.   
 And I really think that I just need to hole some more putts. But all the birdies I make this, I gave up.   
 I holed a 7-iron today on the 7th hole to make an eagle. That helps a lot. But the rest of the round the difficult were very difficult.
