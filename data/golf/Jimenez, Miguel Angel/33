  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Thank you for joining us.   Start us off with your assessment of what was literally a perfect day for Europe,5‑nil up.  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, can't get anything better than that really.   Started with my match with Pablo, but for all the others, there's not a better way to lead a team.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   And no surprise to see the same players for Europe tomorrow.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, going to be the same players we had today.   You can't ask anything better than the way we played, and today, very relaxing, just going to relax and get ready for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Is it true that you cannot take anything for granted; do you believe that?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Take anything for?   
   
 Q.   Granted, playing tomorrow.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, tomorrow I'm going to make the same pairings.   You don't want to change anything that is working well, no.   I don't know what will happen tomorrow.   Nobody knows.   But if anything happens tomorrow and tomorrow is a different format, it's going to be foursomes, and in the foursomes, it's a competitive difference than the four‑ball.   But I think you don't need to change anything that is working well.   
   
 Q.   Wine and cigar or the gym today?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   After here I'm going to have a big, fat cigar.   It's very hot outside‑‑ I looking in the mirror sideways, I can see myself now (laughter).   
   
 Q.   After this kind of performance, do you see yourself as a Ryder Cup Captain in the future?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I would love to, at the end of the year we will see who is going to be the captain and whether I will put my name for the next one or another one, I don't know, I would love to, yeah, but I love to play.   
   
 Q.   Are you a little bit surprised by the 5‑nil result today?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I always 100 percent effectivity is very difficult.   We won all the matches and you are expecting the best of the team, and you are expecting the best of your players and the best points you can and if you can finish 5‑nil, you can't do any better.  
Normally any time we play a team, it's always very close.   We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but you always are expecting of the team and the players.   
   
 Q.   You had two eagles and three birdies to start‑‑  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I don't think anybody made any lower than me.   I make the official three birdies and two eagles, and 10‑‑ probably we can make today 10‑under par probably.   I will be leading the tournament in stroke‑play.   
   
 Q.   How much of a help is it in terms of‑‑ for this event?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, experience is very important.   This is my 26th year on Tour and I've played on a lot of other Cups and teams, but the main thing is patience.   That's the thing, you have to keep going‑‑ and then it happens.   
   
 Q.   You were quite happy, smiling, having fun, even when you were not that far off, you were only one or two off at the time and it looked like you had more fun and you were much more relaxed than Thongchai.   Is there anything that makes you that different?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I don't know.   You made that perception but I try to be the most relaxed as possible.   I know that's important for me, but I don't know how to pay much attention, how stressed they are or not.   They look very fine on the golf course but it's tough when you have a captain that is making a birdie and an eagle‑‑ overall, it's tough to beat that, and they played very well, too.   But I think when you play well, the ones with‑‑ something happened there, they did not play bad.   They make also a lot of birdies.
