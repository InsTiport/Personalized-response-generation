   MIGUEL ÁNGEL JIMÉNEZ:  Today I hit the ball very well off the tee, and that was the big difference from today and yesterday.  I hit some good irons and that gave me some birdie chances.  I made two, on the sixth hole, 6-iron to three metres, and 12th hole, 3-iron to four metres.   
 I saved very good pars in a couple of holes.  From the 15th, I went to the left with 5-wood.  I hit a very good approach to one metre, ten-centimeter putt.   
 On the 7th, I missed the green, went to the bunker, very good shot out of the bunker and three-metre putt for par.   
 The score today, it reflects more of how good I am playing.   
 I was just told that McDowell just had an albatross on the 17th, and I am the only one that has an albatross on that hole in 1994.  Well done for McDowell.  We have to share the honour now.  When I got my albatross, the hole was a bit shorter, and I remember the weather was a bit more quiet, not so much wind.   
 I am going away with a strange taste in my mouth, especially for yesterday's round.  It completely knocked me down.  It's important to putt well on this course, but it's even more important to hit the ball well off the tee.  And that's what I didn't do yesterday.
