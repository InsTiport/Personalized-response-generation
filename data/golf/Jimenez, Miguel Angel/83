  Q. Every match you play, you're winning earlier and earlier. Are you playing better and better?  
 MIGUEL JIMENEZ: I keep playing well. Not today I didn't play very well. We just play very well on the back nine, didn't play very well on the first nine.   
  
  Q. When you get an early lead like that, what's the game plan?  
 MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Keep yourself focused and just play well. I don't think you have to keep playing the same way, not play different than the day before.   
  
  Q. David Toms is the oldest winner of this championship. He was 37 when he won it. You're 47, do you fancy rewriting that record?  
 MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Yeah, maybe. We'll see in a couple of days. I'm playing well; I'm hitting good. I have a feeling, you know, when I'm playing well, I'm not afraid of anything.   
  
  Q. Wish you all the luck. Is there something to be said of experience?  
 MIGUEL JIMENEZ: I think I'm playing very well. I'm 47, I'm not that young. But if I keep playing well and give myself chances on the golf course --  
  
  Q. Can momentum from a day like today carry you to tomorrow or do you have to start over?  
 MIGUEL JIMENEZ: Everything I start on a new day. It's a new day.
