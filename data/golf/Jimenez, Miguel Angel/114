  Q. Not such a good week last week, steady enough start in the season, what did you do in the winter month?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, took some time off after playing Sun City, and for five weeks I did not play golf, two weeks skiing.  
  
  Q. Have you improved at all?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I'm four years skiing now and you can improve. I enjoyed myself with my family and my kids.  
  
  Q. Was this in Granada?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yes.   
  
  Q. And you had an injury?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Not an injury, it's almost about to finish today, and it's almost like walking, I fall down and stuck my thumb.   
  
  Q. So is it affecting your golf?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, it hurts a little bit, especially with the long clubs. With the short clubs, it's fine, but with the long clubs, that's what you feel the pain.   
  
  Q. It didn't affect you today, though.   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, it's going straight from the tee, but it's fine. Not solid drivers, but going in with irons is pretty good. It's not that painful with the short game, and hit some good shots.   
  
  Q. Good start to the week. What about the year ahead, we hear of all the young players talking of their targets and plans for the year; at this stage of your career, do you still do all that at the start are of the year?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Every year of course you have long-term goals, but every day, what I want to do is enjoy myself and enjoy life, that's it.   
  
  Q. When you stop playing, I think we'll make you the Tour philosopher. You'll have the position to make everyone happy; would you enjoy that?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: We are here to learn and here to enjoy yourself.   
  
  Q. What was working for you today?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Playing very well, especially my iron shots. My driver is not straight, solid, because of my injury, I feel pain in my swing. But I'm hitting my irons very good today, and holed some putts, and that's what you need to make the score.  
  
  Q. I see the base of your thumb is taped up, so what have you done?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Skiing. I was skiing in Sierra Nevada, and fell down holding my son, and I got the stick between my hand and the ground and my thumb, tore some ligaments.   
  
  Q. You're a good skier, aren't you?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Handicap 15 maybe. I can go down all the red slopes, no problem.   
  
  Q. You don't tackle the black?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I go down one black in Sierra Nevada.  
  
  Q. So how does that hinder your game at present?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, it affects me because I cannot practice as much as I want, and you feel worry on the golf course.   
 But I still can play golf, but it's painful and sometimes you see on some swings, I am not going through the ball, and maybe you will see me missing shots during the week because it pain. I need at least six weeks to recover doing nothing. But I'm still playing and doing things, so it will probably take longer.  
  
  Q. So what is the thinking, these events are just too good to miss?  
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: No, I need to start. I need to compete. That's what I like, to compete. I feel at home, okay, it's painful, but I think I can play. If I cannot play, I would not stay here. I would be at home for sure.   
  
  Q. I take it it's better than it was in Abu Dhabi?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: A little better. Last week was the same kind of of game, but last week I cannot hole any putts. I made too many putts, and you cannot play like that. That's the game.   
 And then missed by one last week, the cut there, and it happens. Too many good players there on the Tour these days.  
  
  Q. Tell me about this 66. That's a very good start here, and we have tended to see down the years that if you shoot a good round in the afternoon, and you've got a morning, weather conditions tend to be better. Good foundation?   
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Tomorrow we will see. I played well today. I started on the first hole, left myself four meters for birdie and I played very solid all day, and I left lots of chances there.   
 I'm playing very well with my irons, and that's what I like to see in myself. Maybe the irons are the best part of my game.
