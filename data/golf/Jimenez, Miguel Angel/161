Q.
(Inaudible.)
DARREN CLARKE:  We were trying to make everything we could.  That's the way it goes.  You take a look at all the Ryder Cups, so many different teams make different putts at different times of the week.  And it was just fortunate for us that we were making so many this morning.
Q.  You've both done this before, but were you nervous on the first tee?  What was on your mind on the first tee?

MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ:  Nervous?  No.  I feel great.  Yeah.
Q.  No nerves?
DARREN CLARKE:  A little bit of nerves, but whenever you're playing against Davis, who one of the nicest players, and Chad too, that made it a lot easier.
Q.  How are the galleries, were they respectful today?
DARREN CLARKE:  Very much so.  They were very fair to us.  They were cheering for us as much as they were for the other guys.  So we couldn't have asked for more.
Q.  Hal said that there was going to be hell to pay if he put out his two big guys early and they lost.  What's the risk there for them?
DARREN CLARKE:  I think that Phil just made a putt there to go to 17.  They're dormie though, right?  You don't know.

You've got two good players Phil and Tiger there and obviously we have got two very good players.  And in 18 holes of match play, anything can happen.
Q.  If they lose is that just as big a boost to you guys as it would have been to them?
DARREN CLARKE:  I don't think it would make a moments difference to the team really.  You take a look at all the four games out there, they're all very very tough games.  It doesn't make any difference who is playing against who.  You just have to play well to win them.  Fortunately we have managed to do that this morning and other three matches they will each have to do the same thing.
