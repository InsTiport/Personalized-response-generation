  SARAH GWYNN:   Miguel, congratulations, successful defence of the Hong Kong Open.   Take us through the playoff.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Any club you can fit on that corner‑‑ a wedge, because I decide to hit, and I hit a beautiful drive like I hit on my 72nd hole, beautiful right in the middle of the fairway there and the wedge to the green.   
   
 Q.   Obviously a nice way to win the tournament.   How sweet was it?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's very sweet, but it's tough, it's hard.   Winning a tournament is always tough, and the people there is already 3‑ or 4‑under par.   I make a bogey with 3‑putts on the 15th, miss my birdie on the 16 and know I have to make at least one more birdie to make a playoff or two birdies to win the tournament.   
At the end, I make the birdie on the 17th, and then we three go to a playoff when Manley holed that chip on the last hole for the playoff.   And then after, we have another playoff and I win in that style, makes it even more sweeter.   
   
 Q.   I think this is your 20th European Tour title.   How does it feel to win, and what more is there for you still to do?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, you know what I say last year when I win my 19th tournament, I said here, I said, what do you need to win another one at least to make 20‑‑ you got it, no.   It's nice.   It's nice, you know, it's a good record.   Well, just give myself in the right mood and building more confidence to keep doing what I'm doing and keep enjoying myself on the golf course.   
   
 Q.   You're obviously a lot more experienced than many in the field, especially your two rivals in the playoff.   How important was that experience of winning?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's always important to have experience for anything in life, you know, and obviously it's very important, but it's not the determination to everything.   The people is very good there, they all play well.   
This is a golf course that always around this score is the winner.   You want attention, you want pressure on yourself also, you feel something moving up and down, even if you have experience.   The main thing of experience is I never stop telling myself, just hole‑by‑hole, calm, everything happens, live the moment.   
   
 Q.   I believe this is the first one you won in a playoff; was it the hardest?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   A little bit the same, like the previous answer.   Always hard to win a tournament, because all the players, they are good players, and you have to respect all of them.   And winning in a playoff is always more hard because you need to play extra holes obviously.   You need to have a go there, and in anything, with two more guys to play, always tough.   
   
 Q.   Many players on Tour are doing a lot of fitness programmes.   How do you keep yourself competitive since you're not doing a lot of fitness programme?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, this is‑‑ a little bit of cigar, no.   Obviously I'm 49.   I'm going to be 50 in one month.   But obviously to keep at this level, you need to work, and obviously I work almost every morning, especially on the stretch myself and a little cardio.   You need to to compete.   You need to update yourself with all the young people, you know, if you want to compete and stay long on the competition, you need to do that, and I'm doing every morning.   
   
 Q.   The Ryder Cup is coming up next year, is that a target for you?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Always a target.   Always a target.   It's a long‑term target.   There's a lot of tournaments, and the qualification just start a couple months ago, and you have a long year to go still and everything you do, like I said before, you need to enjoy yourself, play the tournament as itself and let everything happens.   Of course, I would love to be part again on The Ryder Cup.   
   
 Q.   A few weeks after you've won last year, you went out and skied a bit and then broke your leg.   Can you explain how you rehabilitated so well, and how you got back to win again?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's a lot of work.   I broke my leg and on the same day I got an operation, I still got two pins on my knee.   I'm working with a physical trainer every day.   Every day I've been in the gym working and try to get back, and then my leg start to work and recovery, and the game is there.   I'm still practising and the ball keeps moving the way I want to.   Don't lose distance.   And the main thing is my head.   The head is very competitive and I'm still there.   
   
 Q.   Going forward for the tournament for Fanling and Hong Kong Open‑‑ what do you think this says to potential title sponsors for 2014?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I don't know what is going to come, helping to find a sponsor for the tournament, make a bigger tournament, that would be nice.   It's a great place.   It's a nice location.   It's a nice tournament, nice golf course.   I believe next year it is going to be a little bit early, just before the series.   And, well, from here, we go ahead, coming up to the title sponsor, a few millions.
