 Q. 68 yesterday, 66 today, 10-under par weekend; very good golf?
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Yeah, playing very well, very solid, especially yesterday. And today I holed some more putts, and it's a nice combination. 

 Q. Do you feel very strong?
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: I feel fine. It's a little tight right now after all of the rain and everything, but I feel nice, I feel good, and I feel like I can make a score and that's a very good feeling.

 Q. Would you like to play five times next week in Valhalla?
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, during the week, right now, I couldn't tell you that. 
 But as far as the condition of my game, I wouldn't mine playing as much as I can.
