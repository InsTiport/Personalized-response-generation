  STEVE TODD:   Miguel, welcome.   Your thoughts on being here in Wales after having won in America in April.  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's very nice, I play today first time the golf course in the Pro‑Am, a beautiful day.     On the golf course‑‑ it's a great golf course.   I think it's a beautiful track, a beautiful links.   
But obviously you need a win to make all the spirit of the golf course.   It's very nice.   On the other hand, as you say, I played only one Champions in America where I won there, and I see a lot of faces, a long time I don't see a lot of faces here.   I look and say I don't know if I belong here or yet or no.   But it's nice.   It's nice.   It's nice to see all these faces.   
STEVE TODD:   Wales has been pretty good to you over the years, hasn't it.   I know you've got a lot of other targets, Ryder Cup, etc., still going on this year, but to win a Senior Open, what would that mean to you?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It would mean a lot.   I don't have any major in my career and I would like to have a major.   
Obviously the senior major would be very nice, so maybe we start with this one.   You never know what's going to happen.   I know that the people think that I can win on this champions, and I hope at the end of the week, I've got my chances and I'm in contention to win the tournament.   
With respect to the other players, there are very good players here and going to show very nice in the tournament.   
   
 Q.   Would you consider yourself still a main Tour player or a Senior Tour player?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, of course.   I'm 42nd in the World Ranking and playing in Europe and America, and there's no point to moving out yet.   Obviously I'm putting my foot on the Champions Tour next year also.   I'm qualified to play in Hawai'i and then probably a few more after I've won there in America, butI don't want to leave the European Tour. I still hit the ball well with distance.   My irons feel the same.   You know, to me, it's always a very nice target to play all the majors.   So to do competitive to do that, you have to keep going there.   
   
 Q.   Do you think you have many more years on the main Tour, The European Tour?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I don't know.   I don't know.   That is the way I feel ‑‑ if I am competing and the best I can do is 20, what are you doing there?   You need to be competitive, no.   And as long as I stay competitive, if I play well, I know I can win a tournament, I still play there, of course.   
   
 Q.   When you won in your debut, you had come off a very good performance in the Masters.   How is your game just now compared to what it was like in April?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   My game is still good.   I've been the last few tournaments, I've been a little miss on the greens.   In the Scottish, not as good then, but I hit the ball very well.   I hit it very good.   
Last week, I have a nightmare on the Thursday on the greens and then on the Friday, I put two balls out‑of‑bounds, you know, on the third hole.   On the eighth with the wrong line with a 2‑iron where on the same lineI was every day with my 3‑wood and my driver, and hit a good shot out‑of‑bounds again and then missed the cut.  
But I've been playing very well.   I've been hitting it very good.   
   
 Q.   I know you stayed on at   Hoylake to the practise.   Would you rather stay there than come down here and prepare?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I have my familia with me, and I stayed; there's no need to rush.   You don't need to spend more; you have time enough in any places.   You don't want to be bored anyway.   You want to go there, have your practise round, your Pro‑Am, whatever you have to do and play.   You don't need to be a week before in a place a week before a tournament, that's no good.   
   
 Q.   Where do you feel you stand in terms of The Ryder Cup, your chances of getting in the team at this moment in time?  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, it's been‑‑ this last year, I win in Hong Kong and then we start on the Volvo Champions this year and then play in the Cadillac.   Tournaments are going soon ‑‑ and then obviously when I finish fourth in the Masters, you want to keep where you are and you think of the possibilities, you know, and that's what I'm going to do.   
   
 Q.   Having won The Wales Open and The Ryder Cup in Wales‑‑  
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's nice, since I won here The Wales Open in 2005, first time I play in Wales, and it was nice.   Nice to win the tournament.   I played in The Ryder Cup there in the 2010 golf course there, good experience always.   Very nice every time I'm coming here.   
Also down a little bitin Caerleon, you have two Spanishrestaurants in Caerleon (laughter).   Both venues, very nice.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to Bridgestone and Valhalla after this?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Back to The Ryder Cup, what do you feel you need to do?   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I need to get a lot of points.   I need to play very well these two weeks, and those are the only two weeks I'm going to play.   And if I get on the team, fine.   If not, holidays, you know.   I'm going to have a holiday anyway after the PGA.   
I'm not going to play the last three tournaments, that is, Denmark, Czech and Italy, I don't want to play the Pro‑Am.   Anyway, none of the top players are going to be there.   There's not going to be too many World Ranking points anyway.   But I don't want to make the effort to play those three tournaments to be on the team.   If I don't get on the team in these next two tournaments, it's fine.   I'm going to have holidays.   I don't want to kill myself.   
   
 Q.   You could get a captain's pick if you don't qualify.   
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, that is the option of the captain.   I would love to, to play in The Ryder Cup, that's nice.   It would be nice.   
STEVE TODD:   Thank you, Miguel.   Good luck this week.
