Q.   Talk about finding yourself in this lovely position again?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's nice, I've been hitting the ball very well all the week and 8‑under par, one more round to go, a couple more shots from the leader, we'll see.   One more round to go and I hope I keep hitting the ball the way I'm hitting, knock in some putts and get the victory here, I would love it. 
Unfortunately bogeys to finish, yesterday also, made bogey, bogey.   Today, it's a pity I made a double‑bogey at 15, I had 7‑iron there and the ball was going too fast from the club, that's not very nice. 
In the right mood, hitting well, hitting solid. 

Q.   Clearly you love this place; this time it's a bit harder, isn't it?
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I love this place.   The golf course is beautiful.   Obviously the long hitters are going to have an advantage, but this is a golf course that you need t putt the ball in play and try to keep it below the hole.   You know, it's very fast greens, solid greens, super golf course. 
Tomorrow, I hope to keep in the same mood and like I say before, you know, hit some good shots, knock in some putts and put a smile on your face.
