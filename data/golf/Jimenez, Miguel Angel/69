  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, no bogeys, one birdie, and that's it today.   I didn't play as good as yesterday.   Without missing many greens, but always quite far away from the hole. 
A couple of sand saves more for birdies, but don't use it, and also a couple of complicated putts I made for pars.   At the end of the day, it's a strange day, but I finish level par, and level par, it's okay.

Q.   Certainly no damage done, you're in a very nice position on the board. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Still in a nice position, but the way we are hitting the ball, you are supposed to make a couple more under par.   But I gave myself a lot of shots to the golf course.

Q.   How is the course playing?   Because you'll have come with a very early tee time, and it was pretty cold this morning. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It was quite cold this morning, very cold this morning.   I just took off the long sleeves the last couple of holes.   It's been quite breezy and cold, but it is the same for everybody this morning.   I think the golf course is in great condition.

Q.   Without the wind the first day, is it more like we are accustomed to here at Fanling? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, in order to play this course, you need to be in the fairway, because if not, you're going to have a lot of flyers here.   That's the way the golf course is, even though if you don't make it, nothing happens, because you miss fairways.
