 Q.  A little disappointed I'm sure to finish with two bogeys but overall, 6-under, how do you feel?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: 6-under is good.  It's only two shots behind the leader.  Two rounds to go, there's a lot of golf to play, but as you say, finish bogey, bogey, middle of the fairway both times and missed on the 17th in the bunker on the right and missed the putt. And then 18 missed in the bunker on the left, unplayable almost because of the down -- impossible to get the ball that close to the hole.  Good putt, also, and I make a bogey.  There's nothing you can do about that.  Played well, and hitting good and, well, just keep looking for the last two rounds.   Q.  You called this course a masterpiece.  What is it in particular that you like about Sunningdale Old?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: It's very good golf course because you need to think every single shot, where you need to finish the ball, in the fairways, you need to putt the ball in the right place and don't miss the fairway.  You don't want to hit out of the bunker because you're going to waste your shot. Then it's very important on the tee, accuracy, and looks like you have all these kind of slopes and it's a very good golf course.  It's one of these golf courses you never get tired to play.   Q.  You've done just about everything in the game, apart from win a major championship.  How big a goal to win a senior major?  MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, that would be nice.  That's the goal this week and, well, we are in contention.  Put my breath on the neck of these guys there.
