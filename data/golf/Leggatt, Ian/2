Q.
How is the state of your game right now?  Satisfied with how you're playing?
IAN LEGGATT:  Yeah, I'm very satisfied.  My game's coming along good.  I'm starting to play good.  I'm scoring better.  I putted a little bit better today than I did the first two days.

So, you know, every week it's getting better and better.  You know, I've had some opportunities where (indiscernible) a few weeks ago to win, so that was nice.  Really happy with the way it's going.
Q.  What is your schedule for the rest of the season?
IAN LEGGATT:  I'm playing pretty much every week from now on till the end of the year.
Q.  How many tournaments?  Do you have plenty to get into the top 125?
IAN LEGGATT:  I don't know how many are left, to tell you the honest truth.  I'm not sure.
Q.  Did you guys get on the clock?  How did you get so backed up?
IAN LEGGATT:  Jerry hit a ball in the trees on one hole, had to go back and play another ball.  That's how we ended up getting stuck behind a little bit.  They came out and told us to just step it up a little bit.
Q.  (No microphone.)
IAN LEGGATT:  Well, that's actual    Greg actually hit a ball into the trees, actually went back and played another one, too, on that hole.  Happened a couple times today.
