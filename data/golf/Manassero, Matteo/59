 Q. You've never played here before; you must like this golf course. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I have not played well enough, I hit not so many good shots but I managed to bring home two good scores and that was when I really wanted. I'm pretty happy about this and trying to work and have a great weekend.

 Q. Your par save at 17 and 18, 8 and 9, you rolled those in with authority, a lot of confidence on those putts?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I've been putting well. That was the most important, the key probably of those two days. 

 Q. What's your focus for the weekend? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Obviously I'm not far away. My focus is try to hit better, maybe just more consistent golf shots and see if the putts will work like this all the week. So it's definitely going to be a good week anyway.

 Q. Did you enjoy playing with Zach and Sergio? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It was a great pairing, I enjoyed it, two great guys. 

 Q. Do you find that American golf fans are recognizing you more? Are you getting more recognition, more autograph seekers? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, that's normal. I haven't played in America much before, and I'm coming here a little bit more, so I'm getting more known. 

 Q. So what you do tonight?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I don't know really. First of all I'm going to practice a little bit and then go back to the hotel and rest.
