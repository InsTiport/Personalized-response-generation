 Q. Give us your thoughts. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, 71, it was a good round, first time I've played here in Wentworth. The course, it's very difficult. I really like it and enjoyed it. Played a good round, all pars on the back nine. One bogey, one steady round, I'm happy about that. 

 Q. It's slightly different for you, because a lot of players played it in the old set up and now having to adapt to the new setup, you've never played it before; what's your thoughts on that?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's new for everyone. So it is maybe better for me that I've never played it. But obviously, if you know already what the course is, you may have a better view of that. But it's new for everybody. 

 Q. And how are you adapting to life as a professional? You did well in The Italian Open. Is it different completely or slightly? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Professional life, it's different, the life that you do, but it's better. I'm enjoying this pro life and it's something I always wanted to do.
