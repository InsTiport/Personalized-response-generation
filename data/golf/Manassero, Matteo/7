 Q.  Do you take huge satisfaction from a day like this when you've had to deal with the elements again?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: It was a tough day.  In the morning it was really nice and then in the late afternoon, it turned into a really difficult day.  We are all completely wet.  It's really hard.   
Yeah, I'm satisfied.  I had a good round.  I made the chances when I could.  It was a good day.   
 Q.  So many highlights when you consider the eagle early on, as well, and a run of three birdies late.  
MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, absolutely, a lot of highlights.  Staying out of deep trouble is a very important thing especially on a day like this.   
 Q.  How difficult was the rain?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: The rain was really strong.  It was really thick rain.  Just with the towel and stuff, you try to keep dry but it's difficult.   
 Q.  How do you approach the final day?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: It's a nice position.  I'm happy to be in and I'll just make the most of it and see what happens.
