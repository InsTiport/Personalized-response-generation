 Q.   A 64, seven birdies in the last nine holes, what a run.   How easy was it for you, especially over the closing holes?  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I was feeling as I wish I would feel every day.   I was feeling really, really good, really, really easy and the ball was going where I wanted it to without a lot of effort, which is what you want on this course.   You want to hit good drivers and then be really, really accurate and solid with your irons and that's what I did on the back nine.   I missed one and then I made a bogey on 8.   
But the rest I'm very, very happy with.   I had some very short birdie opportunities, and that's important.   You're not going to make many putts, all the putts, but if you can make most of them‑‑ it's a bonus.   I finished well and I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   I know you would love another victory on The European Tour, but equally, how important is this last qualifying place for The Open Championship in your mind?   
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It's in my mind.   I think about it.   I would really love to be in The Open next week.   I like links golf, and the Open has got a special atmosphere.   I think it's going to be really difficult because there are some other guys that can win and take the place that there is.   
I will try to win and qualify, that would be amazing, and I'm in good position to do it.   It's good so far.   
   
 Q.   You talk about winning, and obviously you've had a runner‑up earlier in the season at AndalucÃ­a, do you feel you're close to a victory once again?  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, I've been close after a couple of rounds already, like three or four times, and didn't really close it out.   In AndalucÃ­a, I played really solid, but Julien played an amazing game and he deserved to win.   
So sometimes the good game doesn't match up with a bit of luck that sometimes you need, but it's a game of patience when you speak about victories.   I'm playing really well and good enough to win, but then doesn't happen.   So I hope this week is the right one.
