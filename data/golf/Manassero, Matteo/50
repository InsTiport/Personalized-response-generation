 Q. Thoughts on your round?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I played good golf, solid, didn't miss much. 
 So you know, I've done pretty much everything to enjoy, really, the round. 

 Q. How much different is the golf course playing compared to the practice rounds? Because it looks a lot firmer, especially the greens?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It is getting firmer, firmer and firmer. The greens are really tough to hole sometimes from some positions, so you have to play smart. You have to play away from a couple of flags sometimes. 
 But I think they set up the course really, really fairly, putting a few tees up, putting a few tees forward. So it really helped the game a lot.

 Q. What's been the most difficult part of this golf course for you to make adjustments to? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's everything. This golf course is a real challenge. You have to drive the ball straight. You have to hit good shots to give yourself chances, and then to end, the greens are really tough. They are firm, as you said, and slopey, too. 
 It's really a severe golf course. I need to play every kind of shot well.
