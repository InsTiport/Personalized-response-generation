  MATTEO MANASSERO:   It's never a very good feeling when you struggle for such a big week.   I put some really nice work in.   I know I was swinging well.   But it's not enough.   You need to perform.  
Today I had a nice round of golf.   I missed one tee shot on 11.   And I can't remember any other.   I made a couple of‑‑ made three bogeys, probably could have skipped a few, maybe two I could have done much better.  
I think it has been a nice round.   I don't expect it to go like this the whole week, because the course is hard, demanding.   And for sure if I'm going to play like I played today all week it's going to be a great week.   
But as the week goes on I'm getting more and more feel of my swing and that's something really good.   I'm going to work on my putting little bit, but I thought today I didn't always start the way I wanted to and that's about it.   But in general I'm happy with the start.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I played really well.   I missed one shot on the first and I can't remember another that I did miss.   I made a few really nice putts.   Out here when you make putts it means that you've done everything right.   You saw a good line, you touched it right and had the right pace.   Really it's a combination of a lot of things.  
And Bill played really well today, solid round.   And he made a few putts that allowed him to shoot this great score.
