 Q.   How good is 3‑under par 68 around here?  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It's good.   It's really good.   The golf course, it's really fair, and if you hit it wayward off the tee, you make bogey‑‑ but if you hit the ball in the fairway, the greens, they are perfect.   They are not too firm.   They are not too soft.   So if you hit the right club and hit a good shot, your ball is going to get close.   So I think it's playing tough but really fair.   
To shoot 3‑under the first day, it's a good start.   
   
 Q.   Felt good with your game and nicely in control?  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, you never shoot what's going to, this golf course, it puts you so much under pressure but I was really happy with my game and my irons.  
   
 Q.   Do you enjoy the challenge of pitting yourself against tough golf courses?  
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I like golf courses when they are make this, it's definitely my favourite.   
   
 Q.   We have not seen you for a little while at the top.   
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I know.   I'm asking that myself, too.   The game is there.   Sometimes you just go through this period where you can't make a score.   But I did make a few changes and now they are in and I have to say my game is pretty good and probably I'm playing better than before.   I'm actually playing better than before, so I hope that this is the start.
