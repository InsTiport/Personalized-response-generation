Q.   (Inaudible) what aspect of your game was responsible for the first round?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Tee to green I played very solid.   That was my goal coming into today.   It was very important, I think, in match play to keep the ball in play and always have a shot at birdie.   And that's what I did. 
I only hit a poor shot on 3, which wasn't really good, but I managed to get away with a par and won the hole. 
The rest after that, it was really solid.   I left a few putts out there, but obviously I can't complain.   The greens are very difficult to read at times. 
So I was really happy coming in the week.   I knew I was playing solid, but nothing was really coming (inaudible). 
Today it's a nice piece of confidence for me.

Q.   Yesterday when we chatted you said I just need some confidence.   How important is a day like today when you beat a player like Luke?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Of course, it's really fortunate.   Also, coming in a week like this with not a lot of confidence, the first match, it's really important.   It puts you‑‑ if you win it, but more importantly if you play well, it puts you in a nice position, and you know that you can keep going and it's a match after another.   But you know that you can put a good game on and that's the most important. 
Playing with Luke, it's never easy.   I mean, it's very nice, because we have a similar kind of game.   We battled one to another with the same kind of strength and ability.   So it was fun.   It was great.
