Q.   How did it feel? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It feels good.   I have to say, the afternoon conditions were pretty tough.   I don't know about the morning, but the wind was swirling into the trees and made the course even trickier. 

Q.   Fantastic win last week; how do you get up once more?   How do you get backup on that horse and go out there and erase the memories of such a great win?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I don't want to erase them all.   They are all really good memories.   It gives you a little bit more freedom on the golf course.   You're a little more relaxed after a week, and this golf course, this tournament gives me a lot of motivation to do well. 
I like this course.   It suits me and I want to have another good week, and that's why I want to keep going. 

Q.   So a young man like yourself, how do you celebrate on a Sunday night after winning so much money in a big championship?   Do you go out and have milkshakes and donuts or what's the story?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, I didn't do much.   I had to catch a flight.   So I hang out with a few of the Italians that were there, had a nice meal, and that was pretty much it.   I was so tired.

Q.   So your mum is over here, she got on the first plane?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, she was the first call I had, and of course she wanted to see me after that and she came over.
