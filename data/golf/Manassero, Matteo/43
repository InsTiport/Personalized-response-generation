  Q. Lovely day out there, and you played on a beautiful course, must have been a lot fun?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, it was a lovely day, you don't get all this weather in Scotland usually, so it was a really enjoyable day. The course was amazing. I really love Carnoustie. I find it really tough but I love it. A great day. Great golf day. We didn't play so well, but certainly a great golf day.  
  
  Q. Where did you struggle today?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Well, I didn't have so many chances for birdie. And I missed a couple of greens too much. So that was really tough to recover sometimes but still finished under par. The scores are really low, so tomorrow we'll see what happens.  
  
  Q. Enjoy playing with Luke, world No. 1?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Absolutely.   
  
  Q. And what about Jamie Redknapp? Are you a fan yourself?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, I am. I'm a fan of him. He's a good guy. We talked a little bit about football and had some fun on the golf course.   
  
  Q. And two days at St. Andrews now, looking forward to that?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and see what happens. I will have to shoot quite low if it's another day like this, so we'll see what is going to happen. Hopefully it will be another great day on a great golf course.  
  
  Q. And the leaderboard, you've got Tommy Fleetwood, these young guys coming through now, and you're young yourself obviously?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's wonderful. It's great to see Tommy Fleetwood just had a win in Kazakhstan, The Challenge Tour. It's such a great leaderboard, every kind of player, major champions and there's young guys and everything. It's good fun.   
  
  Q. And this week must be a lot of fun on and off the course.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's a good event. I like it. It's a bit different from the others, so Eric, my partner is very good and I'm enjoying playing with him. It's important to have this event I think.
