 Q.   How do you feel about your position in the tournament after the first two days?   
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I'm very happy, first of all, to keep going through this day, because I felt very few times this cold on a golf course.   It felt really long and it was really hard out there, but I'm happy to manage to have gone under par.   
It's probably the biggest I could have done‑‑ I didn't really play that well, but like yesterday, I scrambled a little bit, and I made a few good birdie putts.   As I said, I'm happy, happy to be 4‑under after two days.   
   
 Q.   We can see your breath; that's an indication of how cold it is.   How does this compare to some of those coldest, most awkward rounds you've ever played?   
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Sometimes we play in very, very windy conditions, but at least you only have a sweater on, or just a little bit more.   
But today, it was very windy.   The wind, because of this low and humid temperature, it's thick, so it affects the ball a lot.   It's hard to keep everything warm.   My feet are cold, my hands are cold; everything's cold.   It's hard to put a good swing on it and do it for five hours in a row.   I'd say it's almost impossible.   So you have to just stay focused and grind as much as you can.   
Of course, 15, I think it's playing like a par 5, so I just hit a poor tee shot and then it happens to make six.   I didn't hit a good chip, so I could have done better, but it happens.   In a round like this, you can get an awful moment and you lose shots.   
But yeah, I'm very happy, because at the end, I was really not finding my swing and I was really struggling, so I'm happy to finish with four on the last.
