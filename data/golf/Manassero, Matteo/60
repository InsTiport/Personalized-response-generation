 Q. Talk about your round. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It was a good round. I played pretty solid. I made a few good putts at the beginning and I just kept not making many mistakes. I think I've done one bogey, 3-putting, and that was it. 

 Q. Happy with the start?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, really happy with the tart.

 Q. How about any highlights, did you have any long putts? 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I had a very good save on 13, which I was long left. I hit a very good chip less than a foot and it was really good. 

 Q. And tomorrow you play with the same two guys and it looks like everybody in the group played good.
 MATTEO MANASSERO: We played good. We had a good pairing, nice guys and great players obviously. 

 Q. Course play about like it did in the practice round?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, still the same. It's getting a bit firmer maybe and it's going to be firmer every day, it's going to firm up. But it's playing pretty the same.
