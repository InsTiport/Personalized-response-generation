 Q.  What do you reckon 11-under after three days?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: Same as yesterday.  Kept my solid game and I'm happy with where I'm standing.  Yesterday we talked about ThorbjÃ¸rn being in great form, and he showed it today, as well.  He's played great golf and we're far behind.  But as long as my game, I can say it's been a good three days and I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  When you started, were you already playing for second spot?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: This morning, I was playing to try and make as many birdies as I could.  I think at one point we got kind of close but I could never really hit it close enough to have good opportunities in the back nine.  I had a couple; I only made one, and then the rest were 25-footers that one I left short and one was a good putt.   
But it's just hard to make 25-footers to try and catch up.  It was a good game.  It's not that easy to be tight, and that's basically what made the difference for me.  I wouldn't say I was playing for second.  I was trying to close the gap a little bit but I couldn't.   
 Q.  Is it frustrating, or given that your game is in good shape, are you that much more accepting and patient of the situation?  
MATTEO MANASSERO: I can say being second, one day to go, it's frustrating.  Of course I could have done better today but I'm happy with where I'm standing and we'll see what happens tomorrow.  Again, he's playing great, and if he keeps playing like this, obviously he 110 percent deserves to win this tournament.   
But it's what golf; we're a lot of good players and you expect them to play well.
