 Q. Disappointed to bogey the last but how do you feel about 3-under?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Disappointed obviously but I think five is going to be the average score on that hole. Obviously I hit a good shot and couldn't make 4. 
 It's all right. I started with par, double-bogey the second shot. It was a good come back after that to be 4-under on the last. 3-under is a good score today. It wasn't easy, Le Golf National. It's a good start. 

 Q. You mentioned the double bogey on the second, it's often said it's not the mistakes, it's how you react to them; do you agree with that?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, on a golf course like this, especially, when you can make even a little mistake like I did, the 4-iron, it went in the water right of the flag. It happen on this golf course, but if you react to those mistakes and those loose shots, then you're not going to be able to shoot a low score.

 Q. You seem calm and have a good temperament, is that something that comes naturally or do you work at it?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's something that comes naturally. I am seeing that you have to be calm on the golf course to react to every situation. It's some learning experience that I'm having but still it comes natural.

 Q. When you see Rory McIlroy winning U.S. Opens at 22, does that inspire you?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Absolutely. What he did was amazing. We all know golf is getting younger and I'm part of this kind of new golf cycle. So I'm really happy about obviously every time I go into a major now, I think about that.
