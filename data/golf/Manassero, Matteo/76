  Q. Do you like the way you played today?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I played all day good, every shot. Misjudged the second on 18, but I should have done even less than 71, but I'm really happy about my score.   
  
  Q. Is this what you expected the first round of all the people and everything?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Of course. Yesterday was almost the same in the practice round, so that's what I expected.   
  
  Q. How do you feel coming out to your first Masters?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I feel great. I'm playing good. I've played, I made a good impact on the Masters. So 71 in the first round, that's good.   
  
  Q. A lot of first-timers talk about the butterflies they feel when they get to the first tee box. How were you feeling?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I was feeling all right. I felt I would be more nervous than I actually was. So it was perfect.   
  
  Q. Tom Watson shot 67 today. That's pretty impressive.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, it's pretty impressive, yes. On a course like this, where you have to hit the ball straight and even far sometimes 67 leading score is immaterial press sieve.   
  
  Q. Do you feel expectations on you, maybe not in the United States but back home?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No.  
  
  Q. Because most amateurs have no expectations here.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, no. I don't have any -- I don't know if I have expectations from other people, but not from me.   
 I just want to play good. If I want to play good in the other days, if I don't play I will be sad, but not that much. It's not a tournament that may actually change my life, it's just an experience that I am privileged to do.  
  
  Q. How does the Augusta National compare to the other courses that you've been at?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's a different course. It's completely different.  
  
  Q. Harder?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: In some part it's harder. In some others it's maybe easier. But it's definitely a course that is very hard.   
  
  Q. Were you watching how the other players in your group played and that influence how you played the holes? You were watching closely?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, you mean strategy?   
  
  Q. Yes. Westwood's doing very well.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Of course he played very well, but he also plays a different game from me. So, yeah he has different strategy.   
 I have done my strategy on things that I have done and seen in the practice rounds before and that's it.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, not too aggressive. You don't go for the par-5s when it's too risky to hit the second one on the green. And you have to be more safe. This course, when you are too aggressive it may hurt you.   
  
  Q. Did you feel comfortable because you played last years Open and you played so well?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, I'm pretty sure that last year's Open helped me a lot and having such a big crowd, that's one of the things. And playing a Major, actually too.   
  
  Q. Did you know the Molinari brothers before this week and did you play practice rounds with them?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Before this week? Yes. Well Edoardo especially helped me a lot because he already played this tournament. We have a good practice round and they're always helping me.   
  
  Q. You know them well?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, of course. We're quite close.  
  
  Q. You guys aren't all straying together, are you?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, we're not staying together. But in the future we will, of course, yes.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, no, next week in first week of May at the Italian Open.
