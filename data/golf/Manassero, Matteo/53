   MATTEO MANASSERO: I have to say I enjoyed those two rounds, they are great guys, very friendly with Henrik, and Sergio. Henrik has been playing really well, he's been a bit unlucky the last two holes today but he will still lead the tournament I think in the end of the second round, but you know, I throw a bit, a few shots around halfway today. Made those two 3-putts that were pretty poor. 
 But then, you know, I got off pretty well afterwards and still finished 2-under par, which it's not an easy day out there, and you still have to shoot under par. 

 Q. You come flying back from the U.S. Open, do you enjoy that as a debut experience, and how do you adjust to dealing with jet-lag, playing in America one week and Germany the next?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's not easy, I have to say, when I came here the first two days, I was a bit tired. But you have to do these things. It's part of golf, and it was a great experience, as you said, at the U.S. Open. And next year, I will be more prepared for it hopefully for a better U.S. Open. 
 But I'm happy to be here now and I'm happy to be able to compete here. 

 Q. And not only a big weekend, but some big weeks coming up in Europe, aren't there?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Absolutely, there be French Open and this weekend that can give me some satisfaction yet. I will try to play well, maybe shoot a couple of 6-under, can still happen, and so you never know. But next week will be a great week, I love the golf course. I really like it. It suits my game well, so we'll see what happens next week and obviously then the next one will be The Open.
