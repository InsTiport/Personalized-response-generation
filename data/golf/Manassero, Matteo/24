Q.   How does it feel to be the winner of the BMW PGA Championship?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It's been an amazing week.   I've always felt something really special about this place and this tournament.   Everything has came together this week, and I managed to play well and stay in contention after a tough day on Friday, and pull it off in this playoff. 

Q.   What were you thinking when you're playing sudden death for a championship of this magnitude?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Actually to be honest, I was less tense than walking the last few holes, because you know you've done what you could for 72 holes.   The rest is just about try to hit good, regular shots, just try to make it as easy as possible, and see what the other guysdo.   I managed to hit four good tee shots, and on a hole like 18, it's probably the most important.

Q.   This win gets you into the U.S. Open, The Open Championship for three years, a five‑year exemption on Tour, you're back into the world's Top‑50 at 30th; tell us how excited you are about all that. 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I'm really excited.   Besides this victory, you get all of these achievements that are amazing, but right now, I'm just thinking of winning the BMW PGA Championship.
