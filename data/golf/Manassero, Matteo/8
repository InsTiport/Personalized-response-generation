Q. Thoughts on much more benign conditions than day one?
MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, much.  Well, it was still tough, which is pretty rare to say that.  Yesterday was brutal.  Today was a nice day.  A few showers and now it's amazing.  It was a good round of golf.  I played solid just like yesterday.  The fact there is a little less wind allowed me a few more chances for birdie that I converted and it just ended up being a good round.
Q. After the first round, this feels relatively easy, doesn't it?
MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, after a day like yesterday when you come out and it's only 15-miles-an-hour wind, it's easy.  It was fun to play yesterday because it's certain conditions that you almost never play.  The greens being a little bit slower than usual made us play, which was a really good thing for everybody.  It was just fun.  It was quite fun to watch.  It's just a hard day on the golf course.
Q. Not the first time we've seen your name rising up the board and scoring well.  Is this exciting, the form you're finding?
MATTEO MANASSERO: It's exciting, of course, being up on the leaderboard, somewhere in the Top-10, it's always exciting.  Playing well and just by scrambling well or by some sort of escape, it's even more exciting and I'm happy.
Q. Only halfway for you, but is The Open in your mind and a position there?
MATTEO MANASSERO: It's been in my mind in every tournament there was spots to qualify.  It's in my mind.  It's obviously not something that puts me extra pressure or anything.  It's something that if I play well and it comes, I'm delighted to go for the fifth week in a row at Royal Troon.
