Q.   Good victory for yourself. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It was very nice.   I played so solid from the very beginning.   I started with three birdies on the first three holes, and then to go up after three, because he played birdie on the second hole and then another birdie at hole No. 5, it was very solid.   5‑up after nine holes‑‑ he played very well. 

Q.   David was ill; did he say much about it on the way around or was it competition? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I don't know, he's playing very well.   He birdies on the first, he's closer than me and he holes the putt and we both made birdies on the second, and on the third, we both make a birdie.   He is playing very well.   He missed a shot on the 9th, and then the shot here.   But overall, he didn't play that bad, not at all.   He stuck one in there when he started today.

Q.   Being back in team competition, looked like you enjoyed it? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   I always enjoy very much to play this kind of tournament.   I love the Seve Trophy, it's a nice competition, nice tournament and proud to be part of it once more.   I've been probably the only player who played all of these. 

Q.   You are the only player to have played them all, so how proud are you to win today your singles match knowing that? 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Just very nice to come through for the team, try to win the time, because in all these years, we have won one time.   Very nice to contribute to the team to win for the second time, because all these years, we won only one time.   I hope I make a contribution to win the second time. 

Q.   It's been a good contest, as well. 
MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Very good contest.   I think it's a great tournament.   It's a nice spirit. 

Q.   How important was it to win another crucial point for your side? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Well, not really checking on where we are standing right now, but you just try and get your point.   I played really solid the whole game, probably the best I've played all week.   I've been down just for two holes, and then I put some nice birdies in a row.   I managed to get a good gap.   I was a bit unfortunate on 14 and 15, I should have done better, and brought it to 16.   I was really happy to finish it this way.

Q.   What would it mean for your team to win, having had six consecutive losses? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   That's what JosÃ© Maria said from the beginning, that our record was poor.   We played for improving that, and if we can get to improve that, it will be a great achievement.   There were two strong sides, although some of the guys didn't come, but the sides were really strong, and it was really tight.   I personally enjoyed it very much. 
We are trying our best and I hope we pulled it off.
