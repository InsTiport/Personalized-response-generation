Q.   Your thoughts on 6‑under to start the tournament? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   I'm very happy, 6‑under, it's a really good score.   The course is playing really nice and it's perfect for us, the greens are pure and you can make many putts, but still, it's not easy to score on this course. 
Today was perfect, I have to say, I've played quite well.   On the greens and just around, it has been really nice.

Q.   You seem like you enjoy coming here, Paul Casey and the two of you, batting off against each other? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, we had a lot of fun.   He's a great guy.   I get along really well with him, and he played a great round of golf, as well.   From tee‑to‑green, it was perfect.   He made good putts, and that's it‑‑ unfortunately finished with a bogey but it's a great 6‑under, as well.

Q.   As a foundation for the week, I take it that you'll accept that as a very nice start?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Absolutely.   I mean, the start you want.   You don't want to go too low sometimes.   I prefer to have this kind of round in which I can still improve some things, but puts me certainly in a good position.
