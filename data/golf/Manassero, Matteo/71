  Q. Will you be like Tom Watson when you're 60?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I would be fine with that, yes. Today I think I played really good. Can't play much better than this. I maybe left on the course on some occasions birdie chances. I made two bogeys on the last, but I finished with a good birdie; that's a good memory.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about the birdies you made and how far those putts were?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I made birdie at 14. It was three feet.   
 15, two-putted for eagle from 15 feet.  
 The putt on 18 was maybe four feet.  
  
  Q. How do you think this experience will help you as you turn professional?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Definitely will help me in all areas, to play with these guys, be comfortable with this crowd, and to understand that I can compete with these guys. It's very important.  
  
  Q. What will you do with the trophy for being the low amateur?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I don't know. I will put it in my room.  
  
  Q. Will you get it on the plane?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Is it big?   
  
  Q. I haven't seen it.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I don't know.  
  
  Q. What parts of your game were good this week? What parts could have been better?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Real good -- I think my long game, and my putting, too. I just played bad on the second round. But I putted good. Overall I think I had a good week this week.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I have a good relationship with Tom, yes. I don't know, it's like two friends.  
  
  Q. How did the good relationship start?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It started at Turnberry.  
  
  Q. What experiences will you take away from being here at the Masters?   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Everything here. I mean, playing on a course like this obviously makes you understand that you can play on every course.  
  
  Q. Did you dream about coming here and winning?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Of course, yes.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I mean, I'm dreaming about being at that level. I would probably do that if I'm lucky. I don't know.   
  
  Q. Does he give you advice?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: He's giving me when I see him, yeah. Last Monday he gave me some advice that helped me on the course.   
  
  Q. When did you play with him at Turnberry?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: The first week of May.  
  
  Q. Has it sunk in that you've actually played four rounds at the Masters, something people dream about? And if it's already sunk in, when did it kind you hit you that yes, it's real? Was there a moment it hit you that this was real and not a dream?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I always thought it was real.  
  
  Q. Any signorinas propose to you?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, they think I'm too young, I think. No, I'm not too young.  
  
  Q. Have you noticed a bunch of them following you around this week?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah. I like that. (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. Did that happen at the British Open, too?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, it didn't. I can't remember.   
  
  Q. Was there one hole today that made you want to come back and say, I can do this? Or was every hole like that?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, but making a par on 16, that would be good. I never parred it, always bogeyed.
