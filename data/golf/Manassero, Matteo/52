   MATTEO MANASSERO: Well, yeah, I started really well. I started making some very good shots and holing a few putts. Then in the middle of the round, I struggled a little bit with the putting. I didn't make -- I still had chances but I didn't make them. And then it's obviously to keep going with it. But I found the energy to finish well and to put myself in the Top-10. 

 Q. Three birdies in a row to finish with. You had your National Championship, the U.S. Open, and then you've come straight here. It's been a real tough three weeks, I suppose an enjoyable one, as well?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Absolutely. Really enjoyable obviously. They have been tough, though. It's hard to keep going and hard to play well every day if you're playing a lot of events in a row. 
 But you know, obviously you have to be fit in this season. 

 Q. And you've showed a lot of maturity at the age of 18, which people wouldn't expect but you're doing it. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, I'm doing it, and this golf is helping me and the sport throughout life has helped me a lot.

 Q. Your hopes for the final round, because you have a shot at it now?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, obviously I need to make another round like this, like I had today, and hope. But I think it's probably going to be around 18. So it's going to be tough. But we'll see what happens. But I'm very happy about this round, and if I'll be able to shoot another one like this, it will be great.
