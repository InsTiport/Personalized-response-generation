 Q. You come up against a very good player today?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, absolutely. Luke has the fervor for this tournament. He didn't miss a shot. He didn't make a bogey. And when he was missing shots, he was recovering. He's doing every single thing in the right way. 

 Q. You must still be delighted with how you played this week?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yeah, I am delighted with the way I played this week. And I'm delighted to go up to Friday, here. And I think I have done my best today. I probably played -- I certainly didn't play worse than the other days, I just met a tough competitor.

 Q. And going up against the Top 50 will get you into The Masters?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Maybe. I don't think I'm in it yet. But we'll see in -- still have a few weeks left. 
 I came back in the U.S. to play a few events and see if I can get in The Masters.
