 Q. You were talking about the honor of playing in this championship. Now you've made the cut in this championship. Talk about that. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Probably. I don't want to --

 Q. Let's presume it. 
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Okay, we presume it, and I like this.

 Q. What would it mean for you?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It means that maybe I've won the low amateur, which is a great honor and a great victory, so I'm really happy about this. But I'm a little upset for some other things that happened today outside on the course.

 Q. What are some of those things?
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I want to say my game was not good today. I played so well yesterday. Today I struggled a little, but if I made the cut, I'm happy anyway.
