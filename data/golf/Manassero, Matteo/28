  MATTEO MANASSERO:   It was a good score, 3‑under par is a good start today.   It wasn't an easy day.   I find it always tough when the first day, it's difficult straightaway.   So you need to be focused in your game and you need to start well. 
So I was happy today.   I putted well.   I played good.   Didn't miss much.   So it was a good first round. 

Q.   And yet it was also the case that it's a little bit easier than we fear that it might get. 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, Dave, my caddie, said yesterday was going to be‑‑ but today was going to be really, really bad weather, and, you know, it was just‑‑ to be honest, it was just cold.   It was windy, but it was doable. 
And this afternoon, they predict that the wind is going to pick up.   I don't know if it is going to do it or not, but anyway, this course, this golf course is tough with sunny conditions and no wind, so it's even harder like this. 

Q.   A lovely foundation whatever happens.   Do you think it will stand the test of time?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   This course, you mean? 

Q.   The way you scored. 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   The way I scored, I think it's definitely going to stay in the Top‑10.   It probably even is going to stay in the top 5 but I can see some other guys reaching 3‑under, because if you're putting well, you don't need to do so much to make your birdies and stay away from bogeys.

Q.   Are you excited about being in the Flagship Event?   It seems even bigger somehow this year. 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It seems every year, that it's getting bigger and bigger.   Today I wasn't definitely the main group but is there was so many people around watching with these conditions.   It's definitely getting bigger and bigger. 
I've played well here in 2011 and it was a great feeling two years ago.   But I would like to bring those memories back. 

Q.   What's happened with your finger; it s taped. 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Nothing, I'm just practicing a lot. 

Q.   Only the second man to break 70 today, was any particular aspect of your game responsible for the success?
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yeah, I think I putted really well.   I holed a few putts, but the most important thing is that I felt really, really solid, and I felt really good addressing the ball and I was hitting good putts.   I think that was the main thing. 
And being such a tough day, a grinding day, you can't really hit all good shots, so you've got to make your par saves and make your opportunities, so I think that was the main thing.

Q.   You mentioned a tough day; the wind is starting to get up significantly.   How would this course be if it blew another ten or 15 miles an hour? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It would be really hard to break par.   It was this morning; it was really cold when we started.   I have to say, it's been windy since the very beginning.   So if it gets even windier, it's going to be really hard to make birdies and hard to put the ball close, and very difficult to miss those bunkers that, you know, you can just fade it a little bit too much or draw it a little bit too much and you find yourself in trouble to save par.
