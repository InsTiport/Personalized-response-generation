  Q. You played in the last group, it was a difficult day, I suppose, really.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It was. It was for me. Some good scores, on top of the leaderboard, some guys that played well.   
 I think it was a tough day. I probably didn't hit enough good shots and didn't give myself any -- well, maybe two or three chances for birdie, and didn't get them. So it was a tough day. I struggled but it was a good experience.  
  
  Q. Another learning day for you, every time you play, and with the world's Nos. 1 and 2 around about you, as well.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It's a big learning thing, as I said yesterday. It could have been a fantastic day. Ended up being a learning day. Happens sometimes in golf. Obviously I'm not happy but I will be when I will come back here and do well again.   
  
  Q. Does this week give you the appreciation of what a big championship this is, especially today when you look at the crowds you saw on 18?   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: It was really, really amazing. You could see, it was great from the beginning, big crowd. It was nice to see so much of a crowd.   
  
  Q. And your next start is in Italy?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes.  
  
  Q. Another BMW, a win in your homeland, you never know.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, I'll try.
