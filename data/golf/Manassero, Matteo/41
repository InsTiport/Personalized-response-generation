Q.   A four birdies, one bogey, final round of the tournament, are you pleased with that? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   Yes, I'm very pleased.   I'm happy with the way I played this week.   I putted really well and I got away from many troubles with the putter.   It was a really good week coming out of not a great stretch of tournaments and really happy to start the year like this. 
A good final round and a really solid tournament this week, so I'm really happy.

Q.   10‑under par will be a Top‑10 finish, and Francesco also finished in the Top‑10; how important is that for Italian golf? 
MATTEO MANASSERO:   It's good.   Obviously we showed a lot of it and we have done really well.   We were four out of five that made the cut this week.   It's really amazing for Italian golf and great to have hopefully two Top 10s.
