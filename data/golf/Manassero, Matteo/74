   MATTEO MANASSERO: I'm feeling okay. I'm hoping to make this cut that I struggled for. So I've played not good today. I actually played bad. But I made some important putts under pressure. That was a good thing after today.   
 But I am 4-over, so I'm nearly, I'm on the cut maybe 3-over there and I hope it would stay at 3-over.  
  
  Q. They actually think that the cut is pretty solid at three so, that would mean that you are not only the youngest person ever to make the cut, but the low amateur. What would that mean to you?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: A good thing. But for the moment now I'm thinking about my game today and I'm not happy about this round.   
  
  Q. I think you'll have a chance to improve on it on the weekend. Good luck.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: I hope so. Thanks.  
  
  Q. Can you tell us what you'll work on on the range tonight?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: From wedge to driver. All the long game.   
  
  Q. You did some good escapes today.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes, that's true.   
  
  Q. Talk about that.   
 MATTEO MANASSERO: Yes. I made many putts, many great up-and-downs. So that was a good thing. The good thing of today that saved me a little.   
  
  Q. Were you thinking about the cut coming in? Were you feeling any pressure coming in to keep it up the last few holes?  
 MATTEO MANASSERO: No, I wasn't actually. Actually, I always thought to stay like within 10 shots of the leader, so I finished, I think, 11 shots of the leader. But I don't know, actually.   
 On the course I had no idea about how the cut was. I just played, saving some putts, trying to do the best I could. Actually, I have done my best with 4-over today. I cannot make less than 4-over.
