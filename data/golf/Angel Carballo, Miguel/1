Q. First time playing here?
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: No, it's my fourth time.
Q. Reacting to going into the clubhouse with the lead?
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: I'm hitting really good because having played here already gives me a little confidence.  I didn't start off that well so during the middle of the round got a little bit better and started hitting the ball better, so I'm feeling really good right now.
Q. What have the previous experiences helped you with this time around?
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: I finished ninth here last year so that helps me a lot.  I made a lot of birdies, so I feel really good having played here before.  I'm feeling good about it.
Q. Do you enjoy playing in the modified Stableford format as opposed to the regular scoring system?
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: I like playing it a lot more because you can attack the pin a little bit better, a little bit more.  So eagles and birdies are way better than just making a bogey, so obviously good for me.
Q. Two eagles, take us through the two holes if you can.
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: Coming off 11 we holed out from the bunker, on 16, I'm sorry, so that felt good going in.  That changed the round for me there.  And on 17, I just hit it really good and it just hit and it started rolling towards the pin.  So (indiscernible).  And then on 2, we hit a good drive and a solid 3-wood.  We didn't see exactly where it ended up, but saw that it bounced good, so we were hoping for the best and it ended up being right behind the pin.
Q. Comment about your goals here, with just three weeks left in the regular season.
MIGUEL ANGEL CARBALLO: Just foremost is getting inside the 200.  We just slipped out.  We're 201 right now.  So trying to play solid this week and breathe a little bit better and just get inside the 200 and hopefully get into the finals, the Web finals.
