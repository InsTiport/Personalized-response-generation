Q.   Tell us your impression of your partner. 
THOMAS LEVET:   He gave a key start.   Two of the first five holes we played here at St. Andrews, we made a wedge on 3 and nice eagle on 5.   Suddenly he made those eagles and after that he kind of struggled because he saw his name on the leaderboard, and I saw his face going like this, it's his birthday‑‑ he got so much press on the competition, I think he picked up about 30 years of press this week.
