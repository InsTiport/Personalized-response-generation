THOMAS LEVET:  I think we have a little chance now.  Raphael played really well today and I just tried to keep encouraging him.  He had seven birdies on his own and hit some great shots. The best run was around the 11th, 12th and 13th where he made some great putts, and again on 18.  I thought when we started that something like 20-under would be close to the lead, and that's turned out to be the case.  Unfortunately, we just didn't make some putts coming home at the 15th, 16th and 17th.  We were hitting it close all the time but the putts didn't drop.  I think we could have been about two shots better.
