   THOMAS LEVET: It was pretty tough conditions. It was disappointing because I hit the ball quite solid and there are some holes that are really on the edge of being playable today, and they are not the longest ones. 
 No. 8 was very difficult to get to the green, things like that, and I didn't get very lucky. But I'm still in the running and not too far behind so hope it goes better tomorrow. 
 It wasn't too cold I thought, but it was it ten degrees or so, so dry and it's tough to control the ball, and that makes it frustrating on the putts because you can't feed them. They are dry and the same positions as yesterday, the hole is on the mound, so it goes away from the holes if you don't go at a good speed. 
 So it's tough to get aggressive. That's why I didn't putt good enough.
