  Q. Pleased to finish with 70?  
 THOMAS LEVET: Pretty pleased. The first hole made a really long putt on No. 3 for eagle and hit it stiff on No. 4 for birdie. My iron play was very, very good today and I putted quite poorly and had so many birdie chances today.   
 The greens are good, as well. I was not really pleased at the time, because I missed two drives and made two bogeys and couldn't make anything. I made a nice putt on 18 and that kept me going, enough to go to 3-over par and then that stretch kept me under par, but I could have done better today. It was an easier round of golf today than you can imagine on that golf course, but there's almost no wind today.  
  
  Q. Teeing off the 10, you hit a stretch, 15 through 6, really difficult holes in a row, is there a sense of, if I can get through these, then there are some birdies for me?  
 THOMAS LEVET: Exactly. It's a stretch that you need to go through really well and once you've done this, you think, wow, I need to birdie my way in. So I was actually at 2-over par, I knew that after this, No. 2 was gone there, were some birdie holes there, but just that kept me patient. If you are done with the easy stretch and 2-over par, wow, you're in trouble here.  
  
  Q. You were very much A part of the Ryder Cup bid for France, a successful bid, is there a buzz of anticipation already, seven years ahead?  
 THOMAS LEVET: Of course, of course people are speaking only about that. You can see it all over the course and it's ready. It's ready for The Ryder Cup. People are just -- they can't wait. They haven't seen a Ryder Cup, most of France haven't seen a Ryder Cup yet, and it's just going to be a nice golf course here for them. It's going to be crazy, the atmosphere, just imagining the tents around 18, 15, 16, wow, it's going to be loud.
