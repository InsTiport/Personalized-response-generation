THOMAS LEVET:  It was kind of a classic match-play contest. Neither of us played that well, but then again neither of us played that badly. That would explain why it went up and down, Mike in the lead, me fighting back and then Mike going ahead again just before lunch there. I didn't putt well early on, in fact I three putted three times, but I think that was more to do with the cold and the long delay. Once I got into my stride I was a lot better and hopefully that will be the same this afternoon. We look set for a tight match."
MIKE WEIR: We certainly finished the round better than we started it. It took a while for us to get going, but the game went back and forth, with me getting a couple of holes ahead and Thomas squaring the match near the end. He got a nice break at the 15th where he missed the fairway but made birdie while I was pleased with a birdie-eagle finish to get in front again.

Hopefully that 20-footer on the last will set me up for the afternoon round.
