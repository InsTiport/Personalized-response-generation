THOMAS LEVET:  The problem is tomorrow it's going to be a nightmare.  I think you're going to have 22 players, because unfortunately Chile retired, it's going to be 22 players with nightmares tonight just waiting for the foursomes.  Can we just do something to refuse to play or something like that, because it's going to be terrible.  It's going to be terrible.


Q.   (Inaudible.)

THOMAS LEVET:  At least we'll be 3-under.

RAPHAEL JACQUELIN:  At least we made a few putts.  It's a tough combination.  The driver downwind is going three yards on the fairways, and the putting on the greens is going 30.  That's why the scoring is so ugly.

RAPHAEL JACQUELIN:  I look forward to playing tomorrow.  It's going to be funny tomorrow.  It's going to be great fun.

THOMAS LEVET:  It's going to be so much fun.
