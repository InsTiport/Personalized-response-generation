 Q. 69-69 and four better today, what was the seek secret to that success?
 THOMAS LEVET: Better putting, a little more accurate off the tee and I hit it closer to the pin, so you know, when you do all that, at the end it's all lower, and I was lucky on the bad shots and went on the green and even made a birdie from one of them. That's what it is. It's just golf.

 Q. Conditions different from the first two days? 
 THOMAS LEVET: They changed a few tees on the front nine, much shorter on the front nine but much longer on the back nine, especially holes like 16 and 17 are really, really long. I had a really good drive on 16 and had 100-something yards to the pin. Darren was a hundred yards behind me and must have had 220 to the front or something, really long hole. 
 17 is 220 to the wind, pretty good par 3, and unreachable today for me on the 18th. I don't think there will be many guys hitting the green. 

 Q. What was your mind-set going out? 
 THOMAS LEVET: Just keep playing the way I've been playing the last few weeks and just fully get calmer on the greens and things will drop, and I said, you know, when they started dropping, I said, yeah, keep the same speed on the greens and try to do your best and you never know. 
 The guys might struggle in the front and you get a little chance, even if I'm say, six, seven behind, things can go quickly as we've seen the last few weeks. Even the leader has trouble keeping the lead with four or five to go.
