  Q.  Disappointed with the last couple of holes obviously?   
 THOMAS LEVET: Yes I was annoyed to drop a shot at the 17th but the last was just a stupid, stupid shot. It is one of the shots you like to avoid when you are a pro. I played nearly three whole days without a stupid shot, I played very steady and it was all good and then on the 18th, I don't know what went through my head. There is no fairway if you hit a good driver, you hit three wood and three iron and you are on the green probably and it is just annoying to finish like that.   
 But I am in there for tomorrow and I am happy to be back up there after my start which was really rough. I came back really well, making putts, but I blew it off on the last two holes. It is a little sour in the mouth. But the good thing is that I am not feeling that tired and I am here for tomorrow in a tournament that is always good to me. It is annoying to drop two shots at the end though because if I hadn't done that I would have been tied for the lead and those two shots could make the difference tomorrow - we'll see, I hope not.
