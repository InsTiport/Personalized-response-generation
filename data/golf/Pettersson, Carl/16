 Q.   Talk about the ball hitting your ball.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, I was getting ready to go and pulled the club back and a ball bounced and hit my ball.   So I managed to stop.   I've never seen that or experienced that before.  
   
 Q.   Do you know who hit the shot?   Whose ball it was?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   No, I got no clue.  
   
 Q.   Did it come from 2?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   I think so, yeah.   
   
 Q.   It's a bit of a miss, isn't it?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah.   
(Laughter.)   Yeah, it was, I mean, luckily, I wasn't in my down swing, because if I would have missed the ball, it would have been a, I don't know what the ruling would have been on that.   But it might not have been good.   I regripped and hit a decent shot after that.   
   
 Q.   Did you struggle a little near the end just because of the conditions?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Not really.   I missed a few fairways.   Made a couple of bogeys right there.   Went for an aggressive play on 10, my last hole.   Tried to drive the green and made bogey.   
   
 Q.   Did you miss it left?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah.   But when you go for the green, that's always an option, so I really wanted to get to even par, so.   
   
 Q.   Is there anything about the course that surprised you?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Not really, no.   
   
 Q.   Pretty straightforward?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah.
