 Q.  Can you just talk a little bit about the way you played today to start out? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I played all right.  I started off well, 2-under through four holes, I think.  I got it to 5-under playing 17 and hit it in the water there and made double, then I hit it in the water on 18 and made a good bogey.  Then I came back with two birdies on 1 and 2. 
 Chipped in on 7 to get it back to 5, and then unfortunately I finished bogey-bogey, but overall I'm pleased. 

 Q.  You're right in there? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, exactly.  3-under.  I don't know what the lead is going to be at the end of the day, but it won't be too far off. 

 Q.  Do you feel like this is a course that suits you? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Well, I played it well last year.  I finished eighth last year, and before that I had missed the cut twice.  I feel you've got to be on your game and playing well, and I feel like I'm playing pretty good.  It's just tough.  You've got to play well, and you're going to make bogeys, but fortunately I made a few birdies. 

 Q.  Is it a course you kind of have to learn your way around? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I think so.  This is my fourth time around here, so I think the first couple times it's tough, you don't know where to miss the ball and stuff like that, so it's definitely helped. 

 Q.  Going into the weekend how do you feel about your chances?  Do you get your juices flowing a little bit more knowing you're right in it? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Not really.  Maybe on Sunday, but it's a long way to go.  We're only halfway through, and you can't really worry about that.  Just try to press on and see what happens.
