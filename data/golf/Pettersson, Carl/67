  Q. Carl, a Sunday of survival, I think, for a lot of you guys. If you can just keep it sort of in the red, you have a shot.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I played well today. I was actually a few over at one stage of the round, and I came back and played really good on the back nine. I had one putt on 15 that didn't go in and a putt on 17 that didn't go in. But overall I'm happy. I played nice. I finished the last three days, all rounds in the 60s, so just struggled a bit out there.  
  
  Q. That 17th, there's not a lot to it, but it can be diabolical, can't it?  
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I actually hit a terrible shot. It's so tricky today with the wind. There's no margin for error there, and I tried to play it in the middle of the green and pulled it in the left trap. Hit a decent bunker shot and hit a great putt, and it didn't go in.  
  
  Q. Were you looking at the score? Were you thinking if I can get to a number maybe I've got a shot?  
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, a little bit. I thought if I could get to 5, maybe had an outside chance. Like I said, I hit a great putt on 15 that would have got me to 3, and then I birdied 16, and that would have been 4, and then one more. But I'm happy; I played well. It hasn't been the best of years for me so far, but it's coming around.  
  
  Q. Headed home to North Carolina, though, for next week. You've got to feel good headed into Wachovia.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, exactly. It's always nice to play at home, and I'm looking forward to next week.
