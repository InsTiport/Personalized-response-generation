 Q.   Heck of a round out there.   Well played.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, it was good.   It was fun.   I finally made some putts and still managed to make a bogey, but that's the way golf goes.   It was good.   I don't think I'm going to have a chance, but it's certainly a nice way to finish off a great tournament.  
   
 Q.   Heading into next week, too, probably get some momentum, heading over to play the HSBC?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Well, sure.   Any time you shoot 9â€‘under it gives you great confidence.   I just hope it's a little bit cooler next week.  
   
 Q.   Is it one of those things where you see a lot of guys going low and you want to be a part of it?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, I felt like that the first three days.   I played pretty good golf, I just kept making stupid bogeys.   Today I played nice, but I made a lot of putts, which is a key to shooting low any time, and it was fun to shoot a low one.
