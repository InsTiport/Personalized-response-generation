TODD BUDNICK:  We thank Carl Pettersson for stopping by the 2006 Chrysler Classic at Greensboro.

Carl, your fourth start here.  You made the cut in your first three and progressively 85th, T 35, T 11.

Could a victory be next here this year?
CARL PETTERSSON:  You never know.  I hope so.  Played pretty good last week.  Played pretty good today.  You never know but, hopefully, just go out and try my best and see what happens.
TODD BUDNICK:  Talk a little about the course.  You just had a chance to play it.  Give us conditionwise.  Also, you've also been a very good fall player.  You've had some good finishes last two years.

Just talk about that, how the two go hand in hand.
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think the course is nice.  Greens are good and same layout we had last three, four years and I don't know why I seem to play well in the fall.  I don't know why but I do.

It takes me awhile to get going maybe but this year I played good in the beginning of the year so I hope I can have one of my good fall finishes and play well for the four tournaments.
TODD BUDNICK:  Picked up your second career victory earlier at the Memorial tournament.  Talk about what that did for you.
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think it was nice.  One victory is nice but when you get the second one it kind of confirms the first victory and just given me a lot of confidence that if I play well, I know I can win.

That's the major part.
TODD BUDNICK:  You're 14th on the money list with four weeks to go.  Does the Top 10 a place    you've won already.  You're in the Tour Championship.

What goals do you have left this year?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Well, I'd like to try to win again but it's so difficult in golf to win.  Tiger has been winning every week.  I've got a little miniature goal, try to finish Top 10 on the money list and play well the rest of the year and see what happens.
TODD BUDNICK:  Have any questions?

Q    Carl, over the time that you spent high school and in college in North Carolina, were you able to play Forest Oaks a lot, some?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No.  I've only played it a couple times before this tournament.  I enjoy playing it.  I can't quite remember too much of it.  But I actually skipped high school and come back here and watch the guys.

Q    When you were at "Grimsley", were you a pretty big guy?  Did the football coach every ask you to come out for the team?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No.  I was too involved in golf already.  I started there my junior year and I was pretty serious in my golf at that time so I just concentrated on one support.  Kind of glad I did.

Q    The people that are playing with you today, were they college friends?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Sir?

Q    The people that played with you in the Pro Am, were they college friends?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Today?  No.
TODD BUDNICK:  Anything else for Carl?  Alright.  Thanks for stopping by.
