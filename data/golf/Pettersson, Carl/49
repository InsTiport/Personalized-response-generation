  Q. Talk about 18?   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, it was nice to finish with a birdie. I played solid all day. I've got this new Nike 20XI golf ball, and I was able to reach par-5s that I normally don't reach in two, so that was nice. I played nice.  
  
  Q. I noticed you driving well today.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I felt like I drove it pretty good. I missed a few here and there, but it wasn't far off.   
 I played nice. It was fun. The group was good. We all played nice, and we kind of pushed each other.  
  
  Q. Says a lot for your ability out of the rough as well.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, there is not much rough here. It's very short. The course is playing firm and fast. It's playing good, and to shoot 5-under this afternoon is pretty good.  
  
  Q. How did the wind affect you?   
 CARL PETTERSSON: I'm actually getting by all right. But it was difficult. Some of the long holes are into the wind. Some holes played easy downwind, and some holes played very hard.   
 It was fun, had a great group. And hopefully I can keep it going.
