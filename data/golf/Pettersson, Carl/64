   JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Alright. We'd like to thank Carl Pettersson for joining us for a few minutes here in the Media Center.
 Wow! Nice little string right there between 4 and 7. What happened? Got on a nice roll there.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I was kind of frustrated because I missed two foot putt on 17 and 18 for bogeys and I knuckled down on my back-9 which was the front-9 and made some nice birdies and managed to throw an eagle in there and it's sort of a 9 holes you can shoot a good number if you're playing well and I managed to do it.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Questions, please.

 Q. Do you feel more pressures playing here?
 CARL PETTERSSON: Little bit. I was a bit edgy starting out but it's more my own expectations of doing well. Little bit when you're playing, this is a home game for me, I want to do well and I want to do well every week, obviously, but it feels a little added extra pressure when you're playing at home and it's nice when you do play well.

 Q. Is that because of your few years here in Greensboro or the fact that you seem to be a big part of this tournament now?
 CARL PETTERSSON: Well, I'm on the Board of this tournament and I used to live here in Greensboro and lived down the road in Raleigh. I've got a lot of friends and family out there watching and yeah, you know, it's not huge pressure but I want to do well, obviously, and when my friends and family come out and watch, it's nice to play well.

 Q. Did you notice Tim's round?
 CARL PETTERSSON: No, Didn't really look at any scoreboards. Obviously he's a good player. I saw right now he's playing well so it's actually a perfect golf course for Tim's game. I expect him to do well.

 Q. You guys don't have any bets or anything?
 CARL PETTERSSON: No. We used to but nobody ever paid each other (laughter).

 Q. Can you talk a little bit about you say how this is a course where you can really catch on fire.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah. You know the front-9 it is pretty short really for Tour standards so you're going to have a lot of short clubs in, greens are soft. Even if you drive it into the rough you can get some decent lies where you can still be aggressive at pins and stuff.
 It can backfire, too. Some of these pins are tucked away and obviously if you're on your game you can really shoot a low number.

 Q. Carl, last year at Forest Oaks you said you think it would be good to move the tournament here. That was before any official announcement.
 How do you feel about it now after one round?
 CARL PETTERSSON: I noticed a whole lot more people out here today than we had last year, even for a Thursday, it was on that back-9 it was -- I wouldn't say it was packed but it was good crowds and I think all the players enjoy coming here. 
 I've heard good reports and I think the fans enjoy coming out here and watching us so hopefully by the weekend we'll be packed and it will be nice.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: We'll start on your back-9 where you started. 13 you had a birdie.
 CARL PETTERSSON: 13, I hit a 3-wood and 9-iron to about six feet and made the putt.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 16.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Par 3. Had an 8-iron to about five feet, made the putt.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Talked about 17 and 18, missed some short putts. Go through both of holes where you made bogey.
 CARL PETTERSSON: No. 17 I hit driver, sand iron to about 15-foot and ran it by two foot and made a careless putt and missed the putt, and 18 I hit driver in the right rough, good 6-iron to about 20 feet and I ran it by about a foot and a half and I was -- my mind wasn't really in that putt. 
 I was thinking about how could I miss the putt on 17 and I missed it again, so -- but in one way it was kind of good because it got me fired up for the front-9 and got me more focused.
 Sometimes a bogey can help -- get you in the right mindset for the next couple of holes.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 2.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Two, I hit 3-wood, wedge to about 25 feet and made it.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 4.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Four, I hit 3-wood, 6-iron to ten feet, made it.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Eagle on 5.
 CARL PETTERSSON: Driver, 6-iron to ten feet.
JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 6.
 CARL PETTERSSON: 4-iron off the tee, 9-iron and made it.
JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Birdie on 7.
 CARL PETTERSSON: 4-iron to 12 feet and made it.
 I had a good opportunity on No. 3. I missed about a 10-footer for birdie and missed about an 8-footer for birdie on No. 8.
 JOAN vt ALEXANDER: Anymore questions?
 CARL PETTERSSON: Thank you.
