Q.
That was a tough match, wasn't it?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, it was.  I was 2 up through nine.  And then Kenny came back and played well.  He birdied 10 and 12 and came back to even.  Then he parred 14.  So I was happy to get it back, 1 up on 17.  And we both birdied 17.  A win is a win, it doesn't matter.
Q.  It was a classic match play, the way it went back and forth, wasn't it?  Matches can happen like that.
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah.  I haven't played match play for a long time, since '03.  I enjoyed it.
Q.  It's different to get back into the thinking for match play, because it really is a different game, isn't it?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, but it's so much fun.  You get more aggressive in certain spots.  You've just got to try to put it in play.
Q.  Some guys prefer an easy 7 & 6 win in the first round, but you were right there away; is that better do you think?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Well, it's nice to make putts like I did on 17.  It's always a nice confidence builder, but it would have been nice to close it out on 17.
Q.  What happened on 17?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Hit it in the rough, the right rough, and had a decent second shot, pin high left, fairly easy chip and ran it by.
Q.  Is it tough to gather yourself right away?
CARL PETTERSSON:  You want to close it out when you can, but I thought Kenny would make birdie on the last, and you've got to expect the unexpected.  But you've just got to tell yourself to relax.
Q.  After his approach you thought
CARL PETTERSSON:  I thought he'd make birdie, actually.  After I missed it I wished I would have lagged it.
Q.  Tomorrow, Davis Love, that will be a tough one?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, exactly.  I look forward to that, and    there's no easy match here.
