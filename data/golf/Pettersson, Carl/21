Q.   Carl, first of all, your comment on No. 7 today.   You played that hole pretty well.
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah.   It was a tough pin.   I wasn't really going at it.   I was aiming 10 feet right and pulled it under the pin with a pitching wedge from 144 and sort of went in on the second bounce.

Q.   The first one since -- when was your last one?
CARL PETTERSSON:   L.A. in '07, maybe, '06 or something like that.

Q.   Those never get old.
CARL PETTERSSON:   No.   It's nice when you don't have to putt.   It sort of got my round kick-started.   I played great and struggled coming in.   It was a good day.
