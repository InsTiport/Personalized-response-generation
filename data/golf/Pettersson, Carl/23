 Q.   Great start to the tournament here on Monday, if we can get some comments on your round.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, I played pretty solid all day.   It was tricky in parts and other parts, the wind laid down a little bit.   But you had to have your wits about you today.   It was difficult, but the greens are at a nice pace where it's doable.   
   
 Q.   A couple bogeys early, but really solid on the back nine?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, just one dumb bogey on 16.   I missed a 2‑footer, probably because of the wind but that's going to happen.   Played pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Any other wind‑related situations out there?   
CARL PETTERSSON:   No, everything's good.
