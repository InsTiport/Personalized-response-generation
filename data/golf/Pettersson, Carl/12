 Q.   It was tough going out there on a Sunday.   Lot of golf to get done today but you finished strong, at least with a chance to give you birdie, birdie finish.  
    CARL PETTERSSON:   I played pretty good tee to green all week.   I didn't chip very good and 16 I played 3-over for the week.   I play that hole well I, got a good chance to win.   Disappointed in making bogey there but nice comeback, birdie on 17 and 18 is playing tough.   Par there.  
   
 Q.   That shot on 16, surprised that it bounce as much on you or get a little bit too much of it?  
    CARL PETTERSSON:   A little tricky because there's always the fairways and I think the ball goes a hair further.   It was my fault.   I hit it too hard.   
    Sometimes it springs off there.   I hit it a little too hard.   I was trying to hit it back there and spin it back.   It was really the drive.   I wish I could have gone for it in two.   That's the way it goes.  
   
 Q.   Good solid finish for you.   Got to like your position at least going into the last quarter I guess of this season.  
    CARL PETTERSSON:   Hasn't been the best start.   This is nice finishing, nice finish here in Memphis.   I enjoyed the week.
