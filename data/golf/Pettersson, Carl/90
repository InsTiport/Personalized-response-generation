Q.  You've got to be really pleased with that 33 on the back nine in these conditions?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I got off to a rough start.  I was 1 over through 2, which is not very good.  And then I made birdies on 3 and 5, which was nice, and then a couple of stupid bogeys.  I made a really good par on 10 after a bad tee shot and played nice from there on in.
Q.  Five Swedes made the cut here; you've have to be pretty proud of that.
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, that's good.  How many did we have starting off, six or seven?
Q.  Something like that.
CARL PETTERSSON:  Which is good.  Everyone is playing good.  Hopefully we can all have a good Sunday.
Q.  Talk about Henrik's rise.  He recently won over in the Middle East.  He's really starting to come into his own.
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, he's always been a great player.  He lost his confidence a couple years ago, but he's played fantastic the last couple of years.  He's actually got my old caddie on the bag, which is nice, so they're doing good.
Q.  Talk about what Annika's influence has been being so dominant on the LPGA Tour?  Do you guys kind of look up to her and emulate that to a certain bit on the PGA TOUR?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I think you've got to look up to Annika.  She's fantastic.  She wins eight, nine, ten tournaments a year and she just makes us look bad, but we're going to try.
