  CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, it was good.  I played great today.  I thought it played hard today.  A lot of holes were into the wind and it played a lot longer.  The front nine played really tough, I thought, and 17 and 18 played a lot longer.  I played solid.  I was happy with my finish.   Q.  You're in the Open now, you're heading to St. Andrews.  How excited are you for that?  CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, that's a great bonus.  I've played St. Andrews before but I've never played there in an Open, so I'm looking forward to that, and I think I'm going to take my wife and two children over there, too, so they'll get to experience that.  Yeah, I'm thrilled.  It's a nice bonus.  It hasn't been the greatest of years for me so far, but I feel like I'm at a turning point.   Q.  Talk about your round.  The front nine, we were over at 7 and we didn't see any birdies, it just seemed like it was tough for guys to get it going but it seemed like the back nine you did.  CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, the front nine was tough.  I played it well.  I made -- I think I played it 2-under.  It played a lot longer.  Some of the holes were into the wind and obviously the softer conditions.  Overall I thought it played harder today.  I know there's some good scores, but I was thrilled with the way I played.  Even 17 and 18 are playing a lot tougher, a lot longer coming in.  It's a great golf course, a great event, and I've always enjoyed coming here.   Q.  At 13 you're sitting there thinking, you've got to be thinking nobody is going to come back.  At one point it looked like guys were, but it looks like Bubba is kind of cranking --  CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I thought if I could get it to 15 I'd have a chance.  I hit it pretty close on 16 and missed it, and I thought 15 I'd have a sniff, but yeah, I'm pleased with the way I finished anyways.
