Q. Excellent start to the tournament.  Just get some comments on your round.
CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I played solid all day, really.  I was 1-over early, but then I got a birdie on 3, and then around the turn I had four birdies in a row and got it going and played solid the rest of the way and then finished it off with a nice eagle on 16 to get it to 7-under.  It was just a stress-free day really, and I played nicely.
Q. Everybody today has talked about the greens being basically perfect.
CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I mean, they're great here.  Every year we've been here, they've been good.  It was perfect scoring conditions, I think, today.  No wind, and the greens were perfect, so if you're putting good, you can make some putts.
Q. Just take me through hole 16 if you can.
CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, it's probably the hardest tee shot of the day, and I was fortunate to hit a great drive and hit an 8-iron from the middle of the fairway.  It was a good-looking shot.  You never expect it to go in, but it was one or two guys behind the green that started screaming, so it was nice to hole one.
