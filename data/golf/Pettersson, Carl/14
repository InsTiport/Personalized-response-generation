 Q.   Just tell us a little bit about your round.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah.   I played nice.   I got off to a really‑‑ I bogeyed 1, but then I made a bunch of birdies there on the front nine, and I just putted well today.   Probably hit it better yesterday tee to green, but today I putted better, and it was nice, it was nice to get out, make some putts.   I don't know what the lead is now, but hopefully I've got a chance tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Tell me a little bit about the course this week.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   It's a good golf course.   I've only played here once before, and it played differently today with not much wind and we've had a lot of wind the first two days.  
It's a good golf course.   It's fun to play.   There's some birdie holes out there, but there's also some demanding holes.   It's great.   It's a good golf course.  
   
 Q.   This is your second time, like you say, in Puerto Rico.   First time was in 2010.   A little comparison, and how do you like Puerto Rico so far?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   It's beautiful here.   2010 it rained.   We had a bunch of rain the first couple of days.   It's been a nice week so far.   The weather's been great, and the Puerto Ricans have showed us a warm welcome here, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
