  Q. Talk about your day.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: We started off really good, 3-under through  nine, and then you know, made a stupid mistake on the back nine but overall it  was a pretty decent day.  
  
  Q.  Seems like the back nine is playing a little bit tougher, it seems like  everybody is kind of losing a couple of shots coming in.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Yeah, you probably have a couple of tougher  holes on the back nine than on the front, and that seems to be it.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: It's tough to make putts in the wind. Overall we did pretty good, we could have  kept it going better.   
 HENRIK STENSON: Decent position.
