Q.  Tell us about your round today.
CARL PETTERSSON:  It was pretty steady, I started off with a birdie on one and played solid.  I had one bogey, I short sided myself on number on No. 5 I think.  I had two bogeys, I had a 3 putt also on the back nine.  But that's going to happen.  I played nice.
Q.  Two steady rounds so far.  What do you think it's going to take with the course playing the way it is?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Well, the course is playing good.  There's not that much rough, there's a bit of wind around, but probably 15 under or somewhere around there.
Q.  Is it playing tougher this afternoon?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think so.  The wind is coming up and the greens are getting harder.
