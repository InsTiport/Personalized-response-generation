Q.   Impending darkness cuts it short, a rough morning delays the start, describe the conditions and how you managed to get where you are at least for now?
CARL PETTERSSON:   It was fine.   We got nine holes in.   I think if we have good weather tomorrow, we should be fine.   I think we'll have the cut made. 
And it was a shame we couldn't play longer.   It was perfect for us.   Hardly any wind, it was soft, but it's always frustrating when you have all these delays and stuff.   But we deal with it quite a bit on the PGA TOUR, and I think we'll be okay tomorrow. 

Q.   The strategy or execution, does it change because instead of playing 18 straight holes you're splitting your day up or is your plan pretty much in place?
CARL PETTERSSON:   The plan is pretty much in place, especially at a U.S. Open.   But it does make it a little different.   We had a short delay.   We had to come out without much warm‑up.   But we have done that before, too.   So nothing unusual.   Strategy doesn't change.   Same strategy. 

Q.   1‑under, in the early going, for you anyway, you're close to the top, does it alter your approach or do you just go at it tomorrow?
CARL PETTERSSON:   I felt like I played solid out there and just happy to be under par in a U.S. Open and grind away and see what happens.
