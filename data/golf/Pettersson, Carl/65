 Q. Nice playing, in fact a nice group. In fact, all of you guys caught the birdie binge. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: It was good. Kenny holed it on No. 1 for a 2; and I lipped out on 3 for another eagle; and Fred holed about a 5-iron on 3 for eagle, so we had it going early on.

 Q. Beautiful birdie on 17, as well for you?
 CARL PETTERSSON: It was nice. I pulled the tee shot in the left rough and was fortunate to have a good lie, and hit an 8-iron to about 15 feet and made a nice putt.

 Q. How is the course playing? 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I thought it was good. The wind picked up a little bit this afternoon, but early on, it was there for the taking. 

 Q. You should be in line for a good weekend. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Should be good, yeah. 
 It was nice, a little frustrated yesterday but feeling better today.
