  Q.  Was that about as good of a 72 as you think you've ever shot considering the course and the way it was playing?   
   CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, exactly. I played steady and made a few par putts and played nice.   
  
  Q.  Do you think this course right now is playing, you know, like the USGA wants it to be, the toughest test in golf; but they want to keep it fair, is it teetering on the edge or a good test of golf?   
   CARL PETTERSSON: It's right on the edge. It's fair but it's definitely two or three shots harder than yesterday.   



 And my group we noticed it straightaway after the first two holes that the greens were roll faster and it was getting bouncy.   
  
  Q.  Faster as the day has progressed?   
   CARL PETTERSSON: Definitely, started getting crusty the last two holes last night and carried through this morning.   
  
  Q.  Looking at your position right now, there are a lot of guys out there who are putting up some really fat scores, the cut line is going to be high, you're in good position for the weekend; do you feel good about that?   
   CARL PETTERSSON: Exactly. I wasn't looking at the scoreboard. It's so hard out there, you have to concentrate on what you're doing and try to make pars and sometimes try to make bogeys.   
  
  Q.  What about your birdies and bogeys today, can you walk us through those, please?   
   CARL PETTERSSON: I think I only had two birdies. I birdied 16, which is par 5 and played the ball on to the green at 15-feet and made the putt.   



 And I birdied No. 7, hit a driver and then a 5-iron and made it to about 8 feet and made it.
