   CARL PETTERSSON:  I missed my shot on 18.  I was in the back spot and left myself a long putt for birdie and 3-putted which is -- you leave yourself a long putt this week, it's tough to get it close.  The greens very, very slow.  We're used to fast greens.  I shot the best I ever shot today and I'm happy with the way I played. 

 Q.  You got to feel really good about your position.  You put yourself in a position to win another golf tournament and that's got to feel pretty good. 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  Still a long way to go.  I'm playing well.  If I can keep going. 

 Q.  What are you happiest with your game going into tomorrow? 
 CARL PETTERSSON:  I'm putting good, making a lot of nice putts and I hit my irons pretty good and I have to drive it better tomorrow.  Work on that this afternoon. 
 Q. Have a good practice session this afternoon and play well tomorrow.
