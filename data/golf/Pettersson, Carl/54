  Q. Tough afternoon conditions. Tell me about the golf course this afternoon.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, it was difficult. The front nine, which was my last nine, it was tough to get it close. The pins are tucked, the greens were firm, and the wind was up and down. It was tough to get the direction right. But I managed to play smart golf and made three birdies and the rest pars.  
  
  Q. Tell me how difficult it is. This course is hard, now you get wind blowing 20 miles an hour. It's got to make club selection just a nightmare.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I'm fortunate I have one of the best caddies out here. (Laughing.) I think he's ranked No. 3 right now. But anyway, that helps.   
 No, it was tricky. The pins were tucked, tough to get close to the hole. I played well, a little tentative with my putting, but overall happy with the way I'm hitting it.  
  
  Q. How hard is it to stay patient?   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Well, it's sort of like a major championship style golf course where sometimes 20 feet is better than 10. It's frustrating sometimes when you've got to give yourself those uphill putts so you can give them a go. It's a tricky golf course. I think if you keep shooting under par it's going to be a good chance.
