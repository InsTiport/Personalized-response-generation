 Q.   Obviously it wasn't off to a good start, but you really got it going nicely, what turned it around out there?  
CARL PETTERSSON:   I started really the first three holes to hit it really solid. Then I had a bit of a stretch in the middle there where I hit a few bad shots.   I hit it in the water on 18 and then a bad drop on 1.   And made a good bogey on 1.   And so that kind of got me going.     
I played beautiful on my way in, so it started off good, a little average in the middle and good coming in.   
   
 Q.   The next couple of days, the forecast, it might blow really hard tomorrow afternoon, and come rain on Saturday.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   On this course you can't really do much different.   You've got to put it in play and go out there.   This course can become tricky.   Some of these par‑3s when the wind is blowing, trying to figure out where the wind is ‑‑ I've got one of the best sackman on the bag, so we don't have too many bad holes.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, we were in the fairway and we had to draw a sand iron in there.   I got a fortunate bounce.   But it was a good shot.   
   
 Q.   It was a good shot.   It was a good birdie, and it's a great start to the tournament.   
CARL PETTERSSON:   Thank you.
