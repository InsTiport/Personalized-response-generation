 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I was a little disappointed with my  approach. If I could have just got it  half that distance to the pin, it probably would have made it a little bit  easier for Henrik. 
 You know, he had a difficult putt  and I had a difficult putt. Actually, I  hit a decent putt. It just lipped out.

 Q.  You had to almost just dribble it down, didn't you. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah.  In hindsight, I should have made it run left of the pin. So it was easy looking back I think. 
 We gave it our best today. It wasn't quite enough. There's nothing you can do.

 Q.  In general terms, the two of you have done the country proud this week. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, we enjoyed it. It's always disappointing when you finish  like that when you're in the hunt. We  had a chance and we had a good time.

 Q.  Did it look like it would be 17 or 18? 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, it did.  We were looking at the boards coming in, and we probably knew playing  the last two, they were playing difficult, if we get a birdie over the last  two, we would have a chance to win, but couldn't do it.
