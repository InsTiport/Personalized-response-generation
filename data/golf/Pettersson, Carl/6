  CARL PETTERSSON: I really like the golf course.  It kind of fits my eye and it's fun to play.  I think the front nine is old school, parkland golf course, and the back nine turns into a bit more of risk-reward modern TPC.  So it's a fun course to play.Q. You had a lot of birdies on the course today.  There are a lot of birdies to be had out there.  Is that part of your strategy?CARL PETTERSSON: I started off kind of slow.  I was 1-over through 6 and then made a nice birdie on 7 to kind of kick start the round.  But I noticed the conditions were perfect this morning, not much wind and the course was good, so I managed to get a few more birdies coming in, which is nice.Q. As the week progresses will you remain aggressive out there?CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I think so.  I think scoring will be low.  I think the weather's going to be pretty good.  It's just fun to play good.  I haven't played good in a while, so it was nice to get off to a good start.
