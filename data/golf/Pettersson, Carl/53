 Q. 12 greens with 24 putts; that'll get the job done. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I played pretty good on the front but I missed quite a few greens. I hit good shots into the greens, but I putted well. I think I only had ten putts on the front nine. But that's what you've got to do around here. You've got to hit good shots to the green.
 But then on the back I played more solid. I hit a lot more fairways, a lot more greens, and it was an enjoyable day.

 Q. I thought you were going to sneak one in on 17, too. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I was a little tentative on that one. I read it right edge and I needed more pace. But I made some putts today, so can't complain.

 Q. You seem to play well on big courses, Muirfield Village, Copperhead; Wyndham is played on a Donald Ross course, as well. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I don't know -- I think I like golf courses that put a premium on par as your score, and I enjoy the test.

 Q. Talk about going into the final round. 
 CARL PETTERSSON: Well, you've just got to play the golf course. The course is tough. You've just got to concentrate on hitting the fairway and hitting a few greens, and when you get a chance to make some putts, go ahead and do it.
