  Q. 16 greens today. Very nicely done.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I played good. I played good yesterday, too. I played good all week.   
 Hitting the ball really good, and finally I've had company here, but coming together here, and hopefully I can finish it off tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Kind of started coming in Phoenix. You had three pretty good days to finish up Phoenix too, didn't you?  
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah. Exactly. I played pretty good there. Even on Sunday on the front nine I shot 4-under, and then I played poorly on the back, 2-over. So I played well for a month.   
 I was a little disappointed that we didn't play the Viking Classic, because I knew I was playing well. But that's fine. I'm playing great this week, and just need a few more putts to drop.  
  
  Q. What's working for you now that you've been fighting all year?  
 CARL PETTERSSON: Fire and play. Firing is terrible this year, and swing was out of sync, and finally got it together the last couple months, and I'm just trying to build on that now for next year. And I still want to do well this week, but I'm really trying to get my swing back for next year.   
  
  Q. You're eating again. That's the good thing. You'd shrunk away to nothing there.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah. Exactly. I tried to get better, I tried to get fitter, and actually I got worse, so I'm back to my fighting weight now, 215, and seem to play well at that weight.   
  
  Q. I like you at that weight. Yeah. It's going a whole lot better at that weight. Good luck to you tomorrow and getting ready for next year.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Okay. Thank you.
