Q.   Talk about the circumstance where D.A. withdrew on the tee before teeing off and the first alternate physically couldn't get there in time, and the TOUR granted him his own onesome, first off 1 in the late wave.   Can you talk about your perspective of what was going on on the tee? 
CARL PETTERSSON:   Well, D.A.‑‑ I was warming up, and D.A. hurt his back like 12 minutes before our tee time, and he ran in and saw a physio, I guess.   We went to the tee, and we weren't sure if he was coming or not, but he came up to the tee, and I hit, I was first off, I hit my tee shot, and then D.A. was up, and he just said he couldn't go.   So he pulled out. 
I mean, I don't really know what happened after that.   Robert Garrigus hit, and we played.   We thought the first alternate was going to join us, but I was playing, so I don't know what happened after that. 

Q.   Mark Russell made the decision to grant him his own onesome because he couldn't get there in time.   He said it was the first time in his 31 year career he's ever experienced something like that. 
CARL PETTERSSON:   Yeah, I think that was the right decision.   That's what I think.   D.A. pulled out right before he was announced.   The alternate was here.   I know he was on the grounds.   I'm fine with that.   I don't want to get too much involved in all this. 
But yeah, I think that's fine.

Q.   Was that going through your mind when D.A. said‑‑ when he said I can't go, what were you thinking?
CARL PETTERSSON:   Well, it's a selfish game.   I've just hit it in the rough, so I'm a little frustrated where I went (smiling).   Yeah, it was an unusual situation.   I hope D.A. is okay, and I'm glad to see the first alternate is going to get a chance.
