  Q. Carl, tough day out there today, but you end up with a 1-under 71. Talk about your round today and how you feel about tomorrow.   
 CARL PETTERSSON: Yeah, I started off good. I was 2-under early, 2-under through seven, playing good, and then I made a bogey on 8 and a bogey on 9, which was all right. But got a little sloppy there in the middle but finished the round off good. It was good early on, good in the end, a little sloppy in the middle. But got a chance tomorrow and looking forward for that.   
  
  Q. You're at 8-under, Jim is at 11; is he too far away from you?   
 CARL PETTERSSON: No, not at all. Not on this golf course. It's a very tough golf course. If I can shoot a good number tomorrow, see what happens.   
  
  Q. Do you look at tomorrow, being out early in the morning, as opposed to the afternoon; does that change your mind-set about the final round at all?   
 CARL PETTERSSON: No, not really. Pretty much the same for everybody, teeing up 7:45 to 9:45. So pretty much everybody gets the same weather conditions. So looking forward to it.
