Q.
Your thoughts on the game?  You gave it everything, didn't you?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I didn't putt very well.  I made a nice putt on 17, but that was about it, really.
Q.  That was the key, was it, didn't enable you to get back into the match enough?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, I was 3 down and then I got one back on 9 and 10.

The turning point was 11.  I had about a 10 footer for birdie to square up the match, and I missed that.  I gave myself good chances coming in but just didn't make one.

I would have loved to have had a putt on 18, but Davis made it for me.
Q.  A good week, though.  Obviously some more World Ranking points.  Are you looking ahead to Ryder Cup?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Sort of.  Last year when I won, I wasn't a member of the European Tour so those points didn't count, which was unfortunate.  Yeah, I'm going to kind of reassess in about a month and see where I stand and see what I do.
Q.  I mean, obviously your points at the moment are all in the World Rankings.  You might come back and play Europe if the chance was there?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, exactly.  I'll reassess after The Masters, I think, and see how I stand.  I might come back to Europe and play a few.
