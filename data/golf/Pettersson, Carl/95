Q.  Trying to ensure your TOUR card for next year?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Somewhat.  I'm trying to win, too, but that would be a nice bonus.  I'm not really thinking about that when I'm playing.  I'm just trying to do my best.
Q.  What would it mean for you to win in sort of your hometown?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Oh, it would be great, you know, just to win anywhere (laughter).
Q.  How is your season going so far?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Got off to a slow start.  Played better the last three, four months.
Q.  What was good about your game today?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Everything was pretty good today.  I just made two bogeys.  One of those was just a poor shot coming into the fairway.

The other one was just a bad drive.  Looked like it was going to be a bogey all the way from where it was.
Q.  Could you have gotten out of that one spot?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I could have chipped it out, probably hit a 3 iron on the green or something.  I had 9 iron for my first shot.
