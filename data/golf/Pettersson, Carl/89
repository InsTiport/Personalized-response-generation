JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Thank you, Carl, for joining us for a few minutes in the media center at the Memorial Tournament.  First of all, it was a long day.  But I'm sure you're happy to be finished.  You had a great day out there.
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, it was nice.  It's nice to be finished.  I played really well.  So it's always nice when you play well.  So I enjoyed it.
Q.  Were you dreading possibly not being finished again tonight?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I didn't really think about it.  I knew if the weather cleared up we'd finish.  I knew the restart was going to be 4 and then it went to 4:30, but it's nice to finish today and not have to come back in the morning.
Q.  What were you doing well out there today?
CARL PETTERSSON:  The shots I didn't hit quite well still went straight.  My miss hits went well.  I putted well.  You needed to putt well to score well.  My mishits were in the fairway, and even some iron shots I mishit were in the fairway.
Q.  You've been close a couple of time, top 10s, do you feel a break out is on the horizon, is it coming up here for you?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I won last year, and so that was kind of a break out for me.  I've played nice since, so I hope I can do it again.
Q.  Is this course very similar in setup to Chrysler where you won?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No.  The Chrysler course, probably tighter off the tee, and the one in Tampa is very penal.  This one is, too, but it's wide, every hole is really open.  I guess it's the "second shot" golf course.  You get it in the fairway, and it's difficult from the second shot in.  Chrysler is just difficult all the way around.
Q.  What time did that alarm clocking off this morning?
CARL PETTERSSON:  5:45.
Q.  What did you do all day?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Played golf.  No, I enjoyed the break.  I took it easy.  I had some nice food to eat and just
Q.  Is that the most you've spent at a golf course playing so few holes?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I can't remember.  It might be up there.  I'm sure in Europe we spent days waiting for it to clear.  Atlanta, we spent two days without even playing.
Q.  What time did you actually get to the golf course, here, and you talked about what you do, but do you have a normal routine when the day gets long like this that you like to follow?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Probably got here about 7:15, 7:30.  And I went to the physio trailer.  I've had a hip problem all year, but they worked it out and it feels pretty good this week.
Q.  What did you think when the World Ranking came out Monday?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Well, I wasn't too pleased.  I was 51 and I stayed at 51.  I was the top 50 to get in the U.S. Open.  It was disappointing, but I've done all I could.
Q.  Have you talked to your managers at all about where you might go, it fluctuates a little bit when you don't play?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No, I didn't look at it too much.  I thought I might have a chance to move up, but I didn't play in Memphis.  But I ended up missing that by one.  But I'm going to try to qualify on Monday.
Q.  Do you know another way in?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Maybe winning here, that might help.
Q.  That does it, yeah?
CARL PETTERSSON:  So that would be nice.
Q.  Did you know that, do you pay attention to that stuff?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No, I try not to.
Q.  You rely on us for all your information?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Exactly.
Q.  Are you generally a guy who thrives on soft conditions like this golf course is now, or would you rather have it firm and fast, what exactly fits your game better?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think I like the soft conditions.  You don't have to think as much.  You can kind of fly it to the pin and it's easy to keep it in the fairway.
Q.  The putter you are using
CARL PETTERSSON:  I've been using that putter for 8 years.  Not that putter, but the long putter.
Q.  Obviously you like it, but what do you like so much about it?
CARL PETTERSSON:  It's just easier.
Q.  It was quite a hubbub yesterday about the bunkers, with everybody reacting to them.  It seemed today that everybody was just resigned to their faith and went about their business more than yesterday?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think so.  It was such a new thing the beginning of the week.  And the green side bunkers are fine, but the fairway traps, I haven't been in one yet, but if you get in a fairway trap, there's not much of a chance reaching the green.  If you're in a green side bunker, you have a chance to get it up and down, but it's more difficult.
Q.  How did you handle it yesterday when you saw what you had to deal with?  Did you have to work on yourself not to let it get in your head or not?
CARL PETTERSSON:  No, you just kind of deal with it.  Every bunker is different.  Next week the bunkers are different, last week the bunkers are different, you kind of just adjust.
Q.  How far were you along when the rain delay came this morning?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I was on the 6th fairway.
Q.  How brutal was it for those first five holes?
CARL PETTERSSON:  It was tough, yeah.  All the holes played long.  Seemed like every hole was into the wind.  There was just enough rain to make it difficult.  It was windy, too, so those first five holes played really difficult.
Q.  What did you hit on 1, for example?

REPLACENAME:  I hit a rescue club, like a 2 iron.
Q.  What did you hit yesterday?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yesterday, I hit 3 wood, 6 iron.
Q.  Four clubs different?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah.
Q.  Product of the softness taking away length or the wind?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Wind and rain.
Q.  Did you stay in the clubhouse during the entire six hour break?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, it's not a bad spot to be.
Q.  Was it the food?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yeah, exactly.
Q.  Did you have more birdies today or more milk shakes?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I had more birdies than milk shakes.
Q.  What did you do other than eat?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Sat around and talked.
Q.  What was the general topic of conversation in there?  Had the bunkers kind of run its course?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I think so.  It was more talking about how much it was going to rain and just playing around.  Played Liar's Poker.
Q.  Yesterday, Flesch mentioned a couple of times he changed clubs just to avoid the fairway bunkers, have you been doing that?
CARL PETTERSSON:  A little bit.  On some holes you might hit a 3 wood instead of a driver, you might be more aware of the bunkers.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Let's go through your five birdies.

Birdie on 6.
CARL PETTERSSON:  We restarted, I had to obviously drive it in the fairway and 7 iron to about 10 feet and made it.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  Birdie on 12.
CARL PETTERSSON:  8 iron to the front edge and then made a 20 footer.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  14.
CARL PETTERSSON:  14, I hit 2 iron, sand wedge to 8 feet.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  15.
CARL PETTERSSON:  15, I hit driver, 2 iron into the right hand side trap and got it up.
Q.  How far?
CARL PETTERSSON:  About a foot.
JOAN vT ALEXANDER:  And 16.
CARL PETTERSSON:  16, I hit 7 iron to about 20 feet and made it.
Q.  Any problems with casual water or anything after the restart?
CARL PETTERSSON:  The course was fairly good.  It was wet in spots, but it was playable.
Q.  Any problems with the way that the bunker on 12 was marked, ground under repair, having groups already gone through with ground under repair?
CARL PETTERSSON:  The one on the right?
Q.  The one that was under water?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I looked at that, I thought it was strange.  I guess they cleared it up and water came back up.  That's not really fair.  If you go in, you've got to drop it and you've got a plugged lie.  That was a little unfortunate.  But
Q.  What was the last thing you said?
CARL PETTERSSON:  I was just glad I wasn't in there.  Because it was like a lake.
