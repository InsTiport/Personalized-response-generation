 STEWART McDOUGAL:  Carl Peterson today at 70, 137, joint leader of the Championship.  This is your first Open Championship, how does it feel to be joining us? 
CARL PETTERSSON: It feels great.  I know there's a long way to go yet.  I'm excited about the weekend and pleased with the way I'm playing right now.

Q.  Is this perhaps more than you expected coming into the Championship or did you think if you got a good start you could be competing the last two days?
CARL PETTERSSON: Yes, I've had a good year on the European Tour so far and been in contention nearly every week.  So my expectations are very high of myself and I knew if I played well, I can always be at the top.  I'm obviously very happy with the start and look forward to the weekend.

Q.  I think I read that you still live in North Carolina and you sort of commute to the European Tour?
CARL PETTERSSON: That's right.  I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Q.  Is that because you went to school there?
CARL PETTERSSON: No, my parents moved over to Greensboro, North Carolina when I was about 15 and I've lived there ever since.

Q.  How difficult is your commute from the European Tour?
CARL PETTERSSON: I'm lucky because I have a straight flight from North Carolina to London.

Q.  How often did you use a driver today?
CARL PETTERSSON: Three times today.

Q.  Do you plan to play this tour or make a move to the U.S. tour?
CARL PETTERSSON: I'm trying to qualify for the PGA TOUR next year, go to Q-School this year coming up.  I want to play the U.S., but yet again, I enjoy playing in Europe.  It's a good tour.  But it's more convenient if I play in the U.S..

Q.  What affect did moving to the States at that age have on your golf career?
CARL PETTERSSON: I think it improved my game tremendously by being able to practice in good weather nearly all year-round, playing the junior circuit called AJGA, which is very competitive, and obviously the college career is a great system in the States which I recommend to anybody who has the opportunity to do it.

Q.  Was your experience in NC State very important in the development of your game?
CARL PETTERSSON: Yes, I think so.  In college you learn to compete every day, having to qualify for tournaments and play as a team and play in great tournaments.  As soon as you turn pro, in recent years we've seen guys go straight from college to the tour and European Tour.

Q.  What year did you graduate?
CARL PETTERSSON: I finished up, I think, it was 2000.(Laughter).

Q.  Your dad, his business took him to North Carolina?
CARL PETTERSSON:  Yes, he used to work for Volvo trucks.

Q.  Do they still live there?
CARL PETTERSSON: No, they moved back about three or four years ago.

Q.  Why did you stay in North Carolina?
CARL PETTERSSON: When you're 15 years old, that's where you grow up, all my friends are in the state and my girlfriend lives over there, so that's where I call home and that's where I will live for the rest of my life.

Q.  How confident are you to keep this going for the next two rounds?
CARL PETTERSSON: I feel confident about my game.  I played solid golf the first two days and hopefully I can keep playing well during the weekend and see what happens.

Q.  Are you known for driving accurately?
CARL PETTERSSON: No, I think I'm more known  -- I have a pretty low ball flight so I can keep it under the wind, which might helps if the wind gets up.  I think I'm reasonably straight, but this week I haven't hit many drivers, I've hit a lot of 2-irons, which has been working.
STEWART McDOUGAL:  Thank you, Carl.
