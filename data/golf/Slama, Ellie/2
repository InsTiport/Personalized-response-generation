 Q.  4-under, same as Monday. Talk me through your round. How did it go?  
ELLIE SLAMA: Very similar to the way my Monday qualifier went on the front nine because I had four birdies and no bogeys, and I was putting really well, and striking the ball wasn't great but I was making up for it with my putting, and then I bogeyed the last hole for my first bogey of the day, but that was okay.   
 Q.  What did you do there on 18?  
ELLIE SLAMA: Yeah, I kind of blocked my drive right, and so I didn't have a shot at the green and then chipped out and chipped on and then missed the 10-footer.   
 Q.  What is it about the greens that you love?  
ELLIE SLAMA: The speed, and just being from Oregon, I know bentgrass really well. I know when there's no green, like -- I've played here for five, six days in a row now, so I think that I'm slowly getting used to them.   
 Q.  Did you have much support out there?  
ELLIE SLAMA: Yeah, I did. I had a lot of people come and cheer me on, which was really nice.   
 Q.  Did that kind of feel like it spurred you on during the round?  
ELLIE SLAMA: Yeah, it's super nice seeing familiar faces and having my parents there and grandparents, so it's been a good first day.   
 Q.  Thoughts ahead of tomorrow? You're in I think about 12th place, your first LPGA Tour event. How does that feel?  
ELLIE SLAMA: Good, it feels good. Tomorrow I'll just go out and try and do the same thing and just focus on one shot at a time.
