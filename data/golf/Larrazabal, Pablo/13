  STEVE TODD:   Congratulations, BMW International Open Champion for a second time.   A very tight leaderboard out there today.   Just tell us your story of the day and how you feel to be champion again.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, yesterday, going to the hotel, thinking about today, I knew that coming strong‑‑ I know that Sunday afternoon in this golf course is not that easy.   It's a little bit tougher golf course on Sunday afternoon. 
So if I could make a few birdies, starting the day with a few birdies coming fast, and shoot 3‑ , 4‑under on the front nine, I could have a chance.   Now I make 5‑under, I played awesome on the front nine, and you know, I knew that I was in perfect position.   Just put the ball in play and try to put it close enough to make some birdies coming in and that's what I did.   A great shot on 16 and a good birdie. 
I felt that I needed a birdie on 18 because you never know what the other people behind you is going to do.   But I hit a perfect putt and it didn't go in.   But I didn't need a playoff this time.
STEVE TODD:   Your fourth European Tour victory, and you're winning big events, as well.   Just how special are these titles? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Every title is very special, but this place, you know, from the first time I arrived to this golf course, it's something that suits my eye.   It suits my eye from the tee and on second shots and on the greens. 
I am lucky, winning four, and three very special ones, because obviously I won it twice this one.   But France on that time was one of the biggest tournaments on Tour and is still one of the biggest tournaments on Tour.   And last year I won Abu Dhabi against Rory McIlroy, and this time I won against Henrik Stenson. 
There was an article on the Golf Channel, I think they called me the "giant killer."   In France, Monty was runner‑up ‑‑ and here, four years ago with Sergio; runner‑up in Abu Dhabi with Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson, and this time, Henrik Stenson.   So cannot be a lot better. 
STEVE TODD:   You say can't be a lot better; you're getting married this summer, as well, couple of months time. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It can be better ‑‑ (laughter.)
STEVE TODD:   It's set up to be a special summer for you.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, you know, getting married to Gala is going to be very special, but we've been together ten years and a half.   So it's going to be special to go another step forward, but I feel that she's been my wife for many, many years. 

Q.   ‑I was going to ask you, how do your emotions compare sitting here now to when you won this event for the first time?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   A lot more relaxed.   I was very tired.   We played five holes playoff with a lot of tension, and Sergio was hitting awesome.   He was ripping his driver on 18. 
Today, you know, I had myself in control all the time.   I thought that putt on 18 was going in all the way, perfect pace, I thought it was in.   But, you know, when you play the way you want, and you perform the way you want and you win a tournament like that, it's awesome.   It feels awesome.   Probably after‑‑ of my fourth victories, this is the one I had more in control of my emotions, of my golf, of my putting stroke, of my everything. 

Q.   As Steve pointed out, you've now won four big tournaments this, one twice.   Are you ready now to sort of knock on the door and get yourself in contention for a major?   And also, I know you gave Darren Clarke a putting tip this week.   Can you make his team?   Would you like to make his team?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, those are a few step forward.   I like to go step by step.   I'm now a champion again.   I have to enjoy that, prepare for The Open Championship exactly like my team wants.   Probably The Open Championship is the one I have more chances to win, but probably not in St. Andrews. 
So, you know, prepare for The Open and try to perform in majors.   My mistake is being‑‑ for many, many years, to try to treat majors different.   You know, majors are golf tournaments, and the only thing you have to take care is that‑‑ to prepare them properly.   To be at the peak of your game in the majors, that's the only way, and try to treat majors the same way as other golf tournaments. 
You know, Ryder Cup, you were talking about Darren's team.   I would love to play Ryder Cup one year but we all know how strong is the European Team.   Who do you take out these days?   Martin Kaymer, U.S. Open Champion?   I mean, who do you take out?   In Europe there are 20 superstars.   Paul Casey didn't go last time.   There's so many great players in Europe that to play Ryder Cup for me would be luck. 
But you know, I have time to do a couple steps forward and be a better player.   I'm probably not a player that you want to have as your partner in foursomes because my driver is not that good.   But I can be a good fourball player. 

Q.   How big was the up‑and‑down on 17 to get the momentum going? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   As big as you can imagine.   That lie was not good.   And you know, it was one of those lines that it's a fat lie, I call it.   It's very easy to hit it fat, and I did a kind of bunker shot and it came perfectly.   It came a little too high what I thought but a little bit too hard.   It came beautiful.   Probably the shot of the day.   That shot was very important.   Because if you have to make par on the last, it's easy.   But if you have to make birdie, it's a lot tougher. 

Q.   What did you change to become better? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   When I won it the last time, I think I was 28 and now I'm 32.   That's a lot of difference, first of all.   And then, you know, now my brother is my coach, and so we work on things, we try to get better. 
We change‑‑ last week, we change the routine on the greens, the routine.   So looks like it's working great.   I think it's been six years since I don't do a practise stroke on the greens in a tournament.   I used to go behind and have a look, and go and hit the ball.   Now I just hit practise strokes. 
I'm getting older and I'm getting better and I'm getting more mature, and I'm getting married. 

Q.   As a personal question, if the golf ball wouldn't like you so much, would you still be‑‑
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   No‑‑ I don't know.   I always said that I would be a hard worker.   I love to work hard to try to achieve what I love.   And I love to play golf.   As I said so many times, I don't play golf for many.   I play golf because I love it.   And the day that I don't have fun out here, I quit.   You guys don't see me again.   It's all about fun.   This is very fun to win trophies.   It's a lot of fun. 

Q.   Do you know how muchyou won?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I don't play golf for money. 

Q.   But you know how much you have won? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I'm getting married in two months, so half of what you think.   (Laughter).   You have to pay the caddie.   You have to pay a lot of people on my team.   I have to pay taxes, that is 56 per cent in Spain, and then I'm getting married.   So what do I get, 5,000 Euros probably (laughter). 
I don't play golf for money.   If I play golf for money, I will be not standing next to this trophy, that's for sure. 

Q.   It's funny, because you mentioned it, you seem way more relaxed in the last couple of years now.   When was the point when you said to yourself, I've got to maybe be a little bit more relaxed or keep it down a little.   Do you have the age, or do you say to yourself, it's good to show emotions but maybe lay back as well? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Well, I'm getting old; so the mature ‑‑ is doing a good job over there.   He's a person on my team that is probably the most important person on my golf team, and he did a great job with that. 

Q.   Who is it? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   No, you probably‑‑ people who were at the Spanish Open can find him.   But he doesn't want me to say his name, so you're not going to know his name.   But it's very easy.   It's very easy to find it, and if you want to find it, you will find it.   He's a great guy and he has a lot of Gold Medals in Olympics and a lot of‑‑ he's one of the best minds I have ever seen in my life, and so he helped me with that. 
STEVE TODD:   Pablo, you're a fantastic champion, we congratulate you again.
