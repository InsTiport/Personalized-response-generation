  PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   My game wasn't good today.   I didn't hit the driver good.   I put myself in a little bit of trouble.   But I knew how to handle it and how to keep it going.   I made some birdies coming in, and to, you know‑‑ I can play better golf.   But I cannot‑‑ playing like I played, I cannot score better.  
   
 Q.   You handled it well, and it's still flawless when you look at the card, no mistakes; scoring‑wise, everything is nice and you're a stretch clear.   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I'm going shot by shot, you know, hole‑by‑hole and trying to make as many birdies as I can, and as little mistakes as I can.   Today, you know, I hit a couple weird drives but you know, in the right holes, that I could keep going.   
   
 Q.   How different was the course in the wet weather?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, it was spinning back three, four metres with a 7‑, 8‑iron.   These days where it was releasing   but yeah, three, four, five metres with the same irons, and now they are spinning back.  
So yeah, it was tough at the beginning to know how to plan those shots, but yeah, I saw it out.   
   
 Q.   Thoughts into Sunday?   You've got to get up early to do it.   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   There's many, many hours to spend before teeing off tomorrow, so we will see what happens tomorrow, any plans.
