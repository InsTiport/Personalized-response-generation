Q.   Thoughts on the week? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Auto you're right there with chances on Sunday afternoon with the back nine, you shoot 2‑over par on the back nine, you feel like you left something out there.   If you think that with maybe one shot better, I will be playing the U.S. Open, it is even more painful.
