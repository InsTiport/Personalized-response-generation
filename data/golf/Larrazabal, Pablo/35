Q.   In messy conditions like that, how good is 3‑under par? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   The front nine wasn't that bad, it was raining a little bit but the ball wasn't flying that much.   But it was okay.   But when we arrived to our first hole, the 10th, our first hole, the rain started to pick up and it was just surviving. 
You know, I said to my caddie, just try to putt the ball in play, try to save pars, make pars all the way around, and we will have our chances for birdie.   I made a bogey and then I finished with two birdies. 

Q.   You are one of the players that has said the harder it is, the better for you; you knuckle down and do what you have to do. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Some weeks, it's tough to tee it up on the first knowing that you have to make 5‑ or 6‑under par to be up there.   I prefer to go out there and to fight the course, try to make pars, tough golf courses, tough conditions. 
I love fighting golf, not going 1‑under par on the front nine and knowing that you're far behind.   This is a proper test of golf today and anything red is good.
