 Q.   Coming down the last hole yesterday it looked like you might look two matches and be going home and now you're in the quarterfinals.   Sum up your emotions for us?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yesterday was very special.   To win that match today was the turning point in my match‑play career I think.   I've been working on match play a lot to be a better match‑play player.   I know that my type of game can be a good match‑play game.   
But, you know, to win my first match yesterday of my professional career was very important, and you know, today I start very good.   I start with a few birdies and then Shane pushed me hard and I didn't hit the ball great in the middle.   
You know, gave me a little blessing on 14 with those 3‑putt and hit into the water on 15 and missed the putt on 16.   He gave the match a little bit to me, but I played good.  
   
 Q.   I understand you've been watching the Seve movie last night.   Has it inspired you?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I love Seve's story and I love how he played.   I had the movie yesterday and after dinner, I watched it.   I know his life and I know his story, and I love it.
