 Q. An obvious highlight to your round, tell us about the hole-in-one from your point of view?
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: It was a great shot. I thought it was the perfect club, if I hit it perfect, and I hit it perfect and I made it. So, great. 

 Q. Miguel, you had an eagle of your own, an obvious highlight to your day, as well. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: Well, at the end of the day, 1-under par, except I cannot hole anything. I made 32 putts. Hitting so-so. Not brilliant, but the putter I feel like it's not the best probably. 

 Q. We saw you on one of the tees getting our cameras in your hands; fancy your chances, do you? 
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: Yeah, we have fun on the golf course. Yeah, we feel like we take the cameras and we do it. 

 Q. How about this young fellow who has made a big splash on Tour. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: He is a good player. It's a good experience, nice, fresh, it's good. You need to renovate; the other guys now, not me! But we need people like Pablo, all of these new players coming to the Tour. I think it's very nice for the Tour, and Pablo, he has beautiful hands for this game. 

 Q. What can you learn from playing with Miguel? 
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: We played a lot of practice rounds together. It's always a pleasure. He is for sure the best partner you can have out there to play with. 
 So we enjoy a lot today and we enjoy the practice rounds and I hope we are playing together on Sunday. 
 MIGUEL ÃNGEL JIMÃNEZ: And we are going to have a dinner tonight and going to have a nice bottle of Rioja tonight. We keep enjoying ourselves, don't worry. 

 Q. What club did you play at No. 7?
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: I hit a 7-iron. I saw Miguel hitting a soft 5, and maybe the good stick was the 6-iron to play a little bit safer. But I thought to hit a solid one, a 7-iron, I had 177 meters, so it was a great 7-iron with a little draw. 

 Q. How many holes-in-one?
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: That's my third one. Two on the Challenge Tour and this is my first. 

 Q. First on the main tour?
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: All the hole-in-ones are in tournaments, so that's great. 

 Q. Better than a 9 on the par 3; a 1, in two weeks, both extremes. 
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: Yeah, I mean, wasn't that bad of a shot on No. 17, third round last week. It wasn't that bad to make nine. This was a perfect one. So trying to hit more of these ones.

 Q. Did you know something was wrong with Christian before he pulled out? 
 PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: No, no. He was playing not good. He was making bogeys, and he said to us he was tired. So for Miguel and us, we enjoy together playing. We enjoy a lot playing together, so it's not that big of a deal.
