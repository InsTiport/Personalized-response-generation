Q.   18th hole wasn't looking terribly good, try to sum up the buzz of adrenaline you get when you do that? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It looked terrible all the way.   Driver to the bunker, almost nearby the‑‑ I stride to hit a 9‑iron, I pull it a little bit into the thickest rough on the golf course and I had 50 metres to the hole and I hit a 6‑iron as hard as I could, try to make five and try to have a half point today and go out there and try to do my job tomorrow. 
But yeah, the ball was sitting great.   I thought I had, you know, the chance to putt it close and to make five and to put the pressure on Stevie.   Stevie had a good lie, but I holed it and it went in, happy days. 

Q.   We were thinking of Seve when it went in, because obviously his great record in this championship, he won it five times.   Was he an inspiration to you?   Did you see much of his wins? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know what, was a professional golf player, this is the first match I win in my singles.   I lost in Seve Trophy, I lost in EurAsia Cup, in Royal Trophy, in Accenture Match Play, yesterday.   So this is the first match I win, and I'm very proud of myself. 
Obviously Seve was an inspiration for all of us.   We know his record in match play, maybe the best in history in match play.   But I'm trying to do it my way and I try my best in every shot, and the best shot of the day was the last. 

Q.   Confirm a rumour that I've heard.   You played with one of our colleagues, Ian Ward, from the cricket department in the Pro‑Am.   I heard you hit his left‑handed driver 280 yards down the middle.   True or false? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   True, true.   On 13, on the last hole in the Pro‑Am, I hit on 12 a 6‑iron.   I hit it to the bunker on the par3 and I went for a driver on 13 and I ripped that thing.
