Q.   Tell us about that, a nice, satisfying round.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It was, yeah.   I mean, yeah, I start very well with birdie on the second, and then I 3‑putt on the third.   But I managed myself to make birdie 4, 5 and then eagle 6.   That was a fast start. 
And then you know, I miss a very short putt on like three feet for birdie on No. 8, the little par 3 there, and then I bogeyed 9 and 11.   So a little bit disappointed there from the fairway, as well, but yeah, coming in I've played great.   I've made a couple putts and feel good. 

Q.   Were you thinking at the start of play, nice, low number, could you get amongst it? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know these conditions, we start with a lot of fog in the air.   We couldn't see too much the first holes, and it was tough to play.   It was a little bit chilly out there.   But, you know, I birdied‑‑ I putted first, the first two rounds I bogey the first, so I thought, okay, now we are 1‑up from the other days. 
You know, the fast start, it helped, but seven birdies are very good, but those two bogeys, you know, are very, very tough mistakes. 

Q.   You tend to like the tough courses.   How tough was it today in comparison to the two previous days? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yesterday was brutal.   The back nine was very, very tough.   And today they move some sees up on the back nine and that helps.   I mean, 13 and 14 yesterday, they were absolutely brutal, and today they were playable. 
So yeah, I mean, it's obviously easier than yesterday, and we will see what's going on tomorrow.   Looks like it's going to rain. 

Q.   But still a case of making your score on the way out and holding it together on the way back? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, you know, today I knew that if I could make some birdies and put a low round in‑‑ it all depends on the weather now, if it comes down, the wind, and it's playable, the leader is going to be 8‑, 9‑, 10‑under par, so I will be a little bit too far away.
But if the breeze is still up there, and, you know, we all know how you feel going in the last group on Saturday.   So you feel a little bit more pressure than normal.   So if the leader is 7‑, 8‑, it will be reachable.
