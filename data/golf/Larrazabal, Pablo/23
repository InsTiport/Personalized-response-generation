  PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it was raining and I hit my 5‑wood a little bit to the right and stayed a little bit in the legs of the guy, so a little bit embarrassing for the guy.   But yeah, couldn't get up‑and‑down, and that was the main thing.   Little stories around.

Q.   Give us a demonstration? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   No, it was‑‑ not going to do it.   But yeah, between the legs, just a little bit, on top of the knees, between the knees and the hips. 

Q.   I appreciate you couldn't get up‑and‑down, but part and parcel of a decent score for a first day here. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, decent score.   3‑under, three to play in this golf course you have to take at least one shot out of the scorecard.   The pin position on 16, being in the middle of the fairway, you have to take a birdie, 16, 17 and 18, you have to take at least one. 
So a little bit disappointed for that, but I played all right.   I kept the ball on the track, on the fairways, and my irons are getting better.   So, you know, happy to shoot the first round under par.
