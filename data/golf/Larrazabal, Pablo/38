 Q.   Thoughts on day one?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I played great.   I started playing great golf the front nine.   I was 4‑under very early on the 10th.   
Yeah, I played great, at the end, hit it bad on No. 6 and that hurt me a little bit and I missed a very short putt on 7 for birdie.   
But the course is playing tough and I'm very happy to start like this, the year.   I've been working only myself and the people at home know how hard I've worked this winter to be in shape and to change my golf swing a little bit.   It's paying off a little bit too early.   
   
 Q.   You obviously thought that it was necessary to change your swing?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, to be one of the top of the world, you have to have a solid swing and a little bit more repetitive.   That's what I tried to do.   You know, tried to change a couple things to be more consistent and looked like it worked today, but you know, golf is very strange, so can happen the other way.   
But, you know, very happy with the golf swing and very happy with the work I did this winter.  
   
 Q.   Is it a work‑in‑progress or does it feel like it's already bedded in?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It's going to be a lot better soon but I have to keep working.   Obviously a little change, you can see little changes now, but you know it's going to be a long‑term change but it's going to be a change.   
   
 Q.   Does it alter your expectation going into a tournament knowing that you're working on things like that?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, I wasn't playing that great the last year, but I know that the work I'm doing is not for this week, it's not for next week; it's for the future.   It's going to pay off in the middle of the season.   
But, you know, when you're working as hard as I did this winter, when this round happened, you feel very happy.
