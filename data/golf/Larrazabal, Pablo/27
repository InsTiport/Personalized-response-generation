  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   How are you feeling about the team shaping up, first night together?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   First, it's very nice to be part of the first EurAsia Cup very pleased to be captain of my team and be part of [], as I say, the first event and hoping that this coming event, we are all looking forward to playing in this event.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Pablo, cap tin's pick for Miguel, must be pretty special to be here with the guys.  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it's very special to be here.   I know that or Miguel, it was very tough to pick another Spaniard, and he told me that I had to keep playing well to be on the team, and I didn't, but thanks, but I'm here.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   And you certainly played well; your thoughts on being here this week?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   Yeah, I'm also very happy be to part of the team.   It's something very new for me.   Yeah, I will do my best this week.   I hope I can win my matches and to have Miguel as a captain, I think it will help me and I hope he can give me some good advice.   
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Fashionably late as always, thanks for coming.   Your thoughts on being in the team environment as one of the most experienced guys here?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, team golf is always something that I've loved.   My three Ryder Cups have been my best golfing experiences of my career so far, and you know, golf's such an individual sport, I think any time you get to sit in the team room and bond with some great players, partner up in better‑balls and foursomes golf and play for each other, I think it's something I love.   When I had the opportunity to come here and play in this event, I certainly jumped at the chance.   I felt an opportunity to really whet the appetite for The Ryder Cup later in the season, which we are all trying to get on that team.   I thought this week would be a really great experience.   First time back in Malaysia in a few years.   We have a great team this week and I think we can do a good job for our captain here.   
   
 Q.   You've got pretty good firepower with you.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes.   
   
 Q.   You have a very good team?  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, I have a very good team, we have very experienced guys playing in The Ryder Cup, Thomas BjÃ¶rn, Graeme McDowell and others, they all play very well and we feel very confident in the team.   
   
 Q.   Is the course for long hitters?   
VICTOR DUBUISSON:   You said the course is not meant for a long hitter?   No, I played this morning, it's a great course.   You still have to hit the ball long.   It's a good advantage on the par 5s if you hit the ball long, but no, the more important is to hit it on the fairway, so it's the same.   
   
 Q.   A couple of players on the Asian team, team Asia, they play regularly on The European Tour and a lot of others are hoping to get on to The European Tour in the coming years; any thoughts on them, how you have seen them over the past few years?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, I thought that the Asian game, as I said before in previous interviews‑‑ the golf now is very healthy in all the world, in all the continents.   The golf is growing and the players, there are very good players all over the place.   As you see, they are coming here in Europe and they are coming to America to play, and in Japan, all over the place.   It's not much different like 20 years ago.   Now I think the level is very similar all over the place and you have great players around here, too.   
Regarding this week, they are going to be interesting matches, yeah.   
   
 Q.   What are your hopes for the future in terms of this tournament?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The hopes for the tournament?   For the future?   Well, I remember‑‑ well, I don't remember because I haven't been born yet, but The Ryder Cup started in 1927 and probably now is the event in golf and everyone wants to play I think is the main thing.   And now we start the EurAsia Cup in 2014 and the EurAsia Cup, it needs to be with all the players and everything, some time is something very nice.   I think with the effort of these two big tours and the effort of the players, the EurAsia Cup will become a big event and also important with the majors.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)‑‑  
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, I just beat Thongchai in the race competition.   Europe, one.   
   
 Q.   Is there any pressure on Europe as the favourites?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I mean, I don't know, I have pressure enough to be nearby my teammates in the team room.   You know, I don't know if we are or not the favourites.   We are tied 0‑0, so we will see on Saturday afternoon who are the champions.   But you know, this weather is tough for us.   We are not 100 percent used to it.   We don't play with this grass every week like they do.   So you know, if someone is up already, obviously Miguel won, but they are 1‑up because they know the grass of the golf course.   
   
 Q.   You guys are so used to playing for yourself, how difficult is it to make an adjustment to play a team sport suddenly for a few weeks and maybe Ryder Cup, to suddenly come together where you are not just worrying about your own game but the strengths of your partner; how difficult is the adjustment?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Yeah, like you say, golf is a very individual sport, one of the toughest parts of, say, The Ryder Cup is, is putting pairings together, and getting foursomes pairings more importantly.  
That's why a tournament like this, the EurAsia Cup, to me is something that's very, very important for both The European Tour and the Asian Tour.   Like Miguel alluded to there, this is the main area of growth for the game of golf in the world.   So it's a natural place for The European Tour.   It's obviously a big part of The European Tour to have a Europe versus Asia match is something that our schedule needs from a Ryder Cup point of view.   We need this event to become something very special, something the guys look forward to and something that is part of The Ryder Cup Team building; a chance to put ten guys together, come out here and play against a good team and try some pairings and really enjoy playing team golf.  
It's different.   Like Pablo said, you have extra pressure because you're playing for each other.   You don't want to let your teammates down.  
   
 Q.   What kind of adjustments do you make to your game?   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   Well, alternate‑shot is probably the most difficult format in golf.   You know, there's nothing worse than playing foursomes golf and blowing your partner six‑foot past the hole and say, over to you, buddy.   It's the hardest format in golf.   I won my first‑ever half‑point in Ryder Cup back in 2008 playing with this man in foursomes at Valhalla.   It was a great game, and it was an amazing experience and like I say, I think foursomes is one of the key, key games of The Ryder Cup, and finding guys that can complement each other and play together is a big key, and that's why EurAsia Cup I think is important for The European Team to come together and work on that type of stuff.   
   
 Q.   Have you played this course?   What do you find about the course?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   The golf course is not very long‑‑ the game is probably from the tee, because the grass, the fairways is very narrow and you can have a lot of flyers, and the greens are not very big.   So it is very important to hit the fairways and to be able to hit those greens.   You hit flyers, it's very difficult.   
GRAEME McDOWELL:   I like the air conditioning in the locker room is nice.   
   
 Q.   The players today, they have such strict fitness regimes and go to the gym; how do you manage to stay on the top of your game?   Do you have a regime besides the cigars?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yes, of course.   You think only drinking wine and cigars you can be 50 years old and competing with these yuck guys?   No Chang.   I also work on the gym and work on myself.   The main thing is that you have to enjoy what are you doing in your life and I love the game.   I love to compete because I'm here.   It's a mix of a lot of things, not only gym, not only the games; it's a mix, and enjoy your life, that's the main thing.
