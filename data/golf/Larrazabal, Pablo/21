 Q.   Very well played, you got a nice run of birdies going early on.   Did that get some thoughts going in the head?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   That helped.   Yesterday I played maybe better than today, but I couldn't hole any putts.   And today, you know, make those birdies early on, it helped, 13, 14, 15, 16 and then 17.   And then, you know, I tried to play my game and another short birdie on 2 and 3, and then a great putt on 5 and then a great shot coming in on 8.   
So, yeah, happy with my game and we will see what happens.  
   
 Q.   You won a tremendous playoff against Sergio on the other course down in Munich.   How different is this course?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, it's more troubling to play on this one.   It's maybe, you know, the golf course normally is a little bit softer, that one, so you have to take care a lot with the spin.   It spins a lot, the golf ball, and you have to take care of the trajectories.   But it's similar, tight pin positions out there that you cannot go for them, and a lot of birdie holes that you can take care of them.   So different but still a nice tournament.   
   
 Q.   Is Ryder Cup qualifying on your mind at the moment?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   No.
