 Q.  What do you think of the way you finished, because you finished in some style.  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: It's been a tough day.  Didn't play good enough the front nine.  Put myself over par very quick.  Then I made good birdies, and 8, 9, and straightaway, bogeyed 11 and 12, and myself 8-under par total, going backwards big time on the leaderboard.  And I thought, we didn't score any good this week on that back nine, so it's a lot of opportunities, so why we don't do it today.   
Come 4-under par the last six is very good, and I'm very pleased to myself.  That last putt, we knew the break.  I've been asking Raoul all week for the breaks and he's been superb.   
 Q.  You're up the leaderboard now and that's a lovely position for ranking points and prize money, isn't it?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: Yeah, it puts myself into Race to Dubai.  I was lying 58th coming into this week and I probably secured my spot in Dubai.  I'm very pleased for that because that will be I think my sixth Race to Dubai, and one Volvo Masters, so in nine years of career, being able to play the final seven times is very good.   
And I'm hitting it very good.  My putter has started warming up and hopefully -- I love Sun City, I love the golf course.  I played a couple years ago there and I love the place, so why not.
