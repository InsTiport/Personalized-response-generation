Q.   Did you sense there was going to be a nice low one in you this week?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I'm playing well.   I shoot my lowest round on The European Tour two weeks ago in Kingsbarns, so, you know, I knew that I know how to shoot low these days.   So, you know, I don't plan to shoot low, but I'm going hole after hole, and shot after shot, and trying to make birdies. 
Obviously in the front nine, the birdies, you know, the wind wasn't there that much.   And I made only two birdies, but coming in, I made a couple birdies, 10 and 11.   I didn't make birdie on 12.   I hit 5‑iron on my second shot from the middle of the fairway.   It was a little bit disappointing, but I know there are some birdie opportunities coming in, and I took it. 

Q.   You didn't play badly the first two days, but did you just click today?   Did things just happen for you?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, the difference between 2‑under and 7‑under, it's obviously five shots, but it's very different‑‑ make a few putts, a couple good breaks here and there, and you know, it's just about rolling a couple putts and don't make mistakes. 
Today I didn't make any bogeys, and you know, I made five birdies the first day, five birdies the second day and today seven.   The difference is not that big, only don't make mistake on a couple birdie holes.

Q.   I imagine this is a course you enjoy, you can really go for the shots. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   The mistakes, there were some mistakes out of the left; I'm a push‑miss player, so when I miss, I miss on the right.   The only hole that the bad mistake is on the right is 17, and I made sure that I am quite left.   So left rough is okay on 17.
