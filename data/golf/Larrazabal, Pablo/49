 Q. How did you play today?
 PABLO LARRAZABAL: I think I played very, very well today. It was a good, solid round of golf, and I made a lot of putts on the front nine to keep the round going. And then on the back nine I definitely hit the ball better and it was good to finish with two birdies in the last three.

 Q. What are you going to do tonight?
 PABLO LARRAZABAL: Just try and get my energy back because it's going to be an early wake-up call tomorrow, and then hopefully have a good round tomorrow and then have a nice rest tomorrow afternoon watching some golf.
