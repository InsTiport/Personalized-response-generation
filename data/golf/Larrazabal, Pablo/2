Q. Did conditions toughen up?  Was the wind a factor.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: It was.  It was tough.  Now the temperature went down, six, seven degrees but yeah, I played great the first ten, 12 holes, and then 13, I'm in the middle of the fairway with an 8-iron in my hand.
I thought I leave it like 30 yards short of the green.  I made par, but it looked like a little sign of alarm went on, and then bogeyed 15, probably the easiest pin position of the day, and then on 17, from ten short of the green, I fatted it again, couldn't make birdie and on 18, I missed about a 2 1/2 -foot putt.
So it's a good round, but it's a round, 3-under par,70, on this golf course in these conditions, is pretty good.
Q. So what does Pablo LarrazÃ¡bal need to do to get back into the winner's circle, because we know you can do it.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL: Me, too.  I can do it.  I know I can do it.  I have to keep trusting and I know my team trust in what we are doing.  I have to keep trusting and not making the mistakes I made the last six holes.  Those are the ones that make the difference at the end of the week.  You know, that two-and-a-half-foot putt on the last.  You know, on Thursday, you can look for it in the afternoon.
But anyway, I'm working to get back in that winning circle.  I know I can win golf tournaments, and if I can have -- it's tough when you go back home and you cannot work out and you cannot hit more than a hundred balls on the range, I have both wrists with pain, two days out of five days.  But you know, if I can play like the first 12 holes today,72 holes, I can win golf tournaments.
