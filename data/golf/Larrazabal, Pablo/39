  MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Welcome back.   Defending champion in the BMW International Open on a different golf course. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Like I said to your colleague, I don't feel as the defending champion.   Same event but different golf course, I will feel like the defending champion next year when we come back to Munich.   But you know, here we are. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Talk about last year, especially the playoff with Sergio, it was a special moment for you, wasn't it.
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It was.   I grew up, my brother played a lot of amateur golf with Sergio and I'm obviously three years younger than him, and I grew up watching him winning all of the tournaments he won as an amateur, and as a Spaniard, he was one of my heros. 
Still one of my heros when I grow up and was a pleasure to play against him in a playoff, and obviously more special to win it. 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   What did the victory do for you? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   More cash (laughing). 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   That's always good. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   They always say the second victory is a lot tougher than the first one. 
My brother said that the first one was the victory of the talent, a little bit of luck; and winning your first year on tour is all about luck and all about, you know, one week you play good, you play great golf, you make a few putts, and you don't know where you are, but you win. 
But the toughest one is the second one.   It was a victory of the hard work I did for a year and a half before that.   In 2009, I relaxed a little bit at the beginning.   I wanted to concentrate on the work I had to do, and in the middle of 2009, I started to work very, very tough and very hard in 2009 and 2010.   But I was thinking that the hard work I did was the right way to go, and the victory I did for that hard work was something special. 

Q.   You play with Martin and Marcel tomorrow; how good do you know them?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I don't know German, unfortunately, but we are going to be with a couple thousand Germans and my caddie and I tomorrow.   It is going to be a long day.   (Laughter).
But, you know, Marcel, we have played a lot of golf together.   We are good friends.   Martin, he's a superstar, he's Top‑10 in the world for the last few years, and Major Champion, so nothing wrong with that. 
As I said, he's a superstar.   We are playing in their home tournament and he's a former champion, as well.   So we are even now. 

Q.   Compare these two courses, Eichenried and one; is this one more difficult? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Obviously my score says something.   I played the Mercedes tournament here on this golf course, and I didn't play good.   On the other golf course on the last two years, I made 32‑under par.   So 16 last year to win it; and 16 in 2010, finishing double‑bogey, bogey, par.   So playing 32‑under par playing badly; I prefer the other one.
But you know, different golf course.   I'm a different player than what I was in 2009 when I played the Mercedes here.   I'm a different player.   I'm a lot more mature.   As I said, I work a lot harder since then, and you know, I'm ready to win another tournament. 

Q.   How does your game feel at the moment coming into your defence? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I'm hitting the ball as good as ever.   I think my long game, I never hit the ball as good as I'm hitting now.   My driver is very, very straight.   I never used to be that straight.   I am a little bit loose hitting so many fairways. 
My irons are quite good.   So, you know, the last‑‑ this will be the first tournament I come back to the short putter.   I've been putting with the long putter since November.   But I've been practising a lot last week, the mornings and afternoons before I watch the U.S. Open on TV.   I've been practising a lot on my putting. 
I think, you know, I'm ready to win another golf tournament.   You know how hard golf is these days; you play good and you miss cuts.   And when you play a little bit badly, you make a few putts here, a few putts there, you have the confidence to win a golf tournament.   So this game is tough.   But my game says to me that I'm ready to win. 

Q.   What was it that prompted the decision to return to the short putter?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You watch on TV the last few tournaments I played, I couldn't make putts.   We know all of the rumours that the long putters are not going to be available to use, so.   I thought that it was time to work on the right way and start to work harder with the short putter for the future, and I don't want to wait until 2016 or 2015 that they are going to change the rules.   As I said, if you're putting badly with that type of putter‑‑ I putt good all my life with the short one. 

Q.   You play the very new model of the Callaway driver?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I play the RAZR Fit, yeah.   

Q.   What about the Spain in the final?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   We have to beat France.   Many people think about playing Germany in the final, but it's like in golf.   You cannot win a golf tournament on Thursday.   So I don't win golf tournaments on Thursdays, and Spain is not going to win the Europe cup on the quarterfinals.   So you have to go step‑by‑step and try to win the tournament on Sunday afternoon.   You don't win the Euro Cup in the quarters or semi‑finals, but you can lose it. 

Q.   But the French didn't convince at all in the last. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I don't know.   You can feel badly on Wednesday and still winning the tournament.   So you can play badly on the qualifying, and go step‑by‑step and win the Euro Cup.   Why not? 
MICHAEL GIBBONS:   Pablo, thank you.
