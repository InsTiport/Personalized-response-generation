 Q.   Give us your thoughts on that round?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I played very solid.   I'm not performing on the par 5s, I think only 2‑under par, hitting perfect drivers all the time.   But you know, I'm hitting the ball very good.   I'm chipping okay.   Over 36 holes, I missed four putts under four feet.   Yesterday, I missed a foot‑and‑a‑half putt.   
But, you know, I like this place, and I know how to go low in this place.  
   
 Q.   Two twos on the par 3s on the back nine, which is your front nine, which signals your iron play is great.   You must be happy with that.  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, as I said, I'm hitting the ball very good.   If I keep my ball in play from the tee, I will go low.   
   
 Q.   You know the scoring is low; do you see a target or is it the old clichÃ©, one shot at a time?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   This morning I knew to try to be as close as I can to 10‑under par, I knew the leaders were going to be 11, 12, 13, all the way around to try to close the gap.   Try to shoot 4‑,   5‑, 6‑under par was good enough to close a little bit the gap with them and that's what I did.   
   
 Q.   Are you satisfied with the result?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yes.   Yesterday I felt that 2‑under par were not good enough the way I played, the way I hit the ball.   I hit it very, very good yesterday.   And I felt that if, you know, if I come this morning with the perfect greens, normally no wind in the morning here, I could go low, and that's what I did.   
You know, hitting the ball very good.   Hitting good shots out there.   Putting myself in good chances to make birdies and I made a few.   
   
 Q.   And yet, prior to the championship, even though you're a champion here, you said how much harder the course was.   Have you learned the way to play it?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Back in 2010 and 2011‑‑ 2010 I was 19‑under par going to 16 on Sunday afternoon.   I was leading by two.   I throw the tournament away, finishing double‑bogey, bogey and par.   And the year after, I won it with 16‑under par.   So I know how to go low over the weekend here.   
But, you know, Rafa is playing great, and he's been playing awesome the last month and a half or so.   
   
 Q.   You've already had a nice challenge with Sergio GarcÃ­a, so would be nice to be with Rafa down the stretch.   I know we are getting ahead of ourselves?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   This is Friday mid day, a lot of things can happen.   But I'm hitting the ball great.   Rafa is playing awesome the last month and a half or so, as I said.   But you know, I will try to concentrate on myself and I will send good luck to Rafa, as well.
