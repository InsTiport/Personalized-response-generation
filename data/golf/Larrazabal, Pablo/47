   PABLO LARRAZABAL: I played only one hole properly, was No. 2, then maybe No. 18, only two good holes aside from bad mental game. If you play 16 holes bad, you're not going to make any scores. You know, that's what happened today.   
  
  Q. When you say mentally bad, you weren't patient?  
 PABLO LARRAZABAL: No, I was very, very poor mentally, very, very poor. You know, after that start you need to be patient out there, you need to trust yourself to keep going and to try to make a couple birdies coming in, and I pushed myself too hard in these conditions. You push yourself very hard, you're going to make mistakes, you're going to make bogeys. But the only thing you can do in these conditions, and I did it, so I'm very -- you know, very disappointed for myself.   
  
  Q. In terms of these conditions, have you played in these conditions before?  
 PABLO LARRAZABAL: Of course I've played. Obviously I've played in worse conditions. I mean, it's tough, but it's not very, very tough. Was tough the first four holes, raining and with that wind, but we've played in worse conditions than that. We play the European Tour, not the PGA TOUR. I should be patient because I have the ways to be patient, the ways to be better than I've been today.
