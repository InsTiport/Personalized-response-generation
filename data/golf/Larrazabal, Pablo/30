 Q.   So what are your thoughts on moving nicely into contention for the final day?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it's been a great day.   I started with a bogey on the third with a lovely drive and a lovely 8‑iron, and I missed from three feet for par, but, well, you know, it's all about work and it's all about keep working for 18 holes and try your best every shot, and that's what I did and that's what I tried and I did it.   
   
 Q.   Seems to have been a pretty solid week on a difficult golf circuit, as well, but it's your best round of the week?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it's a golf course that I really like.   It's a golf course that you have to putt the ball in play from the tee and if you don't do it, you're in trouble.   So yesterday, only four fairways and I manage to shoot under par, is something that is special in these kind of conditions.  
Today I hit better from the tee and I hit more fairways.   I hit it more like I wanted to, and things went better.  
   
 Q.   I know you've said pretty much in the past, you like the tougher tracks and the effort that's needed?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, I don't like those golf courses that are wider and easier to hit fairways because you cannot concentrate that much.   These kind of tracks, you know, you have to concentrate, you have to keep the focus, and that's what I love.   
   
 Q.   Right at the start of the year, terrific to give yourself a chance at a victory on Sunday?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It's always good after working very hard in the winter, I didn't have holidays this winter, just to keep working and to get better.   Paid off.
