 Q.   Your thoughts on how this week has worked out?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You know, I played very good.   I hit the ball very good the first three days.   I didn't hole too many putts the first three days, but my long game saved me and today, you know, nothing happened in that round.   
I played again‑‑ the first few holes were not that good but then I hit the ball quite good.   The putts didn't drop and a missed bogey on the last was a bit expensive.   
   
 Q.   Looked solid but just wouldn't click today?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   As I said, nothing happened.   To win golf tournaments, something has to happen early on, and you know, keep it going with birdies and it didn't happen to me.   
Quite frustrated, the last four tournaments, I've been up there in three (rounds), and I cannot play good on Sunday afternoon.   I don't know why, but I will figure out soon and I will take care of it.
