Q.   Thoughts on the final day? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It was good.   I didn't‑‑ I started quite slow.   I put my ball like less than three feet on the first and I miss it, and, you know, it was a little bit shocking, a start like that. 
But, you know, I made a good putt on 9 that put my run on the way.   Yeah, I mean, five birdies since then, and this 3‑putt on the last that, you know, was an impossible putt to put it closer than nine feet and I missed the nine‑feet putt.   But, you know, I take it.

Q.   And when you had that run of birdies, were you getting more excited, thinking that you had the chance? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I didn't birdie 13, but I think that was very, very important.   I missed the eight‑feet put on 14 that I thought if I had one of those, I put myself 8‑under par with two or three birdies on the last four, I had my chances. 
But, you know, the end of the day, it's not all about winning.   It's all about performing.   It's all about playing good golf and that's what I did.   You know, it's all about growing in all the rankings, and I did it.   So, you know, happy. 

Q.   And it does bode well when you're performing knowing that there's other key events to come? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, it's unlucky that one of The Final Series events, the Top‑30 in The Race to Dubai, I cannot play.   It's not fair, but you know, other guys, they are going to play the HSBC next week.   But I will be ready to fight another week back in Turkey.
