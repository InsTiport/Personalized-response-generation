 Q.   I don't know how many times we've had this conversation this season, but it's good to be up there again.   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It's good.   You know, I played okay today, but you know, it was pretty tough out there.   Days like this, anyone can win.   It's just surviving golf.   I think I played good, and I shot 3‑over par, so you know, the conditions were very tough, and I tried my best.   I fight to try to stay over there, but my putting wasn't that good today.   So you know, I take fourth.  
   
 Q.   And there were moments later on when you still had a nice chance?  
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Oh, yeah, I had chances all day long until Paul got hot at the end.   I'll take fourth.   
   
 Q.   You go To the French Open in decent spirits once you recover from this week?   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   No, I have to rest because this week has been very long.   Missing the qualifying on Monday and a little bit disappointing today, but you know, just a little bit of rest this afternoon, a little bit of rest tomorrow and get into The French Open, that is one of the good ones.   
   
 Q.   One of the very best for you.   
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It is a great moment from there and hopefully the good playing is still there.
