  I didn't hit the ball great tee‑to‑green but I scrambled very good when I had to where I was many times.   A few shots there were very, very good, so happy with it.

Q.   One of those good shots was the 10th.   That was nice, wasn't it? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Yeah, I had 169‑meters and a little bit helping and I hit a perfect 7‑iron, went over the green and chipped it in.   So happy days. 
This golf course is a tough golf course.   Doesn't matter how good is the weather.   On this golf course you have to be in position and it's very easy to lose shots.   Very easy to make birdies and very easy to lose shots.   That's what I did today. 
I made a few birdies here and there.   I 3‑putt 12, that was a little bit painful, but you know, I scrambled very good and when I missed the shots, I chipped a gimmie and I shoot 69 the Spanish way.

Q.   I know the Open de EspaÃ±a didn't work out quite the way you would like, but generally feeling good about your game?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   Spanish Open was very tough for me, being at home, I had many people around, and I had a lot of you guys doing things and trying to you know, be good with all of you guys.   You know, sleeping at home is very tough.   To play a golf tournament sleeping at home is tough. 
As a Spaniard, I like to go to bed and have dinner late when I'm at home and you know, when you are in a tournament and you have to wake up at 4.30 in the morning, you have dinner at 9.30, it's not going to work too well.
