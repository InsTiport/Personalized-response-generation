  PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It was one of those rounds that you know that you have to fight the score.   You know, the poor shots I hit, I was able to make pars and I make a lot of three, four foot putts that you have to to make scoring in these conditions.   Very pleased with the round.

Q.   Long day when so many players that have struggled, you're one that seems to appreciate these tough conditions and the fight out there. 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   You guys know that I love these conditions, and I love to fight.   I don't like those courses that you have to make 6‑under par to be in the fight.   I like to fight the score, and that's what I did.   I try to make pars and try to make birdies when I have to, and that was all. 

Q.   You've seen weather conditions in Wales down the years, but this is a particularly fiery course this year it seems?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It's a lot faster, it's a lot shorter this year with hard fairways.   They are rolling quite a lot, so, you know, it's playing a little bit shorter, but with this wind, it's quite tough.   Some of the par3s are almost all into the wind.   You have to take care of some of the shots around there. 
But I prefer this wind than rain.   I'm not a great player with the rain, but I'm not bad with the wind.   So you know, looking forward to see tomorrow, a windy day, and let's see if it keeps the wind blowing for the weekend. 

Q.   Is there a moment when you thought, this is a really good day?
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   When I make the last putt, I knew that red numbers were very good today.   That's what I tried to do is save pars at the end.   They are tough holes coming in, 16, 17 and 18 are not easy holes; 14, as well.   13 and 12, they are very tough holes.   So, you know, try to make pars and try to go home in red.

Q.   Watching you weave Spanish magic out there, was it fun for you? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   It was fun.   Days like this, if you're playing good, it's very fun to fight the score.   So you have to go out there and par is your friend and go out there to fight.   I love to fight. 

Q.   The way you played to me, and to everyone in the commentary team, you looked the sort of player that has the ability to blitz a field, to win a tournament by eight shots; do you feel that? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I don't know that.   Every time I go out there, I try to do my best, and if my best is to win by eight, it will be great. 
But, you know, today was a great day out there.   I fight a lot and I make a couple of three and four foot putts that were very, very important today.   It's very tough to make the short putts with the wind.   You know, try to be ready for tomorrow.

Q.   The golf course is playing firm and fiery; do you like the greens nice and firm? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I like them.   Normally when the greens are very soft, it's not that challenging, and you have to move the ball quite good, and you have to have the pace on the long putts and save the pars, save good pars like I did on 18. 
So, you know, it's a type of golf that I love.   You know, the wind and tough conditions, because you know, I usually miss a lot, and in these conditions, I miss the same thing and the other people miss more.   So it's actually better for me. 

Q.   Going to be a tough week and the weather is going to remain the same with the wind; what will it take?   What score? 
PABLO LARRAZÃBAL:   I don't know, if it's still the same, a few under par; 3‑, 4‑, 5‑under par are going to win.   If the wind stays like this, the golf course is going to be firmer and firmer and it's going to be very tough at the weekend.   So you know, tomorrow morning, try to make some birdies early when the wind is not up, and you know, keep fighting.
