  Q. What do you think of the course so far?  
 GLEN STUBBLEFIELD: The golf course is excellent. Of course, with the wind and the rough the way it is, it's just too much for me. But I love the golf course. I think we could have played in better conditions.  
  
  Q. How did those conditions affect your round?  
 GLEN STUBBLEFIELD: Nasty. I'm not a real good wind player anyway. And then to play in this kind of wind with this kind of rough, it was just too difficult for me.   
  
  Q. What do you have to do to improve, do you think?  
 GLEN STUBBLEFIELD: Well, practice more, I guess.
