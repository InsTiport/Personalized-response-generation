Q. Tommy, is it a case of just what might have been this week?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah.  Well, it's just disappointing, obviously.  It got away from me.  I could count the bad shots that I hit today.  Just middle of the round, and that got away.  But the story of the score, I still had a chance, just couldn't do it.  It's always sad and disappointing.  I don't want to be a bit of a baby about it, but I'm obviously disappointed.  We'll just see what happens now for the rest of the tournament, who wins, but it just wasn't my time.
Q. Yeah, frustrating.  Is that the overriding feeling is frustration?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I think so.  I felt like I did so many things right, but just the last couple of days, two double bogeys that you can't have.  Putts just didn't really drop for the weekend like they did the first two days, and that's -- overall, that was it.
I'm not going to be miles behind.  I'm going to be maybe four shots behind or something.  So it's not a lot a shots around.  I could have done things better this weekend, but it just wasn't to be.
Q. It felt like there was a huge roar when you went out.  The crowd was willing you.  If you could get it going, you could mount a challenge?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I did it on the 1st, didn't I?  I did it perfectly on the 1st.  It was tough today.  Honestly, the first two holes, I played great.  5, soft two-putt front down from below the slope, and I got second putt, lips out.  6, I hit the drive exactly where I wanted to down that right side.  How it got in the bunker, I don't know.  I obviously made a mess from there and rapped it over out of bounds.
I didn't really feel like I did that much wrong.  Could have got it going because the crowd were with me.
Q. On the subject of crowds, and it's going here, next year at Portrush, I mean, they're selling out like mad, Tommy.  How great is that going to be?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's just getting bigger all the time, The Open.  It's such a great event.  You've got to love The Open, and it was a pleasure to play the weekend up there all week with a chance in the last few groups and have the atmosphere.  Got to wait a year to have another chance, but hopefully I can improve before then.
Q. It will be great, though, won't it?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It will be amazing.  Everybody says that when they -- I really hear everybody say, when they come to The Open, these are the best fans.  So that's obviously a good thing from golfers that travel around the world.
