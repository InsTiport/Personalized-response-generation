Q. How happy are you to start off with a round of 70 in this year's championship?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Very.  The course is brutal, really.  It's a really tough test.  Anything par or beating the course is a great score.  So yeah, just in the practice rounds, it's either playing rock hard and windy or it's been really wet with the rain and playing miles.
So when you get into the tournament, you never know what to expect.  Yeah, just really happy to be off the course at 1-under.
Q. Which elements of the course are particularly brutal?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The length, for one.  The greens.  The greens are the toughest test because they are firm.  The course is quite long and then the greens are firm and quite slopey.  So it's hard to, the pins were okay today but sometimes it's so hard to hit greens.  You can hit a good shot and just miss the green, and on top of that, the rough around the green just makes it hard to chip.
There's not a let-up, really.  You've never got one shot where you kind of feel you can go easy for ten minutes or you have a little rest.  It's just five hours of real tough golf.
