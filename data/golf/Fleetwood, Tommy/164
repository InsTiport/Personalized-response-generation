 Q.  Tell us about the eagle at the last.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Surprising, actually, because it was a nice pin. Felt like an eagle to be honest, made up for yesterday's finish. The weekend, I struggled to get anything going. Kind of hit it well, didn't hole putts, and the odd little mistake. So it was frustrating, really.   
And on the 13th tee, I thought, if I can make three birdies coming in, that would be nice, and eagle, one better.   
 Q.  Looking forward to the rest of the Rolex Series?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, big events coming up to try to keep my form where it is. I hit it well this week overall. Felt like it could have been plenty better, which you always do feel like when you hit it well but it was another one of them weeks where I felt like, I didn't contend in the end but I was very close to contending. I'm looking forward to having Monday tomorrow and a little rest Tuesday morning and getting back on it. But yeah, big events coming up, so you've got to keep your head down and get on with it.
