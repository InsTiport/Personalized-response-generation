Q. Tommy, how tough was that out there?TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, it was for me, yeah.  I played terrible to be honest.  I played bad and then all of that put together, if you don't make a birdie around there, like I said, you have to make a score on the front nine.  Too.  I was 3-over.  I just never got anything going, so disappointing.Q. Can you explain it?TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I just played really bad.  It just happens, doesn't it, sometimes.  I think golf is not the easiest of sports, and yeah, I just sort of fought my swing really.  It was crosswinds all day and I'd have been much better off if there was one nine down and one nine back into, but crosswinds when you're not sure about your swing makes it really hard.Q. It's probably going to get worse, so do you think you have a shout of being here tomorrow?TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No.  No.Q. How disappointed are you then?TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Oh, yeah, very.  It's a course that I like and I played well last week, played well yesterday, and yeah, so I fancy my chances of doing well.  But not to be.Q. On the delayTOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, it didn't do any harm.  We could have gone out and it could have been much worse.  We got decent conditions afterwards.  The delay wasn't a problem at all.Q. (Inaudible.)TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, but that's -- you know, it's no excuse for the way I swung it, really, no.
