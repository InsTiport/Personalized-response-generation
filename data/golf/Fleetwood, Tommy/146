Q. How much are you looking at points in The Race to Dubai?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I would be lying if I said I wasnât thinking about it or aiming to win it. I am in a very strong position but Iâve just got to keep concentrating week in, week out. Thatâs the thing you know, with such big events itâs not as if I can sort of hope that nobody plays well and I end up winning, so youâve got to go out and play well.
Itâs a massive event with a lot of World Ranking points, so you are always looking to improve your world ranking and to improve as a golfer anyways, so there is always a lot to play for and hopefully I can keep going and keep playing well.
Itâs a great tournament anyway. We all love Italian courses, theyâve got a lot of class to them and I think itâs great that we have such a strong field coming into this part of the year.
Iâve played alright the last couple of years. I like most golf courses, I like finding out a way to play a golf course and then trying to do it, but itâs a lovely course, one that you have to think your way around it.
Youâve got your dreams and what you work for as well, and Race to Dubai will be on that list, so I donât know how many chances I will get of winning a Race to Dubai and this might be one of the best chances, so hopefully I can do that
