 Q.  How was that match?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's golf.  It's life.  I got off to a couple of bad shots on the first few holes, and then a couple of missed putts on 5 and 6.  So he was 2-up through six, but the rest of the time -- not that I played great, but I can't take anything away from Tony.  He was so good today.   
 Q.  How different was the atmosphere?  Did it feel different to the last couple of days?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The only difference was I couldn't hole the putts to get the crowd going.  You're spread out over 12 matches instead of four, but I just didn't do anything.  I didn't do enough to get the crowd going, really.   
 Q.  An incredible week for you, regardless, four points.  You'll reflect on this with a lot of positivity.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Of course I will, but it's not about Tommy Fleetwood.  It's about The European Team and I'm going to go out and support the lads now.  All that I wish for is that we can get the job done and enjoy tonight, but on a personal level, it's been the most phenomenal week and everybody has been great.  But it's about Team Europe.
