TOMMY FLEETWOOD: If it's a tough day.  After yesterday I needed the weather to be bad, really.  And I definitely got that to start.  But then you've got to play and make a score.  And I was happy to get the people watching me something to cheer about.  It took me a long time to make a birdie.  But it's great.  I feel a lot better coming off the course than yesterday.  But just to make the cut, it's massive.  It's my first cut at the Open, and my fourth start.  And it's just nice to give them something to cheer about, really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I did at one point, actually, yeah.  No, it was absolutely great.  Like I say, there's no way people should be out on that golf course right now supporting anyone.  Me and Ian just kept saying, "There's no chance we'd be on this golf course."  So I can't thank them enough.  And like I say, I'm just glad that I get two more days of golf, and hopefully I can give some more to cheer about.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think it's one of the best.  You look a lot wetter than I do.  Yeah, it was definitely -- I think it's definitely one of the rounds of the year.  I didn't want to be sitting at home for the weekend and moping around.  Yeah, definitely, I think with the cut now on the line or if I was doing all right to shoot under par today, is one of the best rounds of the year, and it will stay like that.  So never mind trying to make the cut makes a big difference.   
So, no, I was just very happy to sort of get off the golf course and play those last few holes under par.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Kind of, but I just thought the law of averages might be in my favour at some point.  And I just -- I haven't made the putts, really, over the two days.  I putted really well today, actually.  And had a lot of chances.  My first birdie was a tap-in.  And it might have been -- there might be a lot of putts and birdies saved off the weekend.  I mean, it was just one of them rounds.  I made a lot of -- as much as I haven't holed anything, I made some really good par saves today, some clutch putts, hopefully tomorrow I can make some longer ones.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, it was all right.  I was actually at a decent rhythm, so I felt like keeping going.  And the break -- the greens were flooding, so it was nice to have that break.  But it was fine.  It felt fine.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I hope so.  I'm just happy to get out today.  We'll see.  I'll be up early in the morning trying me best.  You never know with The Open, you never know with the conditions, what's around the corner.  And I've actually -- I've never played a weekend at the Open, so I actually don't know, really.  But we'll see.  It will just be nice to be playing now.
