Q. 71 today.  How was that for you?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It was a struggle at times.  At times I hit it well.  At times I didn't.  I never quite felt great out there.  You know, never managed to get into a rhythm at all.  It was tough with the wind today swirling around a little bit.
Q. Was that there all day or was it coming later on?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It picked up later on but it was there from the morning onwards.  As soon as we teed off, it was always going to be a lot tougher.  And yeah, so it was just a more difficult day, really.  Especially when you're not quite on your game.
And then when I did hit shots, I kind of had good chances I didn't make, and put it all together, it's always kind of hard to get momentum going.
71, it's absolutely fine.  Obviously I'd like to be a couple better; you always would.  I'm in decent position.
Q. Agonisingly close to a birdie on the ninth for you, as well.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I got a horrible lie in the rough.  I hit a good second shot, really.  Just floated a little bit, come up short, and I had a horrible lie in the rough and chipped it.  Couldn't really get it that close and misread the putt there towards the end.  It was just at that point where I was getting a little bit ratty toward the end.  I had to calm down.  I'm glad to be in, really.
