 Q.  Coming to the final three Rolex Series Events of the series in good form?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I think things are going very well.  I'm playing some very consistent golf and I'm doing a lot of good things.  Said a couple of times now, unfortunately, I've done too many bad things at the right times.   
Just sort of waiting and working and hoping that I can put them all together over four days and get the result that a lot of my good stuff sort of warrants.  But every day, we're working hard and we're moving in the right direction and there's been a lot of consistent stuff which is all good.   
 Q.  You made a slow start here last year but picked up over the weekend, I think tied 23rd in the end.  How do you enjoy playing this golf course?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I do like it.  The last couple years, yeah, I just haven't got off to a very fast start.  There's a lot of birdies made around this golf course, and I think I've -- the first two days, I've just not made enough and not putted well and then you leave yourself a long way back.  I just need to make a faster start if I'm going to contend at all.  I do like the course.  I like the way a lot of the shots set up.  For the most part, the weekends I've had have showed that I can play well around here.  Just try and do that more often.   
 Q.  In terms of the overall position, you're second behind Francesco at the moment in The Race to Dubai and you're defending champion and it's been a fantastic defence of that.  How much would it mean to get over the line and win for a second year running?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It would be great.  It's not the first thing I'm thinking about, really.  Coming into this part of the year, having any chance, whatever that is, shows you've had a great season for those guys that do have a chance, and I would love to get to Dubai with a chance of winning.  But it's really not the first thing on my mind.  I'm practising each day and really this tournament comes first, and this is my only chance, really, to sort of have that chance in Dubai.   
We'll see what we can do this week.  Hopefully I can continue that good play and find myself there on Sunday with a chance and maybe this one might be my week.   
 Q.  The new schedule came out yesterday for The European Tour.  How difficult is it now playing on both side of the Atlantic to trying that balance of playing the amount of events on this tour and on the PGA TOUR, as well?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it's tricky.  It's a world schedule these days.  When you talk about Race to Dubais and FedExCups and whatever you want to talk about, playing both tours is difficult because you're doing both and not mastering one.  You're not concentrating fully on one.   
It is difficult.  You just have to turn up every week.  It just puts more emphasis on turning up every week and playing well.  This year I did a very job of that doing it consistently, and next year I have to do it again, and it gets harder and harder.  It is difficult to schedule your time.  But certainly will definitely be playing enough in Europe and in America, and we'll see how that goes.  I'm still in the early days of playing both tours.  This year was my first year and next year will be another go at that.  I'm still learning as we go.
