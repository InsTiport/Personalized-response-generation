Q. So a great round.  I know it got a little bit dark on the 18th.  Can you talk a little bit about that.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I just hit one bad shot really.  So I'm not going to get too angry with myself for hitting, like, one bad shot through the day.
I did a lot of good stuff.  Played well again.  Holed a few putts today.  And happy to be finished, to be honest.  Everybody's got to come back in line.
Q. Right, and was that the difference between yesterday and today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I just holed more putts, I think.  I felt like I played really well yesterday.  We've been really lucky this side of the draw with the conditions we've had.  So it's good to have made the most of it.
And, yeah, I just holed a few more makeable chances.  But apart from that, I felt like I drove it well, I played well.  Not really giving myself like loads to do stress-wise.  It's so far, so good.
Q. And you started playing really well last week as well, so you sort of got a bit of momentum coming in?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, I've been doing a lot of good things this year.  But I feel like I'm playing better and practicing better.  Couple of frustrating weeks where I had a bad finish in Abu Dhabi, and then last week just felt like I was playing better than what I was scoring and couldn't get it going.
So like, yeah, good to just keep doing good things and stay patient with it and like look at what you do over the last couple of weeks that you can do to get better this week, and hopefully it makes a difference.
Q. And how much do you think the light on the last hole -- or do you -- would you in retrospect --
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   No, I wanted to get in, and I -- it wasn't a hard shot.  I just, you know, hooked it out of the desert, and not trying to do it, it just was one of those things, and I've got two putt and make bogey, it's not like a disaster, it's just not how you want to finish.
Q. Great day.  Thank you.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Thank you.
