  Q. Having got there with a put on 18, tell us your thoughts about the playoff?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, I hit a poor putt and that's the end of it, really.  Aaron played 72 holes very, very good, and it was Aaron's time and Aaron's week.  Congratulations to him.
 Obviously I'd have loved it to have been me, but overall, looking back at the week, there's so many putts that probably cost me being further in the tournament but that's golf.  There's a lot of asset in the game that you have to do well to win, and you know, yeah, one putt on 18 on the 72nd hole, putting cost me at the end.  But that's life and try again next week.
 I played really, really good, especially the back nine today, felt really in control of my game, and you know, end of the day, finish second -- nobody beat me over 72 holes and like I say, it was Aaron's time and that's how it goes.
 Q. I think you got the whole range of emotions on 18 green from the fist-pump to get in the playoff to disappointment at the end.  How do you sum it all up?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Just fell short, really.  It's been a really good week.  I played really, really well today, especially on the back nine.  At the end of the day, I holed that one in the last to get in the playoff but putting cost me overall throughout week.  Yeah, summed it up with I just pulled a straight putt on the last.
 It's disappointing.  Of course, you always look at the positives, but messed up on the first playoff hole and that's that.  It's Aaron's time, Aaron's week.  He played great last week.  You know, worthy winner.
 Q. You talk about the positives to be back up there and get all those meetings again contending in a Rolex event, does it feel good, can you feel that round?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, like I say, struggled with my game really coming back after COVID and when playing in America and stuff, and today was in full control.  Didn't miss a shot from 8 and 9 onwards, and I had a bunch of chances, really.  Made some.  Kind of evens it receive out all the time.
 But felt like I played really, really well this week and yeah, one putt, missed it in the playoff, but there's plenty more.  It's just golf.  Still have to work on my putting a bit more and hopefully improve that for the next time I play.
 Played, in contention, nobody beat me over 72 holes, that's the great thing about it, but one playoff hole and that's it.
 Q. Great ball-striking week, one of the things you'll take to Wentworth next week.
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, exactly, like I say, the way I played this week, played really well in Portugal and then not so good at the U.S. Open but clearly my game is coming back.  I said that at the start of the week.  Everything I've been working on has been really good and felt more like the player that I feel like I should be, really, for a lot of this week, and yeah, tighten things up and hopefully my time's coming.
