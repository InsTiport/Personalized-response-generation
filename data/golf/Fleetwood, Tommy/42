 Q.  6-under on Carnoustie, how did you do it?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I like the course. I feel pretty comfortable. Especially when we play it and there's not much rough, there's definitely certain spots that you can hit and certain holes that you need to know. I've putted well around here.   
Kind of left myself a lot of flat-ish putts, and especially the greens the way they are. Try and hit it firm and straight, and generally aim at the hole and see if they go in or not. Just clearly a course that I feel pretty comfortable on.   
 Q.  Big advantage to start on Carnoustie with the other two courses possibly more scorable, is that how you see it?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It would be nice. I always score really well on this one. It is always good to get off to a good round here and a good start. See what the conditions bring. Kingsbarns always, if the wind blows, I always find that one pretty tricky with the way it's so exposed. Hopefully get some good conditions there tomorrow and shoot another good one, and you've got two rounds around St. Andrews. But for now, enjoy today. It was a good one.   
 Q.  Runner-up twice in this event. Is this going to be your year?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I thought it would be more than twice. I'd love to have this event on my C.V., really. Always enjoyed it. Always found like I played well, and something about playing at St. Andrews, the Old Course, you always walk in -- I don't know what it is, but you walk in, and there's pictures of everybody that's won it on the bridge and stuff, and I've always thought, yeah, I'd like one of them.   
It's always a nice atmosphere. Long way to go but I've done all right in the past, and hopefully Sunday I have another chance.
