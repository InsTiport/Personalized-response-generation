TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I actually played better yesterday but I just couldn't put a score together.  I had a bad finish and it left me feeling pretty sour, to be honest, last night.  A nice night's sleep and then come out today.  I just scored well, putted very well.  Apart from 17 and 18, which were a couple Dutch (indiscernible) again really.  I did very well, really.  Happy to get in.  I know I'm still a long way back, but it's nice to be shooting some good scores.   
 Q.  Well, you've seen the man you've go to catch if the weather allows.  With Andy Sullivan playing alongside you, at least you know what you have to do, I guess?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: He's played great.  Fair play.  He's just not stopped for two days.  When somebody is going like that, you've got to make sure that you concentrate on your game and try and just not get too frustrated that you are moving further and further back.  He's played back.  Weekend, you never know what can happen.   
 Q.  This course, you know the opportunities are there, don't you, but you've got to be careful with it at the same time?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The rough is up this year, so there's still -- bad tee shots can cause bogeys.  When the wind picks up around here, that changes the course a little bit.  But there's plenty of chances.   
At this tournament you always know you're going to have to take them really.  It's always generally -- with it playing soft and the greens are running quite nice, low scores are going to have -- you are going to have to shoot low scores to win.  We'll see what we can do, but just take it one hour at a time.   
 Q.  You don't sound at the peak of health?  You are battling it, are you?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Just a little bit.  I'm scraping by.  I'm fine.
