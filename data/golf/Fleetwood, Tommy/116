Q.  Quite a back nine?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it was more up and down than it felt. After a quite boring front nine. You could be disappointed missing the putt on the last. But really just think they put it in places you can't go. On 4 I missed it left. 10 I missed it right in the bunker. And 11 you can't really miss that tee shot right. So the bogeys are coming from just getting out of position. But it would be nice to shoot under par, but over all it's a good steady start.

Q. Two birdies in a row, colored a little by the last bit. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it was important, really. It felt like a couple over, and I actuallyplayed the holes really well coming in. 16 and 17 I got a couple to drop. Overall I felt like I didn't really have any full game. So level par is pretty good.

Q. Anything to work on tomorrow?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, little bit. The game is not far, and the swing feels pretty close. Felt like I played pretty steady. It's difficult on these greens, because you just can't putt aggressively. So no matter where you are, you're trying to dive it in the middle of the hole a lot. It's difficult, but you can't at any point say I'm going to make this one, I'm going to build momentum and attack. You just have to stay patient. I felt like I did really well today and I was really happy with just that side of my game. 

Q. What was it like with Tiger out there today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it was good. It's great to play with him. Honestly when you're out there, apart from a couple of moments where you might step back and take it in, you're concentrating on your own game. He's very, very easy to play with. He does his thing. The crowds are good. There was no sort of bad incidents. They were sort of never running away before you putted. It was really good. I enjoyed it. 

Q. Could you feel the larger crowd than normal around him?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, yeah, it's kind of a different atmosphere, isn't it, around Augusta and around the Masters, and then Tiger on top of this. It's just very ‑‑ it's great experiences to have. And when you're playing you feel so fixated on your own thing, so you don't‑‑ 95 percent of the time you actually don't take it all in. So when you do it's lovely.

Q. Did you feel the anticipation around the first tee shot?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I was pretty sure they weren't feeling anticipation about me. But, yeah, you could definitely feel it.

Q. Once that was done, did it feel a little bit of a load off?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, no, it was fine. I mean, yeah, it felt that it was Tiger. It's nothing to do with me. I'm playing my own game. I'm doing my own thing.
