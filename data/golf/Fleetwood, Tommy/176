Q. Thoughts on the week?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Today was more of a battle than I wanted it to be.  I had four drivers and today I hit three sort of dodgy shots and one of them was the third, made double.  From there it was a scrap.
But still happy with myself in the end for the way we handled it and the way we played and the way we battled out there.  It was great really.  Couldn't ask for much more.  Always comes down to the last times and that putt, I thought -- I really did think that was going to break in.  But yeah, really good week.
Q. Proud of yourself because of the way you did battle back from the early indiscretion and giving yourself a chance right down the death?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, didn't really know what the winning score was going to be.  But 3, 4 and 5 -- 4, I hit a bad wedge shot and had to get up-and-down, and 5 I actually hit a good iron shot but misclubbed it.  It's really hard with the wind swirling, and nearly did it again.
Just really did have to keep going, because you didn't know what was a good score and I wanted to get back to level through nine and push on.
13, the par 5, hit two bad shots, made par, and I was a bit angry after that hole but kept it going.  But very pleased.
Q. The plan for you now?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's Christmas, isn't it.  I'm going to go home and not do much.  We've had a long stint, really.  I was going to play last week and didn't.  From August onwards, we really haven't missed any that we could play.  It's been great seeing my game progress back to where I would like it to be, but it's time for a rest.  Time to go home and see everyone.
