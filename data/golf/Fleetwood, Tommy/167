Was there any one thing that you can pin down today that might have given you the most difficulty or was it several things that cropped up?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I mean I started off fine, played the first great.  The second played it well.  Third I had good shots in, and overshot a putt, which is easy to do.  And I kind of got out of position a little bit at 6, wrong club.  8 was out of position.  And from then I played pretty well, apart from -- I mean 15, I was better than I was missing it 25-foot left.  As bad as that shot looks, you can't go left.  And 16 pushed it.   
But there wasn't any bad shots from 9 onwards.  And I think, again, I was 2-over early on, and it's easy to just get wound up or lose hope or just lose it because you wanted to win the U.S. Open.  But I was very pleased.  But, yeah, from 9 on I was good.
