  Q. What are your thoughts about the first couple rounds?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   They've been all right.  Things to work on, things to be happy about, and at the end of the day I've got a full weekend of golf ahead where hopefully I can be up on the leaderboard.  I'm happy with -- I'm not happy with the way I'm starting, but happy with the way my back nines are going, and just try and put two nines together.
 Q. It mirrors, doesn't it; 4-under both back nines, isn't it.  At least you get momentum when you finish.
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, I know.  I've missed a few short putts this week, so it's just something to continue to work on.  If those go in, which is like -- it's not simple stuff.  Golf is not easy.  But hole the ones that I should be holing, and it's a completely different score and I'm further up than I already am.
 But at the same time I am where I am after 36 holes where I think it's going to be pretty tough conditions.  Strike the ball like I have been, scoring is going to be tough, like I say, I keep saying I'm going to move up.  That's what I'm hoping for.
 Q. Growing up in the northwest you may well have played at certain of these courses in tough conditions.
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, and I think just appreciate the conditions.  Everybody is out there in it.  I've always enjoyed a challenge and a test.  You definitely feel like you've done a good day's work when you come in.  I always feel like it keeps you very present, it makes you focus on the next golf shot because everything is so difficult you can't get ahead of yourself, and it's just, yeah, tough conditions is always something I've never been sort of fazed by, weather, cold, wet, windy, whatever it is.  I kind of enjoy being out there in it, in a strange kind of way.
