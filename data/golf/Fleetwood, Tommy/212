  TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I played better.   That was a big positive.   I hit a lot of shots‑‑ I hit a lot more greens, maybe not as close as I'd like it to a lot of the time, but I had a lot of attempts at birdie which yesterday was nonexistent. 
So it was definitely closer.   Again, putted well, chipped well when I needed to, and 2‑under when you're at the top of the leaderboard in a WGC event isn't going to be bad when it's my first time. 

Q.   Are you conscious of your position on the board?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, I saw it but it's just nice to be putting myself up there and it's all experience, isn't it, all new learning curves. 
Like you say, you get used to being up there on The European Tour, like I was doing on The Challenge Tour and now moving up again and hopefully I can keep myself up there for another two days, and we'll see where I finish.   But it's nice to be at the top end of the leaderboard in such great field. 

Q.   I daresay, it's always the same, but there were moments when you felt like it could have been even better? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Almost.   That wasn't the case yesterday for a change.   2‑under is good.   I played all right, but I didn't play well, is and the course can catch you out wherever you are. 
So 2‑under was about right today I'd say for the way I played.   I had to shape it a lot today and still hit plenty of poor shots but hit some good ones, as well.   2‑under I'm happy with.

Q.   Is there anything different, unusual, about playing golf in China? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Not really.   A golf course is a golf course, isn't it.   You just try and get on, try to hit the fairways, try to hit the greens and try to hole a few putts wherever you are in the world.   Just put your head down and play no matter where you are and see how it goes.
