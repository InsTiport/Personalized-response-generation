 Q.  Talk about what it was like out there today.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It was a little bit -- I would say it's a little more forgiving than the practice days have been, like it felt like there was a few chances today, but overall, still a brutal golf course, and as soon as you're out of position, you're going to struggle.  Luckily enough, I hit plenty of good golf shots.  Felt like I putted really well, like I holed out really well, and the par saves that I had, I made, whatever I made, three bogeys or something.  But in general, like I didn't really have like a five-, six-footer for par on those holes, so I holed all those putts that you want to hole that are kind of momentum putts.  Felt very accepting out there, and just overall had a good day.   
 Q.  Was the energy level up after last week?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Absolutely fine.  I've got no virus this week.  I've recovered, so I feel much, much better, and it was good getting here and preparing for a golf course I absolutely love.  Like I get a buzz out of preparing for the major courses like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Like that, just a passion for it and adrenaline.  That keeps you going easily.   
 Q.  You weathered 10, 11 and 12 at the start better than most early starters --  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Didn't feel like it.  You know it's going to be a tough start any time at 7:00 when it's a bit cold in the morning on those holes.  It's tough, and I didn't really play -- I actually felt like I didn't swing it well on those holes.  Like 10 I hit a good tee shot but really, really poor iron shot, and didn't get away with that one, made bogey.  At 11 got away with it because I hit it in the bunker.  If you're in the fairway bunkers you've got a bit more of a chance.  And then 12 sort of wrapped an iron shot with my second one and made par.  So it wasn't really pretty over those first few holes, but I think 1-over around them is something nobody is going to complain about throughout the week.   
You know, it is what it is.  But there's some really tough holes out there, and you can't switch off for a minute.  You get through those and you get on to the par-5 on the next, I pulled the tee shot a little bit, I'm in the rough.  Actually I had an okay lie.  You can have a terrible lie and you're hitting a 5-iron 4-iron into a par-5 all of a sudden.  Just because there's some hard holes out there, the easier ones that people think aren't really let-ups either.   
 Q.  You birdied a third of the holes.  Are you surprised there were that many birdies out there?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I was a little bit actually.  It wasn't something that I really -- I mean, I didn't really have an over and under on how many birdies I might need to make, but like sort of you feel like you make one, you feel like the course isn't really giving you much.  I think it definitely felt more playable today, though, than on the practice days.  I made a great birdie on 15, which was my first one of the day, but at no point does it feel like the course is going to lend anything to you.  Yeah, six birdies is a lot.  It's probably more than I thought I would get.   
 Q.  Shinnecock and this course are dramatically different, but is there something about this environment that you feel comfortable in?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I don't know.  Maybe I fit in.  No, you know, again, I think the once in a while, too, they have these major setups, and I enjoy the challenge.  It doesn't always go right, but I enjoy the toughest courses, and I enjoy getting in a dogfight out there with the toughest courses in the world.  I guess look at those as similarities.  But no, I like it.  I love playing over here.  I love the positivity, and I love the support that I get.   
 Q.  Did the New York crowd remember you, did they?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'm not sure they remembered me.  There was no mentions of last year, but they were nice, yeah.  They were in my favor, and I always -- like I consider myself pretty lucky wherever I go that I get really good support, so this week has been no different.   
 Q.  Do you think there's a 63 here?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'm not sure I'd be the one to shoot it if there is.  But no, no.  But Brooks has got a chance for it, so who knows.  I think par-70 does make a difference.  I made six birdies today, so that's one away from shooting a 63.  I think the weather today is as good as we're going to get it.  But we'll see.  If anybody does, then they deserve their place in history.   
 Q.  That was kind of a big deal; there may be a 62?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, there could.  I wouldn't bet on it, but I'd just be going with the odds.  But I could be.  These are the best players in the world, and like I say, if you put it in the fairways, there's certain holes that you have to get through the course, but at the end of the day, good swings and good shots generally do the trick.  Doesn't matter how the course is or where you are.  If you put good swings on it, you're going to be fine.  Whoever does that the most will have a chance.   
 Q.  Did you smile to yourself after a good round on Long Island and see Brooks' name on the top of the leaderboard?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, it's only round 1.  Brooks does a very good job at majors.  I think we all know that.  I sure wouldn't be surprised if he was still there on Sunday.  I think when you get to majors, there's definitely certain names and certain people that you've got to beat, and most of the time certain names and people pop up on the leaderboard.  But that's the game, and that's what we're here for.   
 Q.  He talks about the buzz of majors, as well.  Do you see some similarities between the two of you?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Between me and Brooks?  He's a lot bigger than me and he hits it a bit further.  He's got a bigger bone balance.  But I think yeah, mentality-wise I'm obviously short of -- I'm short of those wins at the moment.  I feel like I get into contention and hopefully it'll be a matter of time.  But definitely in terms of like the challenges and how I think some players go about majors and the way to get people's set up, I guess we could look at similarity in that way, too.
