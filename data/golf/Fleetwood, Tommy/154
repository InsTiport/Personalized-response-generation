TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I didn't hit it well enough.  I didn't putt well enough.  And it was just a bit -- it was frustrating not to be able to get anywhere.  I wanted to get it back to level with them last four to play, had to knock that putt and the last.  After the first day, you know, I'd have taken anything, really, to be playing on Sunday.  So it's easy to sort of be frustrated because you wanted to do so well.  But to complain would be a bit off, really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I mean that's one way to look at it.  I mean it was nice.  Sometimes you have different challenges, so it's nice to show different sides and show different parts of your game.  And, yeah, I mean, I wish we could go back and play Thursday again.  My middle two rounds were as good as anybody's, but my first round wasn't.  And the last round I just couldn't get anything going.   
No, I mean, one of the rounds of the year for sure, that Friday, it will stand that way, as well, no matter what happens.  To play at the weekend was fantastic.  Yesterday was such a great atmosphere early on.  And today it was just great to sort of walk around a course on a Sunday, as hard as you were trying to make a score, it was still nice to be out there.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, a bit of work to do, my game has not been right this week.  So there's a bit of practice and get ready for the next two weeks, this which are big weeks, and then I have a rest coming up.  There's massive tournaments ahead.  And I've played well this year at times and in big tournaments.  So at least I know when my game is on I can compete.   
But, yeah, there's a bit of work to do and hopefully we can get it back and just build confidence again.  But being 27th in an Open is a great result.  It sometimes feels worse than it is.  It's great golf to finish top 30 in an Open.  But when you want to push on it just -- and I played with Marc, he played great.  It always feels worse than it is.   
Not far off.  I have big tournaments to look forward to.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Spotted a few, yeah.  I tried to keep my head down and concentrate on what I was doing.  But it was great.  That's definitely this week something I'll always remember.  I think it was lovely for my mom and dad to see the support I got, and for my family to see the support that I got.  And it's been very, very nice experience.  And, yeah, I'm glad Friday and Saturday I gave them something to cheer about.  It has been amazing getting clapped on to every tee, clapped on to every green, get your name shouted all week.  I'm very, very grateful to everyone that's been shouting.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I mean, it was amazing.  The first tee on Thursday was the best atmosphere I've ever seen in my life.  And definitely on Friday night when there were people out there at half eight at night and it was horrendous weather and people shouldn't have been there.  That's when it really shows they're some diehard fans.  I loved playing in front of them all week.  I loved the chance to play.  It's amazing to have a crowd that much on your side, it really is.  And I loved every minute of it.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, of course it will.  It's been brilliant.  I wish I could have gave myself a better chance.  It is what it is.  But, yeah, whatever happened this week it was always going to be a week to remember.  I'm very grateful for everybody that turned up.  It is a home event, home Open.  I said yesterday I think the tournament should be here more.  I think it is -- I think it's such an amazing venue, as in crowds, town, course.  It's trouble to beat it on the rota.  Hopefully I'll be back whenever it's next here and have the same atmosphere.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah.  It was cool, wasn't it.  I wish I could have made the putt and seen what it would have been like.  But, yeah, to walk down the 18th on a Sunday, you watch on TV all the time, and I'll been sulking in the chair the last three years.  Whatever my score, when I was playing on Friday, I would have taken that walk.  And yet today slightly frustrating day, but that walk was brilliant.  It was a thing of beauty.
