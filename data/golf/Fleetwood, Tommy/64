 Q.  Very nice round of golf.  Nice bounce back from yesterday's difficult round answer it for you.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I mean it's nice to bounce back, but when you're coming down the stretch it's obviously a lot of disappointment there as well.  Just got on the wrong side of the golf course yesterday.  It played like a U.S. Open for us in the afternoon, it was so difficult.  And when you're finding it tough those days can easily just, they get away from you a little bit.  I made a great birdie on the last, last night to do something.  And again today I felt great, I just lacked a couple of putts.  All I needed was -- I holed out okay -- but all I needed was like two or three birdie putts to go in and then you're coming down the stretch with a chance.  So it's strange that the best result of the year and the week that I feel like I've sort of built some momentum and felt really comfortable on the golf course, kind of ends with a little bit of disappointment, it's strange though.   
 Q.  When there's still a chance to catch him, you had an eagle putt on 16, what is that like, are you still doing math, okay, this is what I need to do here, is it tough to focus on the shot by shot when you're maybe looking at the overall, you're trying to win a golf tournament?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Of course.  I mean, yeah, I felt very comfortable today.  I felt very comfortable.  You know you've got to hole those putts.  I felt like -- I wish I could have had some easier putts than 15, 17 and 18 where, 17 I hit a great putt, 16 I hit a good putt, and 18 you leave it short, but it's so steep you're not going to run that one past.  So just a couple shy, but I enjoyed it, it was nice to be in the mix, it was nice to be up there trying to get a good finish, it was good.
