  Q. 6-under par going into the weekend.  Give us your assessment of your play over the first two days.
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, pretty good.  I actually think I played better today.  Just not driving it how I would like to.  I mean, a couple of unlucky ones, as well, that kind of cost -- like 15, I'm like an inch away from whatever it was, and I made bogey there.
 My iron play was really good.  Would have liked to have got up-and-down on the last, but a chip-in around here can be pretty hard with some of the lies you get.  And overall still in the tournament really.  You can only be out of it at this point, can't win it or anything, so I think, yeah, the way I've hit my irons, I've got a couple things to sharpen up, but pretty good.  Yeah, can't complain too much.  Still with a chance.
 Q. One of the shots of the day was the second to 12.
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   How many shots were better than that today, if that's only one of them?  It was particularly good, and it was funny actually because we walked -- obviously I get on really well with Tyrrell and Mick, and sort of walked to the balls and we were only a couple yards apart.  We had to wait for a while, they were up by the green, and I sit down and I'm writing the yardage in, and I'm going, 174, I think it was plus 43 or something, uphill nine, into the wind, and I was like, how far is this, and Mick was saying the same thing.  Tyrrell went first with a 4-iron and it was always like a forced -- like a little fairway wood that I kind of -- ball is above my feet so I was kind of trying to hold it a little bit to not get too much of the slope, and it was one of them that you kind of look up and I was very pleased with it when I was looking up, and nice when that went in for birdie, yeah.  Almost adds more pressure on the five-footer when you hit that good of a shot; you don't want to let it go.  But that was a well-played hole.
 Q. You've contended to win the Race to Dubai the last four years at this tournament.  You said you learned an awful lot from winning in '17.  What specifically?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, I think you have to keep playing each shot as it comes.  I think experience in that kind of pressure is priceless, and you never quite know what's going to happen or how it's going to unfold.  Even last year I was pretty -- I can't remember how far Jon was in the lead going into the back nine, and you get on a run, and all of a sudden we're tied and Jon makes a great birdie down the last and all of a sudden you're in with a shot.  You never quite know what's going to happen.  You have to stay very, like, present and keep hitting golf shots.
 Yeah, I think you just grow more comfortable with it.  You just learn.  It's like being in contention for tournaments.  I guess Ryder Cups, I've only played one, but you look at Lee who's played nine Ryder Cups, I'm sure he feels very, very comfortable.  It all is -- experience is just something that everybody -- you can't buy, you can't teach, you have to have been there.  I've been there and lucky enough, again, I've made it this far in the season.  We've got two days left and I'm still in with a chance to win the whole thing, which is something to be very happy about, and hopefully I can be here tomorrow night with one more day left still with a chance.
