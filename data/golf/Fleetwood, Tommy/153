TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah.  I didn't play that bad, really.  And then the last four holes, to get it back to 2-over wouldn't have been that bad a day.  Yeah, not very good.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: About like normal, really.  It didn't make any difference to me or the way I saw shots.  Everything felt the same on the course.  It just wasn't great, really.  I didn't get any breaks.  When I hit good shots, I didn't make the birdie putts.  It was the last few holes, 16, 17, two bad tee shots.  And made a mess of 17.  And I wasn't that far away, but it just looks really bad now.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: We'll see.  I've come back from bad rounds before.  I might not be very happy now, but come tomorrow you've got to go one step at a time and see what we can do.  This weather is going to play a massive part.  And we'll just wait and see.  I can't do anything about it now.  I just have to go out tomorrow and see what we can do.  Have to try my best and try to make up some ground tomorrow.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it was cool.  It was brilliant.  Yeah, I mean, it was amazing.  Something that you really don't get very often, and I loved it.  Striped my first tee shot.  It was great.  It's obviously great having him out there.  I feel like I disappointed him a bit the way I played.  I'll try harder tomorrow.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, I didn't play -- I was 4-over through 9.  I hit one really bad shot:  I put it in the bunker on 3, which is poor.  I had the wrong club.  I hit one bad second shot into 6.  The rest of it was all right.  On 9 I got a complete flier out of the semi-rough.  I played those last few holes decent.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, up until last week I think I played it about eight times since I was 17.  I prepared great for the event.  And I came out a couple of times last week, and I couldn't have prepared any better.  You've still got to hit the shots and still got to get the good breaks.  I had a couple of bad breaks, and all in all it's the toughest course in the world when you're playing majors; you're going to get punished.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, I was quite happy.  I looked around, felt fine.  You have to pitch your shots, so you can't just -- I enjoyed it, it was absolutely fine.  I felt calm as anything.  The swing actually felt good.  It just didn't look that way from the TV probably.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, not today.  Not today.  I have to get one back tomorrow.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it was great.  They're absolutely brilliant.  They did their part, I just couldn't quite do mine.  It's absolutely fantastic playing in front of that many people, people that are supporting you.  It's brilliant.  It's a great experience.  I loved it.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Depends how I play.  It's still The Open and I shot 6-over, but to be honest I'm just thinking about playing tomorrow.  I know there were people that will shoot 5-under tomorrow -- there's a long way to go.
Come tomorrow I'll be ready.  I'll do my practise in the morning and try my best tomorrow.  But I won't think about -- there's no point thinking about the cut unless I'm on the mark with two holes to play.
Q. (Inaudible.)
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, he played good.  He's one of the best players in the world.  He played fantastic today.  He was brilliant.
