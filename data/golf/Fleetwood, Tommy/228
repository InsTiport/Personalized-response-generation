   TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I didn't play as well as yesterday. My putting wasn't quite as good. Bogeyed the last but can't complain with 1-under around Carnoustie.

 Q. And in this weather, as well. 
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I got out of the car this morning and thought, this isn't looking good. But it wasn't too bad. Played in worse.

 Q. You can't complain, being, what, a few shots off the lead going into the last round. 
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, I'm chuffed, yeah. It's been a great week so far. So obviously anything I get from here is a bonus. Just seeing the guys are on 13-under, so if I can get somewhere near, that would be great.

 Q. What was your expectations coming in, just to make the cut or to win? 
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I wanted to make the cut. I mean, I didn't think about winning too much. But yeah, I just -- obviously it's great to get in this tournament. It's one of the biggest ones -- probably the biggest one of the year. 
 Got all of the best players playing. So three great golf courses, and another chance to get some experience for next year.
