 Q.  Try to describe as the board was turning blue what you were feeling inside?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: You can't prepare for it, really.  We said, we were walking down 6 and we said, sounds a little bit better this afternoon, and the energy that comes off those guys going in front, I don't really know how to describe it.   
All the preparation you do, just nothing gets you ready for this.   
 Q.  What's it like standing alongside this man and why is this such a top partnership already?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: We don't know but we enjoy playing together, and obviously spending time together.  He's played amazing this morning and this afternoon.   
Yeah, I think we just combine really well.  But you know, the boys that went out early this afternoon made an unbelievable job.  Very, very different from this morning, the atmosphere, and we needed it.   
 Q.  Can you quite believe the atmosphere out here this afternoon, and the reaction as you hug your teammates?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's great, but we need to put the hat back on for tomorrow and reset quickly.  They are going to come out strongly tomorrow, so there's no time to celebrate when there's still a job to be done.   
We prepared, like Thomas said, to get it done, and we will.
