Q. Tommy, again, great round.  Bogey-free.  Would you have taken that on the first tee today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah.  It wasn't an easy day.  Scoring has been pretty good, pretty decent.  I know some people are struggling.  But it was tough today and the weather came and went.  Anytime you're going to go bogey-free, especially at a major, take it and run.
And, yeah, I played really consistent.  I'm happy with that.  And you're 18 holes down of the 72.  So I conducted the round today very well.  So I'm pleased.
Q. Game has been good.  Anything particular that was particularly effective for you today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I hit it well.  I was very consistent.  I think off the tee I did a good job.  I was always in play pretty much.  And that's obviously vital.  The rough out here is pretty thick.  As soon as you hit a bad tee shot you're generally going to be hacking out.
In terms of the bogey-free, which is the best part about the day, I made it very stress-free.  It wasn't like I was grinding out and getting loads up-and-downs.  I made a couple of good up-and-downs early on.  12, 13, so about the second shot.  So I got up and down on the par 5, which was just -- you don't get up and down, you make bogey on the par 5.  And I made par and holed a good putt on 13.
Little things like that, especially in major golf, that's so important to good rounds.
Q. You know what that local pressure is like.  What was it like today?  For the Irish lads, can you feel the pressure particularly?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I don't know, I can only speak on a personal level when Birkdale came around and the feelings I got on the first tee.  I suppose aside from the Ryder Cup, I still never quite had.
And this sport is amazing.  You really have to experience it, really, to then be able to take it away and know what to do.  And I did a terrible job of it day 1.  I shot 6 over.  But I loved it.  But it comes with -- it's only yourself that would put that pressure on yourself.  Because you want to do well for everybody in your home.  It's a special occasion.
Actually, not everybody gets to play a home event, let alone be the home event and the biggest event in the world.  There's pressure coming with that.  But I think it's all in a positive line.  And it's good to see so many people out here.
Q. I downloaded a documentary on the BBC.  The Weary Dodger, where did that come from?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The Weary Dodger.  No, Dodger is my nickname.  My dad's always called me that.  I'm not sure why to this day.  And then, yeah, I used to get grumpy on the golf course when I was a lot younger.  Just one of my dad's famous statements.  I'm not too bad now.
Q. So you know how Rory would feel, to some extent?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah.  Well, I actually don't know what he shot.
Golf is hard.  It's Rory McIlroy, and to this day he's like one of, if not the, greatest players I've ever seen.  I wouldn't be at all surprised.  You actually don't know what's going to happen.  Could go out tomorrow and shoot a great score.  Not actually out of the tournament.
It's easy to focus on the bad day that he's had, but at the end of the day, it's Rory McIlroy.  You don't know what he could do next.
It is difficult.  And of course I think when it's not going your way and you're trying your hardest, especially when you're in front of a home crowd, it just adds up a little bit.  But I'm sure that he'll come back just fine.
Q. With the tournament being here?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think it's great.  The golf course I think is such a good major venue.  I can't see anybody saying a bad word about it.  And obviously you've seen how it is this week.
Logistically for us as players it's been the best ever.  Hats off to The R&A.  But the crowds here are just fantastic.
Q. Can you talk about the crowd?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: They've been great.  I think I've always been -- I mean, I consider myself very lucky, I've always had a pretty good connection with the crowds wherever I go.
When you're British playing the British Open, that home support is always going to be around.  It's great.  And something we love playing in front of.
