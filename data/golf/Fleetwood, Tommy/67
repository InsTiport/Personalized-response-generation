Q. Not the day you were hoping for, but can you put into some sort of context, perspective, how it felt and what emotions you're going through right how?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Not very good.  Yeah, I hit enough good golf shots.  It was just one of those days, couldn't get the ball to go in the hole.  17 kind of summed it up.
At the end of the day, you live and breathe the game, don't you, so there's going to be good bits and bad bits.  Today pretty much summed up the sort of second half of the season.  I've done plenty of good stuff in tournaments, and then days like today.
But it is what it is.  I'm fine.  Hit and healthy.  I'll play golf tomorrow and that's it.  I'll go home and I'll spend time with my son tonight.  At the end of the day, it's just golf, but it does hurt when you have days like that.
Q. Ready for one last push there after an amazing season?  Ready for one last adrenaline push on Sunday?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I feel the adrenaline might have gone now.  I think you kind of know when your time's up.  I lasted within two days of the season.  Like I've said, it was a stretch trying to win it.  But it is what it is.  I'll play tomorrow and we'll see how we do, but it's fine.
