Q.   Thoughts on the day? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Very happy.   It's a long, tough course.   It tends to always blow around here.   You wake up at six and then you look outside and it's blowing a gale and it's not very nice.   Just a really good score and played really well. 
Yeah, 3‑under is a great start to the tournament. 

Q.   You got off to a flyer, as well, with four birdies in six. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, I did.   I just started off playing really nicely.   I played nicely all day to be honest.   Just two bad tee shots on the par 5s but they are not easy tee shots to be fair.   I kept giving myself chance, some dropped and some I missed, so it's all good.

Q.   Paul McGinley set this course up to play like Gleneagles.   Are there similarities for you? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   The par 5s are a little bit easier around Gleneagles I think, but apart from that, yeah, it's similar.   It's just one of them courses where you have to hit it well and you have to drive it well.   The greens are actually really soft, which is helpful.   Because we don't hit many wedges in at all, so mid to long‑ish irons that can stop but it just helps you going into the greens. 
I like the course.   The course, I enjoy playing it.   It suits me, and if there's a few more similarities to Gleneagles, I'll be happy.

Q.   Your thoughts on playing alongside Colsaerts, he hit one 447 on 18?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   He wasn't even happy with that.   Took his hand off the club.   Get up there and he's got to take the spin off it into a par 5.   Yeah, he played great.   He got it going in the middle of the round, and when a couple of you are playing well, it's really nice because you can carry each either.   He's a lovely guy and we get on well.   Just a nice three‑ball.
