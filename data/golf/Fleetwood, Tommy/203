 Q.   Great round, two bogeys, you got it back after the eagle on 13.   Can you tell us about the eagle?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, it was just the first putt I've holed all week really.   It was a 60‑foot putt that goes in.   I hit two good shots.   It's a tough course to play when your game is not quite there.   There's so many tee shots that you don't fancy and so many shots you don't want to get over as quick as possible.   Eagles, they are nice when they come along and I just holed a really long putt, really good putt and carried it on towards the finish, another one on 18.     
   
 Q.   Seems to be your game must be coming to you, 67 today?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, definitely.   I think I kept it in play a lot more today, and the holes I struggled on yesterday, I actually put a score together today.   So that was a big difference.   
Played the par5s in 4‑under and that's a massive difference to 1‑over which I played them yesterday.   It's not that big a difference, just playing the par 5s better and keeping the odd shot in play more and holed a couple of long putts.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel as if that's the turning point in this tournament?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I hope so.   You never know.   You never know what you're going to wake up with, do you, but to put a round like that together, it's one of the best rounds of the week so far, so it's nice.   5‑under around here is a good score.   
So if I can put a couple of them together, I'll be very happy by the end of the week.   Just see what we can do and keep going.
