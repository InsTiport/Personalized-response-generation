 Q.   Excellent round of golf, eagle at 18, a little bit of good fortune, wasn't there?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It was the worst shot I hit all day, actually, the second shot, just a snipe straight into somebody's brake fast I thought it was.   Hit the ball came back on the green and made the most of a good putt.   You have to have a bit of luck sometimes to know how well you played, but it was very good today, very good after yesterday, and got myself back in the tournament.   So couldn't have gone much better.  
   
 Q.   Yesterday as you say, 73, only one birdie in the round, what was the difference in your play today?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, yesterday, I had a combination, I really struggled off the tee.   Didn't hit many fairways.   When you don't hit many fairways around here, it's not a recipe for success and any time did I get on the green, I just couldn't get a putt in the hole.   Bad drive and a poor putt in.   I scrapped it around at 73, which was‑‑ it was good.  
It was a hard day to stay patient yesterday and on days like this, just have to keep yourself in it, stay positive and just came out today and played great.   Once I had my first birdie, in God knows how many holes on 15, I just sort of‑‑ I didn't miss a fairway, didn't really miss an iron shot into the greens and holed a few putts and all in all, 7‑under on a course where I don't think I've ever shot under par before was really good.  
   
 Q.   You were out there with captain Paul McGinley and ThorbjÃ¸rn, dressed in the same thing, Paul had some confusion, didn't he?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   He kept saying good shot but he never knew which one it was.   He kept throwing a name out there and we're like no, no, Paul, it was the other one.   No, we dressed the same yesterday and today, we couldn't believe it.   One of them things.   Nike need a few more clothes maybe.   It was just strange, those things happen, don't they.   It was fun and nice to have a bit of fun out there and get the captain a bit confused.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts on shooting 65 around here on what is a difficult track?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It's a very tough course.   I couldn't have hit it any better off the tee.   I missed the first fairway, the 10th and from there on in, I was brilliant.   Put myself in position the whole time.   Hit good shots in.   
Holed my fair share of putts even though I did miss a couple and you walk off thinking, that could have been one really low one today but just to get myself back in the hunt, it's a tough golf course and to be honest it's not a golf course that I've had much success on and I've obviously missed two cuts there and haven't really shot under par.   
To get a score going to, play nice and show myself I can do it around a course that I struggle on just shows me that I'm getting better and it shows me I can do it and it's great to be going forward into the weekend.   
   
 Q.   You finished each half in something of style, as well, didn't you.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, like I say, 18, it was a bit of luck.   It was the worst shot I hit all day.   Hit the ball, comes back in, on to the green and holed the putt.   One of them you kind of cringe at, you don't really want to smile but you have to and obviously finished well at 9.   Good to finish both nines, finish your round with a birdie and like I say, just looking forward to tomorrow now.   
   
 Q.   Was it a matter of adapting after Durban, as well, the heroics there, a bit quiet on the first day?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I just struggled.   To be honest I played the Pro‑Am absolutely brilliant.   I made six or seven birdies in the Pro‑Am and I warmed up really good yesterday and then just got out on to the course and after the first three, I just struggled.   
I couldn't really get it in play off the tee and didn't putt very well and it was all a bit of a struggle, all a bit frustrating.   I managed to stay quite positive.   I came off feeling like I could play well, and I think that's helped me really.   You've got to have the right mind‑set going out there or the course is just going to tear you apart.   If you get beaten there, it's going to be awful so you just have to go out there and attack it a bit and commit to your shots.   
Like I say, I played really well today.   I was just a different golfer, especially off the tee and on the greens.   I mean, 65 around there is absolutely brilliant.  
   
 Q.   Got to ask about the clothing because you and ThorbjÃ¸rn have appeared in the same outfit two days, no consultation?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Just one of those funny things that happened.   Obviously confused the captain which was a lot of fun.   No, I mean, I don't know what to say really.   He turned up this morning and I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.   But that's just the way it is.   If we did four days in a row, would be a good effort wouldn't it.   
   
 Q.   Impressed the captain, as well?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   He's a lot of help when you play with him.   He's always very helpful, he's got a lot of experience whether he's The Ryder Cup captain or whatever, he's a good guy and he's been great with me the tee times I've played with him.   I'm grateful for that and the information he gives you, and anything you can learn off these guys it's absolutely great.
