 Q.  A round of 67 today.  How are you feeling or are you finding your groove after last week?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I didn't play that well today really.  I scored well.  But 5-under on Carnoustie, it's nothing to be sniffed at.  I had a target at the start of the day, I thought if I could get to 6, and I've got St. Andrews to play twice, really, kind of my favourite course coming in, so it's down to me really after that.   
I felt absolutely fine this week.  Could have shot a couple better, but it's pretty good.   
 Q.  Is that mental or physical, do you think you're struggling with?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I just didn't swing it great today.  To be honest yesterday, I was swinging it great till yesterday and the wind, it always plays up with your swing a little bit.  Couldn't quite get it right today.  But hopefully I'll be okay tomorrow.   
Physically, mentally, I feel absolutely fine and ready to go.   
 Q.  A decent score around this course.  How is it being back since The Open?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's weird.  Still, same shots that cost me The Open, cost me today.  My sixth tee shot, can't hit it left on 12.  I just kept hitting the same shots.   
But it's so different, like looking at the par 3s with no grandstands around them.  18 is a little bit of an anti-climax after playing in The Open, I'll give it that.
