TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Kind of gave a few shots away.  Struggled on the greens with the wind.  Found it really difficult to judge break and wind.  Sort of gifted shots on 15 and then the first, nice to be over through ten holes, and did well.  I got it all back in a nice way to finish on 9.
Nice to kind of beat the golf course in tough conditions.  Felt like I was hitting it well.  It's always tough to judge when it's so windy, but felt like I was doing a lot of good things, and just nice to kind of get a bit of a score going at the end.
Q. The change of the nines, was it just getting used to the wind?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Once I got past the first, I didn't really give any shots away.  Played well on that back side.  It was just kind of, I made a mess of 11 with a wedge into the green.  Made bogey there.
12, I hit a great shot in that just caught the bunker to get up-and-down.
14, had a good chance at birdie.  Should have got up-and-down.  I was doing good things, but wasn't really happened, and 3-putted the first, and not very far.  Then things just, you know, got better.  Hit some decent shots.  Holed a couple of really good putts on 2 and 4.  Holed nice putts, and then a couple of nice little shorter ones for saves.  Just all around, did a good job of playing golf, really.
Q. You have more elevation here than the other two courses.  Does it make it harder in these conditions?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think so.  I mean, I don't know what the others have played like.  St. Andrews, you go out with one wind and you come back with another.  Carnoustie is probably not the nicest place to be in gale force winds.
Here, everything is so open.  A lot of the greens are raised.  So you have that to deal with.  I do feel like this is a really tough challenge, and if you get Kingsbarns on a lovely, calm day, it's like such a lovely place to play because you really can get a score and you have such good friends.
Today was a grind, really.
Q. Looking forward to Carnoustie tomorrow?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Definitely.  Like I say, it's nice to get that start and beat the golf course.  It's kind of a little goal I had in mind.  It was always going to be tough, even at 3 over, I thought it's still a chance if you hit good shots.  Just see what the weather brings, really, but two courses that I like.  I love playing them, and hopefully -- the wind can do funny things to your swing.  But I've been swinging well and hopefully tomorrow I can go out and make some birdies and continue on the momentum, really.
