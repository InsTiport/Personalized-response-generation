 Q.   Decent?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Glad I got finished.   I played really well.   I think today the ball just wouldn't go in the hole.   I know I got it to 3‑under but nothing was going in and it just carried on that way.   It was a sad finish after having that delay and coming back out.   I just got fooled by the wind a couple of times, which is very easy to do.  
So I think it's going to be tougher for the guys in the afternoon but overall it's been very good to put myself up there again.  
   
 Q.   A long old week for you with plenty of disruption and plenty of different conditions to deal with.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, there's been plenty of disruptions so far, nice bus journey to deal with, but it's okay.   You've just got to get on with it.   It's the same for everybody and I think every time The European Tour comes to Asia, there's delays everywhere.   But it's been fine.   
Obviously a half four alarm wasn't too nice this morning, but apart from that, it's a great course and it's nice to be here.  
   
 Q.   A great course and a nice challenge?   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It's a really good challenge, especially today now with the wind.   But it's just really nice to play.   There's a lot of elevated tees where you can look down at the fairways.   It's really nice.   There's so much variety on it, and it's just a good test.   
   
 Q.   Form‑wise, I know you've touched on this but this is a continuation of what we've seen recently.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, it's getting there.   I've hit the ball great these last two days, and as I say, if I can just get some putts to drop, then got a good chance over the weekend.   
But it's just a case of making it happen, and I'm trying and working hard and just trying to keep improving as the weeks go by.   
   
 Q.   And that's down to you, not down to the greens.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I don't know, I'll blame it on something else, I'm sure, but it probably is down to me.
