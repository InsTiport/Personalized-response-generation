Q. Your second Rolex Series Event win and carries a first prize of $2.5 million. Can you try to sum it up?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I mean, the money's not that important. Obviously I guess being a golfer these days, you have a chance at a young age to set your family up for life.
Q. It's been 22 months since your last win, I know how much you've wanted it.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'm just very proud of that, really, and everybody that goes on the journey with you constantly. It's just really, really cool when you win a tournament, it really is. And 18, you hit a great shot, and you stand over those putts, you never know what's going to happen. You just have to stand up and hit them.
Q. You started the day six shots behind, an incredible round you played, three eagles, four birdies, one came off a bounce back off a sprinkler head. What were you thinking as it unfolded in the playoff?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I was getting more and more nervous. I think after yesterday, played all right yesterday and I came in and there was a stretch in the middle like 11, 12, 13, I had a good birdie chance on 11, missed a short one on 12 for par. 13, hit two perfect shots and went over the back, and kind of come off and you're disappointed, but I looked at that, two shots better on a tough day, it feels completely different.
We went and putted last night at a quarter to six, went away, come back, putted before dinner. You know, today, I actually made a great up-and-down on 1 and I made a great up-and-down on 3 without those, the day would be completely different.
The eagles, got a bit of luck. I didn't realise we had that bit of luck on 15. Felt like I hit a great putt on 16 that just missed and 17 and 18 I was proud of how I played those holes, when you're leading and they are tough holes. It's weird looking back, kind of tournament, but it's all said and done now and happy days, really.
Q. This victory sends you shooting up The Race to Dubai into a position where you can win The Race to Dubai again. How excited to have that chance again next week?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, like I say, it's an absolute privilege to get to the last event with a chance of winning The Race to Dubai. It's an amazing thing to have in your career and it's one of the things I'm most proud of. It's ages away now. We've got this and tonight to deal with, and I'll start thinking about next week at a later date, but all the same things apply.
Just the closer it gets to the end of the season, the harder it is to stay in the present, do your things and concentrate on what you do best. Happy for the challenge. I feel like I'm very ready. I might go out next week and play terrible, but that's golf and it's experience that will live with me forever.
