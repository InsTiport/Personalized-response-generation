Q. You're 29 years old today, one more than that number to the turn, 63 to close. Tell us about it.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It was good, really good. Felt like the whole week, really, gradually got better. Felt like I struggled on Thursday. Had a really about practice session and played really good Friday when it was really tough conditions. Felt like I played so good yesterday and hit a couple of ropey drives and missed a couple of putts and 5-under was really the worst the could have been and then today just got out and played great, really.
It's weird, a little disappointed on the last, just got the tee shot way, and even then, the last, the wedge, can't seem to get it right all these years. But you couldn't really complain about 63, final day.
Q. You know how the final few holes are playing. Is 17-under going to be a little shy?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I don't want to call it, you never know, but I'm pretty sure. I think Lee obviously looks like he's playing really, really good, and with sort of -- yeah, the way the last four holes played, I think 15 is a nice wind for that pin and it's always a pretty flat green, and 16, 17, 18, you're hitting tee shots downwind. Looks like Lee is playing great. I'm happy to have put a weekend's golf in and it's a nice start to the year.
Q. Incredible 63 in your final round. You must have felt disheartened that every time you're making tremendous strides through the field, Lee is making birdies matching yours?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think you just concentrate on what you're doing and every time, every week we play, somebody is going to play great golf and at the moment that's Lee. I'm very, very happy with my weekend, felt like I played some really good golf.
At the end of the day, golf is very, very difficult and there's so many top, top players now, I think this week shows the standard when the cut was nearly 2-under and it felt so difficult, and then you always look at the winning score. The winning score is better than what you think it is and to have another good result in these events is great. Just happy with my own performance, and if Lee goes on to do it, then fair play to him.
Q. Is there one part of your game you're most satisfied about coming back, new tournament, new season?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think the week's been satisfying in a way that I struggled on Thursday, and I think after -- I've been practicing really well, and Thursday, got out there, didn't play as well as I wanted to. I said after the round, I think it was good in a sense that the tendencies showed up, I can work on them, come back the next day and try again. As the week progressed, my prep's been good and my iron play has been brilliant, especially over the weekend, I feel like it's been as sharp as it has been for the last year and years gone by.
Putted well over the weekend. So the game is progressing. My short game this week, I didn't make many bogeys; that's something to be happy with. It's always the first week of the year, and you never quite know what's going to turn up, so happy that I performed, happy with how I feel and it was nice getting the juices flowing really, on the last, knowing that I could post a score.
