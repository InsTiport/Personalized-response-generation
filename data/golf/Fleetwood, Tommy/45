Q. Solid start, slight hiccup on 15 with a birdie on the last.  Tell us about your round.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Thanks for reminding me.  It was a good start.
Yeah, I played pretty solid.  I played consistent.  I hit a lot of really solid shots, which was nice, because I felt like I had a really nice warm-up, but I practiced really well yesterday afternoon and I didn't play well in the Pro-Am.
Overall we had such good conditions.  It wasn't that easy to make birdies, but I felt, like you say, apart from one hole, I felt like I was really sort of clinical out there and doing a lot of good stuff.  Basically made the most of my chances, and did so much good stuff.  Just one hole was a little hiccup but apart from that it was really good.
Q. You looked quite relaxed out there.  Are you enjoying your experience here at Lahinch?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's nice to be back.  It's nice to be playing in Europe again.  Nice to be on links courses again.  Lovely weather.  Yeah, I was, I was enjoying it.  I was enjoying hitting it pretty well.  I was enjoying playing that new style of golf.
One of my little targets for today was to make sure you really are conscious of how the course is playing, because we know there's a links season coming up and there's a big event at the end of the month.  So I was conscious of that, just making sure that I'm learning from every shot and taking it all in.  You know, might have messed one up, but overall, first day, I have a really good sense of what's to come.
Q. The crowds were behind you out there.  Describe that experience, especially on the first day?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The crowds are great.  I think it helps playing with, you know, one of the kings of Ireland.  But they were lovely, lovely atmosphere, and they are always great crowds to play in front of, the Irish.  They are a very individual bunch, aren't they.  They are a very unique bunch and that's what we love about it.  Yeah, pleasure.  I hope I'm on TV the rest of the weekend and I get a lot more support.
Q. What do you take into tomorrow?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Just the same stuff.  I'll stay on the same routine I've been on.  I'll work this afternoon on my pitching and chipping again.  Links golf, different turf, different reactions.  Just keep doing the same things and hopefully I can build on this.
Q. PÃ¡draig Harrington spoke yesterday about the unique aspect of this golf course.  How did you find it today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It is unique.  I think the main -- there's a lot of blind shot but I think it's really tough to hit fairways.  I hit it great off the tee but I was in the semi-rough so often.  Lovely golf course.  Different test.
I really made sure that I enjoyed it, because you're going to get good bounces and you're going to get bad breaks, as well.  You just have to accept whatever comes to you and try to hit good shots and move on from there.  For the most part, enjoyed it and did a really good job.
Q. How much of this week is about this week itself and how much is on Portrush in two weeks' time?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, look, The Irish Open is something we would all love to have on our resumÃ© for so many reasons.  Rolex Series Event, massive ranking points for The European Tour, which I haven't played on much this year, but overall a quite historic event, as well.
Of course, playing here I think is perfect prep for The Open.  Very, very similar.  I always feel like Irish links has its own sort of -- it brings its own piece to the game a little bit, and you have to be playing those courses to get the best prep, so I think it is perfect for The Open.  Of course, everybody that's in it is going to have one eye on that tournament, but for now, let's concentrate on this.
