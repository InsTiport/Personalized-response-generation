Q. 10-under par, you must be thrilled with that two-round total.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, very good.  Played well both days, really.  Got off to a dodgy start yesterday with a bogey on the 10th, but apart from that, I played lovely.  Didn't really do much wrong.  Just picked away at it today.  Yeah, very happy.
Q. How much did you rest?  How much did you work during the little bit of short off-season?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I didn't do much.  I played golf with my dad on Christmas Day, and he quit after nine holes.  That was supposed to be 18 and he quit.
Q. Is that like a true Fleetwood?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No.  He said, it looked like it was going to rain; it looked like this (laughing).  And I played another round of golf.  So I didn't do a lot.
And then come out here a few days before and practiced in Dubai.  But yeah, it's felt good, really.  It's felt good in practice.  It's just nice.  You never really know how you're going to come out and play.  Even if you put two rounds together, it's always good.
Q. And did you feel at the end of last season, that actually it was where you wanted it and you knew how to pick it up?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, I didn't really want to stop.  As much as I was ready for a break, I didn't want to stop playing.  I was playing great and I wanted to carry on.  But you always need a rest.  I think, yeah, I did a lot of work the last six months of the year.
My swing was good, and I've picked up where I left off, kind of thing, when I started practicing again.  But it's been nice, really.  Seeing it where you want to go on the range is always good, but then you've still got to do it on the course.
Q. Ambition for the year?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, I want to get back in the Top-50 in the world as quick as I can, however long that takes.  That's where everybody wants to be, playing those kind of tournaments, the majors and the WGCs.  You know, it's just starting off in a different place than last year, really.
Last year I was really struggling and I struggled for a bit.  Got my game back and now it's sort of, get results.  I've played two good rounds of golf.  But we'll stick at this.  It's nice to start off two good rounds for the year.
Q. How pleased are you, being a European Tour player, about the Rolex Series coming up and all that can bring?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'll be pleased if I can play well.  No, it looks great, doesn't it.  Definitely gives you tournaments to aim for and hopefully it does the Tour good.  Hopefully we get the fields that we want.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing them, anyway.  Win a couple would be all right, wouldn't it.
