 Q.  What was the key?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Wasn't really any keys.  It was scrappy a lot of the time, I think.  I missed a couple of chances to sort of break away early on.  And then the more the round went on, Zach was more in control of the game.  I was hanging in there.  I had a really good putt on 14.  Then shame to finish the -- actually on the back nine it was really -- scrappy games are actually good at times and they are good to watch.  You constantly battling against yourself as well as the guy you're playing with.  It's just a shame that Zach missed that putt.  I was happy that my chip was zoned in.   
 Q.  Talk about the match play strategy.  It was really in play here at 18.  You went for it and he laid up?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I can get it close, at times you've got to take it on.  That wasn't the easiest chip up and over the ridge.  Like I say, the chip was probably the best shot I hit all day.  To see that go, that's very nice.   
 Q.  He had the advantage, you hit such a good shot.  Does this give you momentum heading into tomorrow?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, it's important, isn't it?  It always helps.  It's great to get off to a good start.  The last time I played in this, I actually lost my game and then qualified.  You've got to be winning your match and try to build momentum.  You take one match at a time, but to win the first one is great.
