Q. Tommy, a second round 66.  How would you assess your performance this morning?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Good.  I holed a few putts on the back nine, which is our front nine.  Game still wasn't quite where I wanted it to be.  Parred all three of the par 5s, which it's giving shots back, that.
But the important thing to do after yesterday where I played really poor and stuck in there was make sure I'm here at the weekend -- you see the 62s and 63s out there, and unless you're playing, you can't shoot them.  So just make sure I'm here for the weekend and I did.
I played better today.  I hit a lot more greens.  Holed a few putts.  Yesterday everything seemed to hit the edge.  Gave myself a few more chances.  Played a little bit better.  Still nothing special but 5-under is still a good score.
Don't matter how scorable a course is; if you don't hit it in position and you hit it bad, you're going to get caught out.  Didn't make a bogey today, which is always good.
Just a bit better, so hopefully as the days progress, I can keep improving.
Q. How much have you enjoyed the LAST two days playing one, two, three, Race to Dubai?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, regardless of position in The Race to Dubai, they are two of the best players in the world.  It's the company that you want to be in all the time.  If you want to be one of the best players, you have to play in that company.  I enjoyed it.  Two lovely guys.  Great golfers and everybody has a different style of play, which is probably nice to watch for the spectators.
Yeah, I had a really good time.  You have to concentrate on your own game.  Today was always going to be a bit of a grind knowing that I had to sort of try and work my way up the leaderboard, not giving myself much head way yesterday.  It was good.
