 Q.  Another impressive performance.  Some Ryder Cup debut for you so far.  What is the comfort factor and confidence, standing alongside this man so far this week?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: He's one of my best friends, not just on Tour but in life.  You know, he has a lot of experience.  He's an amazing golfer, but you know, on top of that -- I've been very, very lucky to get partnered with Fran.  We knew we wanted to play together.   
I mean, yeah, we gel great, and he's -- like I say, I could give him all the compliments in the world, but we played very well.  Today we were solid, and just started riding that wave again on the back nine when Fran started playing great, and I just kind of stood by his side and tried to hit decent golf shots and stay in the hole and let him go free.  Just a great morning.   
 Q.  For you, how important for the European side to go out there, to push on, to keep that momentum from that brilliant session yesterday, this morning?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was massive.  Like we said yesterday afternoon, we knew they were going to be upset and we tried to get ready for it.  We were ready this morning.  I think any time we had to step it up today, we did, either one of us.  We need to keep going.  There's still a long way, we keep saying the same stuff, but there's a lot of points to be won still.
