Q An eagle at the last for a round of 68.  Give us your overall reflection on your day?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, really happy.  Felt like after the first, didn't play all that bad.  It's pretty tough out there.  In the afternoon, the course kind of firms out and the rough around the greens, put together with firm greens, and again, pretty quick, makes it pretty hard.
So I think I played really well.  The irons were good again.  So felt like I was in control for a lot of the day.  Managed to get it going a little bit when you had to stay really patient early doors.  I think, you know, pars are pretty good out there, really, and then if you can just pick shots up, that's the best way to do it.
But started getting it going a little bit and then it became a little bit more frustrating.  Yeah, eagle on the last, makes that right.
Q How are you approaching the course tactically?  Some guys are saying get it in the fairway because the rough's quite nasty, and other guys are saying, no, need to be aggressive and get the ball down there a long way.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I guess you take it hole-by-hole on what you feel comfy with and whatnot.  The shots I've hit off the tees haven't really changed since I've been playing here, especially the last few years.  Wind changes it a little bit in how you want to feel.
I think, yeah, it's a tricky one, really, because being in the fairway you think is key to control the ball and then the closer you get, obviously you're hitting a shorter club.  I preferably, I think I've always preferred playing from the fairway than the rough so I tried to continue to do that.
I didn't hit a fairway today until the 10th hole and then didn't miss one for the rest of the round.  I think it's probably the sign of a great golf course that people have different opinions and how you can play it and stuff and hit different shots off different tees.  I like that about the course.  It gives you options.
