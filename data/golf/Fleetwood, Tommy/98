Q. Lowest nine-hole score in your PGA TOUR career, including that eagle-birdie-birdie-eagle stretch.  What allowed you to get so hot last night?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'm not sure.  I think the break helped.  I was finding it pretty tricky when we first went out.  The wind was up and I wasn't hitting it great, and then when the storm came in, I had like a 10-, 11-footer for par waiting, holed that one and then just hit it really well when it was calm.  Kind of didn't want to stop last night, so I had to come back out, but just one of them streaks that, again, you get on that you don't expect.  You're not really waiting for them to happen.  So it was just a good one to have.
Q. Today when you birdied 18, how important was it to get some of that momentum back heading into the second round?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I think so.  I think it was a good birdie, and then I didn't get my tee shot away, so I had to do it another way.  I would have liked four eagles, but yeah, it was really nice because I had a tough two-putt left on 17, as well.  Hit a really good pace but it really dove, had a tap-in, and then birdie on 18.  So it'll be nice to just sit down now and then regroup for the next round.
