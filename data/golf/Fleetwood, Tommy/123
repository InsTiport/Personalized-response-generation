 Q.  69 to finish, how do you feel?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I feel fine.  Disappointed to come up short.  Had that little patch.  But for the most part, hit it all right and I really enjoyed it.  Great coming down the stretch here.   
 Q.  You had it going, missed two tough greens there on the back nine.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I under-read that one.  They are putts that late in the day, the greens are getting crispy, you're never going to hit them with a lot of pace.  It was a poor first putt after not a bad second shot on 14.  Then just under-read the second one.   
And then 15, nice bunker shot, hit a good putt and it just hung left on me.  It was always going to be an uphill battle from there.  It was nice to have a bunker shot to maybe get into a playoff on last.  But playing down the stretch there with a lot of the fans behind me but it's the ultimate test of your game.  I really enjoyed it today.   
 Q.  We're getting to know you over here in the States and we love your game.  You have to be very happy, great start to the year.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Very happy.  I had a great year last year, and then it was just important that we kept on improving, kept on going this year, and it's been great.  Great start.   
I would have loved to have won this year, and whilst I had a chance, you've got to try to win those ones, but great stuff.  I'm enjoying coming over here and testing my game and hopefully more to come.   
 Q.  See you in MÃ©xico City?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: You will.  You will.
