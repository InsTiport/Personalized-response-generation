 Q.  Last week's final round in Turkey was quite important because it got you a few valuable ranking points.  Obviously with just I object winning, you managed to keep your nose in front but it looks like it's going to be a close end to the season?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, closer than it looked.  I mean, yeah, hat's off to Rosey for the way he's played the last couple of weeks.   
Again, yeah, it's made it an interesting finish.  But I could make it a lot more boring this week if I have a good week.  You know, it's still kind of in my hands.  Still got to just keep doing what I'm doing, concentrate on what I'm doing.   
Yeah, I played nice last week.  Struggled a little bit to hole putts.  Didn't hole enough putts.  I went the last two rounds without a bogey but I didn't convert many of my birdie chances.   
On to this week on a tough golf course now.  But yeah, it's all good.   
 Q.  You must be quite glad he's not playing this week.  He had that dilemma of course, does he play, does he not; but you could almost close it out this week and make it a boring end to the season.  Is that the mind-set you're going into this week with?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I'd like to win the tournament.  Yeah, it's at that stage where every shot counts.  I would like to start the tournaments off a bit quicker.  The last couple tournaments I've sort of played okay on Thursdays and just not scored very well and then you're sort of behind the 8-ball, so I would like to get off to a good start.  If you don't keep going and keep your head down -- yeah, I would love to win.  Aside from everything that's going on, it's one of them tournaments you'd like to win, isn't it.  I would like to have my name on that path walking up the ninth.  Yeah, there's a lot to play for.   
 Q.  How do you feel this course suits your game this week?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It does in general.  It's tough.  You're not going to get away with shots off-line this week.  You really have to think about where you're putting the ball, even into the greens.   
I think with the wind swirling, there's a lot of patience involved.  There's a lot of just kind of knowing where you can hit it and where you can't.  It's definitely a patience game out here.  Doesn't matter how well you play.  If the wind is up, it's going to swirl and you're going to get some bad breaks.  Feel like I'm good at that.  Feel like if I play my game and I hit it well, it should in general suit me.  But you've still got to play well and hit good golf shots.  But I love the course, I really do.
