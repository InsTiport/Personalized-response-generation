Q.   I take it everything was all right in that round today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, I played good, really.   Started off with two nice long putts and didn't make a bogey.   When you don't drop shots, every birdie is moving forward and that's what you seem to have to do in this tournament, it's pretty low scoring.

Q.   And indeed the birdie at the last, moved into a lovely position?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Nice way to finish.   That whole back nine really into the wind, you have to grind it out.   To shoot a couple under from 12 is really good golf and the last hole is a nice way to finish.

Q.   Sublime playing conditions, easy for scoring in a sense; got a bit tougher?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, it was flat calm when we started out really and the wind kind of picked up around the fifth.   But going out, you're always downwind and off the right, which is fine, you can just let it rip and fly it down there and have a little pitch in. 
But then you turn into it and it's obviously a lot harder.   13 is a great example.   Practise I hit 3‑wood, 9‑iron and today it was driver, 4‑iron out of my boots.   When you turn back into that wind, it's pretty hard. 
Anything around 4‑ or 5‑under was a really good score I thought.   Probably the best way to do it was tee off on the back nine, get it flat calm as much as you could and the front nine would be downwind, that would be ideal, but I'm not complaining. 
Today it was fine.   As long as you play well, it's not great for your putting stats a lot of the time with the greens but it's just good fun.   It's one of a kind, isn't it, and it's always fun to play.

Q.   Is this the ideal preparation for this week, knowing that you've got to score over this course before you get tougher things to come perhaps. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, you have to play, whichever course it is at any stage, so you can't‑‑ I think looking at the leaderboard is probably the worst thing you can do, because you just don't know what anybody else is doing.   Just play the three courses, see what you get and hopefully you're in a good position come Sunday and you can go out there. 

Q.   The Pro‑Am format, is it something you've enjoyed?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I've got a really good partner and that's been a lot of fun.   I've actually had good partners the last three years.   I enjoy it.   It's a bit different, and yeah, like you say, getting on so make the most of it.
