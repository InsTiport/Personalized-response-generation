Q.   Just didn't look like it was agreeing all the way as you planned. 
    TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   No, I played terrible really for 12 holes.   I basically avoided a disaster on the first day the last few holes, and that's the only saving grace of the day.   I played well coming in, and that was it.   But it's not a million miles away off the leaderboard.   3‑over, at least I'm sort of one good round away from being in contention again.   If I can shoot 4‑ or 5‑under tomorrow and I'm back not too far away, whereas if I would have finished 5, 6, 7, it wouldn't have been great.

Q.   What was going on those few holes?
    TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Just everything I did was terrible, was wrong.   It was going okay, and then I obviously hit a terrible drive on 16 like trying to get it down by the green and made double there, and then sort of was just falling apart as I was playing really.   I couldn't do anything right.   No matter what shot I tried to hit, it was nowhere near what I wanted to do.   Sometimes you get days like that.   Luckily, like I say, I managed to make three birdies in the last five or six, and 3‑over is sort of still okay.
