Q.   Took you 18 holes, 22 holes and 19 holes to win previously.   You said to me yesterday I hope I can get it done sooner and you have.   How does it feel?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It feels great.   The further it got down the stretch, the weaker my foot start getting and I was just trying to grind it out and stay ahead.   Really good putt on 17 there.   You just expect the worst, don't you.   Luckily another round, we're through.

Q.   Talk about the pressures in this event compared to contention in stroke play. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It's kind of strange.   Actually, it's very similar to stroke play as if you are just leading the tournament with the two of you coming down the stretch.   You just kind of do whatever you can to stay ahead.   Strange thing is you can have a 15â€‘footer but can't have a go at it because they've got five foot for par.   You just try and stick to your own game, stick to what you do and then try and close it at as quick as you can if you are ahead.

Q.   A relative unknown over here in America.   When you come to this championship, do you think I might surprise a few people, I'm playing well?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Not after the first round, no.   I played well that first week in China and then struggled on the second day in the second week. 
I've been doing some good work on my swing and playing well.   With match play, you just never know.   It just goes on whatever kind of opponent you get on the day and however they play and however you play.   It's just one of those things.   So you can get surprises and you don't know what's going to happen.   We're here late on Saturday anyway.

Q.   Comment on your match this afternoon. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   We could have stayed at home, couldn't we, to play an all England quarterfinal.   It'll be good.   He's playing some great golf and I look forward to playing him.
