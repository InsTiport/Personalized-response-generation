 Q.  Tommy, how frustrated or pleased are you?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Neither.  I'm not frustrated with how I hit it.  I didn't play very good, but still I was 1-under with three to play and just played 16 and 17 poorly.  I could have done more on the last after a good tee shot.  I just didn't hit it very well.  I've got a bit of work to do on the range.  Overall, it's not disastrous.  It's funny how much better level par feels than 1-over, but I'm like a good start away tomorrow from being back in it.   
 Q.  How was it playing?  There was lots of talk before about whether to be conservative or whether to be aggressive?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I still just think the tee shots are the one.  From whenever we played it at the Dunhill, it just seems like so much more is in play.  Any bunker seems to be in play almost because you're just not sure how it's going to react on the fairways.   
Once you get on the greens, if you put it in position off the tee, then you have a chance.  You have a chance to score.  I know the pins are tucked away a little bit today, but still you have a chance just off the tee where you've got to really be on it.   
 Q.  You hold the course record here, Tommy.  Do you think it's under threat this week when you look at these conditions?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Depends on pin positions.  I think today they kept it safe.  We'll see.  It has to be very benign.  I think today was such a good day for scoring.  2-under is top ten.  I think that sends a lot about the challenge of the course that they can do it just with it being -- they've had absolutely perfect weather for most of the day, and they still kept the scoring down.  So it's a good indication they can keep the course as tough as they want.   
 Q.  What's the plan for tonight, Tommy, going into tomorrow?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'm going to hit balls, and then I'll just eat and go to bed early really.  A nice early start.  Hopefully, we get the best of the conditions tomorrow, and I'll find something on the range now or just find something before tomorrow starts.  If you can hit it well, hopefully, there's a score out there.  So I'll be there tomorrow.   
 Q.  Always in the mix, Tommy.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Thank you.
