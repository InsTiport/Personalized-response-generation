Q.   Held it together nicely?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   I played good.   Well, it was tough just watching Steve just birdie everything and then obviously I didn't get off to a fast start, but other than that, you struggle after that, especially when he was going low. 
Again, my only dropped shot was the 6th where I got a bit unlucky.   The rough is thick and a couple of feet further the ball wouldn't have plugged and I would have been on the green and you never know. 
My long game is absolutely brilliant and a few putts could have dropped from ten or 15 feet that didn't, but other than that, I played great.

Q.   Is it tough to concentrate on your own game when somebody is shooting that low alongside? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, but you just have to do it.   You've got no choice.   If you don't, then you're going to go backwards.   You've just got to really get on with your own game and try to do the best you can, and I did that really well today.   Steve, fair play to him, it was great to watch and I probably learned a lot from it.   But I have to deal with my own job. 

Q.   What have you learned? 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, you have to make putts.   But it was just great.   That's how you shoot a low score.   I've shot a couple of times maybe back in the day, but it was really good, it was good to watch.   I'm sure when I look back and sit down and think about his round, I'll pick up a few tips. 

Q.   I imagine that you are watching him a fair bit, particularly at the last?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Yeah, especially when it's only a two ball.   Obviously you watch each other and on the last, as soon as he hit that bunker shot and landed, I said to my caddie, that's going in.   You just knew the way the day had gone.   Well, unbelievable shot. 

Q.   Your thoughts going into the final round given your position?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, still not out of it.   You never know what can happen.   Like I say, you just have to go and deal with your own job, get the most out of what you can and if I hit it like I did today, I'm sure I'll put a decent number in.
