 Q.  How were conditions today?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Wind came out of a different direction and a few holes played longer than what they have been.  Just I had a lot of putts that hit the edge really, but 70 is a good score.  I'm two behind when I started and one behind now, so better.   
 Q.  Highlights today?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: The par on 14 was big, because I got unlucky off the tee, really.  Generally bunkers are so fair, you can hit them and they can either bounce out, or they are not that penal, anyway.  So you can hit a shot out of them.  I stubbed it in the face and couldn't get it more than five yards, and I made par in the end.  That kind of kept things going.   
It's so bunched, you don't really want to give shots away.  But it really is bunched.  Every shot you pick up is massive and every shot you lose seems doubly worse.  It's very tight but just got to hang in.   
 Q.  With 16 players within three shots of the lead, thoughts on the chance that lies ahead tomorrow?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I'd rather it be three players within three shots, but it will be good.  Like I say, I've never actually done that great here.  So it's great to be up there.   
Course has been playing fair.  That said, there's a lot of players with a chance.   Can't really focus on that too much.  Just play your golf, really.  If you let it get to you and you start thinking about what everybody else is doing, it will drive you mental.  So just keep going.
