 Q.  Tommy, did you not know it was supposed to be hard to chase, come back after a low round?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No.  Well, I've struggled plenty of times before so it's nice to have to follow with another good one.  I'll try and do it again tomorrow.   
 Q.  What was the difference, what enabled you to --  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Obviously I hit it great for two days.  I drove it really well on Thursday and just didn't -- I didn't put the rest of the game together.   
For me, putting myself in position, my wedges were poor and my irons and so I didn't hole any putts.  I kept driving it the same the last few days and my irons have gotten a little bit better.  Missed maybe one green over two days.  I've been really solid there.   
So far just coming down the stretch like the par 3, 14, 15, long iron, 17 -- I actually -- when you start feeling confident with the long irons, your game is coming together.  Been a good two days.   
 Q.  Put yourself in position like this a lot this year.  What do you feel like it's going to take for you to get over the hump and possibly hold a trophy tomorrow?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I keep doing the same thing.  Especially recently I shot some good rounds and then just it's not quite happened and I either played poor or whatever.  It just happens sometimes.  That's just the way it is.  Winning is not supposed to be easy and it's my first year on the PGA TOUR, still different winning, I know, and slightly different environment and something that you kind of -- you have to accept a little bit.   
It's easy to get frustrated when you're out of position all the time and not getting the results that you want or you're getting that win that you feel like you're playing well enough to get.   
For me, just the same things as we're doing and whether it comes this week or in two weeks or it comes next year, as long as I'm still progressing and I feel like I'm doing the right things.   
 Q.  Was there a thought in your mind at all like this could be a good final round?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: No, not really.  I know there's all kinds of things going on.  Honestly, I really want to go home, I want to go home.  I'll be honest.  I'll be hoping the weather holds up for us and we can go home because I'm well overdue getting to my house.  My wife's birthday party is next week.   
 Q.  When was last time you felt this locked in, everything you hit like that?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: You get rounds like that now and again.  Doing it for two rounds straight is good.  I have to do a lot of practice this week when I felt like I struggled over the weekend at Boston and it's one thing doing the practice but you got to commit on the course, which is actually quite hard to do and for three days, even Thursday I was doing that, just wasn't going very well and you've got to -- now I'm up there in position, I got to keep the thoughts and keep doing the same things.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I hope not.  It is what it is.  We'll see what happens and you deal with it and that's it.  Whenever it is, we'll be playing another round of golf.  We'll see.
