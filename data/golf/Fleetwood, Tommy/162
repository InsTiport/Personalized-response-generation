Q. How was that?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I played well all day.  It's easy on a golf course where you know the scoring is going to be pretty low.  When you know there's chances out there, it's easy -- but when it doesn't quite happen or you don't quite make the birdies, it's easy to lose patience or try and force it a little bit, and can you can't do that.  As long as you hit it, the birdies should come.
Definitely after 9 when I had a good chance, I made birdies on 10,11, 12, and a couple there on 17, 18 there, they just came in bundles for me there.  Yeah, 5-under is a great start.
Q. You were talking Tuesday about the jet-lag.  Has that worn off yet?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Actually not too bad.  I slept great on Tuesday night.  Tuesday night I slept great.  Monday night was a shocker and last night was all right.  I felt fine.  Felt fine all day today.  Energy levels were good.  I enjoyed it out there.
Q. What are the positives in the game and key points in the game today?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I had good control of my ball.  My misses weren't very big misses at all.  You know, I putted well.  The greens weren't easy this afternoon, and especially when they are firming up, so they are crisping up a little bit later on in the day with all this sun and heat.  Some are firm and some are soft.  I think I recovered well after 13.  Just a little lack of concentration or whatever you put it down to.
But 14, I made a really good par, after sort of a dodgy tee shot.  Not a bad swing but just pulled it a bit.  I finished strong.  Overall I felt very in control of my ball and my swing.  You know, 5-under is great start.
