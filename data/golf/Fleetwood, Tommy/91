 Q.  Tommy, the first European rookie ever to win four points in a row, the first four points you played for.  And you two have become historic in a way because you're the first European pairing to ever win four points out of four.  You've done something Seve and Ollie didn't do, something Faldo and Woosnam didn't do.  Describe the sense of achievement, Tommy.  
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: A little bit emotional right now.  We're only on Saturday.  We were really, really good this afternoon.  We played really solid, we played really well.  But yeah, about the piece of history together, it's very special.  And just glad that, you know, we've done our job for the team and we can watch the guys come in now and hopefully we can turn a couple of the matches around or get the point.  And team's doing really well at the moment.  But for us, we've had a great time.   
 Q.  Francesco, as you watch Rose and Stenson there, describe the adrenaline rush you get here compared to the one you got in winning The Open Championship.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Nowhere near.  Nowhere near.  It's been absolutely amazing.  But, you know, we came here -- like we said yesterday, we came here to do a job, and it wasn't to go in the records books or anything like that, it's about the team, it's about getting to 14 1/2.  We're getting closer, but those 4 1/2 points we're going to need tomorrow, we're going to have to fight hard for them.  You saw them today, you know, they're obviously 12 great players.  It's not going to be easy.  But we're doing it properly.  We're doing it the right way.
