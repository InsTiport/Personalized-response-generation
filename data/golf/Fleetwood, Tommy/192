 Q.  Your thoughts on being 10-under par after three lovely days here?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, great.  It's been three really good rounds, three really good ball-striking rounds.  Today I scrapped a little bit when I had to, especially when the weather got poor.  I'm in a perfect position to be in.   Q.  Remarkably different weather conditions across the week.  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Thursday there was a little bit of wind but not a lot and yesterday was so calm and got a little bit windy and calmed down again. And then today just kind of picked up for our last seven or eight holes.  Today has been the toughest day, easily, by far, especially when the holes are kind of playing really straightforward.  Winds are always across and you never quite know if it's into or down, just always across and you're always kind of holding shots off or going with the wind.  It's decisions all the time which are not easy to take.  Today was really good and I was just happy to get in there and 3-under is a good score.   Q.  All the more pleasing that you made the right decisions and the go the control in tricky conditions?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I think it helps when I'm hitting it well.  There was a few shots down the stretch that I didn't hit great.  The second shot into 16 I got away, and then the tee shot into 17, both tried to hold them up -- well, 17, I tried to hold up and 16 I tried to draw it. My short game was good towards the end.  I'm playing well and I've got a good caddie on the bag.  He makes the right decision most of the time.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow now.   Q.  You have had some misgivings at recent tournaments about some of your play.  Does this mean things have settled now and you're in a nice rhythm?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I had kind of a month where I wasn't swinging it great but the satisfying thing about that was that I got results.  I think I finished around 20th in Ireland, 11th in Germany and top 30 in the U.S. Open which is a great result when you are not quite on your game. Came here this week after some good work and I seem to be swinging it better.  Hopefully I can have one more day of swinging it like I have done and see where we can go.   Q.  Something about Scotland?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, there's something about it, yeah.  It's great, isn't it.  We with love coming here.  The family loves coming here.  Bring the dog every year.  We plan the year around the events in Scotland.   Q.  Makes it nice and relaxed?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Well, you'd think so, but you haven't been in our house yet.   Q.  "Yet"?  There's an invite?  TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I didn't think that through, did I.  You can come through if you want.  I'll always welcome you.
