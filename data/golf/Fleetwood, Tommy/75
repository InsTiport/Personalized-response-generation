Q. 68 today, how was that?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Good.  Got off to a bit of a slow start and then picked it up.  Yeah, felt like I did a lot of good things.  Always a shame to finish with a bogey, but it happens.  Didn't hit a very good first putt but overall there was plenty of good stuff and a nice start.
Q. Any key moments you can put your hand on?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Once I got my first birdie, it was nice to get something going.  Then got up-and-down on 18 and things just started rolling a little bit.  I just gained a little bit of momentum from there and kept it going.
Those first few holes on the front nine being downwind, they played so much different than if they were into the wind, and it was nice to have a couple of chances.
Q. Conditions a bit tougher in an unusual wind.
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, but I think -- well, the wind definitely helps you on the first few on the front nine.  Some of them holes, like 5 can play so long when it's into the wind or 4, the par 36.  They are downwind today so they played very different.
Nice to play it in a little bit of a different wind.  I think I almost preferred it as that wind.
Q. Overall, rest of the round, going forward for the week?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, always nice to get off to a good start.  Happy to start like that.  You can't win a tournament on day one, so just try and put yourself in position and build some momentum and today was a good day for it.
