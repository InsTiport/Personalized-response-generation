Q.   Hard fought match today, coming down to the third playoff hole.   Talk about your round. 
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It was just a really good match.   We both played really well.   I really didn't miss many shots and just gave that one away on 17, which was hard to take. 
And then Jamie didn't get up and down on 18.   It was nice to end with a birdie.   Just happy to get off the course now.

Q.   After so many playoff holes, what are you looking forward to tomorrow?   How do you keep your head in the game?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Just try and do the same as I did today.   I played great today.   It was really fun.   You always like being in good matches.   And just go out and play.   Unfortunately got to start again, start from scratch.   I look forward to it.
