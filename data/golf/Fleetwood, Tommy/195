 Q.   That's a terrific finish.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:     Hit a couple of dodgy shots but it's a tough course to score on really and you can see that by the scoring.   I played really good golf coming in, and 13 and 15 are two of the toughest holes on the course and managed to give myself putts for birdies.   Really strong finish and really good start.  
   
 Q.   Traditionally when the sun is shining and the weather is benevolent, you tend to fancy those chances.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Obviously the back nine, you have three par 5s.   To be fair, they are not the easiest.   I think even 12, it's a wide tee shot but then going into the green is tricky and 17 and 18 are tough holes and they are no gimmies for sure.   
You have to hit good golf shots all the way around the course because it's going to bite you.   It's just one of them that you can never take your eye off the ball.  
   
 Q.   You have to have your head in place and really concentrate pretty much throughout.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   It is, it's a tiring week with how busy it is and it's just one of them golf courses where you can never switch off.   It's a great challenge and luckily enough the wind wasn't too bad so far today because when it does get up, it swirls quite a lot.   Again, you have to make the most of your chances.  
   
 Q.   I know we touched on this in Spain, but there were so many good signs about your game.   
TOMMY FLEETWOOD:   Well, there are.   We are just waiting for it to happen.   I'm playing really well and I'm working on all the right things, and hopefully it's just a matter of time before a big result comes.   Definitely the form is coming back.   Today was more good times again so hopefully I can keep going.
