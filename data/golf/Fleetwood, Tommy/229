 Q. Leading the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, how does that feel?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Feels pretty good. Yeah, I mean, just to get the invite and everything, just the experience to play, and it's one of the tournaments that everyone wants to play, as well. Pretty unexpected to be honest. Just to be here is great. 

 Q. Played well today?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, didn't hit it very well yesterday. The wind probably helped me if anything. So once I got -- I holed good putts on the first three or four holes. And then just didn't really look back. Just my putting kept me going. I holed a couple of really nice pars and then the odd one for birdie. But overall I hit it really good. 

 Q. Has that victory in Kazakhstan given you a bit of confidence?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, I learn every time I play at the moment. The last three weeks I've had no pressure on me really. I know where I'm playing next year, which is great. It's definitely given me confidence, because there was a bit of a thought, can I win, because I had been out there so many times. 
 I finally got it done, so just see if I can do it on the bigger stage now. 

 Q. What do you think when you see names like Westwood, Kaymer, McIlroy, all those guys on the leaderboard?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: I thought Kaymer was lucky to be ahead of me at one stage (laughing).

 Q. Is it daunting? 
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It's pretty cruel, because I said to the guys, I've watched it on TV for years and I pretty much analyse everything they do, try to learn off them and obviously my name is in pretty good company right now. 
 So it's good to be up there. Hopefully I can shoot a decent score tomorrow and then play with somebody like Kaymer and Westwood. That would be really cool. 

 Q. Have you played any of these three courses before?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, St. Andrews, we always had the St. Andrews Links as an amateur and so I played that a bit and I played at GB&I in Short Boys here a few years back. Carnoustie is the only one I haven't played. Played a practise round.

 Q. That's tomorrow. 
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Tomorrow. The easy one. 

 Q. And what's your plans for the next few weeks? I suppose it depends on what happens this week?
 TOMMY FLEETWOOD: Yeah, at the moment, just take a week off next week, and then finish off the last two on The Challenge Tour. I'd like to try and finish top of The Challenge Tour if I can, but if I don't, top two or top three would be great. 
 Just I think I'm due a week off. It's been four pretty hard weeks the last four weeks. But like I say, I can relax -- I might not be too relaxed tomorrow now but it's nice to be able to play with not a lot of pressure on you.
