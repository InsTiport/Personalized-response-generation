 Q. David Eger, minus 4, seven birdies today. A couple bogeys, but seven birdies on this course is a good way to go. 
 DAVID EGER: I had lost count. I started out with two bogeys, so I had a lot to overcome. Fortunately, I hit the ball much better on the last 16 holes than I did the first two. 
 Made a couple putts. Made a couple good long putts, and just didn't make any other mistake on the back nine.

 Q. That's sort of the game of golf, isn't it? I mean, after the first two holes you were ready to... 
 DAVID EGER: Oh, you know, just what's wrong? I can't figure it out. 
 But, yeah, I'm very pleased with 4-under on this golf course. If you would have asked me that on Tuesday and Wednesday, I would've -- 68 is a very good score.

 Q. You got a little bit of a calm wind, a little moisture.
 DAVID EGER: It was -- you know, I guess it's not as windy as the predictions have it being 25 miles an hour. But the last four holes, well three out of the last four holes play into a pretty good wind. 
 So it's a good test. You don't want to hit it in the bunkers here, so...

 Q. If I'm watching enough, you've had this kind of score. It's putting three of these together, isn't it?
 DAVID EGER: Yeah, it always is for everybody. But, no, I haven't won in a few years. I seem just to start poorly. 
 So this is a good start for me. I'll see if I can maintain it. 

 Q. Well, congratulations. 
 DAVID EGER: Thank you.
