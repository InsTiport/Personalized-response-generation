 Q. How did you make out today?
 DAVID EGER: Even par. It felt like under par. 

 Q. With the scores out there today, what was it like?
 DAVID EGER: Well, the golf course is just, as you know, unrelenting. If you don't drive the ball in the fairway, the recovery to make par is nearly impossible. 
 And the greens, unfortunately, it's early in the season, they're seeding a little bit. And that's affecting the distance control and everything. 
 But it's a wonderful golf course. It's just it's a difficult golf course for old men. 

 Q. How did you play for the four days? 
 DAVID EGER: Well, I had three good rounds and a terrible second round. I played as well today as I have all week. It's just an unrelenting course. There's no let up in it. 
 You got to challenge every tee shot. You have to challenge every second shot that you're hitting from the fairway. It's just a very difficult course. 
 And we didn't, I mean they were very understanding on the pin placements. I thought the pin placements were fine. But I thought the rough was the toughest part.
