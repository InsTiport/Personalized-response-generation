  Q. Just on your play today. Just an overview.   
 DAVID EGER: Well, I played very well. I drove the ball pretty decently and hit some good irons. Didn't make any mistakes.   
 I think the course, with the lack of wind and the overcast make it's play easier than sunshine and wind, obviously. But it's still awfully wet and awfully muddy out there and it will be interesting to see what they do for the weekend with the playing the ball up. I certainly think they ought to.
