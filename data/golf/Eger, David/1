Q.   With David Eger.   David, another good round for you today.   Could you walk us through it a little bit, please? 
DAVID EGER:   Well, this afternoon, it got a little breezy.   The greens firmed up quite a bit than they were yesterday morning when we played, but that's all to be expected, I guess.   Put some water on it.   It's high and dry today, especially with the wind.
The course will grab you, it will bite you when you least expect it.   It's not anything that's unexpected, the way the course is playing or what's leading right now. 
I don't know what we'll get to double digits under par.   And I'd just like to shoot some under par scores for the weekend.

Q.   A lot of people have talked about driving accuracy being so important.   Is that something that you've been living by these last couple days as well? 
DAVID EGER:   Well, it certainly is, because the rough is so punishing off the tees.   There are quite a few holes that dogleg.   But the change of wind direction today, and I don't know, people that are familiar with practice rounds didn't have this wind.   It will be unfamiliar so that you drive it through the dog legs a few times today.   But it's a wonderful test.

Q.   Was there any difficulties, I guess, if that's the word, or abnormalities just playing in a twosome?   In terms of pacing, did you have to wait or anything like that when the rest are threesomes out there? 
DAVID EGER:   No, Barry and I didn't even think of it, really.   We had to play nine yesterday as two.   So today was no different.   We had to wait.   You have to wait as threes.   Probably wait a little bit more.   No big deal.

Q.   Anything particular to work on for tomorrow, moving day? 
DAVID EGER:   Just play better.   Just play better.

Q.   Thank you very much.
