  CRAIG LEE:   I got off to a really good start, birdie, eagle, birdie.   
   
 Q.   How did you do that?   
CRAIG LEE:   Nice shot over the first but just went into the back edge.   Putt was about 30 feet and up over the hill and that got momentum going.   Hit two great shots, 4‑iron into the second, to about four feet.   Made that one.   
Then hit the flag at the third, so went to about a foot.   
   
 Q.   What did you hit it with?   
CRAIG LEE:   Hit 8‑iron maybe 178 I think it is, 175.   
   
 Q.   On a day like this, do you really need a good start to keep your head up?   
CRAIG LEE:   That helps.   We were kind of discussing it, we were saying level par was going to be a good score.   We were 4‑under after three so we thought under par would be a phenomenal score.   But to pick up another sort of two or three after that, it was pretty impressive actually.   
   
 Q.   You had a good caddie, as well.   
CRAIG LEE:   My caddie is essentially‑‑ in a place like this, you want to just not get in his way and let him get on with it and hit the shot that you have to hit.   He has been a great help.   
   
 Q.   You like this kind of weather, don't you?  
CRAIG LEE:   I wouldn't say I like it (laughing).   I prefer the wind.   This is miserable.   I don't think anybody would like this.   I may be enjoy it more than maybe some of the Europeans who are not quite used to it, but it was bitterly cold as well, and had gloves on all the way around.   It was pretty cold first thing this morning.
