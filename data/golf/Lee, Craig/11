  CRAIG LEE:   Pretty happy with the number.   It's very tough out there.   The pins are very fast, very tricky.   Some of the pins are tucked away and obviously the wind is gusting around here, as well, so I'm delighted.   
   
 Q.   Blustery rough from the start, seems to be picking up as well.   
CRAIG LEE:   We probably got about four or five holes where it wasn't at its strongest, so a little bit fortunate with the draw there.   But now it's really picked up to as strong as it's going to be.  
   
 Q.   What do you think about actually being involved in this tournament?   That's a nice reward for the season I guess.   
CRAIG LEE:   It is.   Obviously after Crans, the goals changed and trying to chase down Race to Dubai, and I'm outside that at the moment.   
I've not got any chance if I don't get into these events, so it's a great bonus to get into these, but it's also a necessity to get into these if you want to get into The Race to Dubai.  
Yeah, I kind of have mixed emotions about coming here but delighted to be here.  
   
 Q.   Does it make you puff out your chest because you are in an elite field?  
CRAIG LEE:   In an elite field, but in the bottom end of an elite field, so I don't want to puff my chest out too much.   I'm in pretty good company, but no, I think if I can get to play three or four of these, maybe I'll start to feel a bit more comfortable.   But at the moment I'm still feeling a bit of the underdog.  
   
 Q.   Carrying on, nothing out scores like that, you'll be right amongst it.   
CRAIG LEE:   That would be nice; if the wind stays as strong as this, I'll be more than happy.
