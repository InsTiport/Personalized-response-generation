 Q.  You had one bogey, how did you feel about your performance?  
CRAIG LEE: I played quite nicely the front nine.  It was quite tough out there with the wind gradually picking up but it's nice to play the Dunhill in a little wind which is good.   
I played very nicely on the back nine, as well and just sort of faded off towards the end and bogeyed the last, which is never great.   
 Q.  How do you enjoy the Pro-Am atmosphere of this tournament?  
CRAIG LEE: I really enjoy it.  It's really fun playing with the amateurs and they get a little kick out of it, as well, playing alongside us pros.  I was fortunate today that we were able to post 8-under as a team.  That's pretty good, as well.   
 Q.  You're playing St. Andrews tomorrow; are you looking forward to that?  
CRAIG LEE: Yeah, it's always a pleasure to play St. Andrews and I think it's going to be pretty kind weather, too, dry, and a little bit of a breeze.  That will be testing but it will be good fun.
