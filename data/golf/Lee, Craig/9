Q.   Thoughts on your position in the tournament after three days?
CRAIG LEE:   Delighted, yeah, I would certainly have taken that on Wednesday.   The golf course is playing very tough and unfortunately still not hitting the greens but another day to rectify that.

Q.   And it was not easy today despite more sunshine and less breeze?
CRAIG LEE:   Sometimes when the wind dies, it's almost easier if you know exactly where that is and how strong it is, but when it starts to kind of gust and pick up and sort of calm down, then it becomes quite a task in the sun. 

Q.   Given all the undulations on the greens, this is a course that takes a little while to learn the nuances? 
CRAIG LEE:   Yeah, definitely.   I think they say it takes about 12 rounds of golf to get to know a golf course probably.   I'm going in tomorrow on my fifth round, so I'm halfway there.   So if I get the opportunity to come back next year, I'll have mastered it. 

Q.   And with the jetâ€‘lag, you must be proud yourself?
CRAIG LEE:   Yeah, I think I've done 47 hours flying in seven days.
