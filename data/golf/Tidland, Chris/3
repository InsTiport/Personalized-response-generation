 Q. Solid 2-Under par 69 here in the final round. You were right there around the lead coming down the stretch. 
 CHRIS TIDLAND: Yeah, I got off to a great start today and then kind of, you know, stumbled there in the middle of the round. It was raining and cold and nasty. 
 Then turned it around again. Kind of an up and down round, but I made lots the will of birdies. If you're making birdies, you always have a chance.

 Q. You weren't the only one struggling in adverse conditions. Even in the ultimate group there was a lot of struggling going on. Were you keeping a watch on the leaderboard to know where you were?
 CHRIS TIDLAND: No, I'm not a leaderboard watcher. My game gives me plenty to think about.
 So I tell me caddie though, he always watches. So if I ever have a question, he tells me how I stand. So I'm just focused on what I have to do.

 Q. Good playing this week. 
 CHRIS TIDLAND: All right. Thanks a lot.
