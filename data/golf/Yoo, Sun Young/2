Q.   Different than yesterday.   Just tell me what was working better today than first round.
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I played late yesterday, so today greens were a little better in shape.   I don't know, everything was working fine.
Yesterday I hit pretty good and just hit a couple of bad tee shots.   That's it.   But today swinging better and swinging with more confidence, I guess.

Q.   More confident today?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah.

Q.   Do you like to get off in the morning usually?   Are you more of a morning person?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   No, not really.   It depends, but I feel pretty good this morning.   I feel fresh.

Q.   Okay.   So was it more of like you're tired about anything or was it‑‑
SUN YOUNG YOO:   No.   Everything was fine. 

Q.   Okay.   All right.   No bogeys.   What was the key to no mistakes today?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I think I be more patient today.   Like I don't know, maybe tee shot was a little better today, so I didn't have any trouble‑‑ maybe once on No. 8, but I made par, so it was a really big deal.   Yeah, overall everything was working very well.

Q.   Everything was very straightforward?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.

Q.   Any particular hole that stuck out or anything that‑‑
SUN YOUNG YOO:   No, not really.   Not today.

Q.   Just very easy, very straightforward.
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah.

Q.   So you're coming off a couple decent finishes this year.   Anything that's been holding you back?   Anything that you've been working oncoming into this week in particular?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Not really.   Yeah, everything was same.   Yeah, just I tried to swing with better rhythm.

Q.   Anything you were working on specifically on the break?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   No.   Not really.   Just trying to get better rhythm than last year.   Last year it was not the year I wanted it to be.

Q.   How do you feel on this course?   Do you like coming back to Phoenix?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Oh, yeah.

Q.   And playing here?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Definitely this course suits my eyes well.   I like the straight and wide.   I feel like I can swing really hard as I want to.   Yeah, I feel good.

Q.   So you think you're more comfortable when you get to be able to go up on the wide and letting go?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah.   I think most people do.

Q.   Most people do.   Easy enough.
