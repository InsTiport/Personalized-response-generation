 Q.   Congratulations, a great round by you today.   Can you take me through your day out there, and what it was like watching Yani out there playing today?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Actually, I think I played pretty good.   I just didn't make the short ones out there.   It was a little too bumpy.   She played great.   There is nothing I can say.   Yeah, it was fun to watch and playing with Yani was fun.  
   
 Q.   How impressive has she been?   This is her third win in five tournaments so far this year.   It's been pretty impressive to see the streak she's been on.   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah, not only this year, she did last year.   She did pretty good last year and a couple years ago.   It didn't surprise me.  
   
 Q.   How were the conditions out there today?   I know we moved tee times up because of the threat of inclement weather and there was some wind.   How tough was it out there?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah, but I think we got pretty lucky with the weather.   We didn't get wet.   
But the wind picked up a little bit at maybe number 15.   But it wasn't too bad.  
   
 Q.   Overall your performance this week, are you pretty pleased with how you were able to go out there and play?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah, I think I've got to work on my putting a little bit and go hit some balls and go have fun next weekend.
