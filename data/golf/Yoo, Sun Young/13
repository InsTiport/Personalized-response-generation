   JASON TAYLOR: Thanks for joining us. Great round today, 8-under and currently in second place. Talk about your round today.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Well, I putted really good on the front nine, but I didn't do really good on the back nine.   
 But I still feel comfortable with it and I feel really confident out there. Yeah, I feel really good.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Let's go through your scorecard. You started on the back nine, you birdied on No. 10.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes.  
 JASON TAYLOR: What did you use on that one?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Driver and I hit 9-iron.   
 JASON TAYLOR: How far?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: 120 yards to pin.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay. You birdied on 11.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Uh-huh. I hit driver and 8-iron from 135.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Birdied on 12.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I hit driver and also 8-iron. 135 also.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Another birdie on 13.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I hit driver and 3-wood. It was on the fringe on the right side, so I chipped and putted.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay. And then birdied 15.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Uh-huh. Yeah, I hit 3-wood on the tee and hit 6-iron from 150 yards.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Eagle on 16.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes. I hit driver and 5-wood. It was on the green.  
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay. Birdie on 18.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Uh-huh. Hit 3-wood from the tee and hit 5-iron from 160 yards.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Okay. Birdie on 1.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes. I did layup with 5-iron and I had 90-yard shot.   
 JASON TAYLOR: You had a bogey on 4.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah. I pulled it so it went into the bunker. Yeah.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Another bogey on 8.  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I was on the right side of the fairway so I had to kind of layup. I didn't make up and down from there.   
 JASON TAYLOR: Thanks. We'll open up to questions now.   
  
  Q. Your first nine, have you had other rounds in your career where you got very hot, like that good of a nine-hole stretch?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I don't understand the question.   
  
  Q. You had a very good first nine holes.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes.  
  
  Q. Before, any time in the past that you've played, have you had nine holes like that before?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: No. First time I hit 8-under for nine holes. Yeah, I feel really good out there. Yeah.   
  
  Q. How does that feel in the moment when you're playing and you look up and you're 8-under at the turn? Does it feel like surreal, like you're in a dream?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, kind of. But I really tried to forget about it and just keep on the focus on every shot. So, yeah.   
  
  Q. A lot of times when somebody has nine holes like that all of a sudden everybody starts thinking 59. Does that come into your mind at all?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, sometimes. But, you know, yeah.  
  
  Q. You played here in the afternoon. It was getting hot. Were the greens still holding pretty well?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah. They were, yeah.   
  
  Q. Did you play here last year?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I did. I really like this course.  
  
  Q. Last year it was very hot and the course had kind of dried out with not a lot of rough. The condition of the course, does it seem different this year, more rough, more grass?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Last year fairway was a little harder than this year. But, yeah, greens were good and, yeah, I was able to hit the fairway. It was soft, so I like it.   
  
  Q. Can you talk a little bit about what was different for you on the front nine versus the back nine and why you dropped off a little bit?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I think I lost a little bit of focus from putting, because I had some more birdie chance on back nine but I didn't make some putts.   
 So yeah, I think was little tired. Yeah.  
  
  Q. Do you attribute some of that to the heat?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I tried, but...  
  
  Q. Did you have any real long putts on the first nine holes, or was everything inside 15 feet?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, every was in four yards so I made everything. Yeah, I had birdie chances.   
  
  Q. The No. 4 hole, your back nine, I think you were 9-under and then you had a bogey. I think you had a very good drive on No.4. You were in the middle of the fairway. The iron shot, don't know what happened really?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I think it was a little bit lush, so yeah.   
  
  Q. This week, I mean, you're off to a very good start. You've had some top 10 finishes. Coming here this week did you feel good and do you feel like you have a chance, especially on this golf course?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I really like this course. I feel really good with this course, so yeah. Just keep it going, yeah.
