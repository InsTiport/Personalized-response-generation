  Q. Tell us about your round today, minus 3. That's a good score.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with where I am right now. And my putting was a lot better than yesterday, so I have my confidence back so I looking forward to another two good rounds.  
  
  Q. Your putting, did you work on it in the time...   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I wasn't hitting good yesterday, so I hit some practice after rounds yesterday. I think that help, yeah.  
  
  Q. Did you have a bunch of shorter putts today? Were you able to attack the pins a little more and have shorter putts, or was it just strictly putting better?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I hit a couple short ones or also made couple long ones.  
 But the greens were a little bit softer than yesterday, I guess, so I was able to attack the pin more than yesterday.  
  
  Q. You're five shots away with two rounds to go. Still close enough to make a run at it.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, it's tough out there, so you never know what's gonna happen out there. I had my best absolutely. I just try to forget about last two rounds, just two new good days, yeah.
