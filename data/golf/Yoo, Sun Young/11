  Q. How was your round?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: It was a little bit windy out there but pretty much the same wind as the practise round. I feel comfortable and I know I'm hitting it good. So I just have confidence and made some putts.   
  
  Q. You're one of the better-placed South Koreans on the leaderboard, along with Na Yeon.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I know, everybody knows she's a great player and we still have two more rounds. Actually everybody has a chance at the moment so we'll see what happens.   
  
  Q. Is there anything that you can do to play better the next couple of rounds?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: There are some holes that have narrow fairways, but I think I handle pretty well right now.  
  
  Q. Conditions are pretty tough with the wind, but you had five birdies today; what was the secret to that?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Just keep my ball flight low a little bit. And I've been working on the windy shots for the season, so actually feel pretty comfortable.   
  
  Q. So far the weather has been good but there could be rain this weekend. How could that affect?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I don't know, there is nothing you can do about the weather. So I just deal with it.   
  
  Q. But the fact that -- because if it rains, it's going to make it that much tougher.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: It will be softer fairways and slower greens, but it's the same for everybody, so I'm not complaining about it.
