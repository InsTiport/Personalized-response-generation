  Q. First of all, congratulations, minus-8. Tell me about your round.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Actually I shot 7-under today, not 8-under.  
  
  Q. Oh, I'm sorry, 7-under. Tell me about the day.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I hit the ball pretty well today. I didn't make any putts yesterday actually, but I made couple putts today.  
 So I played good today.   
  
  Q. How does it look for tomorrow?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Tomorrow I think if I keep doing what I'm doing right now, I be in good position for sure. So I'm looking forward tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What made you play so well today? Are you looser or more used to the course or what?  
 SUN YOUNG YOO: I think more used to the course. I think I feel more comfortable than last couple days.  
 I hit the ball really good, so...  
  
  Q. Congratulations.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Thank you.
