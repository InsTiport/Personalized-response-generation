Q.   Better day today, what was the main difference between today and yesterday? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I knew it was going to be windy today, so I just focused on where I want to start the ball, instead of focusing to getting close to the pin.   So I think I focused very well on this, so it worked out good. 

Q.   You're still four shots back as of right now.   What are your thoughts going into the weekend?   What do you think about it? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I don't really think about anything.   I know it's going to be windy the next two days, as well, so I just want to do the same thing as today and see what happens. 

Q.   Let's talk about your nickname, Course Clown; how did you get that? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I don't know.   I don't even know who started it‑‑ I think I'm pretty quiet on the golf course and I like to have fun off the course, that's how it started.   But I don't mind people calling me whatever. 

Q.   You have a good sense of humor off the golf course.   Does that help out here? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I think it's different, because I want to be more serious on the golf course.   I don't want to be like goofy on the golf course. 

Q.   So how is it being in Taiwan this week? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   It's all right.   I like playing in Asia because I'm from Korea.   It's not far from Korea.   Yeah, I like it, I like playing in Asia.

Q.   How difficult has it been playing in the weather the past two days?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I was kind of expecting this‑‑ it's the same for everybody.   Everybody knows it's going to be tough.   I just keep doing what I'm doing right now and it will be good.
