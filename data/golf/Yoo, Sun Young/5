Q.   Great round out there, everybody has been talking about how tricky this golf course can be, it requires a lot of thinking.   What were some of the keys for you out there today? 
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Actually I had a hard time reading putts some holes but I hit very good and my caddie helped me with reading.   So everything was good. 

Q.   Stacy Lewis was joking, this is going to be a tough week on the caddies, they are going to have a lot of work cut out for them?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah, I think it's the same for everybody.   Everybody having a hard time reading putts because they have some tricky break.   So I have to ask my caddie every time. 

Q.   And for you, I know some people are not bringing the driver out very much.   What was your strategy in terms of approaching these holes in general?   Did you hit a lot of drivers?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Actually I hit 3‑wood a couple times on the tee.   Yeah, I hit a couple drivers.   I was swinging really well today so I felt really comfortable with driver.

Q.   And third event of the year, overall on the LPGA, second for you, how do you feel about your game at the start of the year?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   It's actually pretty good.   I had a good off‑season and I didn't play well last week but I had my game back on the last round.   I feel really good with everything. 

Q.   We are coming up as we are getting to the stretch where you're going to be defending champion at Kraft; what did winning that tournament last year, having that title of major champion do for your confidence level?
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Definitely changed my career.   I feel really great because everybody calls me a major champion, but at the same time I have pressure, as well.   I try to forget about last year and see what I can do.
