  THE MODERATOR:   Sun Young Yoo.   Congratulations.   Champion at the year's first major.   How does that sound to you?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I didn't think about winning today because I didn't want to expect too much, and I didn't want to let myself down, but I think I did better than I was thinking, so I'm very happy.  
THE MODERATOR:   So you did not have any thoughts at the beginning of today about sitting here in this room?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Not really because I didn't want to think about it.   I was thinking just one shot at a time and keep it simple, and I think that worked out pretty good.  
THE MODERATOR:   My last question before we take some questions.   What does this victory do for you?   What does it mean to you to be sitting here as a major champion?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I don't know how to say it.   I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now.   I'm still nervous.   I wasn't nervous on the course, but now I'm really nervous.  
THE MODERATOR:   Really?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Sun Young Yoo.  
   
 Q.   Did you see I.K.'s putt on 18 when she missed, and did you feel anything for her when that ball lipped out or were you just happy for yourself or what were your emotions at that moment?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   She's a great player.   She really doesn't miss those kind of putts.   Some people were telling me that that's golf.   You never know what's going to happen, but I was just watching on the putting green and that's some luck.  
   
 Q.   And do you think she was a little still bothered by that on the playoff hole?   Do you think it was a little hard for her to focus on the playoff hole at that point?   Would it be hard for you?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I don't know.   Maybe it takes some time to get over things sometimes.   I don't know what she was thinking.   I just tried to focus on my game.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel a little sad for her?   Obviously you're happy you won, but do you have some sadness for her?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I mean it happens.   It's golf.   It's a crazy game.   It happened to me before, too.   
I mean everybody's playing to win out here, but I don't think I can ‑‑ she did great today.  
   
 Q.   Was there a point on the Back 9 when you did realize you were tied and maybe you had a chance to win this tournament?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.   I wasn't looking at the scoreboard on the front nine and I started looking at it after 16, and I was one shot behind, so I just told myself that all I can do is do my best, and see what happens.   I don't know.   I didn't realize until 18.   
   
 Q.   When you parred 18 and stayed at 9‑under, did you think you weren't going to win?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I thought I had no chance.   I thought I.K. was going to make that putt, but it didn't happen.   
THE MODERATOR:   By the way, you are the second South Korean to win this championship.   Grace Park as well.   What does that mean for you in the history?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Every win is very important, and especially a major.   But I didn't really think about the win.   I just wanted to think ‑‑ it's a big tournament, right, so I just tried to focus on my game and play some golf and some fun out there.  
THE MODERATOR:   And here we are.   
   
 Q.   Sun Young, congratulations.   
K.J. CHOI:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   What do you think this will do for your personal confidence now that you are labeled forever a major champion?   
THE MODERATOR:   What will this do for you and your confidence going forward?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I've been playing very good, and I actually have my confidence back last week.   So it helps a lot, and I'm looking forward to play some more tournaments.  
THE MODERATOR:   You played very well last week.  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yeah, I did.   
THE MODERATOR:   You live in Orlando; right?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   You're a big fan of the NBA; correct?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   Basketball more than golf?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I like basketball better than golf.  
THE MODERATOR:   Really?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.  
THE MODERATOR:   What's your favorite team?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Orlando Magic.  
THE MODERATOR:   How many games do you go to a year?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I try to go once a year, but I couldn't go this year.  
THE MODERATOR:   Your favorite player is?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   J.J. Redick.   
THE MODERATOR:   Not Dwight Howard.   J.J. Redick.   Okay.   
   
 Q.   Did you bring any family with you this week or have you gotten a chance to talk to family yet?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   No.   I was here by myself.   I just wish my family was here.   My family is still (indiscernible) so I can't wait to get some pictures to my family.  
   
 Q.   When you get to go home as a major winner, what do you think that will be like?   What kind of greeting will you get?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I'm sure my family in Korea will know, but I'm going to Orlando the next two weeks, so I'm all by myself.   So I'm going to have some party with friends.  
THE MODERATOR:   Can you tell everybody about the jump into the pond?   What was that like?   Were you nervous about having to jump?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I didn't know it was going to be that cold.   As soon as I ran in there, I was like, oh, that's cold.   It was great.   
   
 Q.   Can you just give us a little background in how you got started in the game and maybe who you looked up to, who taught you?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   I was 10 when I started golf, and actually, I liked to play pretty much every sport, so one day my dad took me to the driving range and made me hit some balls, and I really liked it.   It was very fun, and I just kept doing it.   
THE MODERATOR:   Other questions?   
   
 Q.   Were you 10 years old at that time when you first started?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   When he took you to the range?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   Could you briefly tell us the progression from that 10‑year‑old start to kind of how you continued onward?  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Yes.   I started playing tournaments when I was 13.   Then I really liked competing with other people, and we had a golf team in my middle school and high school.   We had some good junior golf, and I played.   
THE MODERATOR:   Let me ask you one question about the state of the tour from the perspective of Yani Tseng who gets a lot of attention.   Now that you've won and this week you beat Yani.   What are your thoughts about how good she is, where you might fit in?   Can you challenge her among the great players?   
SUN YOUNG YOO:   She's a great player, and I've known her since like 15, and we played some junior golf maybe twice.   
Everybody out here, they're really great.   It depends how many putts they make, so you never know who's going to win the tournament these days.  
THE MODERATOR:   And now it's you.   Anything else from the audience?   Sun Young Yoo, congratulations.  
SUN YOUNG YOO:   Thank you.
