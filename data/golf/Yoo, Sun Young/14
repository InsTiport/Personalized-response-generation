 Q. Four straight birdies. Great way to start off or to end the day.
 Can you talk about how you feel after today?
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah. I feel great. Some Korean people came out and cheer on me so I really liked it and I think I got lot better weather. 
 I saw the weather this morning and it says thunderstorms this morning but it all cleared up so I really like the weather and I had control today and my caddy gave me good read every time so I played really good today.

 Q. Now you're tied for 2nd entering tomorrow. 
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yes.

 How does that feel?
