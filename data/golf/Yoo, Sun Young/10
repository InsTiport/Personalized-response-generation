 Q. Quite an up-and-down round today in the wind, how was it for you?
 SUN YOUNG YOO: It was pretty much the same as the last two days, but I wasn't like aggressive today. So I have one more round and I will be aggressive tomorrow.

 Q. And that's what you'll try to do tomorrow, be aggressive?
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah, I had some putts come up short sometimes, so tomorrow I'll be more aggressive. 

 Q. More aggressive on your putts?
 SUN YOUNG YOO: Yeah.
