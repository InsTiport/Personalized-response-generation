   SUN YOUNG YOO:  (Recording started.)  I hit driver pretty good on No. 3.  I hit 197 to the pin.  I hit 4-iron.  It was -- I reach the green by two shot.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  How far away were you?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  It was 8 yards; I 2-putt.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Great.  And 5, it's a bogey?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  Yes.  I tee shot -- tee off with 3-wood and I hit a little bit bad so it flew to the right rough, so I lay up with 9-iron.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  How far out?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  It was 184, but I just hit 9-iron.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  And then to how close?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  It was like fifteen yards.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  2-putt.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  And then is that it?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  Yes.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  But you're still 4-under.  That's 68.  How do you feel after this first round compared to your other first rounds?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  I played better than I thought, because it was really tough course to everybody.   
 It was windy Back 9 holes, so I'm absolutely happy with my score today.  I really just try to forget about this round and just keep going for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  Was the wind an issue today?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  A little bit because greens were very firm out there.  So, yeah, I had to play to the front edge and just really release most of times.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Did you have any highlight holes, or what on this course was really strong for you?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  I think this course is really challenge course, so I think driver is really important.  So we got keep it on the fairway every time.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Okay.  Anything else?  Looking forward to tomorrow, is there anything you're going focus on concentrate on?   
 SUN YOUNG YOO:  Actually, my coach was here for me and I was struggling with my putting a little bit.  We got fixed, so maybe I will go to practice a little bit.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE:  Sounds like you got fixed up pretty well.  Thanks for coming in.
