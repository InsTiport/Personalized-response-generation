 Q.  Is this your first time here at Pebble?  
RYGGS JOHNSTON: Yeah, first time here at Pebble, second U.S. Am.   
 Q.  How do you like playing the course?  
RYGGS JOHNSTON: It was great.  It was a fun course to play.  I left a few out there, but I was happy with how I played today.  I played solid.   
 Q.  What was working well for you?  
RYGGS JOHNSTON: It was just kind of a mix of everything.  There were some bad shots in every category, some really good.  I struggled with driver early, got that fixed for the back nine, and then I hit some good iron shots, and I made a couple nice chips.   
 Q.  What do you think you need to work on this afternoon for going to Spyglass tomorrow?  
RYGGS JOHNSTON: Probably hit some drivers, work a little bit on putting, wedge shots, because those greens are tough at Spyglass.  You'll spin a lot of them off the front.  Just distance control.   
 Q.  Even par, probably not where you wanted to be with the 18th hole, but satisfied?  
RYGGS JOHNSTON: Yeah, I was happy with even for the day coming into 18.  I would have liked to have gotten a birdie, get into red numbers, but that's okay, I'll go get it tomorrow.
