Q.   Overall, what were your thoughts?
DAVE McNABB:   Just an awesome week.   I had the time of my life again for the second straight year.   Got to play with Adam Scott, got to play with Ernie Els, Louis Oosthuizen, some practice rounds with those guys. 
You know, did I learn anything?   I thought I came in pretty well prepared.   I just didn't play particularly well.   You know, so I'll try to evaluate why that was and what happened.   Obviously I'm a little disappointed with my play, especially the way I finished today.   At the end of the day, it's an awesome experience to be here and I'm going to hold my head high once I evaluate once going on. 

Q.   Passion and desire to get back and go to Whistling Straits?
DAVE McNABB:   Without a doubt.   That's top of the priority list to make it back for the third straight year.   Going to be working hard starting tomorrow.
