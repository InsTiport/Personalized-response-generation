 Q.   First round 74, are you happy with it?   
DAVID MCNABB I'm very happy with it.   I didn't drive the ball very well today at all.   I got it in the rough quite a few times.   Got it up‑and‑down quite a bunch.   I got it up‑and‑down on 17 from 110 yards and I got it up‑and‑down on 18 from 135, almost holed it out.   Probably didn't have more than 30 putts, so I'm very happy with the way I played.   
   
 Q.   What are you going to be looking for tomorrow, obviously you need to improve on the score a little bit to make the cut, but what are you looking for tomorrow?  
DAVID MCNABB Looking to drive the ball a lot straighter.   I've been playing good and driving is a strength of my game.   I'm looking to drive the ball better tomorrow, and if I do that, I think I have a chance to shoot a really good score.
