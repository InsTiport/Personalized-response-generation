 Q.   Just kind of start off talking about your win.   Did you expect it to take that long once you turned pro?

 Q.   Did you see this building?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I've been playing well.   Every tournament just felt like there was a little something that set me back a little bit.   But yeah, I feel like I've been playing good for a long time, so it was nice to string four together.  
   
 Q.   What's your schedule look like going forward in the near future, I guess?
