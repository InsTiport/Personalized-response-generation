Q. Sum it up for me.
PATRICK CANTLAY: We both played really well, and then I got rolling with the putter. I made a bunch of putts. Made every big one that I needed to make, especially the par save on the par 3, and I was fired up out there. It was fun.
Q. How do you sum up this experience, regardless of the outcome, how do you describe what this experience was like for you?
PATRICK CANTLAY: It's been great. It's a different environment. It's like the last round of a tournament every single match, so that part of it's fun. I look forward to seeing my guys battle hard and hopefully win this thing.
Q. How do you think this experience will help prepare you for the next few years when you're back on your own and back on Tour again and getting ready to go out?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Any time you play in high-pressure situations, it prepares you for all the golf that I have to play in my career. I love the golf course, and playing firm, fast golf courses like these, I think you can learn a lot.
