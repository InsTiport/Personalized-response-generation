Q. 8-under par, 63.  What do you take from this round?  You're 6-under making the turn and you got those holes coming down the stretch.  Happy with what you did today?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, 8-under is a good start and it's just the first round, so scores are going to be really low.
I think wind is supposed to maybe blow this weekend, so that might curtail a little bit.
I think going to need to get into the 20-unders, so today is a good start.
Q. Flat stick was cool.  On 7 you make about a 28-footer.  And that was, by the way, 62 feet at 8, so really rolling the rock well.
PATRICK CANTLAY:   62-footers help.  It hit the flag stick a little hard.  Probably would've been five or six feet by, so that was nice to go in.
Rolled it well today.  One three-putt on 14, but other than that hit the ball well, rolled it well.  It was a good day.
Q. What is it about this golf course that brings out the best in you?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I drive the ball pretty well so I have a lot wedge opportunities out there.
I like the course.  It sets up for a right-to-left shot on a lot of holes, which is my preferred shot.
So I'm just playing from the fairway a lot and it feels like there is lots of green lights, lots of opportunities to hit it as close as I can.  I like the golf course and I've played well here.
Q. What's it like when you go out there knowing that, I got shoot 6, 7-under par each day or I'm going to be out of it?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, that's not the mindset I got.  I just try to give myself as many opportunities as I can.  The birdies will come out here if you're patient and play smart.
Today they did, so hopefully the next three days are more of the same.
