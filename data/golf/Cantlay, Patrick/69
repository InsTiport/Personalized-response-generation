 Q.  Can you talk about the ace you had there on 11?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it was just a full 8-iron and I hit it right where I was looking and it just fell in.   
 Q.  What was working for you today?  5-under there on your first nine.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, everything was pretty solid.  A couple of mistakes where I fell asleep a little bit.  But all in all it was a good start and everything's good.  Game feels really solid.   
 Q.  You got Pebble tomorrow.  Your plan of attack there?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, just go out and make as many birdies as I can.  Conditions are great, so should be able to shoot a score.
