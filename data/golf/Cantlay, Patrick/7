  Q. Just assess the day, if you could, please, Patrick?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   I played really well.  Everything I did I think, I think just good.  I hit the ball really well.  I had a good up-and-down there on 7, just didn't get all the putts that I needed to go in.  I didn't get them to go in today.
 Q. You said every day you hit it pretty well.
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, even today I rolled a bunch of good putts in the middle of the round and I just couldn't get them to go in.  Some rounds some weeks are kind of like that.  I made a bunch early in the round and I hit my lines all day.  I just wasn't able to get them to fall.
 Q. What's your biggest takeaway from this week?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   All parts of my game are really good and I really love Riviera, so I'm going to go down there next week, get rested over the next couple days, and know that my game's in a good spot.
 Q. What did you think about that new tee at 10?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   I don't like it a much as the other hole.  I think it's a little gimmicky, but it's fine.
 Q. What you did you hit there and did you play that in the U.S. Open at all?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   I don't think so.  I hit a hybrid and a wedge and missed about a 10-footer.
