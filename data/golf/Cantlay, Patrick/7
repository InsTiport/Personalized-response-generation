Q. How would you assess your play today?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Slow start and I played really well on the back nine and was able to roll in a few putts and I feel comfortable out here, I actually felt like I played well on the front nine, I just wasn't able to score.  I hit the flag from the middle of the fairway on the third hole and that would have been a tap-in and made a bad bogey on 6, but other than that it was great.
Q. So there wasn't much of a change playing, going to the back nine, where you said you played a little bit better, you just, the putts started to fall a little bit?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I think the back nine's maybe a little easier, at least for me, but other than that I just kept hitting quality shots and I was able to make a few putts on the back nine and that was the difference.
Q. What will be your mentality coming out tomorrow, knowing you'll probably be a few shots back with a bunched leaderboard and a place where it takes low scores to win?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I haven't gotten off to a quick start yet this week, I've been I think even through 6 every day, which is a no-no out here.  So if I can get off to a quick start tomorrow and make a couple birdies it shouldn't be too different to where I was at, at Sherwood and if I can get on a roll and then continue on on the back nine I think I got a shot.
