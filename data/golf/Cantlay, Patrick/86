 Q.   First of all, what did you think of today's round compared to Thursday and Friday when you were trying to make the cut?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Well, today I played really well, actually.   I hit a lot of solid shots and I rolled some good putts, it's just the score didn't really reflect it.  
   
 Q.   Are you consistent at any part of your game or have you been kind of up‑and‑down?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I rolled it well all week.   Yesterday I struck it really poorly.   As far as consistency goes, I've been rolling it well.  
   
 Q.   Have you mad a Masters moment when this is like, I'm here, this is what this is all about, this whole tournament?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Nothing in particular.   Staying at the Crow's Nest is really great.   Every afternoon when I get back there, it's kind of like it's a cool place to be.  
   
 Q.   You keeping track of how the other amateurs are doing, particularly Kelly since you know him really well?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I know where he's at, but I'm routing him for him because it's great for amateur golf in amateurs play well.  
   
 Q.   Do you have room in your luggage for the Silver Cup?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I think so.  
   
 Q.   Who needs the shaver?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Right.  
   
 Q.   I don't know, do you need a shaver?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Sometimes, not every day yet.  
   
 Q.   What are you hoping to accomplish tomorrow?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I'm going to go out and try to play as best I can and see how low I can go.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible) what that's been like so far?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Well, 10 is a really good golf hole.   You have got to shape it right to left off the tee, which I'm really comfortable with.   That green is really tricky so it's important to leave yourself an uphill putt.  
   
 Q.   Early in the week, can you talk about what Rory did?   Just thinking about what he did last year ‑‑  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, not thinking about that at all.  
   
 Q.   Where were you last year when he sort of hooked it?   Do you remember seeing that shot?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I'm not sure.   I mean, I've seen it on replay, but ‑‑  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah.  
   
 Q.   Somebody who knows ‑‑ a player at your home club said that you play all the time with turned pros, that you are not going to be shell shocked out here.   Would that be a fair assessment?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I don't feel out of my comfort zone at all.   I feel really comfortable out here playing with all these guys.  
   
 Q.   You don't feel 20 years old?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I feel 20 years old.   I just feel comfortable.   I've played a bunch of events.   All the guys have been great to me and nice.   I enjoy it out here.  
   
 Q.   Who are some of the guys you play with regularly away from a tournament like this?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   John Merrick and John Cook, Peter Tomasulo, John Mallinger, all the of those guys are out at Virginia Country Club in Long Beach.  
   
 Q.   John Cook is ‑‑  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Champions Tour.  
   
 Q.   He's quite a character, very colorful guy?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   He's a great guy, really good family guy.   He's probably had the biggest influence on me as far as a pro goes, other than my swing coach Jaime.   I called him earlier in the week and he's always giving me words of advice.  
   
 Q.   He comes to Savannah for the Legends of Golf every year.   He was talk about the kids today.   He wasn't talking about you specifically, I don't think, but I guess his own kids are about this age.   He was trying to relate to the kids today.   He was trying to remember, yeah, I was a kid too.   Does he seem like the cool uncle or ‑‑  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   He's a really cool guy.   You know, we practice together a lot and I try and learn as much as I can from him.  
   
 Q.   So you don't feel like there is a generational gap?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, not really.
