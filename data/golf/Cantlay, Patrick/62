PATRICK CANTLAY: Overall my game is in good shape and gearing up for the U.S. Open.   
 Q.  Take a lot out of this week getting yourself into contention on a course that you like and on a tough golf course as you head towards the second major of the year?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: For sure.  I think there's probably going to be similarities between here and Shinnecock, driving the ball in the fairway is really important, thinking your way around fast greens.  So I feel like my game's in a really good spot and obviously just got to get everything ready and get my mind right for Shinnecock.   
 Q.  Is it tough, I mean obviously it's tough today, is it tough sometimes to take some positives even when you don't win and put yourself in that position?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Putting yourself in position is what it's about.  The more you can do that, the better off you're going to be.  I put myself in position, played great all week, and so I feel like my game's in a good spot and really looking forward to the U.S. Open.
