Q. Just talk about the victory today, winning 3-up against Aaron.
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played really solid today.  Four birdies, no bogeys.  Everything is super solid, hit a lot of good shots.  I played really well.
Q. Just thoughts on playing tomorrow, too, heading into there potentially for who advances?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I'm excited for that pairing since I saw it.  Obviously I've never played him in match play.  He's got a great record.  But I'm really looking forward to it, I'm excited and something you think about when you're a little kid, being paired against him and should be really fun.
Q. And he's also the Presidents Cup captain and I know you'd like to be on that team, is that something you've talked about at all?
PATRICK CANTLAY: That's one of my goals.  I'd love to play a Presidents Cup team.  I've never played a Presidents Cup.  I played the Walker Cup and it's a lot of fun.  So it will be good to get out there tomorrow, spend some time with him.  The Presidents Cup team has obviously dominated the U.S. side.  So it would be fun to be a part of that.
Q. And a good opportunity to show him your game, too?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, sure.
