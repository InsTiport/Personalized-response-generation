  Q. How would you assess your match today?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   I feel like it shouldn't be that hard.  I was 8- or 9-under par.  I played great.  Didn't make any bogeys, and it was all the way to the bitter end really sweating it out.  I think sometimes that's just match play, and it's whatever it takes to win that day.  I'm happy with what I did today, it's the best I can do, and I'm looking forward to now.
 Q. Had this been stroke play today, do you think you would have gotten to 16 or 17 and felt very relaxed, as opposed to coming down the stretch in this situation?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, right.  The interesting thing about this tournament is it feels like the last round every day.  If you're comfortable with that feeling, then it's to your advantage.  Fortunately, I feel like I like that feeling.  I feel like it brings out the best in me.  So I don't mind if it's close at the end.  I like it.  It's fun.  That's why I play.
 Matches like today, when you're up against an opponent who plays really, really well and you play just a little better, it's really satisfying.
 Q. Does it also help like when you guys are both playing -- you said you made eight or nine birdies and yet you had to go all the way to 18 -- does it help when you're both playing well, making sure you're keeping that intensity up?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   It does keep that intensity up.  You like to think that if you were way up on somebody you'd step on their throat and still make eight or nine birdies, but you do see some of that in match play.  I've played, between Amateurs and this tournament, sometimes both of you just get going, and because you reset every hole, it kind of spurs you on.  It's like a cart with no governor.  You've just got to keep making birdies because you're only 1-up or you're tied.  So that was kind of like what today was.
 Q. Can you talk about the putt on 15 and your reaction when -- I don't even know if you know whose ball that was.
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, it just kind of came out of the corner of my eye as I was taking it back, and I didn't stop.  I hit a good putt, actually, and I thought it would have broke.  But that's golf on TOUR; weird stuff happens every day.
 Q. Did you find out who hit it?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   No.
 Q. It was Jordan.
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   Was it?  I'll give him crap about it.
