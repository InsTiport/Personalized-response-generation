PATRICK CANTLAY: It was a hard-fought match all day. We played really well, both sides. Fortunately we came out on top. That putt was just a little right-to-left and really fast, so just had to get it started.
Q. Been a while since you put a point on the board, but you were able to do it. Do you feel like you can build some momentum off this victory?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: I sure hope. So I think it was nice to see my boy P. here with some emotion. I think it just shows how much it means to us.
Q. You have 20 points up for grabs Saturday and Sunday. What is your attitude heading into the weekend given what the Internationals have thrown your guys?
PATRICK CANTLAY: It's only a third over. It's the second day we got to see this golf course and we're going to know it even better tomorrow, and I think we're going to come out firing.
Q. Did you have a sense of how big and crucial that putt was for your team?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, ours was a hard-fought match today and we need to flip the script a little bit. We need to get going and hopefully that point on the board gets a little fire in these guys and we finish out these matches strong.
Q. So many changes in momentum, a couple missed short putts but also some great clutch putts. How do you keep so focused to try to grind out these points?
XANDER SCHAUFFELE: Just partner. We understand each other's games, and I just fed off of him. At no point were we down on each other. We just fed off each other. Like he said, it was a tough match and we're just happy to get that point out there.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Xander just played solid all day. We just had a hard fought match. It was tough out there. I'm sure they are all going to be like that the rest of the way; we've got two tomorrow.
