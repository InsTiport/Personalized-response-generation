Q. You're headed to Atlanta and the Tour Championship.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah.  Feels good.  You know, nice to play all the Playoff events.  It means a lot for next week.  I can pick my schedule and, you know, it's great.
I played well today.  The golf course was harder but Leishman doesn't make it seem that way.  I saw him hit a good shot on 17.  I'm happy with the way I played today and the way I kept my composure and kept my cool even when things weren't going my way on the backside.
Q. Did you know what that putt was for on the 18th green?  Did you figure you had to birdie the hole?  What was your thought process?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I figured a birdie would be close.  I knew I was out.  I didn't know it would for sure get me in or anything but I knew it was really close and I definitely needed it.
Q. I think you making the Tour Championship with just 12 events on your schedule is just phenomenal.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah.  I picked my spots.  I played really well this year up to this point.  I feel like I'm just getting started, just starting to get rolling and getting comfortable playing.  I'm playing really well.  My game is in good shape and looking forward to Atlanta.
Q. Patrick, just your thoughts of making it all the way to Atlanta.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it's good.  It was definitely a goal of mine for the year.  I didn't play as well as I would like today but played good enough it seems like and it's a big deal for the rest of my season and that way -- or next season, that way I can set my schedule next year.  It's big for me.
Q. Given all you've been through with the injury and everything, just how big emotionally is that for you?
PATRICK CANTLAY: You know, the way I've been playing I expected to play well this week and I expected to make it to the Tour Championship.
I don't know if it set in exactly yet but it will definitely be nice when I get to sit at home at the end of this year after next week and pick all the tournaments I want to play.
Q. Do you know what you had to do on 18?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I figured a birdie would be close.  I didn't hit it close enough to really give myself a good chance at making that eagle putt.  I figured a birdie would be really close.  I knew I needed to at least make birdie.
Q. What did that mean to you to execute and think you need a birdie and it played out?
PATRICK CANTLAY: It feels really good.  It's what you practice for so many years for.  It's what I practice for so long for and it's nice to see that putt go in on the last hole.
Been working really hard and couple years ago I was in not a great spot and all the hard work I've done seems to have -- it's starting to payoff.
Q. How long do you think it will take to hit you that this could be career-changing?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I don't know about that.
Q. From a schedule standpoint.
PATRICK CANTLAY: It's such a process.  You go out and try to win every week.  Take care of yourself not only one week in particular does the trick but it's going to be nice being in all the Majors and feeling like I can compete with the best players in the world, getting the chance to do it on a week-in, week-out basis is going to be great.
