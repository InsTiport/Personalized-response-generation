 Q.   Tell us what your plans are and how your round went today, I guess future tournaments?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Well, I'm into L.A. next week and I'm into purity Rickie in a couple more weeks and I'm in a Panama on the Web.com coming up.   Today was good.   A lot of solid shots.   Just didn't make very much, and I missed a couple short putts, a couple par saves, a couple short par saves, that's about it.  
   
 Q.   How does it feel to be playing some good golf this week after missing a couple cuts to start the year?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   It feels good.   I didn't feel like I was that off in the two tournaments that I played.   I didn't make a lot of putts, and I didn't ‑‑   just things were not going my way, but I didn't feel too off, so it doesn't come as that much of a surprise or anything, but it feels good.   
   
 Q.   Turning pro last year, do you feel more getting out there and normal now on TOUR?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   It felt pretty normal since I started.   I feel really comfortable out here and I feel comfortable in my own skin and playing golf at the highest level.   So yeah, I feel great.   It's fun being out here.   
   
 Q.   How many times have you played Spy before today?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Twice, maybe once eight years ago and once on Sunday.  
   
 Q.   What happened eight years ago?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I just played up here with my dad.  
   
 Q.   Do you remember the first time you saw the fourth hole, the fourth green there?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I mean, I'm sure it was‑‑ yeah, when I was like 12 years old with my dad.   
It's a good hole, I don't mind it.   There's really only one hole location, back left, down there.   But a couple good shots, and stay clear of trouble there and you can make a three or a really big number.   
   
 Q.   Is there a number you hit to off the tee?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, whatever hits the fairway.   If it's a little down, it's usually a hybrid, if not, maybe it's a 3‑wood.
