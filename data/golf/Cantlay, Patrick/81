Q.   Can you first talk about the day and what happened?   What do you feel like you could have done better?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Well, I hit it poorly today and left myself in some bad spots, and unfortunately I just didn't play that well. 

Q.   Any mud balls or anything? 
PATRICK CANTLAY:   A couple, yeah, but everyone is getting them. 

Q.   I know you guys are long‑term, you're not concerned about one week.   Is there anything you guys have been working on before this as far as swing stuff? 
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, just little things here and there, making sure everything is on track, just working on everything and trying to have a good learn set out there.

Q.   What stands out from the week as far as highlights, on course, off course, just what do you remember?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Just the whole experience I'll remember for sure, nothing in particular.   Staying in the Crow's Nest was fun.

Q.   You stayed there the whole week?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah.

Q.   You said you didn't hit it very well today.   What exactly was it that you were doing wrong, do you know? 
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I just wasn't striking it solid.

Q.   Were you losing it one way or the other?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, both ways. 

Q.   Did you try to make any adjustments in the round?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I just tried to stick to my routine and have good tempo out there. 

Q.   What's the difference right now do you think between the past couple of months and the good play from the summer in your game?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I still feel a little rusty out on the golf course.   I haven't played a bunch of tournaments, and so I just think playing the full schedule this spring at college events, we've got a bunch coming up, and I'll get really sharp and comfortable out there.

Q.   What's next for you guys?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Pasatiempo next week.

Q.   Another MacKenzie design?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Uh‑huh.

Q.   First time there?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Played last year. 

Q.   When you play more tournaments, what kind of rust shakes off?   What gets better as you play in more tournaments and get in that rhythm?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I think everything sharpens up, your distances, and like I said, for me feeling comfortable is a big thing.   I think that happens the more tournaments you play.

Q.   We were talking to Graham, he said this course he has a hard time, doesn't really suit him really well.   How do you feel this course suits you?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I think it suits me really well.   I really like all the tee shots.   The tee shots look good to my eye, and I like rolling it on these greens.

Q.   When you leave here do you look at it as a learning experience?   Are you a little bit disappointed?   What's the takeaway emotionally?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I think any time you get to play this tournament you learn a lot, and I definitely learned a lot this week, and I'll take it with me going forward.   The two rounds in general out here, you know, I got a lot of notes and I got a lot of places where you can leave it and places where you can't leave it for when I come back. 

Q.   You have six or seven between here and the U.S. Open?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Something like that.

Q.   How much will you spend at Olympic between now and then?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I might go up there once, once or twice, probably no more than that.

Q.   Any history there?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I've never played there.

Q.   You played with Zach, obviously he won here and he knows a lot of the places not to miss it or to miss it, depending on how you look at it.   Did you learn anything from watching him go around here for two days?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, just that there's a lot of different ways to play the golf course.   He plays to his strengths and wedges it a lot, and he's really good at wedging it. 

Q.   Any weird wind gusts or anything catch your ball today?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   No, nothing‑‑

Q.   Nothing crazy?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah.
