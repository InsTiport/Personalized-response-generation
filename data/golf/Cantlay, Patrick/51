 Q.  How was the round?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played really well today.  I hit a lot of greens and when I missed, I got up-and-down most of the time.  I missed a short putt on 12, and made a nice birdie on 6 from the rough.  So you know, it was all and all pretty steady today and I think more golf like that come the weekend, make a couple putts, I'll be right there.   
 Q.  How were the conditions this morning compared to the afternoon yesterday?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: They are kind of similar.  The greens are better and a little faster this morning.  About same amount of wind.  I don't know if the wind is going to pick up or not.  It was windy the first hole today, just a little different wind and it shifted.   
 Q.  How do you prepare going into the weekend?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, going to hit a couple putts and rest up.  Early morning this morning.  Woke up at 4:00, so get some rest tonight and come out tomorrow.
