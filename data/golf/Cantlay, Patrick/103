   THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome our fourth semifinalist, Patrick Cantlay. We've been doing interviews, so I don't know how long it took you to win the match, but congratulations.
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Thank you.

 Q. Tell us how being a semifinalist feels to you? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Feels great. I'm very excited and very happy to be here.

 Q. Tell us what you thought perhaps was the key to winning the quarterfinal match? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: The key today was not getting down on myself. Just letting me play my game. It's very important to stick to my game plan and just do my routine and accept the shot that I hit.

 Q. Your game plan is that a conservative game plan or is it aggressive when you can? Not to give away any secrets, but?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Obviously it depends on the golf hole and the conditions and the flagstick and how I'm feeling. So really no conservative or aggressive, just overall how I feel and what I think the correct shot is.

 Q. It's been a steady summer as far as consistent good play. What is behind that and taking the next step from junior to Amateur level pretty well? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Well, I've played a couple of amateur tournaments last summer, so I knew what to expect this summer coming out, I felt comfortable and felt like I belonged. So just doing my own thing, and really just stick to my game and not worry about anybody else.

 Q. Saw you turn your back on 18 when he had that putt, just couldn't watch, I guess, huh?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I couldn't do anything, so looking at it or not didn't really make a difference.

 Q. You also had a putt that went in on 17. At that point are you sort of readying yourself to win? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: To win the hole? 

 Q. Well, if he had won, he would have been --
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Oh, he had a putt to win on 17.

 Q. Right. On those types of situations are you just sort of holding your breath? You can't do anything. 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Well, the moment's there and over really fast. There are a lot of things going through your head just standing there and waiting for whatever happens to happen.

 Q. How did you feel about the way you were coming in this week? Did you feel confident in your game that something like this was ahead of you here? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I felt very good coming into this week. I played well at scratch play last week. Just everything so far has come together this week. I'm hitting it pretty good, so, yeah.

 Q. Is there a particular aspect of your game that you feel has been dialed in this week that also helps explain getting to the semis here? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: I've made a good amount of putts. For the most part made all my short ones to mid-range ones. But, yeah, hit it fairly good off the tee as well. My putting myself on the correct side of the fairway and making sure I don't short side myself off the tee.

 Q. After your large number of high school wins or junior wins, which would you classify as your best and the one you really hang your hat on? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: I'd have to say the State Championship this year. I was very excited and my team was there and my coach was there, my dad was there, you know, my family was there. So I would have to say that one. It was a great experience.

 Q. Have you had much experience on this type of course before, and if not, what do you make of it? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Not competitively. I haven't played on a course like this. But about five or six years ago I took a trip with my grandparents to England, Ireland and Scotland, and I played St. Andrews and Royal County Downs and a couple other courses. So I had seen places like this, similar. I had seen places like this that resemble it a little bit. 
 But this place is completely different than any golf course I've ever seen. Just the slopes and the shots you have to hit. Just the feel you get when you're out there. So I like it. I think it definitely rewards good shots. You know, sometimes it penalizes mediocre ones. So it's a very good test of golf.

 Q. Jamie has become known for working with TOUR guys. How long have you worked together and what kind of advice has he given you this week? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: I started working with him when I was nine. He's been a great relationship, and he's really helped me move forward in every aspect of my game. 
 He came up yesterday and, you know, just really working on doing my own thing, doing my own gig and making sure I just stay neutral and do everything very slow and stick to my game and my routine.

 Q. You said this place is different than any course you'd seen. Have you had to adjust your game to be able to play to what this course asks you to do? Did you feel like I've already got the game to play on this kind of a course? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: I feel I can hit most every shot. I feel like this golf course makes you hit almost every single shot in your arsenal, low, high, right to left, left to right. 
 So it's just taking what I've learned how to do and practiced and learning what holes and what shots that I need to use the correct one.

 Q. You're probably young enough to have other interests in life. So what else do you do? What other things do you interest you other than golf? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Hanging out with friends, girls, ping pong. I like to sleep. Other than golf I feel like I'm pretty normal guy my age.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Not everyone plays golf, so, yeah.

 Q. Could you talk about your par putt at 15, how big that was, because at that point you had already lost 14 and it was about what, maybe 10 or 11 feet? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, 12 feet or so. I just read it just like all the other ones and tried to put a good stroke on it. It went in. 
 I stressed out myself. I shouldn't have left myself in that bunker. And I was more worried about the yardage than I was the line and I just pushed a little bit. But just like every other putt out there.

 Q. Peter Uihlein is your opponent in the semifinals. Your reaction to that? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: He's a great player. But I'm going to play the golf course and stick to my game. Not worry about who I'm playing and we'll see what happens.
