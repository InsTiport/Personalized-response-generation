  Q. Patrick, how would you best explain the experience today playing with Tiger Woods?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: It was fun. I had a good time out there and really enjoyed myself.  
  
  Q. Any nerves or are you past that point?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Same nerves as any time. You have nerves on the first tee, at least I do. And settled down there and had a bunch of fun.  
  
  Q. What were the conditions like as compared to when you played here last year?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Soggier, for sure, and less windy. And then we got some rain, which I didn't last year in the college event.   
 So tougher. It was playing longer, and the wind was opposite.   
  
  Q. How did he play compared to when you two played the other day?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: It's hard to say, just because it's a different situation.  
  
  Q. Yeah, yeah.   
 PATRICK CANTLAY: But yeah, he played how he played.  
  
  Q. Were you surprised?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No. I mean I wasn't really worried. I didn't have any expectations for what he was going to do or what anybody else was going to do except for myself.  
  
  Q. The fact that you beat Tiger by a couple of shots mean anything to you?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No. It's the first round of a tournament, so it doesn't mean anything.  
  
  Q. The short putt on 13 was really the only kind of blemish of the day. Did you just kind of push it a little?  
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah. I pushed it a little bit. It came off funny off the putter blade. It was wet and hit a bump or something. I don't know. I guess it just happens. Hit enough of them and you won't make every one.
