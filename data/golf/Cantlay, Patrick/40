Q. Really good round coming in.  How was the course today compared to the first two days?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it was just a little firmer.  Other than that, it was pretty much the same.  Weather has been good all week, and I think it will be a little firmer tomorrow.
Q. What do you think about some of the guys coming in later in the day?  How was it with the cold?  Seems like it's starting to warm up a little bit now.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I think the weather has been pretty much the same all week.  I think we're going to get more of this tomorrow.  Maybe the course will firm up a little bit, but not too much.
Q. What was the difference for you today compared to the first two days as far as your game?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I hit the ball better today for sure.  Hit more fairways and hit more shots close, which, you know, you need to do.  But other than that, I just hit it a little better today.
Q. Heard a couple of the pin placements, especially on 17, tough to get to.  What are your thoughts?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, 17 is tough.  16 is on probably too much slope.  But, you know, other than that, course is -- that's just Pebble Beach.  There's a lot of greens with a lot of slope, and you have to expect that and try and leave your golf ball accordingly.
