Q. Patrick, just nice to birdie last hole.
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played really well today. I didn't make as many putts as I would have liked but hit the ball solid and thought my way around the golf course very well.  I know I'm 6 back but I played well today.
Q. Did you think the rain that went through really changed the conditions for you guys that went out later?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Not much.  It's been soft all week.  I don't think the golf course played much different than any other days except the greens might have been a little slower today just with the rain.
Q. Was it difficult to stay within your own game with what Justin was doing up ahead of you?
PATRICK CANTLAY: No.  I mean it's kind of the same mindset, right?  The golf course is playing easy.  It's trying to make as many birdies as possible.  That would have been the case regardless of how well he was playing.
But, like I said, I played well.  I didn't roll in as many putts as I would have liked.  I had some chances and wasn't able to convert.  All in all, it was a good day.
Q. What is your game plan for tomorrow with the ground you have to make up?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Same.  Get off to a hot start.  There's some birdie holes in the first five holes and try to get hot with the putter and make as many birdies as I can.
