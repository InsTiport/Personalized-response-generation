 Q. What a difference a day makes. Can you talk about the differences between yesterday and today? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it's easier playing from the fairway. I drove it better today, and I really felt comfortable on the greens and started rolling some putts in. 

 Q. What was the difference for you on the back nine? I think you had five birdies. 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I started off really quick. I made like a 25-, 30-footer on 10, and then I rolled it from off the green maybe 45 feet, rolled that one in on 11, and hit it close on 12, so got off to a really quick start and then coasted in.

 Q. Do you feel differently when you get a couple of putts to sink like that?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it really puts you at ease when you go to the next hole. I felt really comfortable on the greens, so I think that helped.

 Q. Can you talk about the double? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah. Well, I didn't hit too many -- I actually hit some good shots on that hole, and then I just made a mess of it around the greens and three-putted. But yeah, just got to put everything behind you and go on to the next hole real fresh.

 Q. You seemed pretty calm out there. Is that how you were feeling inside? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Not quite feeling that way inside. But yeah, for the most part, I felt calm and comfortable out there.

 Q. Do you have any kind of timeline for turning pro and has your performance here made any difference? Are you thinking about it any more now after shooting --
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No, my timeline is after I graduate from UCLA.

 Q. So this changes nothing?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No.

 Q. You must feel really good about how you played being even after 36. Do you happen to know what course Rory McIlroy is playing?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: I don't know what Rory is at.

 Q. 12-under. 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: That's pretty good. 

 Q. Can you put that into perspective?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, he's obviously playing great. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can this week and get better.

 Q. Did you get much sleep last night?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I slept fine last night. Quick turn-around. I played late, so I was tired.

 Q. Any kind of a switch that you made today compared to yesterday?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No, same approach, same game plan, just hit it a little better. 

 Q. You said earlier coming into this week you really had no expectations in terms of the scores, I guess. How do you feel right now? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Same way. I'm just going to try and play the golf course as best I can. It's a great experience. It's a lot of fun, and I'm just going to try and learn from the other guys and learn from the experience.

 Q. What have you learned through 36 holes?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Just that I can compete and my game is good enough to play the golf course. 

 Q. What would it mean to you to be low amateur at the U.S. Open?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: So much. All the history that's behind the U.S. Open, and to play well would be great. 

 Q. Can you talk a little bit about the confidence you've gained as far as continuing to play in college after being a guy that makes the cut in the U.S. Open? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I had some confidence before I came here this week, but yeah, it definitely -- it makes you feel good about the future, and hopefully one day I can be playing as a pro. 

 Q. What did you say your future plans were?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: To graduate.

 Q. So the earliest you would entertain going pro would be what? 
 PATRICK CANTLAY: After I get a degree.

 Q. This year you're talking about?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: No, I just finished my freshman year, so I have three more years at UCLA.

 Q. So no matter what you did, you'd stick it out at UCLA?
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah.
