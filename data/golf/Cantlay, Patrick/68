PATRICK CANTLAY: It was nice to make birdie on the last to win the match.  It was a hard fought match.  Played well most of the day.  Made a couple of errors, but all in all I played pretty good.  And I'm happy to get it done.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I feel good.  I feel for the first time here I'm learning the golf course a little better.
