Q. Patrick, just some thoughts on your 5-under, 65 today.  Looked like maybe a few less greens hit according to the computer.  Scrambling pretty good today.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Oh, I guess.  Actually felt like I hit it really good.  I came out firing.  Hit a lot of good shots.  Rolled a couple medium-length putts in, and then I kind of stalled in the middle.  Made a bogey on 10.  Kind of got a bad break.  Birdied 12 and 13, and then couldn't get any on the way in.
It was close, really close to what I wanted.  Obviously I'm going to need a really low one tomorrow, but that's the plan:  come out firing again tomorrow.
Q. A little bit different playing in the sunshine?  Course condition still a little wet underneath?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, still fairly wet out there and taking really big divots and a few mud balls.  That's to be expected with the weather, and I'm sure it'll dry up and be even better tomorrow.
Q. When you show up here tomorrow what kind of score do you think you're going to have?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I think if I can get to 15 it'll be about right.  Usually the winning score is about second round -- one and a half times what the second round is.  It was 11-under, so going to be right around 14, 15, 16, 17-under.  If I can get to like 15-under I think I got a chance.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
PATRICK CANTLAY: Oh, yeah.  A lot of places are like that.  If you can get out early and get good greens and calm and wet you can shoot a really good score.  This place you can shoot a really good score, but if you're up near the top it's hard to make a bunch of birdies.
Hopefully come out tomorrow and get off to a hot start and see what happens.
