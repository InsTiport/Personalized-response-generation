 Q.  Patrick, wonderful performance this week. Just take us through those final 5'7".  
PATRICK CANTLAY: I thought I made a good stroke. Just broke a little more than I thought. The first one was really slow.   
 Q.  What do you take away from the entirety of this week?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played really well. I hit a lot of putts that I thought were going to go in today and didn't.   
All in all, playing really well. I'll take all this momentum into next week.   
 Q.  Patrick, obviously tough not win that. Played very good this week.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I did. Obviously it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. That's two years in a row here. I played well all week. I'll take that momentum the rest of the year.   
 Q.  Consolation, two seconds and a win here. Pretty good place for you. Thanks for your time. Well played.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Thank you.   
 Q.  What did you see on the tee shot on 17?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: I thought I had a good number for 9-iron and hit it really solid and must have caught a gust. Came up quite a bit short of my number.   
 Q.  What about the putt in regulation on 18?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Hit a great putt. Thought it was in and it just stayed high.
