Q. A 69 to follow yesterday's 68.  How do you feel about your play today?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Today was a little bit of a struggle for me.  I didn't feel like I was swinging a great pace.  I had to figure it out and made a couple of birdies at the end which kept me in the golf tournament.
Q. One of them was a chip in on the last?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yes, a tough little lie there.  It came off perfect, and went in.  It was a nice bonus.
Q. You finished fourth last year.  Is it a course that suits your style of play?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Definitely.  I like this golf course a lot.  It's in great shape.  And puts a serious premium of driving the ball in the fairway, which is one of my strengths.  I feel comfortable around here, and it's nice to be here.  I feel like I know the lines and what to expect.
The golf course was really scorable.  It's soft and the greens are much better in the morning so I felt like a good score was out there.  And there were some good scores that were shot.
Q. You hit it well.  What are you working on now at the moment?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Not working on a lot.  I feel like I'm swinging well.  Today I was a little out of pace but played the back nine better as far as swinging it a little better in rhythm.
And I feel really comfortable around the golf course.  Starting to feel very familiar for me and getting comfortable with some of the shots.  I really like the place.  So I'm starting to feel really comfortable out here.
Q. That matters, right?  It fits your eye?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, big time.  Just feeling comfortable where you need to leave the golf ball, where you need to hit shots.  There's a lot of hole locations out here that you need to know where to feed the ball in from.  And I'm starting to do it almost second nature now.
