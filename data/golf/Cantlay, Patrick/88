 Q.   You are no stranger to mixing up with the pros, shooting low scores.   What were your expectations as you took the course and now as you walk off minus 1 on the leaderboard?   Were you pleased with your performance relative to your expectations?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I didn't really have any expectations out there.   I just tried to go out and do my best.   Yeah, I'm pleased with 1‑under.   I think that was good.   It was playing tough today.   There was a bunch of mud balls up there.   The wind was swirling.   
It could have been a few better.   I left ‑‑ I 3‑putted twice.   Pretty pleased.  
   
 Q.   How many times in your life as a kid playing golf did you dream about playing Augusta?  
PATRICK CANTLAY:   All the time.   It's such a great event with so much history, and I'm just happy to be a part of it.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to post on your blog today?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   We'll see.   We'll see.   I don't know.   You know, just how awesome it is and how thankful that I am to be here and that I'm pleased and looking forward to the next couple of days.  
   
 Q.   What was the most awesome part of it?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Just the experience and the fans are so great out here.   No one is running around and for the most part they are really well behaved and supportive.  
   
 Q.   Can you stay on this leaderboard all four rounds, you think?   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   I think so, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Best of luck to you.   
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Thank you.
