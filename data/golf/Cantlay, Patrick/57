 Q.  All right, I'm alongside Patrick Cantlay just watching the end of this tournament, potentially the end as Bryson hit a solid shot.  Your thoughts on your efforts today that looked like they may come up a little short.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I played really well today.  I made a bunch of birdies, which was my plan; I stayed aggressive all day.  Just kind of came up a little short.   
 Q.  Take me through what happened there at 17; strange little bunker shot.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Tricky shot.  When I dug my left foot in it didn't have a bunch of sand, and then obviously when I hit my shot there was more sand under the ball and didn't anticipate that.   
It was a tricky one and I hit a poor shot.   
 Q.  Kind of untimely as Bryson was making eagle on the previous hole, but solid birdie at the end to force him to have to make a par here at 18.  Thanks for the time.  
 Obviously a very good defense of your title.  A little disappointed, but you've got to be pleased with the way you played this week.   
PATRICK CANTLAY: I really got off to a slow start Friday, or Thursday and Friday, and that was too much to overcome.  Played really well this weekend and I'm proud of that.   
 Q.  A little bit offline there on 17.  Foot left that ball kicks onto the green instead the kicks right.  How difficult was that bunker shot?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, it was tricky one.  Obviously a bunch slope and I couldn't really tell exactly how much sand was under the ball.  It was just a poor shot at the wrong time.
