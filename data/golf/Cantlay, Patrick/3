Q. What happened on your first hole today?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I hit not a bad drive.  It would have just been in the left rough.  And then not really sure where it went.  It might have clipped a tree and couldn't find the golf ball.  So it's not a great way to start the day.
Q. Describe the round after that.  Obviously you were able to come back after that start.
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, it wasn't that bad after that.  I didn't make very many putts, hit a lot of good putts, and the greens, like always, are just bumpy and wasn't able to get many to go in.  But all in all, I played pretty good today, just obviously two shots worse, just not finding the golf ball.
Q. Conditions a little different than yesterday, a little tougher today out here?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, to be expected and hard to control distances with the balls ripping back so much on the greens and lots of mud balls.  I had at least three or four of those today.  So it's just, you know, it's kind of what happens if you get all the bad breaks in one day.
Q. Do you still feel pretty comfortable with your game going forward?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, I'm hitting the ball really well and starting the ball on the putting green where I'm looking, so should be a good weekend.
Q. Putting today just okay?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, not bad.  It's really hard to make putts if they don't roll really true.  And you get above the hole a little bit and you have to, the greens are on so much pitch that you have to hit it cup speed and if they don't roll true and they hit a bump or two it's hard to make putts.
Q. Is it self-defensive at times?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Not defensive.  It's just, because the greens are on so much pitch, if you find yourself above the hole, if you're going to hit it a foot by or whatever, that is a really, really small stroke.  So it's rolling for so long that it can bump a lot easier.
