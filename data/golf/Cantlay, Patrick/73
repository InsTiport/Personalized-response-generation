 Q.  3-under 67 on your card, no bogeys.  Your thoughts on how you played today?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played really well today.  I didn't make as many putts as I would have liked, but overall, I hit it really well and fought my way around the golf course well, too.  A couple more days like this would be good.   
 Q.  What's the course like?  You always wonder how the pros are going to play first time out.  What did you think of the setup and the difficulty of it today?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Setup is fair if you hit the fairways.  Rough is long, especially if it's just off the fairways.  Greens are fast but they are holding right now.  I was the first group out, so it's probably a little more soft than other groups will see.   
But I think the golf course is great.  It rewards really good shots and penalizes mediocre ones.   
 Q.  You hit 11 fairways, 14 greens, but four-for-four scrambling.  So you were able to get it up-and-down when you had to?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, and a few of those were putts from the fringe.  So that makes it easy, too.   
 Q.  You're 78th coming in, haven't played a lot, nine events.  You have a little spending money to get to Atlanta eventually but you're in a safe spot with a chance to move up?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Not worrying about it.  Just trying to go out and play my best and win every golf tournament you play in, and that's all you can try and do and let the rest of that stuff take care of itself.
