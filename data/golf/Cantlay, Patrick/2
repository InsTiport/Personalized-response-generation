  Q. How fulfilling and difficult have these matches been for you?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   They've both been extremely difficult.  Sometimes match play is like that.  You really just -- depending on the day, you've got to bring it harder than other days.  I played really well and I'm happy with where my game is at, and I'm just going to keep plugging away and have the same game plan the next couple days.
 Q. You were at worst going to be in a playoff for the first time ever to get through in this championship.  Does that give you a little bit of breathing room headed into tomorrow?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   I don't think so.  My mind frame will be exactly the same.  Hopefully the match is a little easier, although I'm note expecting it to be.  This golf course when it's soft like this, there's a bunch of birdies, so I'll just go out and be aggressive when I can and play safe when I have to.
