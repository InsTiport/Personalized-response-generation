Q. Solid finish to the tournament here this week.  You came into the week in the Wyndham Rewards Top-10.  Did you have that pressure off of you in the first event of the Playoffs?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I played well on the weekend.  Made a couple silly mistakes but other than that played really solid.  Didn't get off to a great start, 1-under on the first day.  But all in all, solid tournament and played well today, so built momentum for the next couple of events.
Q. Anything in particular that you're taking away or honing in on for next week?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Every part of my game is starting to feel better as the week went on.  I've been trying to work on the right things and trying to stay rested.  It will be more of the same.  I've heard the golf course next week is really good. I've never been there but looking forward to it.
Q. Take us into your mindset because we talked to a lot of guys that have been on the bubble and they have been talking about how important today was for them.  For you, Top-10 guy, what approach have you been taking?
PATRICK CANTLAY: Same approach.  I try to treat every event as its own event, so try and do as well as you can.  That sounds clichÃ©, but that's the only way I feel like I know how to do it and wherever the points ends up, they end up.
