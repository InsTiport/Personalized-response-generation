   PATRICK CANTLAY: Not nervous really at all after last week at -- you know, not unnerving at all.  
  
  Q. Tell us about how the golf course played for you today, then. 3-under par, solid opening round.   
 PATRICK CANTLAY: The golf course is good. It's in real good condition after all the rain.   
 The greens are a little slow, but they're really true. If you have a good roll on them, they'll go in.  
  
  Q. Very solid eagle out there at 13, too. Tell us about that.   
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah. It got me started. I hit a really good drive and then hit a hybrid to like 15 feet and rolled it in.  
  
  Q. Patrick, keep on keeping on. I wish you the best.   
 PATRICK CANTLAY: Thank you.
