Q. Seemed like for a stretch there you had it rolling and then a lot of like near misses before that, but a good way to finish, to be sure.
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, overall it was solid.  It was nice to make a couple birdies right after making a bogey right off the bat.  I played really solid today, I didn't make any big mistakes, I didn't make any real mistakes.  I just didn't make as many birdies as I could have.  Again I still had some chances, all in all it was a good round.
Q. Any familiarity with this course?  You played out here more than a few times?
PATRICK CANTLAY: I feel comfortable out here, I've been out here plenty to practice and play.  I played the tournament before in 2013 and it's always nice to be in California, nice to be playing here.
Q. You seem to have a nice contingent through the day.  Is it family, buddies, friends?
PATRICK CANTLAY: A lot of guys from Virginia Country Club and some family and friends came out, made the short drive over from Orange County, L.A., Long Beach area, and it's nice to see them out and it's good to have the support.
Q. Obviously this tournament is well known for making a lot of birdies, lower scores, but you put yourself in a good position for tomorrow, is that on your mind at all today as a strategy to put yourself in that day four position?
PATRICK CANTLAY: This tournament's all about making as many birdies as you can and staying aggressive and playing the tougher holes smart and then taking advantage of the birdie holes, which there are a lot, especially when the weather's this nice.  So, yeah.
