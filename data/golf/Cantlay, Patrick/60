 Q.  Talk about your round.  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, I started off slow, really couldn't get out of the gate.  I kind of stumbled on 2 and 3, settled down, made some birdies.  Really didn't make anything today but I played really solid.  Again, hit the ball well, drove it well and I'm in a good spot for tomorrow?   
 Q.  Currently tied for sixth.  The guys haven't gotten too far ahead of you so just comment on your game plan for tomorrow?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Yeah, same as today, fairways and greens, and if I can get some putts to go, there's a low one out there for sure.  I keep hitting good putts.  I just haven't had a day where I made a bunch of putts but it's coming.   
 Q.  You know all about advancing through the Playoffs.  Is that on your mind?  Not that you have to advance but is that on your mind just in terms of trying to better the position?  
PATRICK CANTLAY: Not really worried about it.  I'm just worried about trying to play as well as I can this week and I think that's the key.  Take every week as an individual week, do your best to win, and if you win a couple times, that's all there is to it.
