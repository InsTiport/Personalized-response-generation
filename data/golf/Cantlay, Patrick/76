Q.   It looks like a pretty solid round and especially your back nine there.   You strung together five straight birdies.   Do you feel pretty good about the round?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, a little hiccup on 18.   I missed a few short putts, but other than that it was a really good round.   I struck it really well and I hit a lot of shots close and, yeah, it feels good to get off to a good start.

Q.   Especially that little string on your back nine, is that a nice thing to kind of finish with?   I know it wasn't your final nine holes, but a nice little stretch there to carry momentum into tomorrow?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   Yeah, definitely it's always nice to get off to a good start.

Q.   How about the conditions out here?   People are known for going low here, great conditions, nice to play in this kind of weather and these kind of conditions?
PATRICK CANTLAY:   It's always nice to play in perfect conditions. 
I don't think you can ask for anything more than this.
