  Q. Tight match all the way down to the last 18th green.  You make birdie here to close out Brian Harmon.  I thought maybe the eagle at 12, that kind of turned things around, you went 1-up there and closed him out?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   It did, yeah, I didn't make any bogeys today, I made an eagle, I made a bunch of birdies and still sweating it down to the last hole.  Brian played great and it felt like I could never really get any momentum, I would win a hole, tie it up and then he would make a birdie and go back 1-up.  Until the 12th hole.  And then that chip in from over there where you're just looking to get it close and get up-and-down and then fortunately it went in.  And then the birdie on the next hole was really key on keeping that 1-up advantage and then it was just enough going in.
 Q. Great putt at the end to close him out.  Carlos Ortiz won in your group and you play him tomorrow.  Thoughts on the matchup and give us an idea of the state of your game?
 PATRICK CANTLAY:   My game's good.  I think, this golf course, you have to drive it in the fairway and then you can be aggressive.  There's a lot of birdie holes out here, especially with the greens being as soft as they are and I think it suits my game so I am looking forward to tomorrow.
