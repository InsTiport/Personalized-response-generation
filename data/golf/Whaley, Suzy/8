Q. What does this week mean to you overall?
SUZY WHALEY: Yeah, it's an incredibly special week.  It means the world to me to be able to compete, to play in something that's a first, and then to have women here who made my career possible, to be on the same lengths with them is tremendous.
Q. What do you think this event is going to do for the future of senior women's golf?
SUZY WHALEY: You know, I think that's hard to say, but certainly this has been an evolution in time, right?  We've been waiting for this for a very long time, and we thank the USGA for giving us the opportunity and certainly hope we have many more to come.
