 Q.  Happy with the start?  
FELIPE AGUILAR: Quite happy.  It was very difficult golf today, really windy after the second hole.  You have to be really patient out here, but this is just the first day.  The course is playing really difficult.  You have some holes that you can actually reach the green in one, but if you miss it on the wrong side, it's not very easy to make an up-and-down from there.   
But I played, we can say easily today, we didn't make too many mistakes except for two bogeys on 9 and 18, but you're going to make some bogeys out here.  You have to make sure you make some birdie, also.   
 Q.  How difficult was it at times?  
FELIPE AGUILAR: Well, hitting four 3-woods on par 3s; 18 usually is a hole that we can reach it in two, and then I hit a driver and then I hit a 2-iron second shot and a 4-iron third shot and barely made it, just on the front of the green.   
It's really, really windy.  It's difficult to stand still on the putting green and obviously that makes it a little more difficult just trying to figure out what you're going to do, and the breaks.   
It's been really cold this morning and this wind, when the sun is not out, it gets really cold.  I might as well stay a little bit warm.   
 Q.  I appreciate your focus will be very much on The Scottish Open, but how much is the thought of earning an Open spot for next week?  
FELIPE AGUILAR: That's in the back of my mind.  I'm just worried about what's going to happen tomorrow.  I just finished the first round and still have 75 per cent of the rounds to go.  If that comes along, it will be great.  It will be awesome, but it's not even on my mind yet.
