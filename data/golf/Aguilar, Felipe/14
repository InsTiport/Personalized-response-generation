Q.   How do you reflect on a second round 67? 
    FELIPE AGUILAR:   Good, I played pretty solid today.   I fought against a little muddy balls and a couple bad breaks but I'm very confident in my golf game today and I'm very happy.   It was a good round of golf.

Q.   Looked like you really were out to shoot something like that in these kind of conditions?
    FELIPE AGUILAR:   Well, this is the kind of weather I like.   This is the kind of weather I've been practising back at home.   It's been like this, not really windy, so that makes me a little more comfortable.

Q.   Were you conscious of your position on the leaderboard?   I know it's only the halfway stage?
    FELIPE AGUILAR:   Still a long way to go.   I saw my name somewhere around the leaderboard but still halfway in the tournament.

Q.   Still very early in the season, so how are your expectation levels? 
    FELIPE AGUILAR:   Struggled my putting in 2012 and I think that I need to improve that, the stats were not really good.   I worked on that in our summer, your winter and in December there was a lot of work on that and working on different grasses to get used to, because obviously on The European Tour we play different grasses every week, so it's been good.   Hopefully stay that way.

Q.   And are you seeing the results? 
    FELIPE AGUILAR:   Definitely, the numbers this week have been much better and I'm hitting the ball good and so that actually helps and I've been hitting better putts than I've been making in a long time.
