Q.   Thoughts on the 66 to start?
FELIPE AGUILAR:   Again, I played very good today.   Very solid off the tee.   Good iron play I would say.   A couple of mistakes out there but I knew how to improve the error, you could say, and good putts to make a couple of birdies out there, which sometimes you thought you weren't going to make, and I made one long one I guess and the other ones were makeable. 
But I struggled with the greens.   The speed today was a little slow out there so you really had to hit the putts, and sometimes you end up just right with one more roll and it was in.   But I think I was pretty solid all around, so very happy. 

Q.   And relaxed and enjoying? 
FELIPE AGUILAR:   Yeah, yeah.   Who wouldn't enjoy with this weather.   It's not often The European Tour plays in such good weather, so very happy, yeah.   I played solid, good weather.   What else can you ask for.

Q.   You got good weather in the Dunhill recently?
FELIPE AGUILAR:   I lied, we did get good weather in Dunhill, Scottish Open.   So we've had actually great weather this year. 

Q.   Is this a spin on from the form that you showed there?   I know it was the first round, and not every round, but good signs. 
FELIPE AGUILAR:   Yeah, I mean, I had one blimp in those 54 holes obviously, stuff happens.   I've been playing great, and you know, hopefully I can continue.
