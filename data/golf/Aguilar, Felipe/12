  FELIPE AGUILAR: Would have been great, but I really can't complain.   It was a great week.

Q.   Overall a great foundation for the season, isn't it?
FELIPE AGUILAR:   Actually, yeah.   I've played three events and I should put my name up in the order Race to Dubai, so two more weeks and then a couple weeks off.   It's been a good desert series.
