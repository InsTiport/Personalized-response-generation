Q. 69, 3-under, what do you make of that score to start here over the West Course?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Happy.  It was a good round.  I played quite well today.  It was very difficult.  It's not easy to start off a round at 7.00 in the morning, knowing that the first three holes are very difficult long irons into the green.
But I'm quite comfortable.  The way I'm swinging the ball right now.  I was happy.  I was happy I made good birdies coming in.  Missed a couple short putts, but anyway, something has to happen every once in awhile.
Q. And at least you started at 7.00 in the morning in some warmth and there was some sunshine during the day, as well.  Presumably these conditions are very much in your favor?
FELIPE AGUILAR: It is, but it looks like it's going to be something like this in the afternoon.  It's a beautiful day here at Wentworth and apparently a very good scoring day for everyone else, too.
Q. You've got a good record here, haven't you?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Yes, I've played well some years, and some other years, don't.  It's one of the courses I feel comfortable.  It's not very, very long except for a couple holes, but you have to really be able to shape the balls, sometimes left-to-right, sometimes right-to-left, and you have to be really good on the green out here.  There are some spots that if you miss it on the wrong side, it's going to be really difficult to get it up-and-down or even to make two putts.
As long as you're careful of those things, you're going to be all right.
Q. And you've done that today; you've shaped the ball well?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Yes, I did.  I did play good.  I took some risk on 18, but I had a comfortable 5-wood into that.  It was good.
