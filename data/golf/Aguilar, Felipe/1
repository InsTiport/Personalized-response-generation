Q. Lovely first round, how do you feel about that?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Feel good.  Every time you beat the course, it's nice.  The course is playing really good.  Greens are perfect.  I mean, I'm quite happy with the round I played today.  Not too many mistakes.
Quite an easy round.  Make a couple birdies on the par 5s, so it was a fun day, especially playing with two friends.
Q. Bogey-free is always nice.
FELIPE AGUILAR: Yeah, not too many mistakes.  I only missed one green, and everything else was around the hole.  So let's say, I didn't sweat it too much today, which is good.
Q. Give me some key moments out there.  What pleased you the most?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Yeah, the only green I missed actually, I chipped it in.  I think it was 1-under at the time.  It was number -- I was 1-under after four holes but I missed the green on 5 and then I chipped in that one.  It went from very difficult chipping to -- with a bogey, walked off with a birdie.  I think that was a key point, turning point in the round.
Q. In general terms, happy with where your game is going into the season?
FELIPE AGUILAR: Yes, I played well last week except for Saturday.  I've been playing okay.  I just need to put together four rounds in a row.
