Q.  You and Forsman, are you trying to rejuvenate some blasts from the past at this tournament?
STEVE JONES:  I don't know.  How did he end up?

Q.  He's kind of right there with you.
STEVE JONES:  Is he?  I don't know, I know on 17 he had a little problem, but I didn't know what he did.

I haven't seen a leaderboard at all, so I don't know what's going on.

Q.  Well, you're up amongst them.  How do you feel about your play today?
STEVE JONES:  It was fine.  Every day I've let a really good round slip by.  I haven't made a lot of putts, and today I made four putts in the past six holes, but two of them were gimmes.  Unfortunately, if I could have made some putts any day the last three days, I could have been doing really well.  I'm not going to complain, though.  My ball striking is really good and I made a couple mistakes, but I'm pretty happy with it and it's a nice to be back up towards the top.

Q.  The way the course is playing, it looks like you might have to go semi low again tomorrow?
STEVE JONES:  If they keep watering it.  They were putting a ton of water on this golf course.  They definitely don't need any more water on the fairways, and the greens could dry out a little bit, but we're used to conditions being a lot firmer, and this course normally is a lot firmer on the weekend, but so far they haven't been doing it.  So I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
