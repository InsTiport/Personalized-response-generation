 Q.  Talk today about your round.  Very nice start.  STEVE JONES: Yeah, that's what it was out here.  I mean, you get off to a good start, it really helps. But kind of pooped out there at the end.  Just couldn't quite make a couple short putts.  And I had a couple opportunities, I could have done a little better, but overall I'm really satisfied.   Q.  Do you feel like you've put yourself in a pretty good position to challenge for this thing tomorrow?  STEVE JONES: Well, I don't know.  I don't know what's going to happen today.  These guys can shoot under par out there.  I'm just trying to do it one day at that time. I got off to such a bad start with that cold Thursday morning that I'm just trying to work my way back to even par.  And I got there.  That was my goal after the first day.   Q.  Anything spectacular in the early round?  Any shot that kind of propelled you?  STEVE JONES: Just I hit it close.  I just kept hitting it close.  I missed about a, I don't know, 15-footer on my, for my fourth birdie in a row. Then hit it three feet on the 6th hole or 5th hole, I guess it was, for my fourth birdie.  So that's a good start.
