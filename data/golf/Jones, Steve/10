Q.
Just talk about your round out there so far.
STEVE JONES:  Okay.  Well, a little tired, 52 hours hitting a competitive golf ball out on the golf course.  I did pretty good yesterday, but today playing, all the waiting, I was nervous.

And it was real calm out there today, real wet, obviously.  Hit a lot of good shots.  My putter was pretty good.  I missed a couple.  I had my first bogey on No. 8.  Other than that, came back and birdied 9, so I felt happy.
Q.  Talk about yesterday.  Did you make it out to the course?
STEVE JONES:  Yes, I came out about 4:00 o'clock and felt really good.  But two days of not whacking and not working out much gets to you.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEVE JONES:  I just didn't know what was going to be there today.  I knew Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I was hitting the ball great and feeling good.  And today I felt a little bit weird because you sat around all day, again, and your legs get a little weak on you, and    actually I felt like I handled it pretty good.  It took about three hours to play it.
Q.  Did you do anything different yesterday while you were waiting, trying to pass the time?
STEVE JONES:  No, just tried to walk slow to the ball, walk real slow to the ball and thought about what I needed to do.  A lot of crowd out there, the gallery was great.  It was really wet.  I was surprised it was so wet.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
STEVE JONES:  Well, this morning we watched a little bit of TV and I read my book.  And I had breakfast and lunch and I came out here.  I got stretched out twice.  It's different, but a lot of guys are going through it, you just try to do the best you can.
