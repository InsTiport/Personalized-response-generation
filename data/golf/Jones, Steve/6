 Q. Can you go through your round for me, just overall thoughts?
 STEVE JONES: Overall thoughts, hit the ball really well, putted horrible. I putted -- last two days I've just putted horrible, and it's all putting for me right now. Guys that putt good here are going to win because there's a lot of birdies out there. The greens are soft, and it's playing real easy. 

 Q. What about the conditions right now makes it maybe more conducive to making birdies?
 STEVE JONES: Soft. It's just soft. Being soft you can fire right at the pins, stop it, and the ball is not rolling out, so you're going to have a lot of low scores as you can see.

 Q. Is it tough going into a championship that you go into thinking that even par is going to be a good score and then conditions get soft and it's maybe a little bit easier?
 STEVE JONES: No, you just have to adjust. I said in the beginning, these guys are good out here. They would have to make this course really, really hard, greens like this cart path, to make it where 4- or 5-under is going to win. But the way it is, who knows, 16-, 18-under. But if they don't water it, then...

 Q. You're 6-under par. 
 STEVE JONES: I needed 10-under to even have a chance.

 Q. Do you think there's there a flash-in-the-pan chance?
 STEVE JONES: You never know. You've got to make everything. I've got to make a lot of putts. Jeff, the way he's hitting it, he's hitting it long, hitting it straight, and he's putting well, so that's what you've got to do.
