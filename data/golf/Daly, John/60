 Q.  John, I remember that guy that played the back 9 out there.  Did you remember him? 
 JOHN DALY:  It was a shock to me.  No, I felt good today.  I mean, only one bad hit because we couldn't find my ball on 2.  The guy said it was finally in the hazard. 
 Other than that, the wedges were great today and I made a lot of putts. 

 Q.  You did make a lot of putts.  And I noticed on 17 and 18 as the putt went in a little fist pump.  A little fire in the belly this week. 
 JOHN DALY:  Yeah.  It's been such a rough two years.  Just to finally shoot 28 on the back 9.  Nothing's been going right in two years, and to do that and, you know, it's just a great feeling to get some decent round in for a change. 

 Q.  I have to ask you about the second shot on 18.  It was awfully dangerous.  The ball above your feet.  Restricted swing.  Came close to the water.  Were you nervous? 
 JOHN DALY:  A little bit, but I thought the ball would bounce a little bit more and I thought I had more overspin than that.  I wasn't worried when I hit it.  I thought it was going to be in the middle of the green.  It just didn't bounce very hard. 
 But it's a good 2-putt.  I would hate to have made bogey on that hole. 

 Q.  That was great playing.  We appreciate your time.  Keep it going this weekend.
