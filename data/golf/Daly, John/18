Q.   Good position to be in right there, huh? 
JOHN DALY:   Yeah, hadn't played for six weeks, like there was a few of us that hadn't.   We didn't play in the FedEx. 
Just felt my (indiscernible) was going to look better, but now I was kind of a little worried after the first day.   Today I hit the ball really well and I putted good the last two days, which is good for me. 
The greens are rolling really good, so it gives you an opportunity.   If you hit it think decent, you can make some putts.

Q.   Talk about the eagle on 9 here. 
JOHN DALY:   Yeah, I just killed a 6‑iron for my second shot.   Got lucky.   Actually just barely carried the bunker and hit on the downslope where it got a little roll out of it and had about a 15‑footer, which was good.

Q.   This course is one of the easiest on the TOUR.   Is that playing into your hands kind of thing?
JOHN DALY:   Not really.   I mean, the thing about it is doesn't matter if it's easy or hard, if you're hitting it good you can score well. 
But on any tour, you know, anymore it's just putting.   If you make some putts you can play really well.   This course gives you a lot more opportunities than most courses. 
If you hit the fairways, you're not hitting a lot of long irons into the par‑4s.   You got a lot of wedges into certain things, so that makes it a little bit easier. 
Still, golf ain't easy.   Been out here in Vegas when it's been windy and rainy.   This is beautiful.   It's still like summertime. 
It's good.   It's great for the fans and great for the tournament to have nice weather like this.

Q.   Now if we can get your Razorbacks to play as well as you did today. 
JOHN DALY:   We just need a win.   The guys are trying.   Our defense is horrible.   We've got to get a better defense.
