  Q. Just talk about your round today. You got off to a bad start and then really battled back. Just kind of go through the round real quick.  
 JOHN DALY: Yeah. I hit a couple of poor tee balls that cost me. Just hit a bad putt on 1, little five-footer and missed. And then 3, hit a good second shot in there, just shortsided myself, didn't really have much of a chip. Made a good 5.   
 Hit a horrible third shot on 4 and over the back into the hazard and made a double. Then I came back, birdied 5 and three-putted 7, which you know, just one of those days. Kind of got it back.   
  
  Q. What is the key to that turnaround? Was there one shot that really got you back rolling again?  
 JOHN DALY: Well, when you pulled before and you feel like you hit it solid, you can't get too disappointed. When you really hit it bad, you do. So I was just trying to swing away, and a couple putts came in. The long putt on 8 was a 35-footer that I hadn't made in probably two years.   
  
  Q. Sure.  
 JOHN DALY: Made a bogey there and missed a good opportunity on 9 and made some good shots in the back and then the eagle on 15 was pretty cool.   
  
  Q. Good.
