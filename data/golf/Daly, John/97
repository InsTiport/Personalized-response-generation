Q.
How did the course play today?
JOHN DALY:  The greens are very firm this year.  Usually they're really soft, so scores won't be as low as they have been in the past.

Q.
How did you play today?
JOHN DALY:  I didn't play too good.  We had a lot of fun with our team, though.  They played pretty good.

Q.
The FedEx St. Jude wouldn't be the same if you weren't in the field.  What is it about the course that keeps you coming back every year?
JOHN DALY:  Well, it's my home, that's one thing.  You always want to do well when you're home, it puts a little more pressure on you.  They're going to tear the greens up after this week and get the Bermuda back here.  I like to putt Bermuda greens.  I'm not that good on bent.  I'll be glad when they get Bermuda greens.  Maybe then I'll have a chance.

Q.
You've been playing really well so far this season.  What do you attribute your recent success to?
JOHN DALY:  Just a lot of it is the equipment and I think I've just got some confidence in my game I haven't had in a long time.  The putter is working, and the golf ball from Dunlop has really helped, about ten years of technology, really good around the greens and really good on distance, so that's been a big key.

Q.
Your Godson is unbelievable; we saw him play on 18.  When you play with him are you amazed at how a young man like that can really kill the ball?
JOHN DALY:  Oh, he hits it great, but his short game is phenomenal.  He putted well today.  That's something he always worked on real hard.  I always told him that short game is where it's at.  He played wonderful today.  I didn't even have to play, it was great.  I was just watching him make birdies and pars all day.

Q.
When I hear is you have to buy him new clubs almost every year because he keeps growing up so much.  That might be the downside?
JOHN DALY:  We keep getting clubs and he's doing great.
Q.
You talked about the conditions.  Do you think it's going to be one of these tournaments we haven't seen in a long time in terms of it's not going to take 65 or 66 every day just to be in contention?
JOHN DALY:  No, I think you're going to see right around even, maybe 1-under, even, 1-over cut, especially if the wind blows because the greens have always been darts.  You could throw it right at the flag and if your distances were perfect you could score nothing out here.  This week the par 3s are playing real hard because they're not holding and it's tough to judge the distances out there, and a lot of these holes you can't land the ball short to roll it up, either, so it's going to play three or four shots harder this year than it has been.
Q.
This Pro-Am day, how important is it for you or is it like some golfers take it as let's have fun and it was more fun to have your Godson out there?
JOHN DALY:  A lot of pros play it as a practice round.  I take it like you get to know the amateurs, but it was great.  It's a great day to play with John Michael, great tournament to do that, and Joe is a great guy, a lot of fun, and Randy and Jim, we just had a good time.  That's kind of what it's about.
