 Q. How big was it this week for to you get back to winning? 
 JOHN DALY: Oh, it would have been nice, you know. I didn't hit a lot of greens. I think only hit five or six greens today. I had two bad swings and made one hell of a par on 10. I should have had s hot. I looked like an amateur on that. 
 Other than that, I hit it all right. 18 there, I hit 3-wood off the tee and barely missed the fairway. I thought it was going to be on the fairway. I had a lot of those today.

 Q. First Top 10 since 2005 on the PGA TOUR. Does that give you a little more confidence going forward? 
 JOHN DALY: Yeah, I mean, it's been a struggle. It's like a lot of guys have been hurt, like myself out here. You cannot play good golf out here when you're hurt. You know, I've had a little groin problem this week, but other than that, everything felt pretty good. 
 I just didn't execute. Didn't hit enough greens today to give myself a chance.

 Q. John, you bring up the negatives, but how many positives are you taking out of this? 
 JOHN DALY: Oh, a ton, a ton. There's no doubt about it. I love the way I chipped the last two days. Under the heat today, I know I was kind of out of it there with four or five holes to go. But I made one heck of a par on 15, 17 and 18. I got them down a lot today. Probably in the past I would have shot an 80 or 82 today.
