  Q.  What a weekend for you.   
 JOHN DALY:  Nothing like today, I mean, I had a few bad breaks.  Hit some really good tee balls with 3s.  80 yards back.  I got stuck in the tree on the second shot on 5.  Played the par 5 three-over and everybody else it's pretty good.   
  
  Q.  This week overall you have to be satisfied.  You stuck it all four rounds.   
 JOHN DALY:  I stayed with the driver.  I noticed the fairways are hard to hit here.  I hit a lot of my lines the first few days.  The putts are pretty inspirational.   
  
  Q.  Did you have a good week overall?   
 JOHN DALY:  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I just gotta sit back.  It was a good week.  Tied for 30th.  Just take small steps and hopefully everything --   
  
  Q.  Is Tiger beatable?   
 JOHN DALY:  No, he's not beatable today.  You see the putt on 18.  No, couldn't come close to that.   
  
  Q.  What was your reaction?   
 JOHN DALY:  Just laugh.
