Q. Even par round, take us through it today.
JOHN DALY: It was going good for seven holes, and then 8, 9 and 10 were a few hiccups.  It's just hard.  The course has always been hard.  It's always going to be hard.  I'm pretty pleased with even par.
Q. What is it about this golf course that makes it so hard for you guys?
JOHN DALY: It's just never comfortable on any of the tee balls, for me.  All the bunkers are so strategically perfectly put in, that if I hit driver, there's one or two always in play.  And you've got to hit either one, the driver; and I hit my 2-iron a lot today which kept out of a lot of them.  It's just hard.  You can never get comfortable on the tee boxes.
The par 3s, No. 8, is such a tough hole for me for some reason.  It's just a hard green to hit.  You land it on top, it goes over.  You land it short, you have a chance to go in the bunker.  You don't want to pull it; it goes out-of-bounds.
On 9, they added the tee box; they added that bunker on the left and the far one on the right, which makes it a much tougher hole.
So it's just a hard golf course whether the wind is blowing or not.  I've done something I don't think I've done in 90-something rounds I've played here.  I birdied 2 and birdied 16.  I don't think I've ever birdied those two holes, period.
But I made some birdies and I putted pretty decent, but I didn't hit it great, but I'm pretty pleased.
Q. Overall, you have to be pretty happy.
JOHN DALY: Yeah, but you just start over tomorrow and it goes back to that same grind.  Even when you're playing really good, it's tough to score out here.  It's a golf course, there's not really a lot of holes where you think, I can get one there.  There's no letup on this golf course whatsoever.  It just makes it very stressful and it's tough.  It's hard.
