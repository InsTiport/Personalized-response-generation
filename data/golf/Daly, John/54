  Q. Did the ball rolling back into the water on the 16th sum up your day?   
 JOHN DALY: Pretty much  
  
  Q. Has anything like that happened to you before.   
 JOHN DALY: It actually happened to me last year at Bernhard's tournament here in Germany last year, on the ninth. Just placed it, went to get an L-wedge and it rolled back in the water  
  
  Q. It was going very well?  
 JOHN DALY: I hit it a bad tee ball on the 14th and just didn't get through the ball on my third but really I didn't play that bad.  
  
  Q. you got yourself into position?   
 JOHN DALY: Just got some bad breaks. What can you do.   
  
  Q. You avoided a six there on the last?   
 JOHN DALY: I am hitting it better than I am scoring.
