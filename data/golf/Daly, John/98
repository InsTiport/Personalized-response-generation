Q.  Comment about your play today, obviously happy, 3-under, 69?

JOHN DALY:  Yeah, bogey-free, that's not happened too many times to me out here.  It came out pretty good.  Made some good pars, made some good putts.  And I didn't shoot myself in the foot, anyway.

Q.
Conditions pretty tough in the afternoon?
JOHN DALY:  They were about the first 14 holes, because the wind was blowing so hard.
