JOHN DALY:  Yeah, I was pretty pleased, especially the start I got off.  I didn't start off too good, but I hung in there, and Ben was playing really good and Ryan was hanging in there, so we kind of fed off each other today.  It's always nice to birdie 18.  It's not the easiest hole in the world.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  Thank you.  I don't know where it came from.  I got lucky, I think, but I just hit a really good drive and had 163, hit a real nice easy 8 iron in there.  I'm glad it was close.  It was almost a gimme.  I like those.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  It's amazing.  I mean, I love it.  I feed off the fans.  Like I said, they've been great to me, and it's nice to play decent golf for them.  They've been through thick and thin with me.  I think they think the fatter I get, the younger I get, so they must still think I'm young or something.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  I don't know.  I think sharing the problems that I've had in the past, hopefully it helps other people like it's helped me.  I'm pretty much pretty honest with the media like I've been, with you guys, about everything that's happened in my life.

I think people feed off that, and I'm not scared to show, hey, we may be athletes and professional golfers or whatever, but we all have problems, too, and I think that kind of gets to them, and it's amazing when they come to me and say, man, you've helped my son or my daughter or you've been this or that, really positive things for me.  I think that also helps, too.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  It's awesome.  I mean, you know, like I said, it's a great feeling, but I hate letting them down when you're playing bad.  But it's just great to play decent golf for them.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  Yeah, the rough is a little thicker, you know.  That rough is a little wetter now.  You can't really get the ball as far as you want to out of it.  The greens are very soft today, the fairways are very, very soft, had a lot of mud balls.  But the course is in great shape.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  I hit driver, 2 iron.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  Yeah, I had a 3 iron out, and then the wind kind of just almost switched almost into our face, and we thought it was down toward the left and it came in our face, and one of the best shots of the day was that ripped 2 iron.  I was pretty happy with that one.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  Yeah, I mean, it was a perfect opportunity on the right side of the fairway.  It would be kind of stupid for me not to go for it.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  I think I'm like anybody else.  You know, you look in the mirror, if you like yourself you're going to have a pretty good day.  If you flip yourself off in the mirror, you're not going to have a good day, you know.  I think most importantly I learned to like myself and take care of the things that I need to take care of, somewhat in a selfish way.  I've always    so far as the last few years, it's none of my business what people think of me.  I've lived with that, and I think that's the key to life that I've learned.  You wake up and if you smile at yourself in the mirror instead of flipping yourself off, you're going to have a pretty good day.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  Yeah, but, I mean, my problems are    I've got four kids now, and I like to play the guitar and stuff, so chasing these four kids around is enough to keep you out of trouble anyway.
Q.  (Inaudible).
JOHN DALY:  That was just for the Hooters Monday.  That was this Monday, and we're right out here by the putting green the rest of the week.
