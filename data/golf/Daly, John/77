Q.  Looking at the leaderboard right now, Mickelson is at 5, just talk about the day.
JOHN DALY:  Well, my putter came loose again.  We made a replacement.  I'm tired of replacing it.  That's happened a few times this year where the head has fallen off.  Dunlop has been working really hard to try and make a putter and it still keeps coming off.  I'm not getting another putter, I've had it.  I'm just going to putt with my L wedge.

I'll figure something out tomorrow.  I may have three or four putters in the bag tomorrow just to try and figure out something for next week.
Q.  How has the week gone otherwise?
JOHN DALY:  Oh, it's been great.  I knew the scores were going to be high.  I knew they were going to toughen the greens up and they were going to be firmer today, and I thought I could just go out and shoot even par.  Somewhere around par is going to win the tournament, but unfortunately the putter came loose again, and there we go.
Q.  And you were putting with that other thing?
JOHN DALY:  I rolled it pretty good, I just couldn't get it to the hole.  The other putter was knocking it ten feet by.
Q.  How many holes was that?
JOHN DALY:  11 through 18.
Q.  Just another day?
JOHN DALY:  (Laughing) Something good will happen.  It will happen.  It's unfortunate that this has happened so many times this year, especially in a major.  Jameson has probably built me 42 putters in three weeks.  It's impossible.  We've had some putters here this week and    it's probably the humidity.  That glue is just not going to hold.
