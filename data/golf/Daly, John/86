Q.
John, you're Comeback Player of the Year.  What's changed for you in the past 16, 17 months?
JOHN DALY:  I don't know, I think equipment is one.  And I think attitude and a little bit of maturity may be one.  I'm just more relaxed on the golf course than I ever have been.
Q.  With everything that has gone on, what's your goal now?
JOHN DALY:  It's tee it up and try to win.  That's the goal, you know.

Today was a very tough match.  Justin has been playing great.  He won Bob Hope this year.  I just hung in there.  He missed a few putts for me, too.
Q.  Do you consider this an upset?  Do you look at the rankings when you're seeded behind someone?
JOHN DALY:  No, I don't think so.  I think golf is such a funny game.

And match play ‑‑ I'm not a guy that can really pick the ball very good.  And I took two clubs more on a lot of shots today.
Q.  That's got to be mentally draining for you?
JOHN DALY:  It's tough, and trying to judge the distance playing golf that way, but the fairways are so wet that you just don't want to catch a flier.  There's a lot more variables involved.
