 Q.  You didn't win, but after winning 16 and 17, did it feel like a victory?  
RICKIE FOWLER: It's better than a loss, that's for sure. We wanted to keep stretching them. I felt like we gave them a couple holes with a couple three-putts. Could have been a little better on the greens, both of us, but made some great putts coming in. I felt like our iron shots today, we took care of business, but I think we could have gotten that one if we got it on the greens. Like I say, we made up for it coming in.   
 Q.  Two-thirds of the points still available. What will be your attitude heading into the night and morning for this team?  
GARY WOODLAND: Momentum. Obviously the way Rick and I fought back, like I say, we didn't make much, and you've got one of the best putters in the world with Rick so it's freeing me up to hit some good shots.   
Momentum is huge. That was a huge half-point. Any time you can scrape out something; we did it. Now we have to regroup. We have 36 ahead of us tomorrow and hopefully go out and flip this a little bit.
