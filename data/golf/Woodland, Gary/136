 Q. Looked like one two many half-court shots you had to make today. For not having many good looks, you were right there all the way. 
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, like I say, I didn't hit it close enough, which was a little frustrating. I drove the ball pretty well today, just like I said, never hit it close. 
 Tough to make putts when you're hitting 30 feet.

 Q. You were, what, three feet short at 18 as far as getting it far enough to clear the hump to give yourself a birdie putt? You were close. You were right on the top. 
 GARY WOODLAND: It was right at it. I hit a perfect shot. It was just in between clubs, and we tried to hit the hard one to take (indiscernible) out of play. 
 And, you know, when I hit it in the air it was right at it. Thought I had a good chance maybe to go in. Couldn't ask for a better lie; just didn't cover enough. 

 Q. How much fun was it to be in the middle of it? It was back and forth. 
 GARY WOODLAND: We had a lot of fun. Any time you're in contention on Sunday it's fun. That's what we're out here to do. Unfortunately, I didn't get enough to go in today. Save 'em for next week.
