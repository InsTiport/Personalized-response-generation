Q. Talk about your game a little bit.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, it's frustrating.  I've been playing some pretty dang good golf, especially coming down the stretch.  I kept hitting good shots, just kept hitting it over the green.  Shots that I thought were pretty good, just didn't have the distance down today, which was frustrating.  But it was nice to hit good shots.  Hopefully, next week.
Q. You had a very good bogey-free streak going there.  What happened on 9?  Did that maybe take the wind out of your sails?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, just a shot I hit too hard again.  I was hitting it solid, which is a good thing.  I was just hitting it through the wind.  Hitting a spot there that you just can't hit it over the green there.  That was frustrating.
I hit a bad drive on 10.  I hadn't missed a fairway up to that point.  I started missing a couple of fairways there.  I got it dialed back in late in the round, but it was a little too late.
Q. I looked at some of the shots you hit, and I looked up, and you were still right there.  Do you feel like you did a good job?
GARY WOODLAND: I'm excited about the way I hit it, unfortunately I was just hitting it too far.  I don't know if it was adrenaline or the wind was just that much downwind.  I'm excited with the way I've been swinging, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
Q. Third straight first-time winner at this tournament.  Is there something about this place that makes it conducive?
GARY WOODLAND: I don't know about that.  This place is perfect.  The golf course is as good a condition as we see all year.  The greens are ideal.  The golf course is in front of you, so I don't think there's a lot of knowledge.  You've just got to hit good shots.  There's a couple holes, 12, 16, couple holes down the stretch, you've just got to hit good shots, and whoever does that the best.
