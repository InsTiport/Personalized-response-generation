Q. Talk about just the year as a whole and what it's been like from start to finish.
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I mean, this week is frustrating.  Obviously the last six weeks have been frustrating just pain-wise.  The game is actually I feel like in a pretty good spot, doing things really well and just can't get around the pain.  It's frustrating.  Especially because this meant a lot to me coming back here defending.  I put a lot of time and effort into it, and if your body doesn't let you do it, you just can't do it, and that's frustrating.  The first couple months back from quarantine I wasn't playing great.  Finally got to a point where I feel like the game is as good as it's been, I just can't do it, so I've got to reevaluate.  I'm going to see a specialist Monday morning and we'll see what happens.
Q. Can you talk about specifics?
GARY WOODLAND:   I mean, I've got a torn labrum in my left hip.  I've got a lot of pain in there, and I've been fighting through it, but it gets to a point where you're playing against the best players in the world, you just can't play with pain.  I've played with pain my whole life, but it's getting a little tough.
