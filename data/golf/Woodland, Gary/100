 Q.  Going on to the TOUR Championship again, what does it mean to make it back to Atlanta?  GARY WOODLAND: It means a lot.  For me to get there and not have a win this year, obviously, I played pretty solid all year, which is nice. I got close sometimes.  Which would have been nice to close it out so it wouldn't have been so close today. But all in all, I played solid this year.  I'm looking forward to going next week and anybody has a chance next week.  So, hopefully go out and have good things happen.   Q.  What do you feel you need to do to feel like you have a great chance to possibly win next week?  GARY WOODLAND: I like the golf course.  The golf course sets up well for me.  I just got to put four rounds together.  I've been pretty good at putting three rounds together, just need to put four together.
