  KELLY BARNES:   Please welcome Gary Woodland to the interview room.   
Gary, you've had a lot of momentum lately going into the Playoffs, you put together a couple great rounds this weekend, just not quite enough.   Can you talk to us about how you feel moving to No. 10 in the FedExCup standings?   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, today I just didn't have any AGame.   Obviously I played well coming into today and hit some wayward shots early but I found a way to hang in there and grind it out and gave myself a chance on the back nine on Sunday which is everything you can ask for.   
Made a bad decision on 13.   I hit in the water, making bogey on a par 5 is tough for me and then I gave myself three good chances coming.   I felt like I hit good putts.   Just didn't go in.   
   
 Q.   On 13, did the wind fool you?   
GARY WOODLAND:   It did.   The wind fooled us.   We thought it was across and it was obviously down, especially the second shot after I dropped, I hit it over the green, as well.   
The wind fooled us.   It picked up this afternoon.   It played tough, especially coming in and just made a mistake there.   
   
 Q.   Could you talk about 18, the good chance you had there to get into a playoff?   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I hit good shots there.   Hit a great 3‑wood off the tee box.   Hit a good 9‑iron in there.   Gave myself a great look.   Obviously I was fine‑‑ obviously I heard the horn, but I was still in the zone; when the crowd started‑‑ I had to back off there.   I got refocused and I hit a good putt.   Hit it right where I wanted to.   Just went the other direction, but, all in all, you know, frustrating.   Came here to win and didn't have enough at the end.   
   
 Q.   You seem to have a bit of a two‑way miss going early on the iron going to the right into the bush and the next hole, driver left.   Was that indicative of how you were struggling today a little bit?  
GARY WOODLAND:   Maybe a little quick early.   Not too worried about the right side.   I didn't like the left shot there, the driver.   That was a bad golf swing but the one on the right I just got a little quick with it, but I like the miss to the right.   
The par 5s hurt me today.   I can hit irons into all of them and made par there, salvaged a par on 6, and bogey on 13 was the killer.   
KELLY BARNES:   Thanks, Gary.
