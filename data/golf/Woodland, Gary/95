 Q.   You went the distance and then some.   Some comments on the match?  
    GARY WOODLAND:   It was a‑‑ had to be a fun match to watch.   It wasn't too fun to be in.   Neither one of us hit it too well.   We both putted it well, which made the match fun.   From where we hit it it was a lot of pars and a lot of others.   
    But it was nice.   It was nice to come out on top.   It was nice to see the ball go in the hole.   It was nice to make putts.  
    I can dial in the ball‑striking.   Nice to see balls go in the hole and hopefully I can carry that on.
