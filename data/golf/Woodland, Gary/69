GARY WOODLAND: No, I mean, I was just trying to make birdies.  Couldn't get anything going early.  Finally made the birdie there on 9.
It was nice to see the ball go in the hole.  I hit it beautifully on the back nine.  Really executed shots from 12 all the way through.
Big putt there on 13 to save birdie there on the par 5.  And then hit it close on the next couple of holes.  Couldn't get anything to go in.
And the last ball I wanted to make the putt and ran a little bit too far and didn't go in.  Unfortunately the putter kind of held me back today.  I was very happy with the way I hit the golf ball.
Q. You looking forward to Troon and the Open?  How much emphasis do you take from this week leading into that?
GARY WOODLAND: I've been playing well for a long time.  I just haven't done much on Sunday.  So it was nice to at least hit it well.  Hopefully we get some putts to go in.  And we'll take a lot from this and build on it and keep playing well and hopefully break through soon.
Q. I guess it's a having to wait and see and wait and see.
GARY WOODLAND: It's frustrating.  I executed down the stretch.  I hit it beautifully.  I made the good putt there on 13 and that was the end of it.  I didn't make any putts coming down the stretch.  Gave myself a lot of chances.  Unfortunately I just couldn't get one to go in.
Q. Looked like the second got unlucky there on 18?
GARY WOODLAND: I hit it just like I wanted to.  I thought it was too much.  I didn't see where it landed.  I couldn't tell with it shot, because obviously it bounced right of the bunker.
Q. What did you hit off 18?
GARY WOODLAND: 2-iron.  Had 8-iron.  Actually had exact same number I did three years ago.  Same number.  Same club.  And I hit this one pretty good.  Just needed it to be a yard left.
