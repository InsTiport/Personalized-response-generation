GARY WOODLAND: From Wednesday to today the golf course has firmed up tremendously.  We thought scores would be pretty low.  The balls were bouncing.  The third green, I don't know, had to be pretty hard to hold that green today.  So the balls were releasing, which was nice, with the fairways firming up a little, I could hit more irons off the tee box, play more conservatively.  The golf course played as tough as it's played in a while.  Usually when it's soft you can attack.  The wind swirling, it was a pretty good test this afternoon.   
 Q.  How much if at all is East Lake on your mind?  
GARY WOODLAND: Always.  Always.  That just shores up so much next year.  Obviously staying top 50 in the world does the same thing.  That takes a lot of pressure off everything.  I need to play well and make it easy for next week, too.  For the last four or five years I've hovered around 30 going into the BMW.  I've been on my numbers, I guess I'm used to it, comfortable with it.  I know this golf course suits me well, I played here.  I'm excited about the next three days.   
 Q.  Do you look at the numbers?  
GARY WOODLAND: I know coming in and I'll look at it after this week, but there's nothing really you can do.  There's so much movement.  A birdie here, a bogey there, you move so much.  So it's tough to do.  But I know if I go out and play well, it will take care of itself.
