Q. Gary, after 36 holes you put yourself in good position going into the weekend. How would you assess your performance today?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played a lot better today than I did yesterday. I just didn't make the putts I made yesterday, especially coming down the stretch. A little frustrating to make a couple bogeys there and thought I made it on the last but it didn't go in. The game is coming together. I had a good break. Sharpened up some things, and seeing some results now is nice.
Q. After 36 holes is it starting to feel a little more normal after the long layoff?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, it's tough. I mean, it's tough to get adrenaline going. I think you can get a little bit more of that this weekend getting in the hunt and get those juices flowing, but it is different without a crowd. You've got to kind of get that adrenaline going yourself. You've got a couple crowds here on 15 and 16, but it was nice, peaceful. It's easy to stay within yourself. You don't have the distraction of people moving around, so that part is all right. But you definitely miss the enjoyment of having people yelling.
Q. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at the leaderboard, but this is a very strong top 10 that we're looking at going into the weekend. What's going to be the key for you to accomplish your goals on the weekend?
GARY WOODLAND: Oh, just keep doing what I'm doing. The game is coming together nicely. I hit some good putts that didn't go in today, so you can live with that. But it is a stacked field. The field is great this week anyway, so you're expecting top players to play, and you're coming out here hoping to play well and beat them all.
