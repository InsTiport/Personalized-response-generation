GARY WOODLAND: I got off to a big start early, which was nice.  I didn't play great.  Neither one of us played our best.  But that's the beauty of match play.  Fortunately you don't catch somebody on a hot day when you're not playing your best.
It was nice to make a couple of key putts, five, six, eight-footers the last four of five holes.
Q. You've had a solid season so far (inaudible).
GARY WOODLAND: I needed this week.  I haven't played great the last couple of weeks, so match play kind of frees me up and let's me be more aggressive.  I got some work in the last couple of days and starting to get where I wanted.  I think I needed match play to kind of free me up and be a little more aggressive.
Q. This part of the season is a roller coaster, isn't it?
GARY WOODLAND: It is.  A lot of up-and-downs.
