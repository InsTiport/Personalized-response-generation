 Q.   Very well done.   3 and 2 winner over Ian Poulter here.   How was the game today?  
GARY WOODLAND:   Today was a lot better.   I hit it a lot better than I did yesterday.   
I got off to a hot start which was the key.   Anytime you can get 4â€‘up early, it allows yourself to if you have a bad hole you can get away with it.  
Fortunately I got a big lead.   I had a mistake in the middle of the round but it didn't cost me because I got up early.  
   
 Q.   You had a close match yesterday with Jimmy Walker.   Does that help you going into the second match?  
GARY WOODLAND:   It helped me yesterday to see the ball go in the hole.   I made some putts yesterday which was nice.   And I carried that over on the front nine today, I really had it rolling.   Anytime you see balls go in the hole that's nice.   To beat a player the caliber of Jimmy, and come back and beat Poults, it was a good couple of days.   
   
 Q.   You're 2 and 0, you control your destiny, good luck tomorrow.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Thank you.
