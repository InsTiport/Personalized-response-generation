 Q.   Again, the bubble factor this week.  
GARY WOODLAND:   I'm not too concerned about it.   I'm happy to be healthy, finally healthy this year.   I did some great things last week.   Butch and I put in a lot of work the last two weeks.   Come out here and play well this week.  
   
 Q.   It's not the kind of thing --  
GARY WOODLAND:   I'm out here trying to get the game back.   We saw some great things last week and carry them over this week and play well.
