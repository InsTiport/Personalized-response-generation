 Q.   Gary, 3‑up through eight holes, level through 12.   What was the secret for coming back and winning in the end?   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I played well all day.   Obviously I played well to get 3‑up.   I only gave one hole away.   Marc made some birdies on me to get it all square.   I just kept telling myself I was playing good.   Fortunately I made a good putt on 14.   
It was nice to see a ball go in.   I hadn't seen one go in for a couple of holes.   That gave me momentum.   I birdied 15, as well.   Put pressure.   Had a chance on 16 and finished it up there on 17.   That was nice.   
   
 Q.   You say this course suits you particularly well.   Why?   
GARY WOODLAND:   It allows me to be aggressive.   The format does, as well.   But the golf course allows me to hit driver, which is nice.   The fairways are receptive.   
When I'm driving pretty well I'm going to be pretty hard to beat.   Giving myself a lot of wedges into the greens.   I've been seeing some putts go in, too, which is nice.  
   
 Q.   You lost in the first round last year to Graeme McDowell on extra holes.   You said you learned a lot from that experience.   What is it you learned?  
GARY WOODLAND:   I did.   Obviously G‑Mac is a great match play player.   He's a great player in all.   And I played really good that day.   And being 3‑up with three to go and I hit a perfect shot on 16 and it just went over.   I thought I had the match won.   You can never do that.   You never let up, especially against the caliber of players out here.   Obviously I let up against G‑Mac and he's good, he came back and beat me there in extra holes.   
There's been no let up this week.   I've been keep going, keep going, keep going, and it seems to have worked out.
