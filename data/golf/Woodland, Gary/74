Q. Just 7 under, 65, quite the impressive round today.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played good.  I hit it a little better today than I did yesterday.  Gave myself some more chances.  When the greens are this good and you get them on line, they're going in, which was nice.  It was nice to get off to a bogey-free round yesterday and then follow that up today.
Q. With conditions as benign and perfect as they were, did you almost feel like you had to go low on a day like this?
GARY WOODLAND: I mean, you want to, especially with four par 5s.  For me, length is a huge advantage for me.  So I can get honed to the par 5s, keep the ball on the fairway.  The fairways are a little soft, so they're receptive, which plays a little bit better for me.
Q. Tomorrow and Sunday, weather might be more of a factor.  Does that change things at all?
GARY WOODLAND: This golf course is perfect.  So the weather definitely will change things.  If it stays like this, you're going to have to make birdies, and hopefully the weather does miss us, and we can go out and have some fun.
