 Q.  Overall thoughts on the week?  
GARY WOODLAND: I played really well this week.  I didn't get as much out of it as I'd like to but the game feels really good.  So it was nice to get some work done with Butch last week and really bring it into this week and get some results.   
 Q.  What do you like about the venues coming up, the rest of the Playoffs?  
GARY WOODLAND: Boston is good for me.  I've played well the last couple years, so I'm excited about that.  Crooked Stick is a bomber's paradise and then obviously East Lake.  Hopefully keep moving up, keep playing well each week and hopefully I keep breaking through that door and hopefully get a win.
