 Q.  Another guy who has put up a good number today, Gary Woodland, 3-under 68.  For the guys watching, how tough were the scoring conditions, and how good is that score?  
GARY WOODLAND: I'm very happy with the way I played yesterday and today.  The wind is obviously blowing hard, but it's swirling out there.  The greens are firming up, they're getting fast.  You have to drive the long fairway, because the rough you just can't get out of it.  So it was a tough day.   
But I'm happy with the way I hit the golf ball, and I made a couple putts as well.  So all in all, I'm happy.   
 Q.  You made a nice birdie to finish on 16 and 17 coming in.  How sweet was that shot?  On 17, I just talked about it.  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, we were just trying to get it in the middle of the green, to not finish it was the bonus, to get up-and-down from 110 was a big one.
