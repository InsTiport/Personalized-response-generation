GARY WOODLAND: I controlled the ball today a lot better than I did yesterday.  I drove the ball in play, which was a big key and my iron game was really on point.  So I gave myself a lot of chances.  Didn't get myself in too much trouble, which around here is key.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I mean, I got some work in yesterday on the range when I got done.  The wind has been blowing all week, just got a little stagnant with trying to hit too many low shots.  And made some changes on the range yesterday.  I was hitting beautiful yesterday afternoon.  I got some work in, came out today and it really clicked.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: I mean, the expectations haven't changed.  We're out here playing to win.  I'm going to go out and get some rest.  It was a long day out there today.  It's more mentally draining than physically.  Get back, kick the legs up, rest, and get back and get ready to go tomorrow.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I do.  Obviously like I said, I hit a lot of good putts that didn't go in, but I played very well.  I controlled the golf ball and hit a lot of greens today, which was nice.  A big change from yesterday.  Yesterday the short game really saved me and kind of kept me in the golf tournament.  And today I went out and played a very good round of golf.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: No, he wasn't.  Obviously he had some bad bounces, but the kid's got an unbelievable amount of talent.  He's got a great head on his shoulders.  I loved his attitude.  Obviously he has a big month coming up.  He won the British links a couple of weeks ago and the Walker Cup and British Am coming up.  I'm excited for him.  He's got a lot of game and I think he'll be out here very soon.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: I couldn't tell.  It was raining so hard, I didn't see what he hit.  I knew I hit a 3-wood, I just expected he did, as well.  I hit 3-wood off the tee and I was just assuming, I hit it straight, I figured that was me.  But the kid has a lot of speed, hits it a long way, his short game is very good.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
GARY WOODLAND: There's no doubt about it he's got a lot of game, a lot of game.
