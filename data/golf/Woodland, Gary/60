Q. Nice to get off to a good start.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, it was.  Outside of 3-putting the first hole, I played great today.  Drove the ball well.  Iron play was really, really good.  Saw a putt go in there on 7 and made -- really for about seven or eight holes, made a lot of putts to really gain momentum and keep the momentum.  He was making a couple of birdies and I kept making it on top of them, which was nice.
Q. You've got a good track record.  Finished second a couple of years ago.  What suits your game in terms of this format?
GARY WOODLAND: It allows me to be aggressive.  That sets up pretty good for me.  I should play aggressive more often.  I obviously play well in match play.  I played well in Reno.
I enjoy the format.  Really the first time I've seen the whole golf course.  It was nice to get out today and make some putts.
Q. The 7th hole changed the momentum.
GARY WOODLAND: It was the first time I seen a putt go in.  I didn't make any in the practice rounds.  I finally saw a putt go in.  It opened the flood gates because I made quite a few putts coming in after that.
Q. What did you learn about your opponent today?
GARY WOODLAND: Emiliano is good.  He hits it good.  He missed some putts coming down the stretch when I was making some, which was nice for me.  He's a good kid, got a lot of talent.  He'll be out here for a long time.
