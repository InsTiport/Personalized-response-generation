 Q.  You led by three after nine holes, what led to the hot start for you?  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I missed some putts early, too.  I got off to a good start, I hit it well early.  Just couldn't get anything to go in.  Fortunate to be up three.  And then hit a couple of bad shots on the back nine, which was frustrating.  I hit it in the water.  Especially when you are up you don't want to are give my holes away, you want to make them earn it.  Unfortunately I gave two holes to him.   
 Q.  Did you feel like you had that putt going in on 18 when you had a chance to win it there?  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, it just didn't break.  I hit it where I wanted to, just a little misread.  All in all I played solid.  I'll take a half point against him.
