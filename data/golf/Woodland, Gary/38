Q. Comments on your round today for us.
GARY WOODLAND: It was a nice finish.  I played really well today.  I was -- unfortunately hit it in the water there on 15 and 17.  It was nice to make par, but I felt like you're giving some shots back there on holes where I could really take advantage.  So just hoping Rickie wouldn't run too far away from us because tomorrow, hopefully, the golf course is softened up a little bit and we'll play aggressive.  But I'm happy with where I'm at, I just got to hope I'm not too far back tomorrow.
Q. With that weather and the rain do you feel like it improves your chances?
GARY WOODLAND: It helps me because it's going to lengthen this golf course out, which, any time the golf course gets longer it's good for me.  So I'm playing well, the weather is what it is, I'm just going to go out and play aggressive and hopefully make a lot of birdies.
Q. When you make a shot like that on 18 to finish the round do you ever feel like there is a carry over the next day?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, maybe, but it's a funny game.  We hit it in the water there two holes in a row, a little frustrated, got a bad break where the ball ended up on 18 and so you hole out.  So you take the good bounces with the bad bounces.
Q. Is this the stinger you've been hitting this year?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah.
Q. Is that something you've been working on?
GARY WOODLAND: No, I hit it forever, I guess I'm just on TV a lot more so people see it now.
Q. It seems like it's lower to the ground than it's ever been.
GARY WOODLAND: It's just something where I feel comfortable if I need to get the ball in the fairway I can hit that and it's been a shot that I worked on for a long time.
Q. Which club did you hit on 18?
GARY WOODLAND: That was a lob wedge.
