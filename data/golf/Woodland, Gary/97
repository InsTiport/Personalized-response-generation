 Q.   Obviously a disappointing way to finish.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I played beautifully all week.   I didn't get anything out of it the first two days, and finally put some rounds together the last two days.   You know, it's frustrating to bogey the last hole two days in a row.   Par‑5s cost me this week.   I played beautifully outside the par‑5s.   Finally birdied three of them today and then gave one away there on the last.  
   
 Q.   You're known for being one of the longer guys on TOUR.   This isn't necessarily a course you can overpower, but you've kind of figured a few things out about how to play?  
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, it sets up great to my eye.   It does.   It allows me, the holes I hit driver, it's a huge advantage.   The fairways are really soft so they're playing wider than they look, and I had some‑‑ par‑3s, everything sets up pretty good.   Unfortunately the par‑5s, which I should be able to get with irons, cost me this week.  
   
 Q.   Talk about 18 there at the end.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, when I teed off I was two back.   I missed the drive a little bit and I was just trying to get it just short of the green.   I hit it‑‑ missed the second shot a little bit and I had a horrible lie, and I actually hit a great third shot in there.   I tried to make the putt and hit it a little too hard, and I missed the next one coming back.  
   
 Q.   You beat 70 some players in the field, though, so all in all‑‑  
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, it's positive.   I've been off six weeks, so it was nice to come back.   It was nice to be in contention again on the weekend.   It was nice to play well.   Hopefully ride that momentum and play well next week.  
   
 Q.   Are you going to make sure that Ryan Moore doesn't make the trip over next year?  
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, he's playing great.   I played with him the first two days.   The golf course sets up great for him, as well.   His game looks really good.   He's driving it well and rolling the ball really well.   That adds up to pretty good scores.   
   
 Q.   Being that you're two kind of different players, do you still play the course similarly?   Do you guys carve the same shots out there or is it pretty different?  
GARY WOODLAND:   It's pretty different.   He's playing probably a little more conservative, I play more aggressively, and it just adds up.   He made a couple more putts than I did.
