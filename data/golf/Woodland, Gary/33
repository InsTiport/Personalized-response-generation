Q. Anything can happen.  You know that.  Talk about your round and the conditions this morning.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played great.  I would like to have been under par, but the golf course is tough.  If you get out of position, you're just fighting, trying to make par.  Happy with where I'm at, definitely played better than (indiscernible).
Q. What do you do heading into the weekend?  What are you going to do today?  You were up early.  How did the day start?  What time did you get up?
GARY WOODLAND: I got up right around 5 o'clock.  It will be a little practice today and then get back and rest.  That won't be too hard.  This golf course is a good test physically, but it's also draining mentally.  Today would be a good rest day, and then get back to work tomorrow.  Staying patient.  This golf course suits me very well, so as long as I can stay patient I should be able to attack a little bit and hopefully go low this weekend.
