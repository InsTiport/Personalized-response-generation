Q. Nice final round, a solid tournament for you to build a little momentum here.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played actually a lot better than I scored.  I'm dealing with some body ailments early in the week and really couldn't get going.  Kind of got loosened up the last few days and I was very happy with the way I played the last 30 holes.
Q. You guys have had so many different conditions this week, it was firm, fast, windy, rainy, what was the golf course like in this final round?
GARY WOODLAND: The golf course was perfect.  You feel bad for the members up here, because the golf course early in the week was very firm and it was going to be a great week.  With the rain coming in it softened it up and the scores are probably a little lower than they would want to see, but the golf course is perfect.  We're playing it up today, so no wind, definitely will be some scores out there.
Q. Is the golf course still playing wider fairways wider and the greens still receptive?
GARY WOODLAND: It's still wet, it's still soft, so the fairways are extremely large and you can attack the pins.  So if you drive the ball in the fairway, the greens are rolling perfect as well, you can definitely be aggressive.
