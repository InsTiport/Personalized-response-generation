 Q. Let's talk about the round today, on a very tough golf course, I don't want to say you made it look easy but that was good playing out there?
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played solid all day. I drove the ball well which you've got to do out here. The conditions are perfect. Golf course is in great shape. Try to get it on the greens and try to get a couple of putts to go in.

 Q. How pleased are you with a 4-under round?
 GARY WOODLAND: I feel good. Obviously I wanted to go out and shoot under par. I was trying to shoot under par on both nines and luckily I did that. I'm very happy with today.

 Q. You've had a heck of a year already. You're impressing us each and every week, whether it's bermuda or bent, poa annua, you play good on all of the surfaces. 
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, you know I'm healthy that's the main thing and I've learned a lot the last couple of years. I had nine months off rehabbing for the shoulder and really learned how to do certain things, attack my weaknesses the game is starting to come together.

 Q. You're a Kansas guy. Are you a Jayhawks fan or K-State?
 GARY WOODLAND: Big Kansas fan; Jayhawks.

 Q. President Obama picked Kansas for the second year in a row; Hopefully put the kibosh on him.
 GARY WOODLAND: Let's hope he didn't do it to us two years in a row. Rough year end of the year last year, so let's hope we can rebound this year and go get one.
