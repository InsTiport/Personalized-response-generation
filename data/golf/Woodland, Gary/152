  Q. Conditions changes from yesterday morning, kind of serene, got a little tougher today?  
 GARY WOODLAND: Today I thought it played very tough. Fortunately I drove the ball really well today. Kept the ball in the fairway all day, which I gave myself opportunities. The wind picked up. It was a little different direction it seemed like every hole. Happy with today.  
  
  Q. You were solid. 16 a wayward tee shot but other than that, no trouble at all.   
 GARY WOODLAND: Like I said I kept it out of trouble which is the key out here, very conservative game plan, which I'm not a big fan of, but it's working. Out here, I don't think wind is a huge advantage. There's not many holes to hit driver on. I laid back pretty much all day and tried to get the ball on the greens and make a couple of putts.  
  
  Q. Will you stay conservative tomorrow?  
 GARY WOODLAND: I think so. I don't think there's very many opportunities to hit driver. It's obviously working, so we'll keep doing what we are doing and hopefully it's good enough at the end.  
  
  Q. Happy with the way you are putting?  
 GARY WOODLAND: I am. I didn't make a lot today but I hit a bad putt there on 15, 3-putt on 14, the par 5, but other than that, I putted well all day.  
  
  Q. 17 was great. Nice crowd.  
 GARY WOODLAND: It was nice. They have been there it all day. We have heard them all day so it was nice to get one to go in there.   
  
  Q. Kansas/Boston University tonight. You'll be watching?  
 GARY WOODLAND: For sure. I hope it's a blowout. We had a rough end to the year last year so hopefully we can turn it around this year.
