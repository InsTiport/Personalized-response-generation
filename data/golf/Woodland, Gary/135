  Q. Blustery Thursday. There were a lot of different shots out there. Was that your little hybrid, or what did you hit off No. 8 off the green?   
 GARY WOODLAND: That was a little 3-wood there. The wind blew today, which we weren't prepared for it. Wasn't expected, let's put it that way.   
 But it was nice. Golf course played pretty good, the greens were rolling great, so gave ourself a lot opportunities.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible.)  
 GARY WOODLAND: (Laughing.) I don't know about the best one. No, it's cool. It's nice to see these guys, Steve Young, Ray Allen (phonetic). It's nice to see those guys come out, so it's been good.   
  
  Q. You seem to have a good personality for the tour. (Indiscernible: wind.)  
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, just a little more relaxed and laid back. You gotta pace yourself. (Indiscernible) but it's fun. It's a Nice change from what we usually do, so it's always nice to change it up.   
  
  Q. What did you do well today?  
 GARY WOODLAND: I played well. I chipped the ball well when I did miss is, and, you know, I rolled the ball pretty well. All in all, pretty solid day.
