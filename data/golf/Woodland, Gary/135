 Q. Thanks for joining us after a 68 today, 1-under for the tournament. Can you talk a little bit about your week? 
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played pretty good this week. I just made a couple mental mistakes. I had three three-putts and three bogeys from the middle of the fairway with 9-iron in my hand. After that I played pretty well, just can't make the mental mistakes I made in the championship.

 Q. What kind of confidence does it give you going forward posting in a red number when so many guys were in the black?
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I'm playing well. The game is starting to come along. It's getting close. It's not exactly where we want it, but all in all throughout the whole game from driving to putting to chipping, everything, it's coming along pretty good.

 Q. How was the course playing today?
 GARY WOODLAND: It was playing tough today. The wind was blowing a little bit more, enough where you really had to think about it, and the pins were obviously tucked for Sunday. I was very happy with the way I played today.
