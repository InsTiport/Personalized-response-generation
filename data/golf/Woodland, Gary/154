  Q. Gary, pretty good day out there today, just steady, solid golf?  
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I didn't do anything great today. I played solid. I made bogey on the first hole from the middle of the fairway with a sand wedge in my hand. Outside of that, I played solidly. I got it up-and-down quite a bit today. All in all, I'm in good position heading into Sunday.  
  
  Q. I've got to know, middle of the fairway, No. 1, you make bogey with a sand wedge in your hand. How do you come back from that?   
 GARY WOODLAND: You're going to make bogeys out here. So if you're going to do it, you might as well get it out of the way on the first hole I guess is the way I see it. That's what I was telling myself, and it paid off.  
  
  Q. No more bogeys the rest of the day. How much more difficult was the wind today compared to the first two days?  
 GARY WOODLAND: It was a little different direction, so that's amazing. I thought it was blowing the same, it was just you had to think a little bit more because it was blowing different directions and you have to aim different places. All in all, still blowing.   
  
  Q. Plan for tomorrow?  
 GARY WOODLAND: Go out and keep doing the same thing I've been doing and hopefully some putts drop.
