 Q. 2-under for the day?
 GARY WOODLAND: I played solid today. I hit it good. You know, I gave myself a lot of opportunities. I made one double there on 15, but I hit a good shot there; it was a little too much club. 
 All in all it was a good day. I'm in a great position and looking forward to the weekend.

 Q. How did conditions today compare to yesterday?
 GARY WOODLAND: I thought they were similar. I think the golf course is playing hard but it's pretty fair. Obviously you have to control the ball flight. So fortunately I'm controlling it right now. 

 Q. How much difference with the wind is club selection?
 GARY WOODLAND: It varies. It can get up to five clubs, depending on how high you're going to hit it and stuff. It's blowing out there. The tough winds are cross-winds into you, and downwind it's all right. It's the crosswind you have to watch out for.
