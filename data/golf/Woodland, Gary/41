JACK RYAN: We'll get started here with our runner-up at the Sentry Tournament of Champions, Gary Woodland.  Gary, obviously it wasn't result you were looking for today but just an opening comment on the week and the round today.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played great all week.  I played solid today.  Drove the ball phenomenally, controlled it into the greens.  There was a couple shots early on the front nine I would like to have back to a couple left pins, I just wasn't aggressive enough.  Outside that have I played great.  Didn't get enough putts to go in early in the round.  Made some there through the middle and then you just -- I saw what Xander was doing in front of me, so I was trying to stay aggressive knowing what he was doing, knowing there was some par-5s and last hole I just got in between clubs.  4-iron that I had in my hands probably wasn't enough, 2-iron was definitely too much, so we were trying to hit a big hook in there and I just didn't hook it.  So it was tough there.  Tough making par on the last.  But this one will hurt tonight but excited about where my game is.
JACK RYAN: Take some questions, please.
Q. What can you say about the 62 that Xander put up?  That's some real good shooting, isn't it?
GARY WOODLAND: That's really good.  Obviously the conditions today were the golf course was gettable, as gettable as it was all week.  And you knew that going in.  You knew, I knew I was going to have to make birdies, I knew the goal was to birdie the par-5s and get a couple more.  Obviously if I would have done that, if I would have birdied the last, I would have done that.  But 62 is obviously an awesome round of golf and hats off to Xander.  That's really, really good.
Q. You talked yesterday I think about playing with Tiger at the PGA and what you learned in that situation.  In a situation like this is it more about learning the way your body's going to respond or more about your game?
GARY WOODLAND: More about my game.  I learned a lot that day and I'm trusting my game a lot more.  Obviously laying up on 14 was one where I trusted my game.  I trusted my wedge shot where I normally never would have done that.  I played to the left side of the green on 9.  I pulled it but I was able to get it up-and-down.  Little things like that where I played a little more conservatively, trusting the rest of my game, and I stayed patient today.  I didn't get a lot of putts to go in early in the round and I kept fighting and that's something definitely I take away from playing on Sunday with Tiger.
Q. You've got a three shot lead and shoot 68 in the final round.  You never shot worse than 68 all week.  And a guy throws a 62 on you.  At some point, maybe not tonight, is it going to be easier to look back at this with some positives compared with other times?
GARY WOODLAND: No, I don't think it will ever be easy because I still believe I was playing well enough to shoot 66 today.  The game was in a good spot.  You have an iron into the par-5 in the middle of the fairway on the last hole you expect to make birdie.  I had killed the par-5s all week this week, which is what you got to do out here.  So I knew what he was doing and the competitor in me knew I needed to do one better and unfortunately I didn't get it done.
Q. Did you hit it too good on 18?
GARY WOODLAND: I did.  I was juiced up.  I knew that.  It got down there farther than I thought.  When we were walking down, Butchy said, maybe we will be able to hit iron into here and unfortunately we got down too far where 2-iron I would have had to start in the middle of the junk and cut it so I was trying to ride the wind with a 4-iron and I just came out of it a little bit.  So it was frustrating to have a bad number, but I still had a chance to get it up-and-down just didn't get it done.
JACK RYAN: All right well thanks for the time, Gary.
GARY WOODLAND: Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.
