  Q. (No microphone.)  
 GARY WOODLAND: I knew it was going to be hot, tried to dress for it. I played good but -- I played good all day but obviously I left some out there, made a bogey on 16, a par 5, which you just can't do.   
 All in all I played solid.   
  
  Q. But you made an eagle on the other par 5. Tell me about that.   
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, the hole sets up great for me, I can take it over that bunker, it goes way down there, then hit a 7-iron in there, 30 feet or so and made it. It was nice to get one going, nice to see one go in.   
  
  Q. 68 today. How tough was it out there?   
 GARY WOODLAND: It's tough. The golf course is setin' up where you just make pars.   
 Fortunately I got in under par, and like I said, I gave one back on 16, but it was definitely tough today.   
  
  Q. All those days in the Kansas wind help you a little bit?   
 GARY WOODLAND: For sure, I feel very comfortable out here. The ball strikin' part is easy, I grew up hitin' like this, so you've just to the to stay stable.   
  
  Q. How hard is it to concentrate when the weather is like this? Is that the hard part, too?   
 GARY WOODLAND: No, not too bad. I think the hardest part is the greens. Like I say, I've done this my whole life, in weather like this; this is another Kansas day for me.  
  
  Q. Arjun said he's going to wear black tomorrow. Are you going to?   
 GARY WOODLAND: No, I'm going to wear white tomorrow, cool down a little bit.   
  
  Q. Congratulations, nice round.   
 GARY WOODLAND: Appreciate it thanks.
