  Q. Gary, what a nice round of golf played today. Come to Pebble Beach without the wind, and you took advantage.   
 GARY WOODLAND: I did. The conditions were perfect out here obviously. I drove the ball well, put myself in a lot of positions.   
 Didn't make a lot of putts, but I got a couple to drop early.  
  
  Q. Any time you get around Pebble Beach bogey-free it's a good day.   
 GARY WOODLAND: It is. I've played here a couple times and struggled in the past, so it was nice to get a good round under my belt.  
  
  Q. So have so much club head speed, and yet you hit a variety of shots off the tee. You laid up with irons; you don't hit driver all that often. Did you think of hitting driver on 18?   
 GARY WOODLAND: I did. I cut the driver and I had to aim way too far left, so I hit a bad swinging with a 3-wood. It's tough to make par of par-5s out here, especially with my length. Like to have that one back.  
  
  Q. Pace of play was slow. It's just going to be that way in this tournament. I thought you did a good job of pacing yourself and not getting frustrated.   
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, you're prepared for that coming in. I think they've done a little bit better. Two years ago I think it was really slow.   
 Conditions I think dictate a little bit of that. We had a good time out there, and look forward to some more.  
  
  Q. Looks like you're gonna leave the west coast with your card secured. That has to be a great feeling.  
 GARY WOODLAND: It is. It's nice to take a little pressure off. I'm out here trying to get better every week, and long year ahead.  
  
  Q. Gary, a fine 67 today. You struggled here at Pebble Beach in the past. What triggered today, your best round here ever?  
 GARY WOODLAND: I drove the ball well today. I gave myself a lot of opportunities. Hit a lot of fairways. Obviously the conditions were perfect.  
 So got it on the green and was trying to make putts.  
  
  Q. Now you've got to go over to Monterey Peninsula. This is just your second time in the tournament. How have you prepared for Monterey?   
 GARY WOODLAND: I only played nine holes over there, so I haven't seen the back nine. I've heard nothing but good things about that golf course, so I'm excited to get out there and play.   
 I heard it's a little shorter, so probably a lot of irons.  
  
  Q. You lost a playoff in the Hope, but you were in the playoff. How much confidence did that give you even though you didn't come away with the victory?   
 GARY WOODLAND: A lot. You know, I played well all week there. Obviously I didn't make a lot putts on Sunday there, but I hill it well all week. To be in contention all week was huge going forward for me. I'm looking forward to it.   
  
  Q. Best of luck.
