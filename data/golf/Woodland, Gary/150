   COLIN MURRAY: Gary Woodland, thanks for joining us, 67 today, 11-under for the tournament. Looks like currently two shots back. If you could just give us a few thoughts on the day and the week so far, obviously it's been a good one and then we'll go from there. 
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I played pretty solid all week. Drove the ball well. Kept it in play. I hit a lot of greens. 
 Today I didn't do anything really on the front side and then finally I got some putts to go in on the back and posted a pretty good number. All in all, just played pretty solid. 
 COLIN MURRAY: Three Top-10s already on the year; your mind-set to just keep things going right now.
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I'm just trying to get better every day and hopefully it's enough. Obviously it's been off to a good start but still got a long way to go. 
 COLIN MURRAY: If you could just go through your birdies and bogeys for us that, would be great, starting with the 3 on 2.
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, 2, I hit two solid shots in there about 20 feet and made a good putt. 
 I bogeyed 6. 

 Q. Trees on the right, trees on the left?
 GARY WOODLAND: I had a 2-iron to the left, chipped it up six feet short and missed it. 3-putt on 8, got a little aggressive, was a little frustrating.
 On the back side, finally got a putt to go in on 11 after hitting a bad drive. Hit two good shots in there on 12. 
 14, I hit another bad drive. Pulled it off the tee, laid up and I hit a good wedge shot there and made it.
 16, it's a tough hole. Hit it back 15 feet behind the hole and made it.
 Then 18, hit probably two of the best swings I've made all day just behind it and rolled it in. 

 Q. What do you have left on 18? 
 GARY WOODLAND: I had 160 hole. I hit 8-iron. 

 Q. And what do you hit off the tee on 16?
 GARY WOODLAND: On 16 I hit 2-iron. 

 Q. I don't know how much you saw or how much you pay attention to a board on Saturday, but when you drop a few on the front and it's so bunched like that, is there a part of you that worries about falling too far out of the mix? An awful lot of players up there. 
 GARY WOODLAND: I was trying to go low. I was hitting good shots early and just didn't get anything to go in. Once I made the bogey at 8 and got to 6-under my goal was to get to double digits. I knew I would still be in the golf tournament going into tomorrow if I got to double digits, and that's what I tried to do on the back side and fortunately I got up to 11. 

 Q. This is a golf course that normally would be a ball-striker's course, not a guy that's extremely long, but you seem to be taking advantage of it, could you talk about how you feel comfortable, why you feel comfortable out here?
 GARY WOODLAND: I flew into Dallas -- I had last week off and flew into Dallas to see Randy Smith on Sunday morning, just didn't feel like I was hitting it very well last week after taking a couple of days off. We put a very conservative game plan together, and I had not seen the place and he was telling me about it. I've played conservative all week, a lot of 2-irons, laying back. I'm hitting the ball well right now; so that conservative game plan is working and that's pretty much what we are doing. 

 Q. Where are you hitting driver? 
 GARY WOODLAND: I hit driver on the first hole, par 5. The par 5 fifth, trying to get over the bunkers and then I hit it on 9, 10 and 11. 

 Q. 18? 
 GARY WOODLAND: No. I hit 3-wood on 18. 

 Q. You came so close at the Bob Hope, wondering if that was sort of just a great learning experience, confidence boost, even though you didn't win, just carrying through. 
 GARY WOODLAND: It was. I played well that day. Unfortunately I just didn't get the putter hot. I hit the ball really well. Gave myself a lot of opportunities and made a good birdie to get in the playoff and made another one to advance. Yeah, I took a lot from that and obviously the confidence has kept going. 

 Q. What exactly happened to your shoulder? 
 GARY WOODLAND: I had a torn labrum in the left shoulder and in '09, I had surgery in August, nine months rehab.

 Q. How does one tear one's labrum, do you know?
 GARY WOODLAND: Good question. Wear and tear. No idea. 

 Q. Other than confidence, what else did you take from the whole playoff that got you? 
 GARY WOODLAND: I took from that -- the main thing I took from that is what I'm doing at home with Randy Smith and everything we are doing to my game, I am moving in the right direction. I'm not where I want to be by any means. I have a long way to go but I'm learning how to play this game, and you know, it's starting to show. 

 Q. Scott Stallings is here on an exemption this week and doing well. I think your good finish was on an exemption; can you talk about what it's like, getting an exemption, do you feel more pressure, less pressure; can you relate to what he's going through?
 GARY WOODLAND: I got a sponsor's exemption into Phoenix. I finished fifth. 
 I think it's a little bit of pressure to start the week for sure. You've got a lot to do with the tournament. They gave you a spot, so you have to go out there and make sure you take care of all the business with them. I was fortunate that Waste Management, they gave me an exemption there. I think once you start playing, you forget about that and you try to take care of business. 

 Q. Have you reached 5 in two yet?
 GARY WOODLAND: No, today I could have got home the first day today and easily, I just did not hit it in the fairway. 

 Q. You should try that tomorrow?
 GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, that's the plan. (Laughter).
 COLIN MURRAY: Thanks for your time. Play well tomorrow.
