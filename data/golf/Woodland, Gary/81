 Q.  Just overall thoughts on your round today?  
GARY WOODLAND: It was a good day.  Obviously conditions were great.  Controlled the ball really well.  I had 18 putts, I think, for birdie.  I think a couple were on the fringe, but I hit it good today.  I would like to see a couple more putts go in, but I'm excited where I'm at.  I've got a chance tomorrow, go out and hopefully get some putts to go in.   
 Q.  Do you have a number in mind?  
GARY WOODLAND: No.  I mean, it's going to be nice again tomorrow, so it's going to set up for some birdies.  Obviously Sunday -- we'll see what happens.  It's supposed to be nice.  Make some birdies.  I'd like to get probably seven or eight tomorrow.   
 Q.  Did you work on anything over the break, the little break there?  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, everything.  I dialed in a bunch of new clubs.  I've got 12 new clubs in the bag, so I've got a lot going on there, new golf ball, but it's all coming together pretty nice.
