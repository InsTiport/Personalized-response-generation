 Q.   Gary, another good, solid round for you, 3‑under 67, 5‑under coming into the house, your thoughts on how you played?   
GARY WOODLAND:   I played solid the last few days, haven't got any putts going in yet, but I'm comfortable out here on the golf course, feel very good about where my game is.   Hopefully get some putts to go in this weekend.   
   
 Q.   You hit 14 greens yesterday, 15 today, that's solid anywhere.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Game feels really good, I was a little off on the speed on the greens, but the ball striking feels really good.   Hopefully get that speed down this weekend and have a fun weekend.   
   
 Q.   How about the scoring conditions compared to yesterday afternoon.   No hint of a breeze out here today.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Golf course is perfect, conditions are perfect.   It's a great golf course you've got to drive the ball and keep it in play and get it on the greens.   The greens are perfect.   Good speed down there to make some putts.   
   
 Q.   You and Keegan and Matt Kuchar all seemed to play well today.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, we played solid.   All of us.   Didn't make too many putts out there but we all played pretty solid out there today.   
   
 Q.   Thanks for your time.
