Q. Nice start, including a birdie at the last.  Had a chance for an eagle there.  I know you threw in a couple of long putts on your opening nine.  Your thoughts on how you played today?
GARY WOODLAND: I really played solid.  I wanted to hit all 18 greens.  I missed 17 coming in there which was a little frustrating, but I played nicely.  I drove the ball in play and iron game was pretty good.  I made some putts early.  Lipped-out a bunch coming down the stretch, but I'm happy with where I'm at.
Q. You seem to be getting the hang of this place.  First couple of times you came here you missed the cut, and you had a third place and a 13th.  How have you adjusted your game to this golf course?
GARY WOODLAND: I played a little more conservatively than I did.  When I was young, I would say, eight years ago I guess now, I was hitting driver everywhere.  The key out here is get the ball in play, get it on the greens and attack from there.  Playing a lit bit more conservatively, a little smarter, a little wiser.
Q. Any changes in the bag?
GARY WOODLAND: It's all pretty similar.  I put the new M2 driver in which is phenomenal.  Unfortunately I don't get to hit it much around here but the driver is great.  Very comfortable, same stuff I played with last year, so pretty excited about that.
