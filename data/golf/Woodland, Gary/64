 Q.  I was waiting for you to get to 12-under par, you had a lot of chances there on those finishing holes.  Your thoughts on how you played today, 6-under, 64.  
GARY WOODLAND: I played solid.  I didn't hit it as well as I did yesterday but got off to a rocky start.  I really kind of settled in and I had it going.  I had a lot of chances to go lower than I did, but I'm happy with where I'm at.  I'm happy with where I'm playing and looking forward to the weekend.   
 Q.  Five consecutive birdies in a row.  Take us through that stretch.  
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, it was nice to see something go in.  I hit a good shot in there on 6.   
And then 7, I made a good putt.   
8, I hit another good shot in there close.   
9, obviously really a par 4 for us.  I had an 8-iron in there.   
And 10 is a drivable hole.  So you're getting up there close.  Obviously it's nice to see five in a row.  I haven't done that in a while out here.   
 Q.  You were patient off the tee, using some irons.  How often did you think:  You know what, maybe I'm going to pull out the big stick.  
GARY WOODLAND: I want to pull it out every hole but it just doesn't set up.  I did that my first couple times here and that didn't work out for me.  I'm very comfortable with where my game is.   
Driver feels great.  I just don't get many opportunities out here.  I'm not complaining about being in the fairway either.   
 Q.  You're going to be in the final group on Saturday.  Your thoughts as you try to chase down Justin?  
GARY WOODLAND: He's obviously playing great golf.  I'm excited where I'm at.  Me and J.T. are good friends and we'll have a good time.  I'm looking forward to it.
