Q. Thoughts on the second day, big birdie to close there.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, that was nice.  It was really frustrating.  I didn't play great today.  Struggled really just getting the distances down all day.  I missed a lot of greens but I scrambled well.
I did do that.  And it was nice to finish with a birdie, especially coming off the bogey.  The bogey on 8 really hurt, but to finish with a birdie gives me more momentum going into the weekend.
Q. Very similar first two days to 2013, I think you had seven points the second day there and were a couple of points back then had the big third day.  Does that give you good vibes going into tomorrow?
GARY WOODLAND: I'm comfortable on the golf course.  The game feels really well.  Just off a little.  We'll get that one out of the way and tidy things up be ready for a big weekend.
Q. It's been a few years since you've been here.  How much of the course do you remember?
GARY WOODLAND: Once I got here, I remembered everything.  You get some good vibes and some good memories over a lot of the holes.  Hopefully I can set good memories tomorrow as well.
Q. Does the modified Stableford fit your game a little better?
GARY WOODLAND: Allows me to play aggressive, which is nice.  Birdie and bogey is better than two pars good.  So allows me to play aggressive and that sets up pretty good for me.
Q. You kind of ran away from them on the weekend in 2013.  What do you remember about that weekend?
GARY WOODLAND: I did a lot of things well.  I chipped the ball exceptionally pretty.  I think I chipped it three or four times on the weekend, which is nice; made some putts as well.  Hopefully bring back some of those good vibes and continue the good play I've been doing.
