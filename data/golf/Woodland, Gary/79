Q. Nice little come back for you.  Got off to a little bit of a rocky start.  I saw a double on the card.
GARY WOODLAND: I struggled driving the ball today.  I got in some interesting spots.  But, I really hung in there, attacked the par-5s, played the par-5s 5-under.  So that was a good plus for me.  Hopefully get the driver straightened out and have a good weekend.
Q. You birdied the last two holes to shoot 4-under.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, I drove the ball in play.  When I drove it in play today, I gave myself pretty good chances.  The golf course is in great shape, playing a little tougher than it has in the past, but all in all I'm happy.
Q. As you know, this tournament seems to go to players that drive the ball a long way, length a big advantage out here.  Did you straighten the driver out midway through the round?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, a little bit more comfortable.  The South side sets up a little better for me.  Every hole seems to fade left-to-right.  So I'm excited about the next couple days.
Q. Nice way to finish.  Talk about your round.
GARY WOODLAND: I played solid.  I didn't drive it great, I had a bad double there on the second hole today, but outside of that, I controlled the ball pretty well, gave myself chances when I did get it in play and made some birdies.  I attacked the par-5s, played them 5-under, which helps.  But all in all I'm excited about where I'm at.
Q. How important is it to get off, when you play the North Course first, how important is it to get a good round out there?
GARY WOODLAND: It is.  You definitely think about it a little bit, because you know the South Course is a big boy golf course.  But the South Course is one of my favorite golf courses we play all year.  Most holes go left-to-right, so I'm excited about playing well today and excited about the weekend.
