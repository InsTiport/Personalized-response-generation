Q.   Maybe just some comments about your round.   I don't know if you thought you'd be within a shot or two of the lead heading into the final round, but it looks like you're going to be that way.   Maybe just thoughts going into today and talk about your round today. 
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, obviously I wanted to go out and get off to a good start.   I did that.   To shoot 5‑under and only be a couple off the lead, I didn't think that would happen.   Keegan was obviously playing really well.   But there were a lot of guys ahead of me that are obviously playing good.   I'm in a good spot, been playing well, go out and play well tomorrow and see what happens.

Q.   Looking at this golf course, it's relatively short or not overly long, really, really tight fairways, probably not a typical golf course for somebody like you or Bubba who I think shot 65 today.   Kind of talk about just your strategy playing this golf course because you can't obviously overpower it?
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, it's tough.   The good thing is it's soft so it is playing longer than the number, and the ball is going a long way, though.   The key is to get the ball in the fairway.   You do that, the greens are good enough that you can make putts.   I've been driving the ball well.   I'm still hitting a lot of drivers for me, so I keep driving it well and see what happens tomorrow.

Q.   What did you work on in the off‑season? 
GARY WOODLAND:   I've been playing good.   I've been playing good for a long time, I just haven't been putting it great and got a little putting tip from Phil actually this week, and it's been working pretty well.   Excited about that. 

Q.   And with Tony on the bag, he's been with Greg, he's been withAdam.   Talk about‑‑
GARY WOODLAND:   He's been where I want to go.   It's been a good deal.   We're obviously still getting to know each other a little bit, but we're having a lot of fun doing it, and it helps me play well.

Q.   Did you know him already or‑‑
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I knew him.   Obviously he's worked with Greg and Adam, so he's been around the Harmons a long time, so being around the Harmons I've gotten to know him, and hopefully we can get better.

Q.   In terms of the game plan tomorrow, I'm not sure you thought you'd be in the final group tomorrow. 
GARY WOODLAND:   Exactly.   We'll just keep doing what we're doing.   Game plan is set, we've just got to execute.

Q.   And in terms of getting off to a nice start with the wrap‑around season and a no‑cut event and being able to come out with a win tomorrow, finishing high in terms of FedExCup points‑‑
GARY WOODLAND:   That's huge.   That's why I came.   That's why I came here was to get off to a good start.   This will be the last event I play on the PGA TOUR this year, so I wanted to come over and obviously play well and enjoy the off‑season a little bit better.   You can do that when you get off to a good start.
