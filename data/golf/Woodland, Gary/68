 Q.  3-under today, 5-under total.  What has allowed you to stay pretty consistent this week?  
GARY WOODLAND: My game's been pretty good.  It's been good all year but it was nice having last week off, going out and get something work done with Butch in Vegas, and coming to a golf course that I really enjoy.  The golf course sets up for me very well and I've played some pretty good golf.   
 Q.  How does it set up for you well?  
GARY WOODLAND: It's long off the tee.  The rough is up, but it's starting to firm up a little bit, which is nice.  It was a little soft earlier in the week, but it's just a big, hard golf course, which I enjoy.  Looking forward to tomorrow.   
 Q.  So what do you have to do tomorrow and tonight to hold on and stay here at the top of the leaderboard?  
GARY WOODLAND: Tonight I need to get some rest.  It's a big golf course and it's a long walk.   
Tomorrow, I've just got to keep doing what I'm doing.  I'm doing a lot of good things well.  I'm hitting the ball well and I'm starting to roll it pretty nice, which is good for me.
