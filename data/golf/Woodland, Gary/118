 Q.   You birdied four of the last five holes, sitting at 9â€‘under today, obviously there's been a lot of golf in a short amount of time.   Tell us how you feel right now.   
GARY WOODLAND:   I feel ecstatic right now to be done.   It was a close call coming down the stretch if we would be able to finish.   
Luckily I played great today, gave myself a lot of opportunities, and I drove the ball phenomenally and rolled some putts in, especially late.  
   
 Q.   You have a lot of momentum going into the Playoffs and you're playing well.   
GARY WOODLAND:   Yeah, I won a couple of weeks ago, which gave me a lot of momentum.   I've been playing pretty good this year, just haven't broken through on the weekends.   
Right now, it's seeming to click and controlling the golf ball pretty well and feel like I'm rolling the golf ball pretty well on the greens.   
   
 Q.   How is the course playing with the changes and with the weather?   
GARY WOODLAND:   I didn't play it before.   So the weather has been tough.   There was a lot of starting and stopping yesterday.   Today was phenomenal.   It really dried out well.   The golf ball was rolling, and the greens were still receptive, so you could take some shots at some of the pins.   But all in all, the golf course is in great shape.  
   
 Q.   You're going into the weekend with two completed rounds, and you don't have to finish tomorrow morning; what's your mentality going into that?  
GARY WOODLAND:   It will be nice to sleep in a little bit tomorrow morning and go out and get ready.   Obviously you're going to have to make birdies, and the golf course is giving up some right now.   So get some rest and go out and play well tomorrow.
