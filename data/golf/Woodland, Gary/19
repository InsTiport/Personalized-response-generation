Q. Good round today, 8-under par. Talk about what was going so well for you today.
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, a lot similar to yesterday. I played great today. Unfortunately made double there on 7, which hurt, but outside of that, I played really well. I gave myself a lot of chances, saw a couple putts. It was nice to make birdie on the last. It would have been frustrating if I didn't get that one, but all in all, solid day, and looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. You were in great position last year and it didn't go your way. Do you feel like maybe this place owes you one, that you have a good chance going into tomorrow?
GARY WOODLAND: Yeah, that's golf. I was excited about the way I played last year, and unfortunately ran into a buzz saw there on Sunday with Xander. But hopefully we can flip that. But I'm excited about where my game is at. I'm playing well. Saw some putts go in, which is nice for me, and so hopefully go out and play well tomorrow and give myself a chance.
Q. With the conditions, do you feel like it's going to take a real low one or maybe not as low as it has in the past?
GARY WOODLAND: No, the conditions will dictate that, but the golf course isn't playing as easy as it has in the past, so there's not as many birdies out there, but obviously you have four par-5s, you've got a couple short par-4s, so there's some holes you need to attack. Hopefully I can go out and post a low number and put some pressure on the guys in front.
