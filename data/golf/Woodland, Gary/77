Q. A tough golf course today and you fought and it fought back.  How would you describe your play?
GARY WOODLAND: Up-and-down.  The golf course definitely played as tough as it has all week.  Definitely tougher than it did yesterday.  I would like to drive the ball a little bit straighter early in the round, but I made some good swings coming down the stretch.  It was nice to get some birdies coming in and get some momentum going into tomorrow.
Q. How important is that for your mentality, momentum heading into the final round?
GARY WOODLAND: Huge, because I hadn't seen a putt go in, so it was nice to see a putt go in there on 15.  I hit good putts and 16 and 17 and made birdie on 18.  Which was nice.  So I'm happy with the way I finished.
Q. Let's talk about tomorrow, not only do you have everyone else you have to beat, this golf course is tough enough, but now you got elements with rain and wind that could get up to 45 miles an hour.  How do you prepare for that mentally?
GARY WOODLAND: I'm excited for it.  That's what you want.  You want it to be as tougher as you can.  You want to go out there and earn it.  So I hope it's tough and I hope I have a good day.
