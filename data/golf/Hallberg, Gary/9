Q.   Talk about the eagle today. 
GARY HALLBERG:   Oh, okay.   I hit a pretty big drive on 15.   I only had 187, I think, to the hole.   And I hit an aggressive 6â€‘iron about six feet and made the putt. 

Q.   Did you know you had it wasn't six feet, did you see it pretty clearly?
GARY HALLBERG:   The shot or the putt? 

Q.   Both. 
GARY HALLBERG:   Well, I had a little bit of a hook lie and the pin was in the back left.   So it was favoring a draw.   So I was able to draw it back there and it was great.   Nice making an eagle.   You don't make them every day.
