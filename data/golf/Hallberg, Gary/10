  Q. Shot 67 today. Just kind of go through your round. It looked like it was just a real solid round.   
 GARY HALLBERG: Actually we played 31 holes today, so it was a long day. Well, early on I was 2-over and I eagled, I knocked it about 10 inches with a 3-wood on number 7 to go, bring it back to even for the morning round. That was great.   
 And then so the afternoon I birdied the first hole from 30 feet, 2nd hole from eight feet, 4th hole from about four feet.   
 And then let's see, 5 -- 6 was the best shot. I hit a 3-wood off the tee and a hybrid about six inches from the hole.   
 I bogeyed 8. I couldn't decide what club to hit and knocked it in the bunker and missed a 10-footer for par.   
 Then going on the other nine, let's see, 13 I birdied, made about a 12 foot putt there.   
 And then I bogeyed 16 both days. I drove it just in that left rough where I had bad lies and couldn't get it to the green. Missed about an eight, 10-footer there.   
 And then I birdied 17 and 18. Hit an 8-iron to 12 feet on 17, maybe 10 feet on 17; and an 8-iron to about the same, 8 feet on 18. I drove from a bad lie in the rough on the right there and had to chop it out and I was able to still make a birdie. So it was good.   
  
  Q. A really good round. What's the plans for tomorrow, for tonight? Just going to get rest?  
 GARY HALLBERG: We walked a long way. We got up early and played in the wet, soggy conditions. 31 holes. For an old man like us, you know, that's rugged. So I think I'm just going to go and get some food and rest and get ready for tomorrow.
