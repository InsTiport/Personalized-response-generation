  GARY HALLBERG:   Well, Tom and I, we started out the first couple‑‑ I bogeyed the first two, and then he made a bogey, so we were a little bit slow starting.   The official put us on the clock, so we started rushing, so we kind of never had any rhythm all day, either one of us.   Between messing up early and then rushing, it just seemed like we couldn't quite get ourselves in a good rhythm out there.   We were just trying to catch up all day long.   But 3‑over is not all bad.   It's a hard course.  
   
 Q.   It's essentially still blustery out there, and you've put yourself in a decent position anyway for the final day?  
GARY HALLBERG:   Exactly.   I'm happy.  
   
 Q.   What were your thoughts starting with a healthy lead after that exceptional round yesterday?  
GARY HALLBERG:   Well, I would have liked to have shot a couple, 3‑under today, but I went in three of those fairway bunkers, and you know, that's bogey.   I hadn't hit any of those the first two days.   I went in a bunch of sand today, probably five sand traps all day, and those are my bogeys.   
   
 Q.   You presumably were buzzing after yesterday, and I know you didn't wish any bad, but you were right clear‑‑  
GARY HALLBERG:   Great pairing, and I was happy.   I enjoyed playing with Tom today.   He's a joy to play with.  
   
 Q.   He was talking very nicely about you in glowing terms yesterday because you, I think, amazed everybody, including yourself, with that round?   
GARY HALLBERG:   Yeah, it was just one of those days.   I'm so happy.   
   
 Q.   But now regroup and get ready?  
GARY HALLBERG:   Exactly.   I'm going to go hit some balls.
