Q.   What are your overall thoughts on how the round went today?
GARY HALLBERG:   Well, inconsistent.   I recovered well.   I think I made four bogeys and five birdies.   That's been kind of what I've been doing every day, five bogeys and six birdies or something like that.   Lots of birdie and quite a few bogeys, too. 
Overall I've been trying to stay pretty even keel and not get too excited about a bogey and it's been paying off, because I've been rebounding with a good score on the next hole.

Q.   What holes do you feel like you might have lost an opportunity or that you could have made up another stroke or two?
GARY HALLBERG:   Oh, gee, my memory's not that good.   I'm over 50 now. 
I would say that‑‑ you know, it's hard to say.   I don't know.   I would have to think about it.   But I got ‑‑ I had a good day and I'm happy to be where I'm at.

Q.   Only three shots off the lead, what's your mentality now heading into tomorrow?
GARY HALLBERG:   Well, try and do the same thing that I did the first three days and not make the bogeys.   That would be good. 

Q.   And what are your thoughts overall on the course conditions and how it played today?
GARY HALLBERG:   The course is spectacular.   It's real fun to play, it's got a lot, it's got the character.   Every shot in the bag, a lot of uneven lies, a lot of slope, but the more you play it, the more you enjoy it, because you get to know it.   You get to know where you need to go and where you really ought to stay away from.   So it's, I think it's wonderful.
