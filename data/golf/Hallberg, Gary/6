Q.   7‑under, wonderful total, how do you rate its chances? 
GARY HALLBERG:   Well, I'm just happy to be in at 7‑under.   We had a little rain there the last hole and a half, and I was quite nervous on the 18th tee.   You know, 7‑under, looking at the scores, I think Freddie has two holes to go, a par 5 that he can reach, and then 18.   So he probably has the advantage at the moment.   But if he doesn't birdie 17 for whatever reason, then I like my chances.   But it sure feels good to be where I am right now.

Q.   You birdied the 13th to get within one shot; did you have a target score in mind at that stage? 
GARY HALLBERG:   No, I was just trying to hit the fairway, hit the green.   That was my plan.   And I didn't really think about that.   I tried to stay in the present moment.   I think I did a nice job of that.   I wanted to get ahead of myself.   But I stayed in the present moment.   Tried not to worry too much about the bounces, because you know how it is out here.   You get good and bad bounces, and luck is a word that is used quite often, linen Scott Lennon, you can see why, with the way the ball bounces around the fairways and the greens, it's difficult. 
But quite happy like I said, and we'll see what happens.
