  GARY HALLBERG: To the crowd, some way, somehow. I went bogey, double bogey after we came back from the rain delay. I'm in the top 7 or so, but hindsight, it was a good week. It was a really good week. I made a lot of good putts; I missed some putts, and it was hard.   
 You look at the golf course, you think, gosh, this shouldn't be that difficult, and then you go play it in competition, and it's very, very -- those putts are very trying, and you know, you miss cue and you could make double bogey.   
 I bogeyed that 16th hole missing the green. I couldn't even get it on the green. It was very hard.   
 It was a great place for a Senior U.S. Open. Couldn't have been better. I told them on the First Tee, "How soon can we come back here?"   
 They said, Well, we can't for five years, but maybe on the sixth year we can do it.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).  
 GARY HALLBERG: Oh, yeah. It's great. When you have support out there, it's unbelievable. When you're walking on the fairway and someone says your name, you want to run over and say, How are you; good to see you; oh, hey, how are you. But you walk down the fairway and you gotta kind of ignore them and kind of do head waves.   
 It's frustrating. I ran into people I haven't seen. I saw some people I grew up with, high school, elementary school, Chicago. Lots and lots of different folks from all over the country come here to enjoy this week.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible).   
 GARY HALLBERG: Wonderful. Love The Broadmoor. It was a great, great place to play a tournament. It was really -- couldn't say enough about it.
