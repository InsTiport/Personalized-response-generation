  Q. What were the highlights of the week for you?   
 GARY HALLBERG: Just being in Colorado. The fans were really great. Playing this golf course, just being here. I think that was the highlight.   
 On a footnote, I think that, as far as the golf goes, I thought I played, hit the ball well enough, didn't putt well enough this week, and that was kind of my moral of my week, the moral of the story for me this week.   
 It was just one of those week, some weeks you hit the ball bad and you putt the ball good, some weeks you do the opposite. I just didn't get it all together.   
  
  Q. How great was it for you playing in your home state?  
 GARY HALLBERG: It was wonderful. It was just great to see a lot of people I haven't seen in a while, a lot of people out here. There is quite a crowd. It's going to be an exciting finish and it would have been nice to be there, but it was a great week.
