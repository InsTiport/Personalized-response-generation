 Q. Just sort of sum up the week. 
 JIM THORPE: I was expecting better because I worked hard. But, you know, what, I don't like my golf clubs. I changed from Callaway. I won't say what I played this week, but just not my cup of tea, you know what I mean? 
 I drove the ball decent and putted well, but other than that, I didn't do nothing well at all, you know what I mean. 
 I got away with the a couple decent rounds the first couple rounds, and today I lost the ball. Had a perfect tee shot on No. 3 over there and never found the ball, you know. 
 So it's the first week back. I'm going to take it one day at a time. I'd like to play better, but I didn't. There's always next week. You have to look at it that way.

 Q. Feel good just to get the cob webs off, though?
 JIM THORPE: Oh, yeah, man. Well, I knew it was going to be kind of a tough week, you know what I mean, with answering all the questions and everything that's going on. 
 So I knew it was going to be a little bit tough. That never bothered me that much. But I worked on my game and it didn't show. Sometimes it happen that way. 
 But for some reason I'm not satisfied with the equipment. I'm going to see if I can do a little search and find something to suit the eye and that sort of stuff.
 Yeah, give myself another couple weeks and I shouldn't have no excuses. Put it that way. 

 Q. Where do you go from here?
 JIM THORPE: I'm gonna go home and relax tomorrow a little bit, take it easy, take care of some business, and start back to work on Tuesday. Yeah, just got to do it.
