  ROCKY WALCHER: Going straight that way and that never happens out here hardly.  It hardly ever blows out of the east and all the holes were just weird and you couldn't figure out whether you were into it or downwind on the back-9 there going north.  So, it was strange out there.   Q.  Were your playing partners dog cussing the course or complimentary?  ROCKY WALCHER: Very complimentary, yes.   Q.  Is there anything else dealing with the delay this morning, Rocky?  I mean obviously you deal with delays sometimes but anything strange?  ROCKY WALCHER: It's almost like I've got to warm up about every 30 minutes anyway so I guess go out for 30 minutes and warm up again.  But no, it was okay.  Just getting out, going was nice
