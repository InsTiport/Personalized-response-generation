Q. At what point out there did you know how things were going and where you stood?
CELINE BOUTIER: I didn't know at all.  I didn't look at the leaderboard.  I knew at 18 I was one shot back.  That's all I knew.
Q. What were you thinking going into 18 with that in mind?
CELINE BOUTIER: Nothing really.  I knew it was a tough hole.  I just wanted to be on regulation in two, and then if I made the putt, then it would be best.  But missed the green so...
Q. Let's go back to 16.  What happened on that putt?  Was it more of a misread or a mis-hit?
CELINE BOUTIER: Kind of both.  When I was at address, the wind kind of blew in the opposite direction, so I kind of, like, pushed it as a reaction.  But I feel like it was just bad timing.
Q. How would you grade the day as a whole through your performance, especially such a rough start and to bounce back?
CELINE BOUTIER: Well, on a scale of one to ten, probably a one.  I feel pretty bad right now.  So I think, hopefully, I'll learn from this.  I just feel like my putter was not good all day, and I just struggled to have birdie opportunities throughout the day.  So I don't think I could have done anything -- anything more except for making putts.
Q. Obviously, not being in this position before and the nerves down the stretch, but that win at the Vic Open, how much do you think that sort of helped and got you ready for this moment?
CELINE BOUTIER: I actually thought it was going to help me more.  It kind of helped me throughout the first three rounds.  But then today, I was pretty nervous all day, even in the morning when I wasn't even on the course.
So I feel like -- I mean, obviously, Majors is a different situation, but it's always good to be in this position, I guess, for the future.
Q. Just lastly, how were the nerves down the stretch?  You said you fought them all day.
CELINE BOUTIER: Well, honestly, I played so bad, I didn't even think I had a chance.  And then on 16, when I missed a putt, I kind of knew that it was going to be hard.  So I didn't -- but I didn't really pay attention to -- I did at the beginning pay attention to the leaderboard.  And then I didn't start very well, so then I was like forget about it and focus on yourself.
That's what I did.
