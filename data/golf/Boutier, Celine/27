 Q.  New career-best round for you.  What was it like out there today?  
CELINE BOUTIER: It was pretty cool.  I mean, I didn't really realize that I was that low.  I mean, at some point I just lost track of my score.   
But it was just pretty cool to be able to play that steady the whole round.  I don't think I made a bogey today, so that's always a positive.   
 Q.  You think you play better when you're just not thinking about what the score is?  
CELINE BOUTIER: I think so, yeah, because sometimes I just put too much pressure on myself, you know, to make birdie, to go 1-under, whatever.   
So I think when I'm able to play more freely I'm able to shoot lower.   
 Q.  What was the course playing like today?  
CELINE BOUTIER: It was actually pretty windy, windier than yesterday I thought.  I thought it was playing a little longer.  I was hitting the ball really well so I had a lot of opportunities for birdies throughout the round.   
That was pretty nice, yeah.
