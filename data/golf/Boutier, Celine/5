Q. Solid day.  Back here on the LPGA Tour.  How do you think you fared after the first round?
CELINE BOUTIER:   I think pretty good.  I mean, I feel like it's a tough course.  You know, you got to play to the middle of the greens a lot of times and play safe in a lot of the holes.  So I feel like I gave myself a lot of opportunities, which was nice.
Then two bogeys obviously.  But I think on this course you've got to give it a bit, so I was pretty happy with my round overall.
Yeah, I wasn't feeling too like nervous or too rusty, so I felt pretty nice and comfortable out there.
Q. I was going to say, during quarantine you did do some sort of competition.  For one, I know you did the Texas Women's Open.  Did you do any other competitive events, and did that help ease the rust for this one?
CELINE BOUTIER:   Yes, for sure.  I played like three events in between the last LPGA and this one, so it was definitely nice to get back out on the course.  The purpose of playing those mini tour events was obviously not to feel too rusty coming in here.  I think it worked pretty well because I didn't feel too rusty out there.
Q. This is also, as we've been talking to a lot of European and American players, the host of next year's Solheim Cup.  You have had an incredible performance last year.  Has that been in the back of your mind as you've taken on Inverness?
CELINE BOUTIER:   Oh, for sure.  I mean, especially the first time I played this course.  I was definitely looking around and trying to picture what it would be like for the Solheim Cup.  Obviously it's going to be next year.
I mean, the course is in amazing shape, so I feel like it's not going to be playing too different.  Yeah, it was definitely in the back of my mind, especially the first time I played it.
