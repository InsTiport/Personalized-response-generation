Q. We found out it's your birthday today.  What a way to celebrate, a 66.  You must be very pleased.
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I'm really happy to be able to finish with a good score like this this week, and also my birthday it's always special.
Q. Has anybody told you it's a difficult golf course?
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I did experience the difficult golf course and I knew it was going to be challenging with the wind and every thing, but I just tried to take advantage of every opportunity I had on the course today.  I knew that I needed to shoot something low to be able to move up the leaderboard, so I'm really happy I was able to do that.
Q. Looks like it's not going to be enough to catch up with Gaby.  Were you looking at the leaderboard at one point thinking, Hang on, I might have an outside chance here?
CELINE BOUTIER: No.  I actually decided to focus on my own game today and not look at one leaderboard.  I didn't really know where I was standing throughout the day.
I just figured if I wanted to have a shot, I would have to shoot really low, so I kind of knew coming it was going to be difficult, but I'm just happy I'm in the top 5 or top 3.  To be able to finish on a good note like that is always nice.
Q. Clearly you enjoy playing golf on Haiman Island.  You had a professional win here before.
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I think was like half an hour away from here last year.  Unfortunately they canceled the tournament this year so I'm not able to defend my title.
Yeah, been having some good weeks here.  I think I'm going to come back the next couple years.
