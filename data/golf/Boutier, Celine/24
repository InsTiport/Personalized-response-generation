 Q.  How was your day  
CELINE BOUTIER: Pretty good.  I started pretty slow.  1-over -- I started on the back, so 1-over on the back and then I had a birdie on No. 1, which was my No. 10, so that kind of got me going.  Then played really well on the front.   
 Q.  Yeah, I mean, you played like fire on the last nine.  
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I was just like able to hit it closer because on my front, it was like a little too far, so I didn't have that many like close birdie opportunities, but I was able to change it on the front.  So it was good.   
 Q.  That's awesome.  Have you played the course before?  
CELINE BOUTIER: No.  First time.   
 Q.  First time.  How is the course working out for you?  
CELINE BOUTIER: I think it fits my game more than last week.  So I was kind of happy when I played it because I could see myself playing well on this course.  I kind of like, you know, the layout and just the way you have to play it.  It's better for my game I guess.   
 Q.  Are you much of a leaderboard watcher?  
CELINE BOUTIER: No.   
 Q.  Have you seen how the scores went?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Well, I did see a little bit from last year, so I knew that you could score pretty low, but I didn't know -- because I heard it was -- it's a little bit more windy than last year, so I kind of expected the score to be low but not as low as last year.  I guess we'll see how it goes this week.
