  Q. Nice 2-under, 70 to start your tournament.  How are you feeling right now after your round?
 CELINE BOUTIER:   A little bit upset.  I finished on a bogey on 18, so that was a bit of a shame.  Overall pretty happy with my round.  I feel like I made a lot of birdies.  I had a lot looks for birdies throughout the round, so it was always positive.
 Q. Any particular holes that stood out to you with good birdies?  Tell us your birdie story today.
 CELINE BOUTIER:   I just feel like it was a little bit of everything.  At the beginning on the front nine I made some good putts for birdies and then in the back I felt like I was -- I did make like maybe a 30-footer on No. 13, which was the longest putt I made today.
 Other than that, I feel like I was honestly within 10, 15 feet quite a bit today, so it's always helpful.
 Q. We had some changing weather conditions.  Started really cool, got warmed up a little bit, and now it's cool and windy again.  How is that mentally battling, changing, and with the wind swirling around us?
 CELINE BOUTIER:   Yeah, I mean, I feel like because I played in the morning I was kind of expecting it to be cold right away, so I was already prepared.  But definitely the cold at the end of the round was not expected.
 It's just I think the main difficulty is the wind, but at least it was coming from the same direction all day so it was a little bit more predictable.
 But it's definitely playing tough.
 Q. We missed this tournament last year right at the beginning of the pandemic.  It's got to be a good feeling to be back here.  Even on a gray day in San Diego in great to be in San Diego.  What's it like being back?
 CELINE BOUTIER:   Yeah, I mean, I love the west coast and I feel like this course in particular reminds me a little bit of Europe because of the grass and everything.  I love the way they set it up.  It's always usually really pretty with the flower and stuff like that, so I always love coming back.
 I will definitely sad not to come back here last year.
 Q. What do you take from today and work on for tomorrow?
 CELINE BOUTIER:   Hopefully take some confidence from today.  Just feel like just try to make a little bit less mistakes the next couple of days.
 But if I can keep my game the same, I feel like it was pretty solid from tee to green, so just trying to stay confident.
