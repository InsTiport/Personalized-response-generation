 Q.  Celine, 7 under par overall heading into the weekend. How comfortable do you feel at that number with where the leaderboard is at?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Pretty happy with my game. I felt like today was playing very difficult with the wind. I thought I hit some good shots, missed a couple of putts on the back, but overall pretty happy with my game.   
 Q.  Hole-in-one on No. 5. What number is that for you in your career, and how exciting was it?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, it was amazing. It was a very good shot too and very long hole. So it was a 4 iron. Super happy, excited. It's my second one, but my first one was like eight years ago, so it was definitely time for another one.   
 Q.  Was it a little disappointing that it didn't come on the Raptor hole or Steaks For Life or anything like that?  
CELINE BOUTIER: That's okay. I'll take a hole-in-one any day.   
 Q.  What are you most looking forward to for the weekend being in contention?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Just the experience, I guess, and I feel like any time you get the chance to be in contention for the weekend, you have to take advantage of it. So hopefully, I have my game ready for the weekend.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy this format with the celebrities and the stars from other sports and TV shows, movies? Do you enjoy that competitive nature with them?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I didn't really know what to expect because I've never played in a format like this before, but I was actually pleasantly surprised yesterday. I felt like it was super interesting to play with people that are really good at their own field and they're also very good golfers, which I didn't really expect them to be for some reason. So it was actually super enjoyable, and then today was also super fun. I'm really excited to meet new people tomorrow again.
