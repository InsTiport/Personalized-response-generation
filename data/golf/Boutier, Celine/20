 Q.  A great finish to the second round.  You're in a great place on the leaderboard.  What's your impression of that?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, very happy with the way I handled the weather delay and everything.  I didn't start very well, but I kind of really stayed patient and took advantage of some of the holes out there today, but it wasn't as windy so I felt it was playing a little bit easier.   
 Q.  The way you're playing, is it where you'd like it to be, or do you think you can fix some things and maybe go up the leaderboard some more?  
CELINE BOUTIER: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've been playing pretty solid.  My putting was pretty good on the back.  I think if I can keep it going today and tomorrow, it would be great.  I still have a couple of adjustments to make.  I feel like I've lost -- I'm 3 over on 11, so I think I can improve on that hole.   
So, yeah, I think so.   
 Q.  Does the golf course suit you to be successful on?  
CELINE BOUTIER: I think so.  I feel like the strength of my game is more my irons and second shots.  So I feel like it's very important on this course to place the ball very well on the green or, even if you miss, on the right side.  So I think that for me, it's an advantage for sure.
