 Q. Talk about the course today. 
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: Well, it's a fantastic course. I really enjoy it. I came in about a month ago and it was in similar conditions as far as being really wet. I think they did a great job, it seems, to drain out pretty good for the most part. We were playable under the situation. So I like the golf course. 

 Q. Do you want to just give us an overview of your day today?
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: Yeah, I started out really good. Started out on 10 and missed a five foot birdie putt on 10. 
 Go to 11, almost save a par there. 
 Go to 12, which is playing extremely long for me, and I cut a 3-wood in there to about 18 feet and left it on the lip. 
 Then 13, that tough little downhill par-4 I pulled a 3-wood into a fairway bunker, that little pot bunker down there on the left, and was 121 and hit a great shot out of there up to about 12 feet and made the putt for birdie. 
 Other than that, I hit a lot of good shots out there, but with the wetness of the fairways, I didn't adapt very well on some of my iron shots and so I was hitting a lot of thin shots most of the day trying to make sure I didn't chunk them basically. 
 And then my club make up for today being as wet it was, I had a 15 degree 3-wood and a 18 degree hybrid and I found off of my drive I was having to hit some cut 3-woods in there choked down a little bit and I kind of double crossed on two or three of those and those cost me. 
 So all the long holes I think I parred a couple of them, but most of the long holes I did bogey. I shot 78. But it was actually a good experience and I actually played much better than my score. But that's the way it goes.
