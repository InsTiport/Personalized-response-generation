  Q. When did you learn you were in the field here?  
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: About 7:03. I got here at 7 o'clock and they came up to me at 7:03 and said that I had a tee time at 9:20 that unfortunately Paul wasn't able to make it. So he withdrew and I got in.   
  
  Q. What's it mean, this is your first PGA?  
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: Actually it is my second. I played at Oak Hill.   
  
  Q. What does it mean to play in your home state then?  
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: Well, this is really special, to be honest with you. My entire goal last year was just to be able to able to qualify for this tournament. I ended up as the Sectional Senior Player of the Year, won our Section Championship, went to Florida, was in really good shape, I shot 67, 70, 73 down there, and then I shot a 75 the final round and missed getting in by one out right.   
 So this is really a big deal for me. A lot of my friends are going to come up and it will be nice.   
  
  Q. What were some of the highlights of your round?  
 DAVID ARBUCKLE: Let's see, well, instead of highlights I'll say a couple of low lights, first of all. I shot 75. I didn't hit it great, but I hit it pretty decent. Hit some really nice shots.   
 Almost holed out a little pitch shot on No. 12.   
 Let's see, 10, 11, No. 11. I hit the flag and stopped right there. Saved par there.   
 Then almost holed out from the sand, saved par there.   
 But I did miss a couple of short putts inside of four feet, little side hill putts where the wind was blowing and I didn't commit and go all the way through them. But I hit it pretty decent. I feel pretty good about what I'm doing. I got to play with Larry Nelson today and he's just such a class act. He was really good guy out there.
