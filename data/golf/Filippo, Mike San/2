Q.
How were the course conditions?
MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  The course was great.  We really had a nice morning to play.  The wind was down and it was, I'm sure you're going to see some good scores today, because it, the greens weren't that fast and I thought it played rather easy, actually.
Q.  What was the advantage playing this morning?
MIKE SAN FILIPPO:  Well, I don't know what it's going to do this afternoon as far as the wind is concerned.  It's always nice to play in the morning as far as the greens being fresh and there was a little moisture in them, they were a little slower, and that was a problem, I thought they were a little slower than I thought.  But depending upon how the wind holds up this afternoon that would be a big advantage too.
