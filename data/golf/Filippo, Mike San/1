 Q. You've made this cut a number of times, including 2004. Can you compare those two experiences?
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: Well, I would have to say in 2004 I played a whole lot better than I played this week, but it was a pleasure to play again. It's always a thrill to get in these tournaments. I know all of us as club pros look forward to the opportunity to play with these guys and it's tough to put your game on the line and I haven't been playing that much lately and I got a new job I've been working. 
 And I knew coming in that it was going to be a bit of a struggle. And I'm pleased I hung in there and made the cut. I'm disappointed that I didn't play as well as I am capable of, but all in all it was a good week and I enjoyed myself.

 Q. Did you notice much difference in Valhalla between 2004 and 2011?
 MIKE SAN FILIPPO: They're both good golf courses, real good courses. The only difference is I drove it in the fairway all week then and here I drove it in the rough all week and that's a big difference when you play in one of these tournaments.
