 Q.  Right now, pops is way ahead of the son.  So what have we got, has the bet been determined?  
DELL CURRY: It has not.  We got a little busy yesterday.  We're going to figure something out this afternoon.   
 Q.  Okay.  But no lake, we understand, correct?  
DELL CURRY: Correct, we'll try to do something different this year.   
 Q.  I think Steph's got about, I think he's on the 14th hole.  Has about six or seven points.  You've got a few right now.  You might have to adjust after day one, give him some?  
DELL CURRY: Yeah, his caddie's pretty tough when it comes to negotiating that.  We'll have a tough conversation this afternoon.  But it will all be fun.   
 Q.  Steph said yesterday that you've been playing pretty good.  So have you been working on your game for this event?  
DELL CURRY: I have.  I wanted to play better.  You want to play better every year.  I was able to play a lot of golf since about April.  Been hitting it pretty good.  I'm happy that I'm still hitting it well.  At least early in the tournament.   
 Q.  So bragging rights for you, how much does that mean for you?  
DELL CURRY: A lot.  I'm looking forward to dinner tonight.
