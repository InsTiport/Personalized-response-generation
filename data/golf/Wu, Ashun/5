Q. How was the competition to try to hit the bell?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, it was very fun.  We tried a lot of times but we didn't make it.  But still, very fun, because the target is very small.  If we can hit the driver, maybe we can make it.
Q. What about seeing also the Chinese young kids who start to get into golf?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, they play very well right now, and you can see many Chinese juniors coming to play golf.  They also play very good in the tournament and many people are watching Chinese juniors, they grow up every year.
Q. Give us one sentence about the BMW Masters this year, what is it like and what is your confidence like, and what are you looking for from the tournament?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, it's a great tournament here.  I like the course here also.  I think for my sponsor Latin America and my sponsor BMW, I have a good tournament here, I very much enjoy to play this week and hope I can play very well this week.
