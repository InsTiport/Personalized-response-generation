Q. What are your thoughts on how you've played for two days?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, yesterday was very difficult for everybody.  The wind is blowing on the greens and some holes played very long.  Today was better because they moved the tees, some tees forward, so everybody was enjoy today I think.  I'm very happy with play today.  Got four birdies, it was a really good round.
Q. Give me an example of what was very hard for you yesterday and what was easier today.
ASHUN WU: Yesterday got wind, so big wind, and sometimes on the green, the ball was moving, so it was completely confusing.  Today was more better wind on the front.  The morning time, the wind was not very strong.  So that's pretty good.
Q. Do you like links golf?  Are you enjoying this?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, I like links golf because the ball, you have to play a lot of good shots and you have to think about how to play, not just play on the green.  So it's very interesting links course.  I'm learning a lot.  My first time play links course, it was very difficult for me, but now it's better, yeah.
Q. When you've had a victory so very recently, is confidence high?  Are you excited for the weekend?
ASHUN WU: Yeah, because my game is getting better right now.  And I know the links courses very well right now, so I think I can play good this week.
