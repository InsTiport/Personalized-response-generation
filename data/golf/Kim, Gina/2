Q. Gina, you start off with a three-putt at 1.  Did you think, okay, now I've got that over with.  Let's kind of play some golf now?
GINA KIM: Yeah.  You know, it was only the first hole.  I mean, I still had 17 holes left to play.  There was definitely more golf that I had left.  So I didn't really take it too hard.  I just kind of got a little disappointed for three seconds and then just moved on to the next hole.
Q. And you struck the ball well again today.  Has that been the strong suit the last few weeks with the NCAAs and this week?
GINA KIM: Yeah, I think that's been one of my biggest strengths these days.  You know, my shots have really helped me in times when I really needed them.  I've definitely made birdies because I've stuck it very close.
So I'm feeling really good about where I am right now.  Clearly, my scores are doing well, and so hopefully I can keep that going for the rest of the weekend.
Q. What was the reaction from family and friends to the fireworks last night and the way you shot up the leaderboard?
GINA KIM: Oh, God, my phone blew up.  Obviously, they knew I'd be okay out here.  They weren't too worried about me.  But seeing my name up at the top of the leaderboard, they obviously weren't expecting that.
So they were kind of shocked, at first, and then very happy and very supportive.  So I'm very grateful for them.
Q. (No microphone)?
GINA KIM: Like 30, 40 people.  And then, obviously, Instagram as well, Snapchat, Twitter.  Yeah, and then text messages.  Some even sent me emails, yeah.
Q. Did you have a hard time calming down last night?
GINA KIM: I did, yeah.  As much as I was tired, you know, this is definitely a new experience for me.  So I actually had a hard time falling asleep.  So I just had to like do a little bit of stretching and then just take a Benadryl and then go to bed.
Q. Did you get up in the middle of the night?
GINA KIM: Yeah.  Just, like, two times, I think.  Normally, I'm a great sleeper, but last night was not it.
Q. Thinking about this?  What was the --
GINA KIM: Yeah.  I mean, first, I didn't want to get too ahead of myself.  I was, first of all, kind of trying to make sure, like, you know, I still kept it together to make the cut first.  And then, you know, the next two days, I can worry about, you know, other things besides the cut.
So I guess there was just a lot of, oh, my God, this happened.  Or, you know, what happened if this happened?  There was just like a lot of little scenarios kind of going through my head or what could have possibly been different if this shot hadn't done that or something.  But I think I've calmed myself down and kind of organized my thoughts a little better.
Q. You said yesterday, and again today, that you kind of feel like you now know that you belong out here.  Are you going to feel that way tomorrow afternoon?
GINA KIM: I definitely think so, yes.  My mindset on how much I belong here really hasn't changed.  I guess today was kind of a testament to that, seeing how people were finally showing interest and some attention after I've managed to do something crazy yesterday.
But being able to kind of play some solid golf and shoot a consistent round, I think it definitely proved that, you know, I'm definitely ready to be out here.
Q. When I saw you on Tuesday, I asked you about designing your championship ring.  You said I'm just a freshman.  I can't do that.  You're not just a freshman now.
GINA KIM: Yeah, I guess not.  So maybe they might give me a say in what might it look like, but I honestly don't know how that works or how it's designed.  So I'm just going to leave it up to other people.
Q. Did your coach and teammates reach out to you last night?
GINA KIM: They did, yes.  A lot of them did.  I was very grateful for them.
Q. What happened on 18?  Was it frustrating to let one get away?
GINA KIM: Yeah, I just misread the putt.  And then, obviously, speed was not very good.  It's kind of disappointing to have a three-putt on the last hole.
Q. How long was the last putt?
GINA KIM: It was, like, 12 to 15 feet.  Yeah, it was not good at all.  But, you know, at the end of the day, like, it's just one bogey.  This is the U.S. Women's Open.  Pars are good.  Bogeys are okay.
Q. You say you belong here.  Have you separated -- can you have fun away from the intensity of competing?  Are you able to separate that and appreciate that, this moment?
GINA KIM: Yeah, I think I can.  You know, I try not to have any expectations for myself, and I think that really helps in terms of me just trying to have fun but also knowing that I have to compete out here as well.
So I just think kind of being confident in what I'm doing and constantly just keeping the same routine and committing to it and just enjoy the experience while walking, I think that's really helped me a lot so far.
Q. So what's your future after this?  What's your --
GINA KIM: In future, as --
Q. Pro and all that stuff?
GINA KIM: Oh, you know, I'd love to get my degree at Duke.  I love college.  It's been a great experience for me, and I think it's definitely helped me mature as a person.  So, you know, I think that's still kind of in the air, but as for now, I'd love to get my degree first.
Q. Can you feel the difference out here from a college event, that this is a business for these women and it's a little more cutthroat or whatever?
GINA KIM: Yeah, of course.  You know, obviously, these women out here are fantastic at what they do.  They've definitely invested a lot of time and effort into it.
So I guess the atmosphere between a college tournament and here is definitely different.  But, you know, I think everybody still has the same goal at the end of the day, you know, play some good golf and shoot a low score.
So, I mean, I understand, you know, it's a very business-like atmosphere, but I can also tell people want to have fun as well.
