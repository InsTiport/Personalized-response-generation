Q. So 4-under today after even yesterday.  What was the major difference between the two rounds?
GINA KIM: I just think I didn't make as many mistakes as yesterday, and I think it was my putting that really got me lower.  I don't know.  Like overall I just think everything worked out better.
Q. Do you think there is still some more room to go even lower in the next couple days?
GINA KIM: Yeah, there's definitely room.  I mean, I've definitely missed a couple shots out there, but I think I'm saving them later on for the week, so it's not a bad thing.
Q. Do you think you've figured anything out today that's going to help you down the road?
GINA KIM: Always stay below the hole.  These greens are so intense, that, I mean, I've kind of figured out where to miss them if I hit it bad.  But, overall, I think I've gotten the general layout and everything and I think that helped me a lot.
