  Q. What it's like to be playing a round at Augusta National.
 GINA KIM:   Yeah, it's so special to even be a part of it, even though my score today wasn't great at all, I'm very happy with just even getting the opportunity to play and that means a lot to me.
 Q. Do you sense that the course elevates all of you?
 GINA KIM:   I definitely think so.  There's just this vibe, this cool atmosphere that just brings anybody up I think.  It's just such a special place to be, and for Chairman Ridley to give us an opportunity to get out here and just to play and have fun, I think that's really a wonderful experience for all of us.
 Q. A lot of you are very focused on the outside world, probably not this week, but Georgia is in the news.  Have you thought about the issues in Georgia?  Is that something that is important to you, maybe not right at this exact moment?
 GINA KIM:   I haven't been checking my phone but I'm not quite up-to-date with the issues.  Could you -- do you mind --
 Q. The voting law that many believe is suppressing the vote, so Major League Baseball yesterday announced they were taking the All-Star Game out of Atlanta.  Maybe it's something you care about, maybe not, but the issues of #BlackLivesMatter.
 GINA KIM:   I think I'm just not educated enough on the issue for me to really have an opinion at the moment.  I'm definitely going to look into it.  I kind of just stayed away from my phone just trying to absorb the experience here.  Yeah, thank you for asking.
