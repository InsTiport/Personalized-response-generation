  Q. How are the conditions out here today compared to yesterday?
 GINA KIM:   Well, it's definitely colder, definitely windier, which I feel like is going to make the course play a little tougher today, but I felt like I just stayed patient and just took advantage of opportunities that came to me.
 Q. How do you feel about your round?
 GINA KIM:   Pretty good.  It was interesting.  I made a lot of great par saves.  My scorecard may not show it, but it was a bit of a roller coaster.  I think just staying patient out there was really the key.  So I managed to have a bogey-free round today.  I thought that was pretty momentous in these type of conditions.
 Q. How has your experience been this week?
 GINA KIM:   It's been amazing, way better than I expected, and I already had high standards from the beginning.  Augusta National and the tournament committee has just been so wonderful to us.  This is definitely the highlight of my year.  So it's definitely nice to be out here to just even have the opportunity to play.
 Q. It's nice to have some teammates to share the experience with.  Talk about that.
 GINA KIM:   Yeah, so I'm out here with Jaravee Boonchant and Erica Shepherd.  It's really nice to be able to play in such a big event like this, but it's even better to do it with your teammates.  I've had a great time with them, and I even played the practice round with Jaravee.  It was fun getting to learn the course with her and just kind of enjoying the experience.
 Q. What are your expectations for your round at Augusta National?
 GINA KIM:   Well, I missed the cut two years ago, so I don't really have set expectations, but I hope I can just shoot under par somehow.  We'll see how that goes.  Yeah, I just want to enjoy the moment because it's not every day you get to play Augusta.
