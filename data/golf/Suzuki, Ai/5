 Q.  How important was it for you guys to halve that last match and get a point on the board for the team?  
AI SUZUKI: Very important.   
 Q.  And then about the day and your rounds, how did it feel?  
AYAKA WATANABE: We both were playing well, but the difference in the putting was what caused this half.   
 Q.  Do you think there's going to be any change to the lineup tomorrow, or how will you approach the second day of this tournament?  
AYAKA WATANABE: We probably won't change.   
AI SUZUKI: Since we finished well, we're just going to keep that going for tomorrow and just win tomorrow.
