Q. Was Perfect golf today?
AI SUZUKI: I was not thinking about the score whole day. 7 under.
It was nice front nine. I had few mistakes, but never big mistake. I am satisfied overall.
Q. Had any up and down?
AI SUZUKI: Maybe 7 and 9. Specially No.7 miss the tee-shot. I have to hit under the tree branch. Hit 4U low.
Q. Reason why you are not thinking about score?
AI SUZUKI: I have no reason to count score. Just thinking about each hole. How to take birdies on each one. Just thinking where should I hit on the green to take birdies. Shot and putts worked out well today.
Q. Final hole birdie?
AI SUZUKI: 2nd shot was like 300 to the pin, so I hit to about 80 yards. Used 54 degree wedge and controlled to 60cm (2ft.)
Q. After you returned from injury, you won last week. Leading the tournament for 5 rounds?
AI SUZUKI: I am not expecting too much. I am no practicing much. What I am doing is just concentrating what I can do at this moment. Thinking I have to settle down with what I can do now. ItÂ’s going well so far, not to be greedy.
Q. For the final Round?
AI SUZUKI: I am always checking U.S. LPGA winning scores. I have to shoot more than 3 under to win the tournament. Usually winner scores low. Especially this week with this course, I think I have to play and score 5 to 6 under. That will be my target score tomorrow.
Q. Thinking about US LPGA after winning?
AI SUZUKI: Not at all. I will think about that after winning. As of now, I know I have chance but just want to make my world ranking higher. This is not Japan Tour, so even par or over par will not going to win the tournament. I never scored 60s on final round to win, so that will be my kind of wall to go over. Today I am 12 under, but tomorrow I will start from even par. Starting from Zero tomorrow.
