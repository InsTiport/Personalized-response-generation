 Q.  General thoughts on the day, getting a halve out of the match?  
AI SUZUKI: We had a lot of chances to win, and we're a little disappointed.  I had a lot of eagle putt chances, and 16 was when that turned, so yeah.   
 Q.  Still able to get a point in and in good position heading into the last day of pool play.  What's the key tomorrow to make it to singles?  
AYAKA WATANABE: Because States and Japan are in the same position, so we're just going to have to go for it to make it to the singles.   
 Q.  Will you change anything up for tomorrow, or same teams and go at it?  
AI SUZUKI: It's not bad, so it might be the same.  Just because it's against USA we may change it.  We'll see.
