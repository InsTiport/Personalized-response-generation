Q. Please can you give me your thoughts on your match this morning, tough conditions out there?
HUNTER STEWART: Yeah we played every hole into the wind pretty much, it changed around at the turn but the course is playing as tough as it has all week.   Ashley and Jimmy just outplayed us pretty much the entire round which was shown by the fact we never led.   We did some good things we made four birdies on our round and they had two bogeys and one birdie which is a pretty clean card.   They deserve the point.
Q. Did the different conditions this morning play any part?
HUNTER STEWART: It just made the course tougher, if we had just hit some better shots we would have been fine which was evident the way Ashley and Jimmy played.   They did it and so it could have been done.  
We were on the wrong side of a few bounces and unfortunately weren't able to get going.
Q. You had some trouble in the bunkers?
HUNTER STEWART: Yeah I whiffed it.   They were on the green with 12 feet for a two so the way I was thinking is if I could just get it over and clear the lip I could scoot it on the green and Mav could make a 20 footer.   I could have chipped it backwards but that would not have been any good.   We played more aggressive than we would in stroke play.   So I had a whiff today and it was kind of fun
