Q. How do you feel about the way you played today?HUNTER STEWART: It was okay.  I did some things well, did some things not so well.  I got hit in the mouth on the first hole.  I hit a nice shot and it rolled right in the, right into a little bush, right off the fairway and I was able to salvage a par, but didn't really get settled into my round very well.  Didn't have the putter rolling early on, but was able to hole some nice putts later on in the round and kind of keep some momentum.  But I bogeyed the last hole and that kind of makes dinner taste worse. But tomorrow's a new day and I look forward to trying to do some good things tomorrow.
Q. What's the one thing that will be on your mind when you come out tomorrow?HUNTER STEWART: I just got to get into play a little better.  I was kind of in the native area a little too much and had to kind of finesse it through the grass and the sand and didn't really have control of my ball very well.  I didn't give myself opportunities with the putter to be very successful.  I didn't putt well, but I really wasn't in good enough spots to go ahead and make great birdies, so I look forward to kind of getting to play tomorrow and give myself some opportunities.
