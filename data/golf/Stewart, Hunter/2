Q. Is that a relief for you?
HUNTER STEWART: ?It was a tough fought match this afternoon. It feels nice to win a point and grab some momentum for us although I don?t know what?s going on behind me. We needed that point badly and to win 16 and 17 to go 1 up was big.?
Q. At times you hardly used your putter. You chipped in twice and he followed out of the bunker.
HUNTER STEWART: ?There were lots of shots going in the hole. The quality of golf was very high. Paul brought out the best in me and brought some good stuff out of him. It?s always fun when that happens.?
Q. You delayed turning professional. Did you make the right decision?
HUNTER STEWART: ?This has been an incredible week. To win this match and to feel the energy of this crowd and to feel how much it means to the fans of Great Britain and Ireland. The camaraderie among the teams has been phenomenal. It?s definitely the right decision.?
Q. Thoughts on getting first full point in singles for USA?
HUNTER STEWART: ?It?s kind of a relief and it grabs some momentum for us. It was a match of momentum swings and I had it at the end.?
Q. It was a dramatic match. What about Paul?s hole out from the bunker?
HUNTER STEWART: ?He made the bunker shot on 13. I was on the side of the green thinking that he?d probably get up and down no problem or maybe take a 5 every now and again but it really wasn?t going through my head that he was going to hole it. I just had to re-group.?
