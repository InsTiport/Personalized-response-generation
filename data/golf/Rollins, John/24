 Q. John, tell us a little bit your round. 
 JOHN ROLLINS: I played good. I got off to a little shaky start, 2-over after four, but just kind of settled down and hit some good shots and gave myself opportunities and fortunately played the last five or six holes 4-under. 

 Q. Is this one of your better scores in a major?
 JOHN ROLLINS: It probably is. I think I've had -- there's been a couple of times when I've played decent, like at the British my first time. I was right around even par for two rounds, and everything else, but as far as I remember, this is so far the best that we've had. 

 Q. Another 4-under round to be a special week for you. 
 JOHN ROLLINS: I would take it. Obviously we're chasing one of the hardest guys to catch, but 4-under tomorrow would make me very happy going into a week off.
