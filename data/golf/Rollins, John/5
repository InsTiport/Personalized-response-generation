Q.   I know you're proud of that.   Blustery conditions, tough scoring conditions.   4‑under 68 is really solid?
JOHN ROLLINS:   Yeah, I played well.   Very happy with the day.   The winds were out so some of the shots into some of these greens were really tough, and you had to be really committed to what you were doing.   But I just managed my game really well and got out of there with a good day.

Q.   It was fun to watch you play.   I saw you on the back side your last nine.   What was your strength? 
JOHN ROLLINS:   I think I was just really calm out there and just really committed to what I was doing and didn't really try to‑‑ it's not a golf course you can overpower, so I wasn't attacking a lot of flags.   I just sort of let the round evolve and hit it in the right places a lot of times and managed to make some putts.

Q.   How weird is it to get out here when it's dark?   The flood lights on the range.   It's cold.   It's kind of an eerie feeling, isn't it? 
JOHN ROLLINS:   Yeah, it seems like it's been cold all year.   So far everywhere we've been has been cold weather.   But it is weird warming up in the dark.   Here, feeling the wind and seeing the wind, you're kind of thinking, okay, it's going to be one of those days, and sure enough it was. 
It's tough out there, but the scores can be had, and hopefully we'll be in good position going into tomorrow.
