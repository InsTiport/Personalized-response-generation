 Q. It's a good score to be under par but it's not the score that you wanted today. You really hit the ball well.
 JOHN ROLLINS: Yeah, I played good. You know, I had one bad hole on 15 and just kind of hit it a couple times and, you know, you can't multiply your mistakes on any hole and I did that on that hole and it got me.
 But, all in all, I played well and gave myself a lot of opportunities, you know, which you just eliminate that mistake tomorrow but keep that momentum going and, you know, you never know what's going to happen.

 Q. What happened there, did it jump on you? You had a bad lie off the tee?
 JOHN ROLLINS: I had a horrible lie off the tee. Wouldn't even attempt to hit a lob wedge 80 yards. I chipped it back in the fairway and I was left with a 5-iron back to the back right pin. 
 Probably one of those don't miss it right and got over it a little bit and hit it a little bit further than I wanted to. I was left with another marginal lie with a downhill, the green running away from me. 
 Probably should have taken my medicine a little bit on the chip and try to get it past the hole and take my chances back up the hill but, you know, it is what it is and at least I got one back coming in. I wanted the one on 18. Hit a good putt.

 Q. You're hitting the ball really well. Keep it up and the putts will fall maybe on Sunday.
 JOHN ROLLINS: Hope so.
