 Q.   I know you went pretty low today.   What did you do well out there?  
JOHN ROLLINS:   Just played solid.   I gave myself a lot of opportunities and made some putts.   I let one get away there on the next to last hole there, which was a par‑5.   I only had 210 to the hole.  
But overall, I played real solid and steady and just had a good round.   
   
 Q.   What was it like playing with Scott today.   He was pretty hot?  
JOHN ROLLINS:   Yeah, we just played good all week.   We both played real well yesterday at La Quinta, and we had a good group and the mojo in the group has been positive.   It was great to see a lot of good shots, putts going in.   So it's nice to get in a group like that.   
   
 Q.   Take a pretty good low number to catch him tomorrow, but do you feel good about the position you're in?  
JOHN ROLLINS:   I feel pretty good.   The first day kind of put me a little behind, 2‑under over there on the Palmer Private.   But we'll go out tomorrow and just try to keep attacking and doing what we're doing, and, you know, low numbers are out here so you never know what will happen.
