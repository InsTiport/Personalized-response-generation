 Q. Solid round out there given the conditions and the wind?
 JOHN ROLLINS: Yeah, I played great today. Hit the ball probably the best I've hit it all year. My irons were pretty much right on. 
 I putted pretty good. I missed some short putts and missed some really good birdie opportunities. I had a lot of putts seemed like they were six, eight feet from the hole all day. Made some and missed some, but all in all I struck it beautifully and I'm very pleased.

 Q. Yeah, I saw you driving 12 of 14 off the tee today. So I'm sure that gives you plenty of confidence in driving?
 JOHN ROLLINS: Yeah, driving has always been kind of one of my best stats. That's something that I'm proud of to be able to come off the tee the way that I do. 
 But today everything was pretty much working well. Just hopefully scrape in a few more of those mid-range putts and see what happens the rest of the week.

 Q. How did this course set up for you overall? 
 JOHN ROLLINS: I like it. I've played here a number of years now. I like the golf course. I've played well here in the past, and it's a course I'm comfortable on. 
 So we'll see how the conditions are. I think the weather's supposed to cooperate pretty well the rest of the week, so we'll see. The greens were much firmer and faster today than they were the first couple of days, so I think we'll see more of that as the week progresses.
