Q.   It just seemed like one of those rounds where it just wasn't clicking for you.   Nine straight pars and then a bit of a roller coaster coming in. 
JOHN ROLLINS:   Yeah, I didn't play bad, I just never really got anything going.   And didn't really have the good looks at birdies.   When I hit good shots, I seemed to always have that defensive putt or whatever. 
And just kind of got the birdie on 11 that kind of felt like, okay, we have jump started things. 
And Nick played great.   He shot 5‑ or 6‑under par today to win the golf tournament, so that's hats off to him and I just couldn't get it done.

Q.   Not the ultimate outcome, but what positives do you take, especially a chance to tee it up next week now?
JOHN ROLLINS:   Yeah, I'll go there next week in Mexico and see what happens.   Try to keep the momentum alive.   And I take a lot of good things from here.   I putted well, I hit the ball well, I pretty much hit it well every day.   I just gave myself a chance.   And that's all you can ask for and we'll just try to build on it next week.
