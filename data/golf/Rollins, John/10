Q.   Talk about highlights of your round today.
JOHN ROLLINS:   I played solid, you know, really all day, kept the ball in play, gave myself a lot of opportunities. 
Had one little hiccup there on 16 with a 3-putt but other than that, that was I believe my only bogey and had some other chances that, you know, I could have gotten but, all in all, I played really, really solidly and like where I am.

Q.   Going into tomorrow, you're one off the lead.   For the weekend, what are your goals?
JOHN ROLLINS:   Depending on what the wind does and obviously the weather looks good for the rest of the week, so, you know, I think it's just going to be all be based on the wind, how strong it blows or not. 
If it blows like today, I think guys are going to shoot some numbers and the scores will continue to be low and if the wind blows and they get the pins where we know they're probably going to put them, then, you know, you may not take as low of scores as you think.
But we're just going to go out and try to stay calm and patient and keep giving myself some chances and hopefully the putts will keep falling.
