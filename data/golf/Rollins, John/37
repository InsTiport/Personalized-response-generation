 Q.  John, solid opening round, 5 under par.  You've loved this place.  I guess memories help a little bit. 
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Yeah, good memories don't hurt.  I played good today.  Kept the ball in play.  Gave myself a lot of opportunities and left some out there. 
 I had some good putts that I hit, good putts that just didn't go in.  So, you know, if we can just kind of keep doing what we're doing and see how the scores pan out for the rest of the week. 

 Q.  Your length a big advantage here. 
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Yeah, you know, I played with Jason Gore, so I don't really feel all that long.  He was blowing it by me 30, 40 yards it seemed like all day.  And it's definitely a golf course that suits long hitters. 
 So, you know, hopefully I can just keep hitting it the way I'm hitting it.  And I think I have enough length to handle it. 

 Q.  Jason felt that way last week playing with Jason Zuback.  I'm sure it's interesting for you guys to see guys hit it that much farther than you? 
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Yeah, we talked about him playing with Zuback and asked him a couple times, you know.  I think I hit 298 on 18 to reach the green.  And we were like can Jason reach it with a 3-wood?  And he said he'd fly it at the flag no problem. 
 So I'm back there as a mere mortal thinking, How I'm going to get there in two?  And here Jason Zuback can fly it on the green.  So it was a good day. 

 Q.  You don't look like a mere mortal to us.  Good start, and good luck this week. 
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Thanks.
