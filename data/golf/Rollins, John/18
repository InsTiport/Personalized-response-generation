  Q. You were playing well all week.  
 JOHN ROLLINS: Yes, I played good. I played good all week. Gave myself a lot of good opportunities and, you know, very happy with what I did.  
  
  Q. From one traditional course this week to Ridgewood next week. Do you take a lot of confidence in there?  
 JOHN ROLLINS: Absolutely. Anytime you play well you feel good about the next week, but Ridgewood is a great golf course and, you know, it feels like you're at a Major Championship out there the last time we played and looking forward to going up there and getting The Playoffs started.  
  
  Q. Anything you're going to work on between now and then?  
 JOHN ROLLINS: Not really. I'm playing pretty good and doing right things. Kind of stick with it and see what happens.
