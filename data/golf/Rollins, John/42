  Q.  Talk about your finish here.   
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Yeah, it's nice to finish off with a birdie.  I hit a good 9-iron in there a couple feet and just tapped it in to finish off a good day.   
  
  Q.  Were you aware of what the significance of that putt meant?   
 JOHN ROLLINS:  No, I mean, I played good all day.  I had some opportunities, I just couldn't really get any putts to go in early, and then they started to fall for me on the back nine today.  I'll try to carry that momentum forward for the next three.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about, you look up and you see right now -- I know there's still some players coming through, but it has to be a good feeling knowing where you sit at the top?   
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Yeah, absolutely.  Any time you get off to a good start, it's always nice.  It's a long week.  You know, we've still got three long rounds to go, but I like the way I've been playing so far the last few weeks, and hopefully this week will be the same.   
  
  Q.  Can you talk about the course and how it's playing?   
 JOHN ROLLINS:  The course is beautiful, fantastic shape, probably the best I've ever seen it since the five or six times I've played here.   
 The greens are perfect, so right now it's pretty accessible, pretty soft after the rain the last couple of days.  I think it's supposed to be sunny and nice the rest of the week, so hopefully it'll dry out some and get a little firmer and faster.   
  
  Q.  How much do you do scoreboard watching, if at all?   
 JOHN ROLLINS:  Not a lot.  You kind of see where you stand, you see what's going on, but it's not something you just sit there and study.  You know, you're more focused on hitting shots and playing one shot at a time and giving yourself as many opportunities.  You're aware, you see it, but you can't dwell on it.
