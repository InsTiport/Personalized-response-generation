  CAMERON BECKMAN:   You know, anytime you have 6 birdies on this course you shoot a good score.   That's the whole key to the day.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the conditions, if you could.  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   The golf course is absolutely perfect.   We didn't have any wind to speak up all day long.   You know, shows how good the golf course is if 4-under is leading the tournament.   It's a pleasure to play.  
   
 Q.   Finishing up with a 42-foot birdie, got to feel nice.  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   I made a long one on the 18th hole and then I'm just trying to two-putt that one went right in and stuff like that is nice.   I played decent the last two times, the last Tour events.   I played well on the Web.com Tour.   I live right across the street.  
   
 Q.   How many times have you played out here?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   It's where I've been practicing.  
   
 Q.   This is a pretty important tournament to you?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Yeah.   You know, I don't have -- played okay in Puerto Rico.   Played okay in couple of those.   Trying to make the money and play good out here.  
   
 Q.   If you get a Top-10, that gets you into the Shell.   Would you play that?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   That would be awesome.   You never know.   Qualify for a couple and play good, that's kind of my goal right now, shoot some good scores and play good golf.  
   
 Q.   Then let the rest take care of itself, maybe?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Yeah.   I'm at a disadvantage, I'm not going to get in a lot of tournaments.   Last year I played well enough out here to get into the Q-School.   That's okay.  
   
 Q.   I thought they didn't have the Tour School anymore.   The Web.com thing, get your status renewed?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   It gets you into that.   If you have a good four tournaments you get your card back.  
   
 Q.   How has it been to losing your card after you had a good career?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   You know, I had three wins or whatever and kind of lost my run a little bit for a couple years.   My family is getting older.   I want to be home and I'm 44 years old now, so -- I've actually been working pretty hard, trying to get back in it.  
   
 Q.   How old are your kids?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   11 year old and 8 year old.  
   
 Q.   Kind of a major field with local ties?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Even when I was on the Tour I haven't played well at this golf course.   I played good at LaCantera a few times.   Basically my goal to have some good rounds.  
   
 Q.   You live just --  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Just in those hills right over there.  
   
 Q.   How long is your commute?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Two minutes.
