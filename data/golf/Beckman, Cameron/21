Q.
Let me ask you first of all, a lot of birdies out there; this is a sprint, birdie, birdie, birdie.  Is that your mindset?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Yeah, the par 5s are basically reachable.  You've got to play well on The Palm to start the week.  Obviously everybody is making birdies and you've got to just keep right on going.
Q.  How do you deal with the whole Money List, your position and this kind of thing?  Is it in your mind?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  It's still in my mind.  I'm obviously on the number, I'm in the area, so I've been very stressed out lately I must say.

But I've been playing well, so I knew if I came in here and played well I could secure my card and have a chance to win the tournament.
Q.  (Inaudible).
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Right, I'm not going to do much different.

I'm pretty excited about just keeping my card.  That's kind of a nice feeling as stressed as I've been, and I haven't thought about winning this golf tournament too much.  I'm just enjoying myself and trying to do the same tomorrow.
Q.  Thank you very much.  Best of luck.
