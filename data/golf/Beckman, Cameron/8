 Q. Nice playing today; 6 under par. Just get comments on the day. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: It was pretty good. I hit a lot greens and made some putts. You know, just made seven birdies and a bogey, and the bogey I had was a three-putt from five feet.
 So I'm real happy with how I hit and the way I putted. The whole game was good today.

 Q. Talk about the conditions. A little breeze out there. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Yeah, this is different wind than we're used to. Normally it's the opposite. Makes the last three holes very difficult. 
 Now that we're playing that par-5 that, you know, that makes that hole a little bit easier. It's kind of a give and take. The other par-5 on the back's pretty reachable.
 So, I don't know. I'm real happy with 6-under today. I know that.

 Q. Birdies that stand out?
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Not really. I just did a lot of real nice shots today and I made a few nice 15-footers and some short ones and birdied all the par-5s.

 Q. Nice being here in Mexico. Sort of everybody's at ease, it seems like. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Yeah, this is such a beautiful place that the players get to come down to here every year, and it's nice playing well, too.

 Q. Talk a little bit quickly about your season up to this point?
 CAMERON BECKMAN: You know, I've been struggling a little bit getting used to (indiscernible) starting to get my lies better on my irons now where I feel like I got 'em the same as last year. 
 Just kind of a process we had to go through a little bit.
