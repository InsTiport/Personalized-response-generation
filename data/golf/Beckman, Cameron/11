 Q. Pretty simple card for you, birdies at 14, 17, 1 and 5, bogey-free. That's always sweet. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Yeah, it is, considering I really drove it poorly and got away with it a little bit today. I'm very happy with 4-under.

 Q. You may have gotten away with it with a nice putting round. I think you have 51 putts now for 36 holes. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Yeah, I think I'm putting better than I did when I was here last time and won. If I'm going to be competitive on the weekend, though, I've got to get the ball in the fairway and hopefully keep making the putts.

 Q. You're using that White Hot putter and apparently are very comfortable with it?
 CAMERON BECKMAN: I do. I use the 330 Mallet, actually put that in the week I won, and it's been good ever since.

 Q. How has this course changed through the years?
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Well, they've tightened up the fairways so much on us now, and the rough is very thick. You can get lucky in it, but it's really thick. 

 Q. Really a nice par coming out of the thick rough on your 18th hole, the 9th, a nice chip and a nice putt. 
 CAMERON BECKMAN: Yeah, that's kind of what I've been doing all day. The fairways I missed I got lucky a couple times and actually got to the greens, but getting in front and getting it up-and-down, and hopefully that continues.
