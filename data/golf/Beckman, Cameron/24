CHRIS REIMER:  We're joined by Cameron Beckman, 66 to go 11-under for the tournament, five straight birdies at the end of the round.  You're probably ready to start the 4th round now.
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Yes, that would be good.  I had three chip-ins, which for me is nice in the last five holes.  Basically I wasn't doing much and birdied the last five, so it was nice.
Q.
Do you remember going on a streak like this during the year, any other closing out a round like this?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Not to close out a round.  I've chipped in four times this week, and I haven't chipped in four times all year, so it's been nice.  It's been a big change.  I've been working on my short game.  FedEx I could hardly chip it on the green to be honest but let alone chip them in, so it's a nice change.
Q.
Pace of play for you a little slow like it was for some other guys?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Yeah, there's so many waits on the front nine and then the back nine was fine.  It's just part of being at the back end of the field.
Q.
Your round seemed like it was going along, nothing dramatic, and then --
CAMERON BECKMAN:  I was playing solid.  A lot of the pins were tough early and just didn't really get anything going.  Having three chip-ins, that's just not something you do every day, and that just sparked the whole round.
Q.
Anything different about your chip-ins that's suddenly connecting?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  All of a sudden I feel like I'm going to chip them in.  I guess just working hard, working on it a lot, spending a lot of time with it.  I changed wedges, but that's about it.
Q.
When was that change?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Just coming into this week.
Q.
It seemed a couple of them weren't that far.  They were chip-ins but it's like they were 60 feet and you knocked them in.  You had a reasonable chance to make them in other words?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Actually I putted one in, the par 316th, but they were pretty short little chips, but even then, it's nice to have them.
Q.
Just talk about the position that you're in here, one off going into the final round.
CAMERON BECKMAN:  I didn't even look at the board.
Q.
Loren Roberts is 12 and you're 11.
CAMERON BECKMAN:  I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.  I haven't necessarily hit it that great this week, but I've kept the ball in play.  You know, I've chipped and putted great.  I noticed yesterday I was leading putting in both stats coming into today, and I'm sure I'm probably doing just fine still.
Q.
What to this date has been the best thing that's happened to you in golf?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Probably when I won the Southern Farm Bureau Classic definitely.  I was struggling to keep my card -- this is my sixth year on Tour.  The first three years I went back to the school and got my card back, and then I won the end of '01 my last tournament, and it just started my career.  It hasn't been a great year so far this year, so I'm just basically looking to have a good back end of the year.
Q.
Can you allow yourself to think of what winning tomorrow would do for you?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Well, it would be awesome.  It's something that I'm trying to do again for sure.  I don't know that I'm going to be thinking about it much.  I haven't thought about it at all this week, and I haven't really -- like I said, I haven't hit the ball that great, but I've just kind of kept myself in it and I'm going to keep trying to do that and see what happens.
Q.
Are you in the Open next week?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  No, I missed the qualifier.
Q.
Did you do it here?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  I did it in New Jersey.  Funny thing is my back has been so bad this week, too, and I don't know if that's part of kind of the attitude I have or not, but I just haven't really put any pressure on myself.
Q.
Did you miss by a lot or were you close?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  I missed by two.
CHRIS REIMER:  Run through your club selections for your birdies and bogeys.  Start with 3.
CAMERON BECKMAN:  3, I hit it just over the green and chipped it 20 feet and missed it.

5, birdie, made a ten-footer.

10, I made about a 20-footer up the hill.

Then bogeyed 13, missed a short putt for par.

I hit it about six, seven feet on the par 3, the next hole.

Chipped in on the next hole from the front of the green.  The pin was in the front, so I just hit it right down to the front of the green and pitched it up the hill.
Q.
30 feet?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Probably.  Next hole hit a good 4-iron, rolled just through the green and putted it from the fringe, made that.

Then I actually hit a great shot into 17 and hit the wrong club, so I'm just right there in the front of the green, and I chipped that in, then made a 20-footer on the last hole.
Q.
How long was your chip-in on 17?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  15 feet maybe.  Pin was only on five steps, and I was just right there.
Q.
What about 16 on the putt from the fringe approximately?
CAMERON BECKMAN:  Ten feet maybe.  The pin was right on the back edge and I was just on the fringe.
