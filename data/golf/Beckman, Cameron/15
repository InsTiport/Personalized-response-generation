 Q.  How is it playing so far? 
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  I played good.  I 3-putted the last hole.  Played good and make some more putts.  Didn't make enough putts today.  Not bad. 

 Q.  How is the course playing out there?  It's been raining heavy around here.  Any differences from the past year? 
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  It's a little slower.  It still plays pretty short.  Hit a lot of the short irons into the greens and you can make some birdies. 

 Q. Perfect, thank you, sir.
