 Q.  147 on the FedExCup points coming in.  Projections have you jump into the top 144 and 142. 
 Does that wear at all on your mind? 
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  I'm thinking about it.  I'm here to try to get into the FedExCup and get into the FedExCup Tournament.  You know, either way is fine.  You know, I feel that I could get in but hopefully I play well today tomorrow and I'll get in. 

 Q.  Is your game kind of rounding into form here?  Is this kind of like a look into the future? 
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  I've been playing well.  I tried to putt better this week and make more birdies, you know, keeping the mistakes down to the minimum and hopefully tomorrow I'll play well and get in the FedExCup. 

 Q. Thank very much.  We really appreciate it.
