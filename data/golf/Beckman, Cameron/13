  Q.  That was a 68.  Is that the best you've played this year?   
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  I don't know if that's the best I've played, but I didn't drop a shot today, and around this golf course it's pretty good.   
  
  Q.  That was a very tidy card.  How would you describe the conditions?   
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  You know, I think they softened up the greens for us a little bit, which made it a little easier.  We had some wind out there, so you've got to drive the ball well and par the long holes.  Fortunately I did that today, and made a nice bomb on the last hole to finish 4-under.   
  
  Q.  That was a great one, because it must have been in your mind, don't three-putt here, don't ruin the round.   
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  Actually I was thinking I was due to make one, and sometimes when you think positive like that, they go in.  I had a few chances on the back nine that I missed and kind of got them all back right there.   
  
  Q.  That will put you in great shape for tomorrow and the weekend, so play well.   
 CAMERON BECKMAN:  Thank you.
