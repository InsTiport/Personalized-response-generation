 Q.   The threat of weather maybe tomorrow in this area.   How nice is that number today?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   I got off to a good start.   Shooting 4-under is nice.  
   
 Q.   You played this course, you're so familiar with it.   Was there anything different today, the pin placements?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Pin placements are different.   I've played enough to know what the breaks are and things like that and where to put it and you know, I was happy with what I did.   I played well here the first two years so I'm happy with today.  
   
 Q.   Lot of discussion how tough this course is.   This is one you've been a big advocate of this course.   What are your thoughts today on how it played and --  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   You can see by the scores.   You really have to be paying attention to where you're putting the ball on the greens.   If you miss it just a little bit, it will go down quite a ways off the green.   Fortunately, I hit a lot of greens today and putted great and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   How would this be for you to post a really good number over the weekend, maybe even lift the trophy?  
CAMERON BECKMAN:   Any tournament, of course, would be awesome to win.   If I were to win here it would be unreal.   We've got a long way to go.   I'm not going to start thinking about that.
