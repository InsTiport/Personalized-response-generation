Q.   How good was that?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   It was good, I had a leg injury, it's getting better, it's pretty stiff, was tough to finish, but it was a very good day.   Off the tee was perfect, and even on the green.   I'm very happy to play golf, because it was very tough last few months physically. 

Q.   What have you done to your leg?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   I don't know, I really don't know.   Maybe I practiced too much on the range to be honest, practise too much every day.   The thing I did the last two weeks, I've seen the physio every day.   I'm pretty sure he fixed it, but we'll see that in a few weeks, it's definitely better.   I'm happy.

Q.   What is it, the knee? 
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   That's the knee, like a sciatic, you know, so it's getting to the nerve.   It's even tough to walk, was even tough to walk two weeks ago.   So I'm really happy to play golf this week. 

Q.   Especially when you get conditions like this, any kind of injury, you think, it's cold, it's wet, not good?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   Yeah, it's getting better, it's definitely bad tonight but it's better than two days ago.   So yeah, I guess it's going to stay like this.   But yeah, anyway, you know, when you are so bad physically, you just want to play golf, so you are even not thinking about the score.   Today I was just thinking to enjoy the game, so it was nice. 
You just forget about the rest and you just think to play golf, that's the good thing.   I mean, that's very good to think about that.   I don't think about the score; I did that too many times and just too much focusing on the scores.   It's a good attitude.

Q.   And a different attitude for the whole week?   You're not going to start thinking about it now?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   Definitely don't want to think about the score anymore, keep doing the same thing tomorrow and we'll see.
