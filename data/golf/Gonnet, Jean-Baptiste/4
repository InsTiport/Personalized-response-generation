Q.   Talk about your round today?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   I was playing on the start, I was 2‑over after four, so I was a bit struggling on the greens today.   I'm pretty happy, I finished very good. It's a good one, definitely a good round. 
The main difference from yesterday was my driving.   I found some rough today and when you don't find the fairway here, it's very tough. 

Q.   The rough, it's very tough?
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   Definitely higher than last year.   That's why the scores are not very low.   It's getting tough I think because it's a bit more windy now.   I think it's going to be tough this afternoon. 

Q.   The conditions from yesterday afternoon to this morning‑‑
JEAN‑BAPTISTE GONNET:   There was definitely less wind for me, so it was a bit easy for me at the end.   You know, it's still tough, it's very tough this year, if you don't reach fairways and especially with the wind this afternoon.
