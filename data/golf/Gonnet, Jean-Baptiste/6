  Q. Talk about a good round.   
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: It was good, lovely weather there, amazing course, very nice, and it was amazing putting there for me, especially on the back nine, I shot 5-under I think. It was a great day. It was really good.   
  
  Q. Your back nine was the best of the day coming home in 31?  
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: Yeah, I made a lot of great putts on the last four holes. Yeah, it was great. I've got the speed on these greens, and that's very good for me because it was tough for me this year to putt very well, especially last week. But I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. You say it's been tough this year. There have been a couple of decent results but nothing special?  
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: Nothing special. I made a lot of cuts. Maybe I made ten cuts I think. I finish only Top-30, Top-40 max, so I have to work really hard on the greens, because the game is really nice, really good. Last week I finish Top-10s in greens in regulation; that's the problem for me.   
 After a day like this, it's okay. But you never know in golf. You never know if tomorrow is going to be worse than that. You never know. I just have to practise. I feel good this week on the greens. That's good for me. That's a good feeling.   
  
  Q. Is there something special about the nature of the greens, the environment here?  
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: I've been there five years ago on the other course. It was, for me, good memories.   
  
  Q. And what was it five years ago here?  
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: I think I finished 10th. Well, the other one, it's very nice, the other course is very nice, and it's good to play in this weather. It's just amazing. The course is nice. I enjoyed it.   
  
  Q. Imagine you are surprised by the weather as we all are. What was it like for The Challenge Tour event?   
 JEAN-BAPTISTE GONNET: It was good.
