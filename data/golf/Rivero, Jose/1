Q.  Your overall thoughts.  How did you play today?
JOSE RIVERO:  I played very well today.  Especially the putting today.  My game is good, not fantastic, but good.  Yesterday I played pretty good.  But my putts was not, just not very good.  So it was a very, very good round from this golf course.  It's difficult.
Q.  What do you think of your chances for the weekend?  Do you like where you're at?
JOSE RIVERO:  It's too long, it is my first time to play here and it's, I'm very happy to play.  I don't know.  Tomorrow, or the weekend, I play slow, slowly and I don't know.
Q.  Is this overwhelming for you or is this pretty neat?
JOSE RIVERO:  Okay.  I'm very happy for the weather and the golf course.  It's beautiful golf course.  It's difficult, but it's beautiful.  And for the weekend, I am not too much see to the leader board.  I play shot for shot and hole by hole and finish normal.  Okay.
