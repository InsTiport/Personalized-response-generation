Q.   I think the way you hung in there yesterday was key to your round today, but you played awfully well, especially down the stretch. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I'm really happy about the way I hung in there.   It's been an awesome week from beginning to end, and I'm just happy to finally pull through.

Q.   You make the birdie at 15 and at 16, and then 17 and then of course at 18 get it up and down.   And during the playoff, what was going through your mind over all of this?
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, it was a fight in the playoff, too.   Justin made a great putt there on the first playoff hole, and I had it to make one on top of him to extend it.   And then I hit a bad second shot and had to scramble for my par on the second one.   So I was able to do that and I feel pretty good about that. 
And then, here, Justin hit a good drive, I thought, he just hit it a little too far and got in trouble.

Q.   What does it mean to you to win Jack's tournament?
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Unbelievable.   Jack is such a good ambassador for golf.   It's a big honor.
