Q. Well played out there today.  3-under par; how were you able to do that?
DAVID LINGMERTH: Conditions were tough today, and I didn't really strike the ball all that well.  I was scrambling really good, and I made a couple nice putts.  Yeah, I scored really well.  Obviously you never like to finish with a bogey, but overall it was a nice day.
Q. Despite the rain this morning, it didn't seem to affect the golf course.
DAVID LINGMERTH: No, the greens are still pretty firm, fairways firm.  The rough has been juicy all week, so I don't think it really changed it a lot.  I think the course handled the weather pretty well.
Q. What was the key for you today?
DAVID LINGMERTH: Like I said, I putted well.  I scrambled pretty well.  I'm going to go to the range now and see if I can sort the swing out here.  It's not far off, but I want to strike it a little better over the weekend.
Q. A bogey on the last couldn't completely dampen what ended up being tied for the low round of the day, a 3-under 67.  How did you put it together?
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, today was a scrambling sort of day for me.  I putted really well.  I chipped well around the greens.  I wasn't able to strike the ball as well as I have been the last few months, really.  I'm going to go to the range and work on that a little bit, but I'm really glad I scored the way I did.
Q. Was there any point in the round you were able to get in a groove or were you kind of just holding on?
DAVID LINGMERTH: You know, probably 8 and 9 there I started to get going a little bit for a few holes, but it was a big grind today for sure.  Yeah, I'm happy I'm sitting where I am.
