 Q.  62, great day's work for you?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, very pleased with how my round ended up today.  Got off to a little rocky start.  Had to save a couple pars early and I got rolling with the putter and made five birdies in a row.  I started swinging it better, too.  I felt like I was in pretty good control of what I was doing out there today.   
Putting on these fresh greens early in the morning definitely helped.  I made a few nice putts, so happy with today.   
 Q.  You made the cut on the number, so was the putting the main difference today?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, definitely.  Ball-striking-wise, I think I struck it at least this good round No. 1.  Round No. 2 was a little shaky but I didn't putt very well, so you know, putting on these fresh greens, it definitely helped.  I saw my lines really good, and I putted with great speed.  Yeah, I feel comfortable on the greens now, so that's great.   
 Q.  You must feel good going into tomorrow?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, I was very pleased with being able to move up the leaderboard a little bit.  The weather's pretty nice today.  We'll see how this afternoon turns out for the guys in the lead.  I'm hoping to be somewhat near the leaders and have a chance tomorrow.  That's what I hope for.
