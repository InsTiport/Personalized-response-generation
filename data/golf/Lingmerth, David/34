 Q.   You had a bogey on 1, six birdies and a huge eagle on 18.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, it was quite an interesting start.   I started the day with a snapâ€‘hook off the tee, and it was ugly.   But after that I settled down and played pretty solid, and actually felt like I had a few more chances to make some putts.   But obviously I'm happy with a 65.  
   
 Q.   Barring an eagle on the last hole by Owen, looks like you'll be in the last group tomorrow.   That's where you want to be going into the last day?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   You know, that's what we play for.   We want to be where it happens, so if I'm in the last group, that would be great.   It's going to be fun.  
   
 Q.   A couple of near misses this year, playoff at Humana and second place at THE PLAYERS.   What's it going to take tomorrow?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   I don't know, just keep doing what I did today, and I should have a good chance.
