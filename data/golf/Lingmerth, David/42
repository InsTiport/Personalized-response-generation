Q.   Just maybe a couple thoughts on your round.   There was quite a few birdies out there today. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I struck the ball pretty well, I would say off the tee with my driver it was one of the better rounds ever, and then I didn't feel all that great over the putter, but I got a few to go and then I had a chip in too and I played really solid.   I did have a 3-putt and another bogey, so it's a couple of shots I would have wanted back, but obviously I played great today.

Q.   Talk about the birdies. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Well now I started on 10, so I get the holes mixed up here.   So let's see.   It was on, it must have been on number 17, is that a par-3? 

Q.   I believe so, yeah. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah.   I missed the green just to the left and I was probably only 25 maybe feet from the hole or something.   And it was kind of a fast one, so I just lobbed it up there and maybe just 10 feet in front of me and it trickled in.   So it was a nice one. 

Q.   I know there were a lot of birdies to be made out here and guys can make runs pretty quickly, but do you feel pretty good about where you are going into the weekend?
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Absolutely.   I feel like my game was headed in the right direction with today's round and hopefully I can keep it up the next two.
