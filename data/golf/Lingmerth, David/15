 Q.  You come in as the defending champion, shot 4 under 68.  Got to be pretty pleased with that.  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, I am.  I feel like I put myself in some good spots today and got a lot of looks.  If (indiscernible) snuck by, it could have been a really good round.  I also hit a couple of loose shots that I had to try to clean up the rest of the way.  Like I said, I'm feeling really good.   
 Q.  Even though the greens were soft, they looked like they still held plenty of speed in them.  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, I feel like they're soft.  You can be pretty aggressive out there.  They're still extremely, extremely good, extremely fast putting, and very true.  So I think we can have some low scores coming in tomorrow and the weekend too.   
 Q.  Coming in as defending champion, how has the week been for you?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: A little bit more attention from the media and so forth, but just really good feelings about this place and feeling good about the state of my game.  So I'm just going to enjoy the week as much as I can and hopefully make a title run again.
