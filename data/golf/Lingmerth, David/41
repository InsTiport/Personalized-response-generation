Q.   You needed a score today.   Did you go out there and play aggressively?
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah.   Scott had quite a bit of a head start out there, so it was kind of like playing for second, it felt like.   So I felt relaxed all day.   I made a lot of putts.   My short game was great today.   I struck it pretty well from tee to green, but the short game was where it was at today.

Q.   There was some opportunities out there, tees moved up, a couple of hole locations that were accessible.   When you got out on the golf course, did you feel like 62 was a number that would be more possible than you thought?
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I got off to a great start right away.   I think I was 4â€‘under through six holes, and then I birdied 7 and 8, as well.   And at that point, I realized that I was playing really well.   But at the same time, it felt like a lot of people were going to birdie these holes, so I needed to keep it up and keep on going and make a few more. 

Q.   You had some tough putts coming in.   You're sitting there in the fairway at 18 knowing you need to make up one or two.   Talk us through those last shots. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I hit a good tee ball on 18, kind of down left, maybe a little bit too far left.   It got close to the water there.   But I knew that 3 would definitely help me a lot.   So I tried, but I also knew that left is definitely going to run a lot, too. 
So I tried to keep left out of the way and missed it a little bit too far right, unfortunately.   But I tried to make the chip shot and didn't have enough steam on it. 

Q.   Nothing's guaranteed but there's still some golf left to be played.   So we'll see. 
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah.   Thank you.
