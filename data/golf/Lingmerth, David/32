 Q.   Solid round of golf, 4‑under 68.   Kind of the start of the year but not really in that sense, but it's a good way to start it.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I played pretty solid today.   It took me a few holes to get into it, but towards the back nine I played really good.   Had kind of an unlucky break, had a pin with a wedge shot and made a bogey, so I felt like I was playing real solid, and 4‑under is probably what I deserved.  
   
 Q.   Fun golf course, isn't it?   A little old‑school, you've got to figure it out, put it on the right side of the fairway.   You can play from the rough if you're on the proper side, and sometimes from the fairway you don't have a shot.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, it's fun to play a course like this where the holes aren't overly long, but it's penalizing if you don't put it in the right spot.   What was it, 4‑under was leading for a long time, now I know Andres played really good and shot 6, but going into today, I thought a lot of guys would probably shoot 6, but the course is holding up real well.   It's a hard course.  
   
 Q.   The course in the morning was really, really cool, and I think the afternoon scores might be a little bit better because of the heat, but they've got to deal with the greens.   The greens are going to be a little bumpy; they're poa annua.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   That's right.   We'll see how it goes, but I'm happy to be around the lead, to be where I'm at.
