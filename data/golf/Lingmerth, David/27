 Q.   How did you keep your head about you all day?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   I had so many good players around me, I just knew I had to grind it out and I didn't know what the winning score was going to be.   So just tried to do my best and keep my head down and plug away.   And I'm very happy it worked out.  
   
 Q.   What was your heart doing during this?   You looked very steely.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   I was actually pretty calm most of the time.   It did start beating a little harder once I got over that final putt to close it out.   But other than that, I think I handled myself pretty well.  
   
 Q.   And to win Jack's tournament?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, such an honor.   Such a great ambassador for golf, does so much for us.   It's an amazing feeling.  
   
 Q.   Your putt on 18 here on the first playoff hole, what's going through your mind there?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I've been in a few playoffs.   And you win some, you lose some.   And I just felt it was my time this time.   It was my turn this time.   I told myself I'm going to make this one.   I'm very happy to get it going.   
   
 Q.   When you walked up 18 the first time, saw the gallery, understanding the moment, you kind of talked the other day that you thought you would handle pressure just fine when you were a 36â€‘hole leader.   Did any of that tension sink in when you were walking up and saw what you were facing?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   You know what, honestly, I played the final group yesterday.   Today I was in the second to last group.   But yesterday I think I learned a lot about how to handle a day like today.   I was probably a little bit more nervous yesterday than I was today, honestly.   So it was a good learning experience and, yeah, I'm super thrilled.
