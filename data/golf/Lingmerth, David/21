 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Right.  Yeah, a very good feeling, but there's some scores to be had out there and I think my lead will probably not last too long.  I feel like someone will probably outdo me by a couple shots here today, at least.  But obviously I'll hopefully be within reach after today and really looking forward to the next few days.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID LINGMERTH: The wind was down a little bit, beautiful day.  The greens are at a firmness right now where you can throw some darts in there at a few of the holes.  So scoring conditions are pretty good.   
Obviously I played in the morning, the greens are perfect.  You can really get some putts to go in.  Today was very scorable.  I saw 9-under, I wish I could have done that.  But too many bad shots.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, it does.  I got a good start at the Open, too, a few weeks back at St. Andrews, but very disappointed with how I continued my play that tournament.  To get two solid rounds in the first two here this week, it's a good feeling.  I need to go to the range and figure out my ball-striking a little bit better for tomorrow.  But really happy about how things are going so far.
