 Q.  10-under par, 62 in round three.  Including six birdies in a row.  I don't know where to start.  Why don't you just describe what happened out there?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: Well, I've been feeling really good all week, been playing very solid tee to green, giving myself tons of opportunities and got off to pretty decent starts, I shot 4-under on my first nine the first day, 4-under on my first nine the second day, and just haven't been able to keep my rounds going.  So, today it was kind of a slow start, really, I only birdied one of my first five holes or whatever.  But then I really got going, got in a good rhythm and knocked them close.  I shot 10-under today and I had a chip in for eagle, which is nice, and I made a probably a 15-footer on hole No. 1, which is my 10th hole.  But other than that, it's basically a lot of short putts for birdie, because I was able to knock them close.   
 Q.  Did you catch the right course on the right day?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: You know what, I feel like it's been like this every day.  It was a little bit of wind the first day maybe, but not much to talk of, I don't think, so I really don't think it matters in which order you play these courses, in my opinion.  Someone might argue that, but they're all very scorable.   
 Q.  You've had a pretty good three day run so far, and you find yourself five shots out of the lead, is that a little daunting?  
DAVID LINGMERTH: You know, like I said there, 4-under and 4-under my first two and out here you got to make birdies.  So, I was hoping to catch up and get a little bit closer than I am right now, but it is what it is of the I got to go out there and try to do something similar tomorrow and see how far that could get me.  How far that could go.  So, yeah, I'm just going to try and keep on going.
