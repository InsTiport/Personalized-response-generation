 Q.   Obviously on the last hole you knew you had 61 to get into a playoff, right?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, I was a little too aggressive on that putt.   Wanted to make it.   
   
 Q.   Your second shot on 18 you stood there and said this hole is different today because of where the pin is, I can make birdie here, right?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, absolutely.   I was going to try to catch that ridge.   I didn't want to get too aggressive with my line, but I knew the ridge could help me.   I just caught a little bit of a flier and it flared out a little bit to the right.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about this day.   You seemed so calm.   
DAVID LINGMERTH:   I felt good all day.   I was in a good state of mind.   I felt like I was swinging it good, and I had no worries.   I was struggling a bit with my putter, though, missed some reads, and misâ€‘hit a few putts, too.   I had a bunch of opportunities on the front nine and didn't make much happen, and then towards the end there obviously 17, 18, I could have done a little better.  
   
 Q.   Did you want to play with Tiger?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   I would have loved to, but I really enjoyed playing with Sergio.   We had a good day.   Sergio is a nice guy.   
   
 Q.   Five missed cuts to playing in the last group.   Pretty good week, right?  
DAVID LINGMERTH:   Yeah, it's a little bit of an improvement, that's for sure.
