Q. Final round 66, how was that?
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, 66 sounds good.  Can't say I'm unhappy with the way I played today.  I think I did pretty well tee-to-green.  Didn't make as many putts as yesterday, so that was part of the game today where I felt like I was a little frustrated maybe.
But you know, overall, played solid and a lot of guys played really good today.  So you really had to make birdies.  I didn't make quite enough, but yeah, still a pretty good day.
Q. How do you sum up the week?
DAVID LINGMERTH: It's been a treat, actually, start to finish.  Really pleased with the crowds out here.  They came out in bunches and it's been a great tournament to play in.  And I'm quite happy with the way I performed.  Obviously when you're in contention, only two shots behind the lead as I was starting today, you hope you can pull something out and maybe get a W.  But didn't quite till the end today, but yeah, still happy.  Something to build off of.
Q. Valuable world points and Race to Dubai points?
DAVID LINGMERTH: Yeah, I'm hoping to, I haven't played that much on The European Tour this season, and I needed to make a bit of a move to make it into The Race to Dubai final.  So hopefully this can help and I'll be back for Italy and try again there.
