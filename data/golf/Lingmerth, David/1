Q. David, with 18 points today, excellent start to the day.  You're sitting at 229 on the FedExCup points list.  At that position, does it almost put it in your hands where you have to win to get close to where you need to be?
DAVID LINGMERTH: I mean, obviously, it's been a little rough go for me for a little while and working my way back.  And things are starting to come around.  But I don't really think about it that way.  I just try to stick to the process.  One shot at a time.  And whatever happens happens.
But, obviously, you know, with some not-so-good golf for a little while, I'm just looking forward to keep this going and hopefully put together a good week.  And why not try to finish on top?
Q. Last week, you shot 63 in the second round of the Barbasol Open.  Unfortunately missed the cut.  But did that round carry forward to this week and kind of keep that momentum going?
DAVID LINGMERTH: I think so.  The first round there was not very good.  So it's kind of weird to shoot a 63 on a Friday and miss the cut.  But any time you shoot a 63 you're doing something right.  So I had a lot of good things to bring with me from that round and obviously try to keep it going here.
Q. For you, what would be the secret for these next three rounds?  Will it be more mental or physical (indiscernible)?
DAVID LINGMERTH: This is a little bit of a physical walk, for sure.  It's very hilly and you can get tired.
But golf is a mental game.  So I'm just trying to stay relaxed and keep doing what I'm doing.  I feel like I'm swinging it good.  I gave myself a lot of opportunities out there.  So if I can keep that going, should be able to have fun the next few days, too.
