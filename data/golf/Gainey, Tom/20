 Q. Tommy, 1-under par today after a great 5-under yesterday. You must be having fun out here the last couple weeks? 
 TOMMY GAINEY: I'm having a blast. The conditions today were pretty tough. That wind unexpectedly got up to about 15 at times and sometimes 20, gusting on you. Like number 17 is playing 215, it's really playing like 235. 
 That's the hard part, especially with the water left, and if you bail out right, I mean, there is still no getting up and down. 
 It's tough out there today, especially when I hit the ball like crap. Made a couple putts here and there, but other than that, I'm glad to be 1-under out of it today.

 Q. Yeah, dangerous holes the last 17 and 18 there. You've tried to get better on the PGA TOUR, and the last couple of years you've really improved. You're playing probably the best of your life. What has been the effect and what are you doing really good these days? 
 TOMMY GAINEY: Actually, winning on the Nationwide Tour. That pretty much told me if I could win on the Nationwide Tour I could compete and win on the PGA TOUR. It's just propelled me on the level I'm at right now. 
 Besides today, I've hit the ball really good and putted well for about the last month. And out here you've got to make putts, and that's what I'm doing. I made putts last week, finished third. This week, I'm at 6-under. I don't know what place I'm in right now. 
 But I made some key putts today to save the round. But I'm real happy. I feel like this wind is going to keep blowing and get a lot tougher for those guys out there this afternoon.
