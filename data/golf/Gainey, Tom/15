  Q. Tommy, you've been consistent this entire week. You really polished it off today.   
 TOMMY GAINEY: Well, you know, I've hit it kind of bad the first two days, but I've just made everything I've looked at. Putted really well, and today is just another day. I mean I made a lot of putts today. You know, I had a bogey-free round which out here when you don't make any bogeys, you can gain a lot of spots in a hurry.   
  
  Q. You put the big bird up at 16, too. Tell me about the eagle.   
 TOMMY GAINEY: Well, you know, actually that was a bad swing on the second shot. I was trying to hit it a little further left than that, but just slid ahead of my shot there and it hit a little right, but it worked out. When you hit bad shots and you get away with it out here and you can make eagle, that's awesome, man.  
  
  Q. You know, it's one thing to catch a good break. It's another to take advantage of it. That's what you did on 16.   
 TOMMY GAINEY: Yeah, you know what. I feel the same way. A bad swing and then it works out and I had a 15-footer for eagle. Yeah, about 15 feet. And made it.  
  
  Q. Tommy, you've been knocking on the door out here. One of these days you're going to kick it in. Might be tomorrow.   
 TOMMY GAINEY: You know, I hope so. What a better place to win than either in South Carolina, my home state, or here in Vegas.  
  
  Q. We'll let you catch that Auburn game and cut you loose.   
 TOMMY GAINEY: Thanks. Thanks a lot.
