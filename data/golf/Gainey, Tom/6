Q.   Tell us a little bit about the round overall.   You were right there.   I know you're disappointed.   But still, a decent day; right?
TOMMY GAINEY:   Not really.   I mean I hit it terrible.   Hit it terrible.   Especially 17.   Making double there, that was really not a good thing to do.   But I struggled all day swinging at it, hitting it.   I just couldn't ever get it online with the pin today.   I was hitting it way right or way left. 
Distance control was good, but I mean I was either way right or way left.   But I hit it terrible off the tee, and out here it sets everything up.   And for me today just wasn't a good day.

Q.   That was the main difference between the two days was the driver?
TOMMY GAINEY:   Oh, no doubt about it.   Yesterday I hit 71 percent of the fairways.   Today I bet I didn't hit 30.   So I mean that's a huge difference, and when you miss the fairways out here, you're going to pay for it.   And I paid for it today, so I just gotta try to put it behind me and get ready for tomorrow.

Q.   I was going to say, you're still in it with two rounds to go.   Just gotta go work it out on the range and try to figure it out. 
TOMMY GAINEY:   I'll be better tomorrow.   I'll be better tomorrow.   I'm not too worried about it.
