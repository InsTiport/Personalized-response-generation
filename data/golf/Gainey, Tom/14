 Q.   Tommy, a long day of golf but very well played.  
TOMMY GAINEY:   You know what, actually you talking about a long day.   How about a long year so far for me?   It's been a bad year so far.   Just trying to work out the kinks, and I think I made the switch to a different Odyssey putter, and I'm going to tell you what, I'm glad I made the switch because I putted lights out for two days and missed four, five inside of ten feet.   It could have been a lot lower than what it is now, but I'm very happy.  
   
 Q.   I was going to say you made three of them from outside 20 in the second round.   You must like that putter.  
TOMMY GAINEY:   I'm in love with it right now.   I'm glad to see it finally going in the hole.   You know, I just got to take it over to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   How long do you usually stay in love with a putter, though?   Players and their the putters don't usually stay married very long.  
TOMMY GAINEY:   The last one I had for just over two years, but, you know, sometimes when you get in a slump, it's time to make a change.   Most of the time, change is for the better, and for me, it was for the better and, you know, I'm loving it right now.  
  
Q.Ball striking just fine.  
TOMMY GAINEY:   Ball striking is coming around.   I haven't hit it very good this year.   Right now it's impressive for me, so I'm loving it.  
   
 Q.   Good golf course for you, I would think?  
TOMMY GAINEY:   It is a good golf course, but after the 3 inches of rain, ball in hand, so I mean you expect low scores.  
   
 Q.   There will be some lower scores from the afternoon group when they finish.   Then you guys will get back out.   Good luck to you.  
TOMMY GAINEY:   Thank you.
