Q.   Tommy, nice round of golf, how does it feel good to start off this way? 
TOMMY GAINEY:   It does feel pretty good, but I let a few get away from me.   On number 7, especially, not real happy about that, but my year's been so bad, inconsistent.

Q.   You start out 129 in FedExCup standings, but have played better in the past month.   How much is patience a factor? 
TOMMY GAINEY:   Well, I haven't been very patient.   I've been trying to force the issue, but I'm trying to get better, trying to get better at patience.   So far today it looked like it helped out quite a bit. 

Q.   You mentioned the bogey at 7, but you had six birdies and just the two bogies, yet you want to talk about the bogey with me? 
TOMMY GAINEY:   Yeah, well, that bogey sticks out when you're like 35 feet just off the green and you threeâ€‘whack it, that kind of stings. 

Q.   Lot of positives? 
TOMMY GAINEY:   Yeah, lot of positives.   I hit the ball well and made some putts, hit some really close shots.   Had like two or three within two or three feet of the hole.   So I'm pretty happy about that. 

Q.   Talk to me about that stretch of two, three, four and five? 
TOMMY GAINEY:   2, wow.   I hit a bad wedge shot there.   That was a bad shot.   But it ended up in a pretty good spot, and I was able to make a putt.   It was like 10 to 12 feet, but it was like a foot and a half off the green next to a sprinkler head, so I was very fortunate there because it could have gone down much further left.
