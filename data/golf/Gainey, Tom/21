 Q. Tommy, more momentum carrying over from last week? 
 TOMMY GAINEY: I don't know. I would have to agree with that. I think the momentum from last week is definitely still with me even though I've got a new caddie on the bag this week. 
 My caddie, Marvin King, he had some kind of back issues, so I told him just get better. Get ready for next week and maybe THE PLAYERS. So I've got a new caddie on the bag, and it seems to be working. 
 It's just the first time I've used him before. I like the score that I shot today, and we worked really well.

 Q. You seemed to catch fire there at 18 and around the turn there. 
 TOMMY GAINEY: I hit some really good shots. I hit some really good shots and I made a few putts, and that's it, man. I mean, I didn't have to sweat it at all, not too much at all. 
 I'm real happy with the way -- my ball striking is really good right now. And my putter, as of last week, I'm making a lot of putts and still making some today. So that's a really good thing out here.

 Q. How does the course set up for you today with the wind and the fast conditions? 
 TOMMY GAINEY: No question about it. This golf course played pretty tough out here this afternoon. I didn't expect the wind to blow as much as it did off and on, gusting this and that and the other. 
 But I'm real happy to shoot 5-under with the wind change and gusting at times, blowing 10 to 15 straight. And then all of a sudden a gust of 15, and then it won't blow in at all for a couple holes. I'm pretty happy with where I'm at. Just got three more days.
