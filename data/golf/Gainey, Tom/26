 Q. Talk about grinding today and where you are. 
 TOMMY GAINEY: Well, so far the day started off good, but as you can see right now, I'm not too happy. I made a couple bogeys the last few holes, and you know, I didn't think I really hit that many bad shots to be honest with you. The drive on No. 11 I thought was good. I hit it in the middle of the fairway and it just happened to go in the water. That's just how it goes. I caught some good breaks this week, just unfortunately I caught a bad one there. But that's how it goes. 
 You know, I'm not too happy in my position right now, two back, but I've just got to come out tomorrow and just get it done, just start making some putts.

 Q. Was there a mental grind today? 
 TOMMY GAINEY: You know, I wouldn't say a mental grind. You know, I felt like I hit some pretty good shots. I started struggling off the tee a little bit with the driver, and I had to scramble quite a bit. You know, that's part of the game. You're not going to hit every shot perfect or good. You've just got to sometimes get it up-and-down.

 Q. So you're still in position?
 TOMMY GAINEY: I'm still in position. I've still got a shot at it. I'm just a little mad at the way I played those last six holes.
