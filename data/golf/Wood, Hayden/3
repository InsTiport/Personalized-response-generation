Q. 67 at Riviera in the first round of the U.S. Amateur.
HAYDEN WOOD: 64.
Q. 64?
HAYDEN WOOD: Yeah.
Q. Sorry.  There must have been a mistake on the scoring.
HAYDEN WOOD: Yeah, I think the scoring was messed up.  We didn't have a scorer until the?  The first like six holes.
Q. Congratulations.  That's better than I thought.  Wonderful.
HAYDEN WOOD: Thank you.
Q. So bogey-free or did you just make a bunch of birdies?
HAYDEN WOOD: I made seven birdies and then I bogeyed No. 14, the par-3.
But other than that, it was pretty solid.
Q. Hit a lot of fairways?
HAYDEN WOOD: Yeah, I think I probably hit every -- I hit every fairway but I think No. 1.  I went through the fairway.
Q. Okay, okay.  And so you're basically tied for the lead after the first day.  How does that feel?
HAYDEN WOOD: It feels good.  It's a match play tournament, so, I mean, the tournament starts on Wednesday.  To be able to see myself play a round like that today -- I mean, it was windy out there and the greens probably might have been a little -- they were pure, super pure, but got firmer and faster as the day went on.
To be able to shoot a score like that gets me going.
Q. When did you feel like it was going to be a good one?  Was it early?
HAYDEN WOOD: I shot 3-under on the front, but it was a lot of -- I had some up and downs and stuff, and then I birdied 10, 11, and 12 and went, All right, this is going to be fun.
Then bogeyed 14, which wasn't a big deal.  Hit a good shot.  Just caught the lip of the bunker and came down; made bogey.
Then I birdied 17.
But I made a nice putt on 18.  That was nice.  I had a pretty long putt.  I was on the right side of the green and left it probably four feet short, but made it right in the middle on the comebacker, so it was nice.
