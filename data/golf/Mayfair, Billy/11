 Q. All right. Billy, obviously a great week for you. It's looking like it's going to be tied for third. What did you do different this week?
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, I just hit a lot of good iron shots. The golf course is in immaculate shape. It's the kind of weather I like. It was hot and warm, and it's a good golf course for me. You gotta drive the ball well, and made a few good putts here and there. 
 It's just one of those weeks. Yesterday I hit a lot of good shots on the front and had a lot of birdie putts inside five or six feet and made those and made the putts I was supposed to.

 Q. It looked like you were rolling the ball out there with your putter. 
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Yeah, a lot better. And the putt on 18 I'll probably have nightmares about that one, how that didn't go in. 
 But overall it was a great week, and it was fun to get the blood flowing again. And I proved a lot to myself today, after Wachovia and losing there and shooting 77 on Sunday, after having a two-shot lead and being in contention this week and finishing up good is really a good confidence booster.

 Q. What does that do for your confidence going into the next event?
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, obviously I'm not in the PGA next week, so Top 10 here will get me into Greensboro and all that. So I need one or two more good weeks, I need another good week at Greensboro to keep going for the FedExCup.

 Q. Are you friends with Bill Lunde? 
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Not really. I'm pretty close. His locker is pretty close to me. Nice young man, and he played great today.

 Q. I was going to say, looked like you were pretty happy for him. 
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Yeah. Anytime you get your first win out here it's a big improvement. Seems like a lot of guys I'm right behind them when they get that first win, so maybe one of these years the old guy can maybe come through.
