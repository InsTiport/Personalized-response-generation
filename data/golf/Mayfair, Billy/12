 Q. Great round today. What were the conditions like out there? A lot better wind wise than yesterday, I would imagine. 
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Yeah. I teed off yesterday at 1:28. The wind was blowing probably about 25, 30 knots, and today was just a nice 5 to 10 knots. 
 It was really enjoyable playing. It was a great temperature out there. The golf course is in great shape, and it was definitely conditions for some good scoring. I took advantage of it on the first nine holes. I didn't play as good on the back, but 6-under, I'll take it. Have a lot of sun tomorrow, I hope.

 Q. All the right numbers today you see out there, is it simply the conditions? What do you pinpoint it to?
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, these guys are good out here, but you know, the conditions are perfect. Wind's not blowing that hard. The greens are soft, and the greens are in perfect shape. So when you add those things together, guys are going to make a lot of birdies.

 Q. Your thoughts going into the final round now. Right now, if all stays true, you're a shot off the lead or maybe a shot or two. Right where you want to be going into the final day?
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Absolutely. Starting where I did today, I feel good, and you know, I just gotta get some rest tonight and be ready to go tomorrow.

 Q. Thanks, Billy. 
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Thanks, guys.
