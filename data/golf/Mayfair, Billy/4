Q. So just kind of walk me through your round a little bit today.
BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, it was a good, solid round, 3 under.  Under par any time is good here.  I shot even par on front, making two birdies and two bogeys.  And I played really good in the back, making three birdies.  It was a good, solid day.  I drove it on the fairway a lot, made some good putts, and looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. Are there any key holes that you think either you feel you played really well on or need to look toward the future?
BILLY MAYFAIR: I birdied 12 to go to 1 under and hit a really good on 13, just missed the putt and missed a two-footer for par there.
Missed the fairway on 14, but luckily caught a good lie and knocked it on and made birdie.  So that kind of kept my momentum going.  So I caught a good lie.
Q. Obviously, runner-up last year.  Was there anything else you did extra, I guess, to prepare for this one?  Definitely want that win.
BILLY MAYFAIR: Obviously, it was great last year, being my first event and stuff.  I was ready.  Got a little more playing time under my belt this year.  It's a new golf course and new strategies, but I always love playing in USGA events.
