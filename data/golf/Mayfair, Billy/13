  Q. What's your take on this course?  
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Kind of like the golf course. I like it better than the one we played. I think if the wind can kind of stay like it is right now and not blow too hard, I think it's a real good test. You got to hit some good shots and hit some good iron shots.   
 Reminds me of Montrose we used to play down there at West Palm Beach for the Honda. It kind of table tops a little bit. You got to get to know the golf course. That's more rounds. As long as the wind doesn't blow as hard as it did yesterday, I think the players will like the golf course and I think the scores will be good, too.  
  
  Q. Over-par is the average in this. In fact, there was a 73.3 for awhile. U.S. Open last year played worse. This looks like it's going to be a test even with the wind.  
 BILLY MAYFAIR: The wind blew harder this morning than it did this afternoon. I think we got the luck of the two draws. But, you know, I think the wind takes a lot here.  
  
  Q. What about the greens, some of the players say the greens are a little funky, a little goofy.  
 BILLY MAYFAIR: They've got some elephants buried in them. There's hills in them and all that good stuff. You just have to get used to it and know where to hit. When you have a good flat putt you got take advantage of it. When you don't, you try to get it down there close and get out of here. Just a matter of really learning the golf course over the next few days.
