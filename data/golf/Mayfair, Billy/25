 BILLY MAYFAIR:  It was chilly and the first hole played long.  But the greens were nice and a little soft.  They were getting firmer as the day went on.  They will definitely be getting tougher as the day goes on. 
 It is setting up for being an exciting round.  The golf course is winning right now. 
 I expect it will probably win this week. 

 Q.  Regarding the ceremony on the first tee with Arnie teeing off. 
 BILLY MAYFAIR:  It was great to see Arnie.  But the moment of silence for Mr. Nelson was very special.  The moment of silence brought tears to my eyes.  It was special seeing Peggy there on the first tee. 
 You forget to think he was gone.  It will really hit us when we go to his tournament in a few weeks.  It will be another emotional moment.
