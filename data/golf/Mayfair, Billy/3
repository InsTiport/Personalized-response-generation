 Q.  Rounds of 71, 72, how happy are you to be inside, and tell us how brutal it was out there today.  
BILLY MAYFAIR: It was tough.  It's probably the toughest conditions I've played in in a long time.  In fact, I think this might be the hardest.  We got here today in the parking lot, saw how hard the wind was blowing, at least 30, 35 knots and knew rain was in the forecast and coming.  You just have to grab hard and play hard and just kind of work my way through it.   
I drove the ball very well today.  Kept it in play a lot.  I missed a lot of greens.  I think everybody did, though.  But I just chipped and putted very well.  I made a lot of good saving pars.  I think maybe at least six or seven saving par putts and it just keeps the momentum going.  Hopefully tomorrow the weather won't be quite as bad and get more of a truer test out there.   
The golf course is in great shape.  It staying in great shape for the rain it's had and all that.  We really enjoy playing it, so I hope we get two pretty good days to end the championship with.   
 Q.  Is this a situation where you're not even looking at the leaderboard out there?  
BILLY MAYFAIR: No, it's too early to.  Just too many things can happen between now and Sunday, and like I said it was just survival today.  Just get around and post a number and stay in contention.   
 Q.  How much of your game plan revolves around the forecast for the weekend?  
BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, as soon as you wake up in the morning, you turn it on and you kind of see how the whole day is going to go, and as soon as you get here, you start looking at the flags and all that.  Basically it revolves completely around the weather, I think.
