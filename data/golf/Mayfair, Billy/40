BILLY MAYFAIR:  I wasn't, but I guess I am now.  I've got    I guess I've got some decisions to make now.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Well, yeah, I just was planning on playing next week at Moline, and if I do, I don't know if I can get over there in time and all that, so I've got to make a couple phone calls and make a couple quick decisions here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Yeah, it is.  You know, I love playing here, I love this golf course, obviously winning here ten years ago in 1995.  I kind of struggled the first day and the last three days I've played very, very well and really, really solid.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  No, I just started making some putts.  I made some great putts today.  I made a few good long putts today, but just started making some putts.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I haven't decided yet.  I don't know yet.  I don't want to say anything because I don't want to offend any of the sponsors or anything like that.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  It's a good decision to have, yeah.  It's a lot better than worrying about if I'm going to get in or not, that's for sure.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Well, I would say it's a great    finishing 2nd at Colonial, playing in the last group and finishing well and coming back today on Sunday and playing well on Sunday here now just continues to give me confidence.

You know, it's been a lot of fun this year, and a lot of people told me it was a lot of pressure because of my exemption and all that.  I didn't feel like it was any more pressure, I felt like it was just another year out here.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I have not played an Open there.  I've played St. Andrews but I haven't played it in an Open.  I didn't play the other two there.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's so different.  Obviously what I remember, obviously the golf course wasn't quite in the shape it will be for the Open and all that, but it's a fun golf course.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I was just over there    in fact, we were over there for the Walker Cup team, and we went over and played.  So it's been a while, a long time.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Well, I think it's great.  You know, I think obviously it's going to be a big draw for the tournament and all that.  I don't know if the LPGA has a tournament next week or not.  I've said before, I wish she'd concentrate more on helping get that Tour going than worrying about the PGA TOUR, but she's playing next week, she'll be fun to have there and she'll probably bring a lot of people out, which is great.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Well, I practiced a lot with the longer putter, and when I was at home and all that, what it did for me is it just gave me a lot of confidence.  I think the biggest thing is when I get done with a round or go home, I don't think about it back in the hotel room or this or that.  I don't worry about it as much, which is nice.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Well, last year they didn't show up very much on TV, so
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  No, not really.  It's just a confidence factor and seeing my line and feeling good.  I mean, I feel like now I could go back to my short putter and putt just as well.  I'm not going to, but I feel like I could because I feel like I've got my stroke and my confidence back.
Q.  (Inaudible).
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I'd call it a belly putter, but I'm not a very big tall guy so it's not very long anyway.
