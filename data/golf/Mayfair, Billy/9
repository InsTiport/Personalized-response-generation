   BILLY MAYFAIR: That's right. You know, I've played good the last four weeks, you know, since Vegas, and played well last week and finished good. So I got a lot of confidence.   
 Played very well this morning. Four birdies, no bogeys. Just got to go out tomorrow and see what I can do.  
  
  Q. How do you put it out of your mind?  
 BILLY MAYFAIR: You don't ever put it our of your mind. You just go out there and you try to make this as a normal tournament here. I've played here 22 years and I enjoy playing here.   
 So I think once you tee off and get going out there, you just try to give it a moment and (indiscernible: wind.)   
 Sure, I want to play well and get my card, but still want to try to win this week. That's your goal. That's what we're really doing here. We all have little goals and all that stuff, but you don't put it out of your mind.   
 But if you start playing good, it hits a lot easier, that's for sure.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible: wind.)  
 BILLY MAYFAIR: Well, yeah, I think obviously the wind got really nasty. It was swirling out there. Greens were real quick this morning.   
 4-under I'm real happy with, and we'll see how everything else finishes out.
