BILLY MAYFAIR:  You know, it's been a long week for me but I feel pretty good, still a little tired and all that.  Go back next week and get some more rest and hopefully come out a few more beaks from now.  Overall it's a great week and the fans here in Chicago have been just wonderful, probably the greatest fans I've ever been around and they supported me all four days.

Walking up 18, it was just hard to concentrate, everyone was really cheering for me and that means the world to me.  Everyone knew and was really giving support.  I think cancer has probably touched everyone's life at one time or another, and I was graduate to be here.  Didn't have a great weekend but I'm not complaining that's for sure.
Q.  How do you feel right now?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I'm tired.  I think today physically I felt better but I was more mentally tired.  I hit some bad shots coming in.  Hit it in the water on 17, which I probably shouldn't have done.  Another week at home, get physically ready and get back on Tour and get mentally tough again.
Q.  I'm sure it's easy to understand why you would be a little bit knocked out mentally with what you've gone through and your mother has gone through and playing in a major and not even knowing how you do.  It's been a heck of a week.
BILLY MAYFAIR:  It's been a heck of a last couple weeks for me.  But my mom is doing good.  I talked to her last night and she's up and around and she probably doesn't know where she's at but who doesn't, but she's doing much better.
