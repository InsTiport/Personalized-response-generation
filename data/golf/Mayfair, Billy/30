Q.
How is your mother doing?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  I talked to the doctors this morning and she is doing better.  She is alert, she knows where she's at.  She knows I'm playing in the tournament and she still thinks she's at home but she's in the hospital and that's okay.  Her vitals are getting better so, another 24 hours to see how things are going.
Q.  Out of the blue?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Out of the blue.  She had a CAT scan on Thursday and while she was in recovery, she had a mild stroke and heart attack.
Q.  How much has golf been an outlet for this week?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  It's been a great outlet for me, to get out there and not just to be out here with all of these great fans here in Chicago but just to be out with the other players and all of the guys on Tour.

And to be able to see everybody has been a great outlet for me and just gave me a lot of confidence, too.  I didn't play as well as I'd like to today, but played well this week and maybe I'll get it going tomorrow.
Q.  Ran out of steam a little bit?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Getting done late last night at 7:15 and having to turn back around, yeah, I need to do a lot of cardio when I get home next week.
Q.  What is your cardio workout?
BILLY MAYFAIR:  Riding the bike.
