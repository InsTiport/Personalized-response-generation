Q. How was it out there today?  Did you have any surprises?  Did anything stand out on the golf course?
KAITLYN PAPP: I thought it was in tremendous shape as you'd expect.  I feel like Augusta exceeds any expectations you have.  It's a truly magical place to play golf.
Q. Do you have a favorite hole?
KAITLYN PAPP: To me, No. 12 is a pretty memorable hole, just because it's right near Amen Corner and all the azaleas in the background, I just love the way that hole looks.
Q. How long has your dad been your caddie?
KAITLYN PAPP: Ever since my first tournament when I was ten years old.
Q. Has he ever missed a tournament?
KAITLYN PAPP: Yes.  One.
Q. Only one?
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, last summer.
Q. He's been your caddie all week.  Will he be tomorrow?
KAITLYN PAPP: I'm not sure.  I'm leaning towards yes, but I haven't made 100 percent decision yet.
Q. It's a tough decision.  You've got to balance, obviously you're most comfortable with your dad but when it comes to experience, how are you going to be evaluating that decision tonight?  Will your dad be a part of that?  I'm sure he will be.
KAITLYN PAPP: Yeah, for sure.  I think I just want to I guess keep my options open and just think about what's best for me, and honestly, I feel like it would be a really cool experience for him to be on the bag since he's been with me the whole journey of golf.
Q. Was there anything about the course you weren't expecting?
KAITLYN PAPP: This is my second time playing Augusta, and both times, the undulation of the greens was so shocking but also makes it pretty fun.  You have to use your creativity and imagination to try and make the best putts you can make.
