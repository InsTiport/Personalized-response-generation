  Q. Kaitlyn, how was it out there today?
 KAITLYN PAPP:   The conditions were really difficult.  Obviously the temperatures dropped a lot from yesterday, so it was pretty cold all day.  Luckily it wasn't too windy, so it really required just a lot of par golf today.
 Q. Birdie on the last hole; can you talk us through that?
 KAITLYN PAPP:   Birdieing the last hole was really exciting.  I hit a pretty good tee shot and then I hit a really good approach shot to about 15 feet and had a pretty much dead straight putt up the hill.  That was an exciting way to cap off the week.
 Q. Obviously you're low amateur this week.  How does that feel?
 KAITLYN PAPP:   I'm really honored.  Like I told Golf Channel, this year the group of ams in the field was really strong, and so to be low amateur in that group really means a lot.
 Q. What did you learn about yourself and your golf game this week?
 KAITLYN PAPP:   I learned that I can pretty much handle whatever conditions come our way.  We experienced perfect weather, we experienced kind of difficult weather this week.  I think I just learned that I'm pretty mentally tough out there.
 Q. You've played obviously high-level amateur and college golf.  What was it like the last few days playing in the final two or three groups of a major championship?
 KAITLYN PAPP:   It was really exciting.  Initially my goal here was just to make the cut, and I ended up playing really great golf and found myself somewhat in contention this weekend.  I mean, I was just thrilled just to be in that group.
