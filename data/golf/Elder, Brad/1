  Q. Nice 63 today. Talk about your round.   
 BRAD ELDER: Yeah, it was nice. It was a nice round. I hit it pretty good on the front, made some putts, and then kind of had a hiccup on 10 but got it back and then chipped in on 16 and made a nice birdie on 18.  
  
  Q. Was it the putting, the driving, a combination of everything?  
 BRAD ELDER: You know, I just kind of kept it in play and I hit some nice iron shots, but mostly putting. I putted good, chipped good, made the par putts when I needed to and just kind of kept the round going.  
  
  Q. Beautiful morning, no wind really to speak of. Anything that kind of got you off to a good start?  
 BRAD ELDER: No, it was nice. I mean, it was a little early to be teeing off, but it was nice. It was a very nice day to play golf. You can't ask for better weather.   
 Maybe I was still asleep and didn't get in my own way.  
  
  Q. What are you looking forward on the weekend?  
 BRAD ELDER: Maybe just more of the same. I just need to make some putts and just kind of keep it in play and hit some decent iron shots and then hole a few putts, see what happens.
