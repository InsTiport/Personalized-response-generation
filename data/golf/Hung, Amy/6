  AMY HUNG: Try not to be too greedy and one shot at a time.   
  Q.  How did the course play?  It's been renovated, we had a little rain yesterday, just talk about how the golf course played?   
   AMY HUNG: Some of the par-4s are pretty long. So put on the fairways the main key on this course, I think. And put on the right spot off the green. Because it's the green gets very slippery sometimes.   



 So actually par is good score for every hole.  That's my goal for the day, I want to just finish the hole par or under every hole.   
  
  Q.  You putted extremely well today, you had only 27 putts.  So you didn't have any of those circumstances where the ball rolled beyond the hole and off the green then?   
   AMY HUNG: I didn't know that. Yeah, some holes I would rather just leave it short of the green instead of over the pin and putt downhill. I would rather just do a little chip and run in the front of the green. I think that's easier for me.   



 Because I'm pretty confident with my chipping.  And I have a lot of good chips today.  I think.  I think I chipped better than putting, actually.   
  
  Q.  I believe you chipped in on the third hole?   
 AMY HUNG:  Yes.  That's right.   
  
  Q.  Or excuse me, the second hole, for a birdie 3.  Tell us about that shot.   
   AMY HUNG: Oh, yeah, I was on the fairway and then the second shot I had to hit a rescue, but the wind was a little right-to-left and I had a little downhill lie.   



 So I hit it, I missed the green -- the pin was the left, so I just barely missed the green on the left side about 10 yards from the hole.  So it's not very long chip, it's a like a little high lob shot.  So just follow what I picture and then it just went in the hole.
