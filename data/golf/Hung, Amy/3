 Q.  Amy, how do you feel right now, a little nervous? 
 AMY HUNG:  Yeah, a little bit.  You know, it was a very exciting match and we went back and forth.  Young Kim is a very good player, she's very steady, I knew I had to play well to beat her. 

 Q.  What is the difference from the front nine versus the back nine? 
 AMY HUNG:  When I started I didn't contact the ball very well for the long game because I was looking at the wrong sheet, I got the tee time wrong.  But I found it on the back nine -- plus, we were on the clock, too.  So on the back nine, I kind of slowed down and shoot a couple birdies and then had fun. 

 Q.  And are you having fun, because you're going into Saturday, in the top 16 out of 64.  What was your goal coming into the tournament, and now what is your goal going into this weekend? 
 AMY HUNG:  I'm just happy to be here.  This is my first time playing this event, and it's an honor to play this event.  So just very excited and I don't want to expect too much because usually that will get myself pressure.  So I just play one shot at a time and see how it goes, see how far I can get. 

 Q.  And your thoughts going into tomorrow, any plans for tomorrow? 
 AMY HUNG:  I will make sure I get the right tee time, get here early and then try to finish the match in as less holes as possible and then we can have more energy on the back, the second one. 

 Q.  What time did you think you were supposed to tee off? 
 AMY HUNG:  I have no idea.  It's something to do -- oh, today, I thought it was 11:30.  I think someone gave me the wrong sheet, and I looked at it and it's not official and then they changed it after.  But I made the tee time.
