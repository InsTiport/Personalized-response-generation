 Q. Overall thoughts on the round. You're 9-under par. Pretty good spot to be. 
 AMY HUNG: Yeah. Yeah, I been played best I ever play. Rolling it well, swing well, and just stay patient. 
 I had very good caddie with me right now, so I'm very confident.

 Q. Is it different than usual?
 AMY HUNG: Yeah. Actually we start work together like this is the third week. Yeah, so we did a lot of improve.

 Q. What's his name?
 AMY HUNG: Danny Huber. H-u-b-e-r.

 Q. No -t?
 AMY HUNG: No. 

 Q. Okay. Cool. Well, starting the day, obviously Brittany put up a good number yesterday. Does that change your mindset at all? Do you feel like you have to make more birdies when she's got that number sitting there? 
 AMY HUNG: We layout a game plan the beginning of the week, and just kind of follow the game plan. I guess we just focus on something I can control. 
 So I'm not worry about what other people do. 

 Q. How about a hole-out for eagle? Does that help a little bit?
 AMY HUNG: Yeah. Wow, yeah, that was an awesome experience. (Indiscernible) eagle since beginning of the year, and I finally accomplished it.

 Q. Oh, really? That's your first eagle of the year?
 AMY HUNG: No. I make a couple eagles in beginning, and then he say, Okay one more eagle and then I just stop making it. 

 Q. Do you remember what you hit and from where? 
 AMY HUNG: Yeah. It was 13th hole in the back of -- on the hill, and it was 115 to the hole. I hit like a punch 9-iron.

 Q. Okay. 
 AMY HUNG: And one hop and just dive in the hole.

 Q. Does a shot like that change anything for you mentally? I know you say you have a game plan. Does that do anything for you confidence-wise? Do you kind of say, Okay, this a cool, special week? 
 AMY HUNG: Not really. I been knocking a lot of shots very close in the past couple of weeks, so I'm kind of expecting it's going to drop sooner or later.
 Yeah, so just happy to be in. That one hole was actually kind of tough. The wind of coming left to right. But I hit it solid. 
 You know, just an soon as the ball took off from the face it's not under my control. So I just try to think that way.

 Q. Cool. Great. Thank you. 
 AMY HUNG: Thank you. 

 Q. Good luck. 
 AMY HUNG:
