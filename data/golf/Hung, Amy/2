 Q.  Talk about your round today and the playoff, what happened in the playoff? 
 AMY HUNG:  The playoff, Carin hit it to the right in the tree -- not in the tree, under the tree, so I know she has a long second shot, so finally she laid up because I don't think she can safely cross the water.  So I get a good opportunity for that, so I just want to hit it on the green, close around the green and then 2-putt it. 

 Q.  That's essentially what you did? 
 AMY HUNG:  Yes. 

 Q.  Kind of an adventurous round, lots of up-and-downs.  Talk a little about that. 
 AMY HUNG:  Well, I played well until the last couple of holes.  I guess the wind I misjudged a couple of the holes.  I had a couple of wrong clubs.  My swing, I wasn't 100% committed to it.  I think I'll do much better this afternoon about that part. 

 Q.  You're dialed in with the wind now, you have a better handle on it with your clubs? 
 AMY HUNG:  Yes. 

 Q.  Are you happy with your game overall? 
 AMY HUNG:  Yeah, just happy to be here and I've survived one more round, yeah. 

 Q.  You're three rounds into this, for the 59th seed, you're holding up remarkably well. 
 AMY HUNG:  Thank you.  And wish I can play -- keep on playing better golf.
