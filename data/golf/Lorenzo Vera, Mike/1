 Q.  Mike, good start here at the British matters.  
MIKE LORENZO VERA: Yeah, really happy.  It was tough out here.  Hard to hit the fairways with those crossing winds and dry grounds.   
 Q.  How much can this golf course punish you if you get into trouble?  
MIKE LORENZO VERA: I hope I will not be able to answer that question, but yeah, well, if you start missing the fairways, you're chipping a bit far from the hole, and then these greens are really fast because the wind is -- you really have to consider the greens for the lines.  It can be brutal.   
 Q.  Do you enjoy this test of golf?  
MIKE LORENZO VERA: Yeah, I do, but I need a nap now.
