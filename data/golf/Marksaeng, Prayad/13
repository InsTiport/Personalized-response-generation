 Q.  Just the start you're looking for? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: : I played very good along with Prayad, who did well. He drove well from off the tee. He teed off first and he was always on the fairways and I could get aggressive. We played very well today. We were very steady. 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: I drove well but the rest of my game wasn't in form. Thongchai played really good to get us going. 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We worked well together. There were some holes where I just picked up the ball. If someone played bad, the other would concentrate hard. It is very important to do that in the fourball. In the last hole, he drove into the water but I got it into play. 

 Q.  You both seemed very relaxed out there? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We were talking about jokes all the time. We talked about everything out there. Just catching up with each other as we've played in different events. 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: We just kept encouraging each other on today. 

 Q.  Foursomes tomorrow, have you guys determined your strategy? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We'll plan tonight on who will take the odd number or even number holes. There are some holes which I like and some which he likes, so we'll decide from there. 

 Q.  Feeling confident now that you're joint leader? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, the more we play together, the more confidence we'll have. There are three more rounds to go. 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: It's good to see us on the leaderboard. Tomorrow will be important with the foursomes but it's won't be a problem for us.
