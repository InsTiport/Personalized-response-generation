 Q. Ask him about his day and ask him if his back was a problem. 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: The greens are hard to read. I tried my best, I hit pretty good, but the greens are, especially the 5- and 6-footers, are very, very difficult to read. 

 Q. How is his back?
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: (Through Interpreter) Yeah, he start on the back nine, he start to have the back pain. He has a pinched nerve in the back there. That's there. And it's very uncomfortable. It's hard to make a full swing. And you have to adjust when you don't have the full swing, just to get on the green or that. But from the fairway it's no problem.

 Q. Is he thinking about withdrawing from the Masters?
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: I don't think I want to do that. I'm not going to do that. That is my pride and I don't think I would do that. He'll be fine tomorrow morning. He'll probably shoot 5-under.

 Q. Is there anything you want to say about how you feel?
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: Just very, very limited time for me to practice, because I only got here a few days before and then there's not a much time. And then I got hurt and there was a couple days before the competition and it's very hard for me, it's very limited time to practice. 
 And then the way they put the pins for us today is, I tell you what, five, six, five, six, ten-footer off the green is easy to do. It's very, very hard for me. 

 Q. How do you plan on playing tomorrow?
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: I think that I will try to do my best and to get it going, you never know.
