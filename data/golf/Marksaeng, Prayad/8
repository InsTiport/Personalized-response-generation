 Q. What was the difference today in round 2? 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: Greens quite hard and fast today. 

 Q. On the back nine you only hit one green where you putted for birdie. You had some problems reaching the greens. Can you talk about that? 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: Because of the tee shots not good it was quite difficult, so I was quite worried about the greens at that time. It's difficult to be on the greens in regulation. 

 Q. What is your thought on being two shots out of the lead going into Saturday? 
 PRAYAD MARKSAENG: I didn't mean to be this high in this event, but it's great. I'll do my best tomorrow.
