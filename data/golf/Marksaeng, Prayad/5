 Q.   The first nine you were 4‑down, what happened?   
PRAYAD MARKSAENG:   Front nine, I played better.   I played better.   I only maintained the game.   Front nine already 4‑up, and on No. 10, I bogey, so that was the game change.   He make a mistake a lot on the back nine.   He keep maintain his game, that's it and don't also make a mistake.  
   
 Q.   What did you tell yourself when you were 4‑down?   
PRAYAD MARKSAENG:   Happy with the game today, also.   Only keep maintain my game and then the turning point is on 13 and 14.   After the bogey it was 1‑up and on 15 both of us chipped bad, bad chip and both bogey.   And No. 16 is the one that I can keep up and keep thinking about how to play that hole.  
   
 Q.   The last putt, how important was that?  
PRAYAD MARKSAENG:   I saw the line on this hole and then the caddie reminded him to stay still and then short putt.   
   
 Q.   Do you think that Jamie was also going to make the putt?  
PRAYAD MARKSAENG:   I think about if Jamie putted the same on the 17th hole, so did the same.
