Q. Can you talk about your day?
PRAYAD MARKSAENG: Maybe no luck today.  Hit good, early putting, everything was on the green.
Q. You were five-down from the first position; can you do it again tomorrow?
PRAYAD MARKSAENG: Maybe in the same time, no luck, both.  Cannot get recover.  This one missed and that one also missed.  I think we solved the problem -- went on the green, birdie putt.  This one missed, that one missed, the same missing on the same hole.
Both really quiet.  Not very talking all the time.  Both very serious concentration.  The game, sometimes too much, need to relax.  Maybe tomorrow I adjust the pairing.
