Q. 1-under yesterday but kind of got things going a little bit today.  Your thoughts?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, played a little better yesterday than I scored, and played a little worse than I scored today.  Although I kind of made a couple mistakes at the end, which makes the round a little sour.  Overall, good start to the season.  Happy with the first couple days.
Q. Golf course, changing personality some; it appears to be firming up a little bit.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit more what we expect over here.  Obviously a lot of rain over the last week and the weekend.  But it's getting better and better every day.  I think we're in for a great weekend.
