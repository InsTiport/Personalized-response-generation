 Q.   All right.   126 heading into this week.   How much is that a factor, how much is that in your mind?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   It's a huge factor.   The Playoffs really start this week for me.   Happy to be in the position I'm in because I was about 137 starting Reno week.   Go to Reno in a half point field and, you know, are able to move up.   That's pretty good.   
I didn't get to play last week.   I ended up being the 3rd alternate.   Kind of a bummer.   I'm excited for this week and the Playoffs are starting now.  
   
 Q.   Is it in anyway kind of a nagging inconvenience or something thinking you got to get to a number or it just takes care of itself?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   It takes care of itself if you play well.   It's a little bit of inconvenience.   Unfortunately, as well, I'm one of guys who my money list number is a lot better than my FedEx Cup number.   That's always kind of aggravating, yeah.   It's a little bit frustrating but it is what it is.   
Some years you'll be I guess one way, some years it will be another way.   But hopefully I can play well this week and get myself going here.
