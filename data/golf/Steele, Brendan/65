Q.   I know you're focused on your own game, but at what point did you realize he had seven straight 3s?
BRENDAN STEELE:   Well, when you're keeping the card it's pretty easy to look at it.   It looked like it was just all the same number in a row.
Yeah, it was pretty wild.   I definitely ‑‑ I feel like I played terrible, and I think I played decent, so (laughs).   But that was fun to watching.   They were going in from everywhere.

Q.   Have you ever been around something like that, a situation where a guy's close to a 59?
BRENDAN STEELE:   I've been in rounds when guys have gone crazy like that before.   I can't remember anybody closing in on 59.   I don't think I've ever seen that, not in a tournament anyway.

Q.   On 18 you guys were talking about it and everything else.   Were you kind of surprised he was so calm?
BRENDAN STEELE:   No, I've known Tommy a long time, and he seems to be pretty calm most of the time.   He just has a good time, kind of stays in his own rhythm, plays really quick, which I think is really good.   I think that's why you see him shoot such low scores.   He doesn't get in his own way that way.

Q.   Were you doing the math when he made the eagle?
BRENDAN STEELE:   I knew what he was, yeah.   I knew he needed one more.   After he made the birdie on 16 I knew he needed one more.   It's tough to do it on a par 70 because you don't have the par‑5s.   You can say it's tough to do it on a par 72 because you gotta go two more lower.   You know, when you only have two par‑5s and they're decently tough out here, it's hard to get those easy ones or get the 3s.   But definitely after he made the birdie on 16 I was looking at it, I was like, well, he might make birdie on the next two.   I was thinking 58 for him the way it was going.
