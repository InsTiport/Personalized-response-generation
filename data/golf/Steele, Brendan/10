 Q.  Brendan, you fought hard on a tough day to play golf. Come up a little short in the playoff. How much does this hurt? You really had this tournament. Yeah, it hurts a lot. I mean be kind of everything that could go wrong went wrong today. I'm just a California kid who doesn't like rain, so I was just trying to grind and I worked as hard as I could and just wasn't good enough.  
 Q.  I guess everything that could go wrong in the last hour did for you.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, basically. I was battling as hard as I could through the rain and all the elements and stuff. Just couldn't get any putts to go in, and didn't make a good swing on 18 at the right time. It's tough.   
 Q.  Yeah, the number into the 10th in the playoff just went for it because Cameron was so tight in there.  
BRENDAN STEELE: You know, I think the shot has been playing so long all week that I just had it a little different in my head than it was playing right now. This is by far the calmest we've seen it. I was thinking anything I landed on a normal type shot was going to spin all the way back down, and I thought that was my chance to make a three. I hit a really good shot, but just was obviously not the right one.   
 Q.  I know it'll take a while, but you'll find some positives out of this.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I've battled with a lot of things over the last year and a half with the game, and this is really going to help me to battle forward and keep doing what I'm doing. I think I'm going to get a lot of the confidence out of it.
