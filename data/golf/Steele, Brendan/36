 Q.  Sum up the day and the week.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Fantastic week.  Obviously, really happy with how I played.   
Would have liked to have made a couple of those putts on the back nine.  I thought we hit our line pretty good there.  It just wasn't quite our week, but feel like really building on a lot of good stuff right now and very positive coming off of Frys and not playing a very good last round.   
 Q.  What are the positives that you can take back from this week?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Just staying patient.  Being a little bit more into the moment, kind of enjoying it a little bit more.   
This is why we play.  It's to have a chance to win and to be in the last group on Sunday.  I lost a little sight of that at Frys.   
And, so, now I've got four rounds under my belt in the last group on the weekend already this year, so just trying to keep learning and keep getting better.   
 Q.  You got off to a few par putts -- pars in the early in the round, was it a bit frustrating that you just couldn't make those birdies?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Definitely.  You kind of expect to birdie 3 and 5 and you don't get either one of them, you get a little frustrated.   
But you have to stay patient, because there's a lot of birdies out there.  The last thing you want to do is start to push.   
So, overall, I'm happy that I just kind of hung in there, stuck with my game plan, and was able to make a few the rest of the way.   
 Q.  Still a good start to your season as well, isn't it?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Very good.  Very happy with it.   
 Q.  Talk about experience Malaysia for you this week.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, it's been awesome.  Everybody takes such good care of us, the fans are fantastic, they really showed up today, very supportive and very loud.  It was a lot of fun.   
It's such a nice city.  Such a clean city with a lot of different cultures kind of mixed together, which is really fun for us to see.  We don't get to see that very often.
