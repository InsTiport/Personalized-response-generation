Q.   Great playing today, 7â€‘under 64.   Just talk a little bit about today and obviously you've got to be feeling great heading out from here. 
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah, feeling great.   My game has been great the last couple weeks, but I haven't been getting anything out of it.   I felt like I was playing well in the desert and just couldn't keep up with the low scores out there.   I felt like I played well last week and missed the cut. 
But I thought the game was good and was able to stay patient this week, which has been hard for me to do, and fortunately it came together today. 

Q.   There's a rumor that you only play TPC courses really well; is that true?
BRENDAN STEELE:   That's sort of true, I think, except for Sawgrass.   I apparently don't play that one very well at all.   But yeah, I like TPCs for some reason, so any time you see a TPC on the schedule, you can expect to see me there.
