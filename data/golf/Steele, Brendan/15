Q. Feel pretty good about the way things went today?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yes, very good.  Always nice to have a tap-in on 18, too.  No matter your score.
Q. The scoring conditions out there, nobody's putting up a number.  How tough is it to score?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, opposite wind than what we have had, so all the holes are playing completely different.  I found this week that the ball's going really, really far downwind, too like, uncontrollably far, with your iron shots.  So probably hit it over 15 greens this week, which is really tough and not a good police to play from as a rule.  Especially with the greens being so firm.  The downwind holes are just as hard as the into the wind holes a lot of the time.
So, just really tough, got to be on your game with every shot.  If you're a little bit off or even if you hit good shots, you can get punished really badly out there.
Q. Haven't seen a ton of long putts made either.  New greens, is that impacting it?
BRENDAN STEELE: I thought the greens rolled awesome this week.  I wasn't holing really long putts, but I holed quite a few 10 to 20 footers this week.  So, I was really happy with the greens.  I thought they were fantastic.
Q. Is this the kind of test this tournament should have on a Sunday to get a worthy champion?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I think the course is good enough, no matter what conditions you get, you're going to get a great champion, but when the wind gets up like this you're going to have to hit quality shots, you're going to have to play with some courage and you're going to have to be really calm when it gets stressful, because you always know you have these holes lurking at the end and you don't really know how your day's going to go until you go through you that stretch.
Q. Did it feel it stressful today?
BRENDAN STEELE: Big time.  It's stressful all week, but I felt really stressed yesterday.  For some reason, I was just really uncomfortable and didn't play very well and kind of talked myself into some bad positions.  Today I was trying really hard not to do that.  But it's always stressful coming around 17 and 18, especially with the wind and you can really ruin your day there in the blink of an eye.
Q. When you have stress like this, do you do it yourself or have someone helping you?
BRENDAN STEELE: My caddie is part psychologist, part green reader, part club selector, part whatever he needs to be.  So he definitely helps me a lot.  There's only so much you can do at a certain point.
