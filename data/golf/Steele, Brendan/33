Q. Clean card, that's hard to get around here.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, it's really tough.  Actually missed some fairways, too, but was able to get it around the green to at least have a few chances to get up-and-down, and made some good saves early, which was key.
Q. You played the North Course, do you care if you play the North first or do you just take what you get?
BRENDAN STEELE: You got no choice anyway.  So you got to like whatever you get.  But I would probably rather play South Course first, as a rule.  Just to know that you've got some opportunities coming the next day.  But now you've just got three tough days in a row.
Q. Sometimes we call this four weeks of poa annua greens.  As a So Cal guy, are you comfortable with that?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, definitely, I grew up on this kind of surface, so for me it's really comfortable.  The greens got a lot better between yesterday and today on the North Course at least.  So that was really nice to see.
Q. Good start.  Keep it up.
BRENDAN STEELE: All right.  Thank you.
Q. 4-under par to start here on the North Course.  Talk about your round a little bit.  Clean round.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, making no bogeys is always good.  North Course is playing tougher than it has in the past.  I think it's gotten a little tougher every year.  And now the rough's up and the greens are pretty firm and quick, so I'm pretty happy with it.
Q. Do you like -- you said earlier you would rather play the South Course first, but is it good to get that good score on the North Course?
BRENDAN STEELE: Either way, if you play well in the first round, it doesn't really matter.  But I think, mentally, you like trying to get something done on the South Course, maybe posting something around par and knowing that you got some chances on the other side.  But I'm happy with my start for sure.
