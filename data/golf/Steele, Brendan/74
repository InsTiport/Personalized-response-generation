  Q. You've got to be disappointed. What are your emotions?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: It's terrible. It's the worst day I can remember on the golf course. I'm not even disappointed that I didn't win, I'm just disappointed that I didn't give it a better round. I didn't see this coming at all and didn't feel like I even played as bad as the score showed. But we ended up in about 27 bunkers today, which you can't do, and it doesn't take much out here, I guess. But it's definitely an experience I'm going to try to learn from. But right now it hurts a lot, and I just wanted a strong finish. Didn't expect to win, but I expected to play better than this.  
  
  Q. How were you feeling this morning? How did you deal with the long wait?   
 BRENDAN STEELE: The long wait, I had as good a warm up as I could have, was hitting it perfect, chipping it good and putting it good, was ready to rock. I felt great, didn't feel any different than any other tournament, and I just didn't have it.  
  
  Q. You said you're almost shocked, that you didn't see this coming?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: No, not at all. Not at all. I would have been shocked if I would have told me I shot over par today.  
  
  Q. What was the difference between today and the first three?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Didn't hit it in the fairway, and I don't know why, but I didn't hit it in the fairway. I mean, I was in a fairway bunker on every hole.  
  
  Q. When did you feel it started to get away from you a little bit?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: 5. I hit it out of play on 5 because I hit that shot on the green or up there somewhere and make birdie and I'm in the tournament and going fine. But 5 and then again on 13 because I made eagle on 12. Then it started spinning back the other way.  
  
  Q. 15, was that out of bounds or unplayable?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Unplayable. I had to go back.  
  
  Q. Obviously you were doing your own thing there with Keegan, triples and then rallies back. I suppose that doesn't surprise you, that kind of result?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: No, that doesn't surprise me. He's got all the game and all the heart in the world, and that doesn't surprise me at all. Hope to see him win it. That would be fantastic. I'd be super excited for him.  
  
  Q. I know it might be hard to think about it now, but can you take a lot of positives out of this week?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Eventually, not right now. Absolutely not right now. But eventually I can.   
  
  Q. What was it like to be alongside for Dufner's wild ride there on the back?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: You know, I wasn't paying that close attention to what he was doing. I was so far out of it, I was just trying to keep myself together. I'm really disappointed in myself that I couldn't close out 17 and 18 and even just shoot 3- or 4-over. That would have been at least not terrible. But I'm not very happy about those last two holes.  
  
  Q. What lessons can you take from your first major?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: I don't know, because I didn't get ahead of myself, I didn't get -- I didn't start thinking about the results. I did everything that I wanted to do, and it just didn't work out at all. I mean, almost from the start, it was just like big trouble.
