 Q.   Tell me that story one more time.   
BRENDAN STEELE:   So, my caddie is from New Zealand, and he was back there after Mexico, spending time with his family and friends, and it's summer back there, so it's a good time to be there.   And he came back on Sunday night to get, came back to LAX, and they wouldn't let him through Immigration.   
So they treated him kind of like a criminal and turned him around with two guards that made sure that he got on to his plane straight back to New Zealand, and we have got to try to get him sorted out so he can get back here as soon as possible.   
   
 Q.   Did he have ‑‑ what was the snag?   Did he have his papers intact?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah, apparently there's something to do with he's not technically allowed to work for an American, I guess, on the visa that he has.   Which we didn't know.   So he can work for a foreigner in America, but he can't work for an American.  
   
 Q.   An American in America.   
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah.   So some sort of technicality that we didn't, were not aware of.   And we're going to try to get it sorted out.   
So, in the meantime, I've got some buddies covering for me on the West Coast until he can get back.   And hopefully he can get back kind of soon, but.  
   
 Q.   And his name?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   Sam Pinfold.  
   
 Q.   And you have who this week?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   I have Will Farish.   
   
 Q.   And he is a?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   He's an actually a college teammate and he is now LAPD.   And he will be easy to spot, because he's six‑four, 225, and he just laid down his motorcycle so he has a broken wrist.   So he's going to have a cast on his wrist, and a big pink cast on his wrist, so he'll be very easy to spot.   But it should be fun having him out, but we hope that Sam can get back as soon as possible.
