 Q.  Obviously, 9-under par today.  Finished with a birdie.  That had to have felt good.  
BRENDAN STEELE: It's always good to finish with a birdie.  Doesn't matter what you shoot.  Always makes lunch or dinner or whatever taste good, and you feel a little bit better about it.  So it's always nice.   
 Q.  What is it about the golf course that suits your game?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I'm doing a lot of things well right now.   
I'm putting the ball in some pretty good spots.   
I've got a little more length than I had the last time I was here in 2013, so I can cover a few more bunkers.   
So playing the course a little bit differently than I did last time, probably four or five of the holes.  So rolling it really well.  So a good combination.   
 Q.  What is your mindset heading into the weekend here?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I'm trying to be really patient and I'm trying to be really positive this week.   
I had a really nice week going a couple weeks ago, at Frys, and that didn't end up how I wanted it and was pretty bummed last week.  I was kind of almost grieving for Sunday and attitude was really poor and everything.   
So I tried to just really hit the reset this week and get the attitude going and stay positive.   
 Q.  Could you talk a little bit about the work you do for Grandfathers for Golf?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I can.  It's a local charity from where I grew up in the Hemet, San-Jacinto Valley that I've been a part of since basically right when I turned pro.   
 Q.  2005.  
BRENDAN STEELE: 2005.  Yeah.  And what they do is they provide a safe after-school activity for children in lower income areas and that wouldn't necessarily have access to golf.  So, it's just a good way for kids to learn the game and have just a safe activity more than anything.  Introduce everybody to it and give them somewhere to go and a good environment.   
 Q.  How does it kind of change your outlook towards life when you're very involved in a charity like this?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, that kind of stuff is fantastic.  I love the junior growth of the game kind of stuff because it's, I remember what it was like to be a kid and to look up to the guys playing out here and it's huge.  I mean it's really, really important.  It's fun.   
 Q.  So how long has this program been going on?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I think it started when I was in high school.  So it's probably been going about 15 years now.   
 Q.  Any good golfers have come out of the program?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Nobody like on the PGA TOUR or anything.   
 Q.  But getting there?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I think the play's getting better, but it's not really about like becoming a pro out of there, it's more just about kids that wouldn't necessarily get a chance to play getting to play.   
 Q.  How was the experience being kind of an announcer the first day of the U.S. Open?  
BRENDAN STEELE: The U.S. Open?  That was fun.  I've actually hosted Morning Drive for two hours before, too, so I did that in 2011, but it was fun to go on there.   
And it was a little bit different because you're talking about other players' games, so I'm used to talking about my game and I can kind of tell you where I sit, but from an outsider's perspective, you have to be a little bit more objective and a little bit more careful what you say, but it was fun.   
 Q.  So was it the kind of love that you have for the game that kind of prompted you to go there?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I mean just this game gives you a lot of opportunities and you kind of just make the best out of them and that.
