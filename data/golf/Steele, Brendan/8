Q. (On the weather.)
BRENDAN STEELE: It was colder than it was in California. It certainly was. The wind was a little bit more up, and now it's beautiful. Now it's warm and the wind is laying down, so we knew the afternoon was going to be a little bit better, but I think the afternoon is going to be a little bit better tomorrow, too.
Q. 68, that's a really good start considering the conditions.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, overall very good. I was close to having kind of a crazy good round today and had about 15 minutes where everything was going wrong, but other than that, it was great.
Q. What is the difference between California golf and Florida golf?
BRENDAN STEELE: You know, obviously the grass is a huge difference. With the overseed here, it's a little more comfortable in the rough than it is when it's just straight Bermuda, but the first few times that I came to Florida I did not adapt very well. I didn't know how to chip, I didn't know how to putt, I didn't know how to play the grain. I've gotten better over the years. I think this is now my 10th Honda, so being that many times here, I feel a lot more comfortable, and I've learned a lot of things. But it's definitely some big adjustments on the chipping and the putting.
Q. Not fair you've got the sun coming up now, starting to feel warm, and you've been through the trenches. I heard you talking about how the conditions were out there this morning. Are you used to stuff like that? How were you able to play so well?
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, definitely used to stuff like that. You just have to deal with whatever you get. Sometimes you're the hammer, sometimes you're the nail. But I kept trying to tell myself that it's going to be 12 or 13 degrees colder tomorrow morning, so how miserable that would be, that really made me positive about how cold those guys are going to be tomorrow because they're going to have a nice afternoon.
Q. Talk again about the difference between California golf and Florida golf in your eyes.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, chipping and putting is the key. You have to play a lot different shots around the greens. With chipping there's a lot more grain. There's a lot more grain that you have to play as far as speed and break with the putts. Sometimes I get fooled. I think most guys that live here, they have a pretty good sense for it. I have to kind of jump in coming off the West Coast and figure it out quick, but this is my 10th Honda now, and I feel a lot more comfortable here.
Q. Do you go home and watch Brooks and all those guys play the afternoon, or do you just let it unfold and take a look later on tonight?
BRENDAN STEELE: I'll probably watch it a little bit. If it gets windy, I'll watch it. If it doesn't get windy, I don't want to see guys making birdies. That's not very fun.
