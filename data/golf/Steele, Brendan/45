Q.   68 for ten total after three rounds.   Around here that might be the last group a lot of weeks.
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah.   I feel like I'm playing really well.   I guess it would be last group a lot of weeks that a guy is not going to shoot double digits under par in just the 3rd Round.   That's kind of a problem.   But I'm happy with my game and happy with what I'm doing.

Q.   You had a little rough spot there on 11 and 12 today but otherwise you played pretty clean.
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah.   Hit a couple loose shots there, couple mistakes, got a little off the momentum that I had going for ten holes but was able to get it back on 13 and finished pretty strong for the Green Mile.

Q.   18, you had a pretty good shot at making birdie there.
BRENDAN STEELE:   Kind of a tough read.   We got it somewhat right but broke a lot more than we thought.
