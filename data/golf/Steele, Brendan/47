 Q.   You didn't tee off in the third round, talk about the start, stop.   It's been the story of your first three days.   Just talk about that day and what's the hardest part?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   Yeah, it's been a little choppy.   Had a lot of momentum, to kind of end yesterday and didn't really have any to start today.   
So that can be hard to just try to keep building on what you have going good.   You try to recapture it every time you restart, and obviously wanted to get out and play some holes this afternoon.   But the weather has been uncooperative, so excited to play tomorrow, hopefully in some better weather.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever seen it rain like this, and when was the last time?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   No.   I'm a West Coast guy, so when I is he see rain, it's pretty rare but also it's more of just like a constant rain for the day, not anything crazy like this.   This is pretty heavy duty stuff.  
   
 Q.   What's the hardest part on dealing with all the starts and stops and trying to stay consistent in your game?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   Trying to make sure that you're mentally ready to go.   You don't want to be caught off guard by anything.   You want to make sure that when it is ready to go, you're still not in player dining mentally.   That's really the hardest thing is making sure you're always ready to go.  
   
 Q.   What will you do with the extra three or four hours?  
BRENDAN STEELE:   Just get some rest.   Try to rest up for tomorrow, probably eat a lot of food and get a lot of sleep.
