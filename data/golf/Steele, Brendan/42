 Q.  It's obviously a little bit of a disappointment, the 3-putt on the last hole, but that was a really solid day today?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I kind of got started on a 3-putt on No. 2 from about 15 feet for eagle and 3-putted there and 3-putted the last hole, and in the middle I made a ton of putts.  So I guess it's just kind of a crazy game like that.   
 Q.  You've had a good solid season, you're trending in the right direction, what's it going to make a nice run into the playoffs?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I actually feel better about my game going into the playoffs than I have the last few seasons.  Every year I seem to be a little bit sluggish on the way in.  So I'm really excited about the state of my game right now, and I think I can make a charge going into the playoffs.   
 Q.  It was a good round today.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I played really well today.  A little disappointing to make bogey on the last hole, but other than that it was a really good day.   
 Q.  10-under, you would have been happy if you knew that's where you would finish this week?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I think so.  Scores have been a little bit better than I thought they would be.  Obviously some of the guys are playing some great golf, so it's tough to keep up with.  But I think I only made three bogeys and a double for the whole week, and any time you do that in a Major it's pretty good.   
 Q.  What's your schedule like the rest of the year?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I've got next week off and then hit the playoffs hard and hopefully take it all the way to the end of those.   
 Q.  Have you been following the progress of Lahiri and what do you think of him?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I actually haven't gotten the chance to play with him, but see him over here quite a bit these days.  He's highly ranked in the world and he's getting to play a lot and that's great, but look forward to getting a chance to play with him at some point.
