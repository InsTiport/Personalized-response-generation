 Q.  Great opening round.  Hate to use the word easy, we're throwing it around a little bit, but the guys in the studio were calling it gettable out there.  Were you surprised at how gettable it was?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, the weather's been great the last few days, so I think we were expecting a pretty good day out there.   
The greens are rolling perfect, they haven't gotten too firm yet, so it makes sense today, I think.  But you still have to hit the shots.   
 Q.  In terms of the last hole, the 9th hole, your last of the day, it looked from our advantage point like your third shot from 158 almost went in.  Did you think it had a chance?  
BRENDAN STEELE: No, actually I had no idea where it was.  I knew it was a good shot, but I didn't know if it was 10 feet or a foot or what.   
So, yeah, I was really happy to walk over the hill and see actually that it was closer than I even thought.   
 Q.  I know this is a strange question, because after a 65 on this golf course, maybe you shouldn't be working on anything, but are you going to work on anything, take a look at anything between now and your second round?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, actually, I didn't like my speed control on the greens today.  So, and that was one of the things that we actually didn't focus on to start the week.   
So we're going to go and do a little bit of speed putting and just try to keep that dialed in.
