BRENDAN STEELE: Hit some really good shots.  Didn't really miss any fairways or any greens, I don't think.  Maybe one green.  And worked really hard on my putting.  Tried to get that dialed in.  Wasn't very good last week.  Was able to hole some of the putts as well.  Obviously have to go really low.
So, yeah, just comfortable on this course.  Playing a little easier than I ever seen it but the shots are still the same and I was lucky enough to get out there feeling really good.
Q. You only had two approaches that were outside of 16 feet.  One was on a par-5.  Obviously you're feeling dialed in there.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, really dialed in on my numbers.  The ball is going a long ways today but Christian and I had it pretty well figured out.  So, yeah, I mean I had even a lot of other good looks at birdie on most of the other holes.
I think I missed the green on No. 13 and chipped it to like a foot and then I had a couple looks on 15, 16 and 17 that were makeable, definitely for sure.  But, I'm very happy with where I am.
