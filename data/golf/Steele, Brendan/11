THE MODERATOR: Brendan, I know this is a difficult time for you, so appreciate you taking the time to come in. Just thoughts on what just transpired.   
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I mean, obviously super bummed. Held the lead for a long time. Felt like it was kind of mine to win. But I did everything that I could there. There is nothing that I'm upset about. Just didn't quite get it figured out and do it at the right time.   
THE MODERATOR: Questions.   
 Q.  How much does the wait have any affect?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, wasn't helpful. Stood on the for a long time, which was okay because I was kind of collecting myself from 17. I was watching Ryan and trying to figure out what he was doing. I was trying to figure out where he could have possibly hit it, and then I was thinking, oh, he's hit it out of bounds right.   
I was like, well, we don't want to do that. So that wasn't positive at all.   
 Q.  What club did you have on 18, and what lie did you have water wise?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Lie of good, water was fine. I mean, it's just a 2-iron to win a golf tournament. Just a hard shot. Just didn't quite make my best swing there, and still ends up in an okay spot because of where the grandstands are. Hard to get it all the way back there and expect to get it up and down from 65 yards there.   
 Q.  Curious, I can't get a good sense off TV what that lie is exactly like behind the 10th and also a little shot on 18 where looks like it could plop out if you're not careful.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, the lie was actually okay. It's a hard one to get all the way back to the hole since the pin all the way on the back right and I'm on the front left.   
Just visually it's one where you think you hit it hard enough and it ends up being short.   
 Q.  On 10, was that a tough one in terms of distance control?  
BRENDAN STEELE: 10 everything is spinning really hard, so if you land it around the hole even it can spin back off the tier. And then I played the hole six times this week and it's been blowing pretty hard in every day, so I don't really have a gauge for it to be blowing just five miles an hour or whatever it was.   
So it's been playing so long it's been hard to get back there. I think I just overplayed it because of the way it's been the last few days.   
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?   
 Q.  Just want to talk a little bit about the family and the desire. Looks like you got it back. Exciting day for you and the family nonetheless.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, definitely be lying if I said that off season I wasn't a little worried about keeping my card or whether I could compete out here anymore or whatever. To kind of get rid of that this first week and know that I can play well -- when you're playing well you want to play. When you're not it's easy to want to be somewhere else.   
This is definitely going to be motivation for me. Next week we go to my home event, so that's really nice. Have a lot of the friends and family support there, so I'm excited to get there and try to carry some momentum. Hopefully in another better weather conditions. This is not my forte, not what I like.   
The rain is the worst thing for me. When it's blowing 40 I don't really care, and just steady rain is so brutal for me because I never played in it as a kid. Any time it rained we just stayed inside. If I would've drawn out the worst possible day for me, it would be steady rain every day.   
 Q.  And Victoria is getting old enough that she's starting to sense all this, so that's exciting.  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Been taking her out to the golf course, and she runs around and she's got a little plastic clubs she can whack the balls around. It's a lot of fun. She thinks that daddy's job is to go eat peanut M&Ms and chase balls around a chipping greens. She thinks I have it pretty good.   
 Q.  That's what you do, isn't it?  
BRENDAN STEELE: More or less. (Laughter.)   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah. I'm going to play a lot.   
 Q.  Hurry up and get to Phoenix.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time.
