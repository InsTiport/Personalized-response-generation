  Q. Really solid day, talk about the performance today?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Very under control today. Just a lot of good, solid shots. Hit a lot of shots close and made two birdies, and other than that never really got in trouble and just had to make a couple of nice two putts, a couple of one-lags. But it was pretty easy today. For out here, anyway.  
  
  Q. There seems to be a very big premium on accuracy, hitting the fairways, access to the greens; how big has that been for you?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Huge. I've been driving the ball really well and that's why I've been able to put the ball on to the green and just 2-putt and move on most of the time. So if I keep driving it well, I think I'll be in good shape.   
  
  Q. You're in the Top-10 right now, what's the game plan going into tomorrow?   
 BRENDAN STEELE: Just got to try to do the same thing I've been doing, drive the ball in play, be smart with iron shots, and not get in too much trouble and try to hole some putts.
