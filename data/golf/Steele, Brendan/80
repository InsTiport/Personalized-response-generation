  Q. Even par 72. Great round today considering the wind. Just few comments about the round.  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah. It's pretty good today. The course was so narrow that without the wind it's hard enough and when the wind is really blowing any kind shot that gets off line seems to end up in the junk. So, it's a pretty strong golf course.  
  
  Q. What was your strength today, you know, obviously playing with the wind, but what went well for you?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Sure. Everything is pretty good in my game. My short game has improved over the last couple of weeks, and my attitude is a lot better this week after having a week at home to kind of reflect on how the season has kind of gone so far and what I really need to adjust and improve upon.  
  
  Q. Wind supposed to die down pretty significantly tomorrow. You'll be playing late. What do you think about tonight, tomorrow and so forth to kind keep yourself in that momentum?  
 BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah. Just need some rest tonight. I got pretty beat up out there, I think we all kind of did. You know, I'm really just trying to focus on the attitude that I take to the course and just try to execute every shot and, as simple and stupid as it kind of sounds, it's just about staying in the moment and not being too hard on yourself if things don't go your way.
