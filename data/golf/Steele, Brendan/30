Q. One great start to both 9s for you, birdies at 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3.
BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, usually that's helpful.  You know, this course is so comfortable for me.  It's nice to come out in really good conditions and to a place you feel good and get off to a good start.
Q. Quick turn, is that good for you, I mean obviously you're playing well, you go right back out?
BRENDAN STEELE: I didn't want to stop last night.  I might as well keep going this morning.
Q. Play well.
BRENDAN STEELE: Thanks.
