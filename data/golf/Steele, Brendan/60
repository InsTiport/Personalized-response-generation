Q.   Well, not the day today that you had yesterday but all in all a great week.   Top 5 finish.   Gotta be feeling good about the week overall?
BRENDAN STEELE:   Definitely.   I'm really happy with the week overall.   I didn't like how I played today.   I didn't really have what I had yesterday.   Didn't feel very good with the putter.   Holed a couple of long ones.   Wasn't very good in close. 
My iron play wasn't very sharp.   Drove the ball okay.   But overall not as sharp as I was the first three days, Because I really played well the first two days as well, just didn't get as much out of it.

Q.   Point system, like this a lot?
BRENDAN STEELE:   I love it.   Anything that's different is fun to me.   It gets kind of monotonous playing the same thing over and over again.   So it's pretty fun to do something different.   Every putt is worth a little something different. 
So par putts aren't as important out here.   Birdie putts more important.   Eagle putt's even more important.   Bogey putt's very important.   So it just adds a little other dimension.   I think it's perfect for this course as well.
