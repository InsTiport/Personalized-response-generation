 Q.  How did you react when you guys got the text late last night?  
BRENDAN STEELE: Obviously bummed. We all want to play this event, but first and foremost everybody's safety is most important. I was bummed that we had to play yesterday with everything that was going on. I didn't know what had kind of changed from yesterday morning to last night.   
Just disappointment, I think.   
 Q.  How would you describe everything that's gone on with this tournament in particular in the last 24 hours, considering the state of the world right now?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I mean, I think everything that's going on with this tournament and when I've been home and watching TV and everything, it's straight out of a movie. It's like when the zombies have taken over. It's really, really scary.   
 Q.  When is the last time you've ever figured that for the next month, sports, golf, everything is going to take a backseat. Could you have ever scripted a situation like this?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I mean, even when we've had really bad terrorist attacks, we've gotten back to sports pretty quickly to help people heal, so no, I don't think you could have scripted this. This is pretty extraordinary.   
 Q.  For you as a person, what's the most important thing that you want to take care of over the next few weeks?  
BRENDAN STEELE: I just want to get my family home. We're a long way from home being in Florida. We live in California, so just want to get them back and kind of hunker down for a little while and make sure everybody is okay and make sure my family and friends at home are okay and see where we go from there.
