Q. How are conditions out there?BRENDAN STEELE: It's like a major out there right now.  The end of yesterday and today, major championship, for sure.  I didn't play the U.S. Open here, but obviously didn't play the same way that it did this week.  This is full major championship conditions.
Q. Rough finish for you.  Kind of take us through that last hole.BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I didn't make a very good swing off the tee obviously.  Didn't end up in a great spot.  But drew a pretty good lie.  Had a similar lie on No. 12 today can it came out dead left, and it did it again, and I don't really know why it's doing that. I was trying to hit it right and just kind of bounce it on to the green, and get myself a long putt and at least post something.  But it just came out, I mean, 25, 30 yards left of my target for some reason, so I don't know if I just need to work on how to play that shot with that lie or what.  But it happened twice today, and obviously didn't work out.
Q. Got to be happy with your last couple weeks out.  Seem to be heading into the right direction.BRENDAN STEELE: Yeah, I'm really happy with everything I'm doing, because it's funny, you end last week and you feel great and I finished strong and felt really good about it.  And today, I actually felt really comfortable all the way down the stretch but unfortunately didn't hit the shots that I needed on 17 and 18, because I kind of pulled it in the bunker and made a good par on 17 but didn't give myself a putt there, either.  So a little upset about those two.
