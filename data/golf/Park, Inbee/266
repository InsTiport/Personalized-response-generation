  THE MODERATOR:   Four last holes you birdied, so six out of the last seven. 
INBEE PARK:   Yes. 
THE MODERATOR:   Run us through that stretch, your birdies. 
INBEE PARK:   I will go backwards. 
18 out of the bunker, 7‑iron, then about a 10‑footer. 
17, 8‑iron hit to about three feet. 
16, wedge to 15‑footer. 
15 was wedge to 4‑footer. 
13, yeah, another wedge to 4‑footer. 
12, 3‑footer with a wedge. 
THE MODERATOR:   Putter was going.   Greens getting a little slower after the rain.   How did you do reading those? 
INBEE PARK:   I think I play much better in the rain than hot.   I much prefer rain than hot.   The front nine putting was a little bit disappointing, but I gave myself a lot of birdie chances. 
I just waited for the putts to fall and it did on the back nine.   Great round today. 
THE MODERATOR:   Going into the back nine, no birdies in the front nine, were you discouraged? 
INBEE PARK:   That was the way I've been playing the last three days.   I just knew the birdies would come out.   So I just tried to trust myself. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   6‑under today, six birdies on the back nine, suddenly back in contention.   How is it going to be tomorrow?
INBEE PARK:   I mean, this golf course is scoreable and hard at the same time.   I still need a lot of birdies tomorrow I think to win.   I'll just go out there and play aggressive with short‑irons and try to give myself a lot of birdie chances. 

Q.   Is that the plan, to be aggressive and put pressure on?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I try not to think about winning.   I just play my game I've been playing lately. 
I'll just keep trusting myself shot by shot. 
THE MODERATOR:   What did you do during the rain delay? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, just sat down there.   They had food in there, so it was great.   I ate something, tried to have fun. 
THE MODERATOR:   What hole did it get suspended on for you? 
INBEE PARK:   5. 
THE MODERATOR:   Do you think it helped taking a break, regrouping, or just another rain delay? 
INBEE PARK:   It was hard, I mean, because this rain delay was long.   I mean, but I kind of expected this coming to Malaysia.   Everybody had to deal with it. 
THE MODERATOR:   Obviously you're having a great year this year.   Did you have any goals coming into this final stretch the last six or so tournaments? 
INBEE PARK:   My main goal is I'm currently No.1 on the Money List.   I want to finish right there.   I got to finish strong these last few events because a lot of girls are very good.
