  INBEE PARK: Overall, day wasn't too bad, 3‑under. Made a couple short putt misses on the back nine, which was a little bit disappointing. I could have easily got two or threeshots out there today, but it just didn't happen. 
One thing that I'm so satisfied with is I got the points for the Hall of Fame. That was the biggest goal in my career. Everything else is a bonus. I got a bonus.

Q. You fall back after that missed two‑footer at 12. Was that hard to come back from? 
INBEE PARK: Obviously I really wanted to play a bogey‑free round today. Obviously that hole ruined the day. I had a couple of birdies after that. 
No. 17 birdie putt was a big miss too, but it's just that kind of week. I missed a lot of short putts out there this week. I made all of them last week.

Q. No other sport can a player 27years old be in the Hall of Fame. Hat's off to you. 
INBEE PARK: I didn't know if I was going to be able to achieve that honor. It has been‑‑ I look back, it hasn't been that long, I feel like. I achieved so many things. If I don't do it this year, I have to put so much pressure on myself to get to one point. I have to maybe wait all year. I don't know what's going to happen. That definitely put a lot of pressure off of me and I can really enjoy golf even more.

Q. Were you following what Lydia was doing out there?
INBEE PARK: A couple of times, yes.

Q. Do you think this will change your time line at all as to how long you will stay out here, now that you've basically accomplished what every player dreams of?
INBEE PARK: I said the Hall of Fame will be my last goal, but it really came early and I achieved pretty much everything I set so far in my career. There is plenty other goals to set. I will sit down with‑‑

Q. Like what? 
INBEE PARK: Like winning a lot more majors. Annika won so many times. There's so many other things to look at. It has been a fabulous career.

Q. With the million on the line today, were you thinking about that? Did that play a part in the pressure out there today? 
INBEE PARK: To be honest, I really wanted to do ‑‑ get the points for the Hall of Fame. I thought the money was out there, definitely. 
The Hall of Fame was really on my mind all this week. I think I got too nervous like the last five or six holes coming in. Going into the Hall of Fame is something I've been dreaming off all of my life. I got a little bit nervous and missed a couple of short ones.

Q. Because you sensed you might have been ahead of Lydia enough to win? 
INBEE PARK: Yeah, my dad told me yesterday I needed to shoot one shot better than Lydia today. I was trying to play good out there today.

Q. This is one of the hardest to play because of all of this? 
INBEE PARK: I think so. This is I think probably the most pressure I ever felt, yeah. 

Q. Really? 
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think so. Because this is something I really, really want. The more you want it, the more pressure you feel. I really wanted to be in the Hall of Fame. That's what I've been really dreaming of. It's a dream come true.

Q. What's next? Do you go home and eat bon bons next week?
INBEE PARK: I have a tournament next week. It's the KLPGA players versus the LPGA players, like a match play. I'm ambassador for the tournament.

Q. Where is that?
INBEE PARK: It's in Korea.

Q. The Japanese Tour?
INBEE PARK: It's the Korean Tour versus LPGA Tour. The Korean girls and the LPGA players. 

Q. What it's called?
INBEE PARK: It's Champions Trophy.

Q. Is that new?
INBEE PARK: It's new this year. 

Q. You were really thinking that the‑‑ that was your main focus today because the Player of the Year, if you win you knew you get in the Hall of Fame. 
INBEE PARK: I thought any one of them would be nice. But I thought that is probably the easiest out of the four or five things that was going on. 
Obviously, I mean, it's not easy to play better than Lydia, but I was able to do it today. 

Q. When you think back on your journey, moving to America as a young girl to further your golf, you getting in the Hall of Fame, does that cause you to think back? 
INBEE PARK: Oh, yeah, there's so many times I felt homesick coming to America at such a young age. I had a great junior career in America, learned so many things in America. Obviously being in the LPGA Tour was a thrill. It's going to be another big career coming in. I think it has been‑‑ I really enjoyed myself out here. 
SometimesI ‑‑ there's a few times I really wanted to maybe quit golf and live a normal life. There was a few times that golf was getting really hard. But obviously I was able to work on all of that and to be where I am.

Q. It's almost like you had two careers up to the U.S. Open, first win and then this slump and then after, right? 
INBEE PARK: Yeah, yeah.
