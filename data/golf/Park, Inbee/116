 Q. How did it go out there today?   
INBEE PARK: Not so bad out there today. Just got off to a slow start and made a couple birdies coming in. I only chipped once today. I hit a lot of greens and fairways, just couldn't putt. These Bermuda greens got me again. I haven't putted that well on Bermuda greens. I feel like I hit a lot of good putts, but just lipped the edges and a little bit off on the pace. I need to work on the putter a little bit and I think it should be good.  
   
 Q. How many days do you ever say I just couldn't putt today?  
INBEE PARK: Actually quite many times this year, I think.  
   
 Q. Are you glad you are playing alongside your competition this first round?   
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it's exciting. I think we played together in Singapore earlier this year. We didn't get to play that often, not as much as everybody else. So it was exciting. Would have been nice if we made a lot more birdies out there. It would have been more fun, but it was a little more of a slower day on the greens. Hopefully I can make some putts.  
   
 Q. What happened on 1? Did you pull that shot or hit the wrong club there?   
INBEE PARK: No. I pulled the shot a little bit.
