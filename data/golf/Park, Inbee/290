  Q. 72 in the final round.   
 INBEE PARK: Uh-huh.  
  
  Q. What are your impressions? How do you feel?  
 INBEE PARK: Oh, I think I play very good today except for just couple three-putts out there. Greens are really tough to putt.   
 I just, you know, a little bit disappointed with, you know, finish I had, but overall the tournament was great. I was really being patient with all these delays.   
 Yeah, I'm happy that I finished today.  
  
  Q. Yeah, talk a little bit about the delays. Obviously there were a ton and you didn't know when you were going to finish or when you were going to play. How does that affect you on the golf course?  
 INBEE PARK: It was really tough to concentrate because you were stopping and then you start again and stop. I think it was just a matter of concentration to get it back on. We pushed it in the dark, but we finished it. So I'm happy with it.   
  
  Q. Did someone get a quick tee shot off there?  
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, we did. Hee Kyung hit a tee shot quick so we could finish.  
  
  Q. I know the weather conditions changed dramatically, especially after the restart. It was windier. How did that affect you?  
 INBEE PARK: Last few holes it was really windy and tough conditions out there. Made some good up-and-downs and just happy with it.  
  
  Q. What's going to be your main takeaway from this week going into the future?  
 INBEE PARK: The U.S. Opens I think I've got to putt a little bit better. My ball striking is really good, so I think this tournament gave me a lot of confidence that I could play good in this tough conditions. So maybe I will do maybe better next time.
