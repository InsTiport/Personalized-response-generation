Q.   A statement win for you guys.   How important was it to get the first two points up for Team Korea to make this comeback win here today?
INBEE PARK:   I mean, obviously we need to win a lot of matches today to actually have a chance.   So the first match is very important because if we lose the first match, it kind of gives everybody else kind of know what to play for.   So I think it was important to win the first match and it kind of gives everyone hope and some energy to play well.

Q.   A huge matchup between you and Caroline.   You've seen Caroline play so well in Solheims.   You knew it was going to be a huge matchup for you.   How tough were you expecting her to play today?
INBEE PARK:   Yesterday I knew I was going to be playing against Sweden, but I didn't know which player I was going to get.   But I was like saying to my teammates, you know, Just hopefully not Caroline.   But that's who I got today and I knew it was going to be a touch match, so I played all I got and I played well today. 

Q.   So Yeon yesterday said heading up to the playoff yesterday the most nerves she's ever felt.   Talk about the pressure here this week and how nervous you guys have felt.   It's a different environment rather than big tournaments and Major tournaments.   Talk about how the pressure's mounted for you guys and how you've been able to deliver. 
INBEE PARK:   I think it's a great atmosphere and it's obviously a little bit different of the nerves that we're playing with because we never really got to play the team events like this.   So many people came out and watched.   It's just country versus country, not just yourself. 
So, yeah, I think it was something very new and special.   And I love this format and I think it was a lot of fun this week. 

Q.   You guys have quite the following out here.   We have all the Korean flag headbands, a lot of cheering, a lot of loud cheers on the first tee for you guys.   How special was it to be able to play well this week, make it to Sunday, and play well for your fans and your country back home?
INBEE PARK:   I think it is huge because everybody expected us going into the finals, but we actually did it the hard way.   Actually, in having a chance to go at it on the final day was huge.   I think if we didn't play the last day, I think that what would all these Korean people do because there's so many people that came out here to watch us.   So I think it's actually good to give them something to cheer for.
