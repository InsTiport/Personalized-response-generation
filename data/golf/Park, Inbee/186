  INBEE PARK:   Yeah, having in a good of a start here, you can't mess it up here.   The first four holes are toughest.   Yeah, the I still left a couple out there but a very good ball‑striking day.   Today gave me a lot of confidence going into tomorrow because the first two days I didn't feel like my ball‑striking was there enough, but today gave me confidence going into tomorrow.
COLIN CALLANDER:     You said the other day your ball striking this season has been very good and the putting has been letting you down a little bit.   Has it improved as the week has gone on? 
INBEE PARK:   It felt like it has improved a little bit.   The last couple tournaments I had, I didn't really putt well but this tournament‑‑ I'm also missing short ones but I'm also holing ten‑, 15‑footers.   So just trying to avoid 3‑putting tomorrow and I'm in good shape. 
COLIN CALLANDER:   Are you using same putter as last year? 
INBEE PARK:   No, different putter.
COLIN CALLANDER:   So what did you do with the good one? 
INBEE PARK:   It's at home.   I like to try different putters when it's not working, refresh my mind.   Nothing's wrong with the putter but it has been a struggle this year with the putter.   So, yeah, I just wanted to have something new and fresh. 

Q.   Has that one putter won all three majors?
INBEE PARK:   Yes.   Should I go back to that putter?   (Laughter).

Q.   What's the secret to scoring well around here? 
INBEE PARK:   I think you just have to start it well.   Don't lose too many shots on the first four holes, five holes.   If you're 1‑over par through four or five it's okay because you have opportunities coming up on the finishing holes.
But obviously I got off to a better start today and playing the par 5s, you have to take advantage of the par 5s here and not be in too many fairway bunkers. 
COLIN CALLANDER:   Can we go over the details? 
INBEE PARK:   The first, I hit 7‑iron into about 15 feet. 
No.2 was 8‑iron about 15 feet. 
4 was 6‑iron to about another 15 feet. 
6 was six‑foot.
8 was 3‑putt from 15 foot. 
12 was like 30‑footer with an 8‑iron. 
14 was 8‑iron, 3‑putt from maybe 30‑footer.
17 was about five feet, four feet, made that one. 

Q.   Charley Hull had four 2s today?
INBEE PARK:   Really. 

Q.   When was the last time you birdied all the short holes? 
INBEE PARK:   I don't know if I've ever done that before.   I really can't remember last time I did it.   I remember doing three of them but I don't remember four of them.   I had two today. 

Q.   Can you talk about coming in here under the radar; is that strange to you, given all of the experience last year, that the spotlight has shifted considerably this year? 
INBEE PARK:   It's somewhat weird, awkward, but I didn't mind that.   I didn't mean having three days feel like this is a normal tournament.   I didn't have much pressure.   Really just try to play my own golf.   Yeah, I start to feel a little bit of pressure from now and tomorrow, but I'd rather be having the pressure than not being in contention. 

Q.   Along the same lines, have you enjoyed this year more than last year, would you say? 
INBEE PARK:   At this tournament‑‑ I definitely enjoyed it last year as well but this year has just been a little bit different to last year.
Last year I enjoyed it and having pressure and experiencing something I never have experienced before.   It's really different.   If I end up winning tomorrow, I definitely enjoy this year better.
COLIN CALLANDER:   You got unlucky with the weather last year whereas this year‑‑
INBEE PARK:   It's just really consistent this year.   Morning, afternoon, didn't really matter this year. 

Q.   You said you could see improvements in your game and I know putting has been off this year, but can you just expand on what has improved? 
INBEE PARK:   My swing is just getting more consistent and hitting the ball a lot better.   Obviously I got a lot of confidence from my ball‑striking last year.   Everything is just maturing and having a lot of experience, it really helps me going through on the golf course. 
And yeah, I have been in different positions of winning last year, and this year, when I have an opportunity and when I know I have an opportunity‑‑ yeah, I think I'm a little more mature player than I am last year. 
COLIN CALLANDER:     Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.
