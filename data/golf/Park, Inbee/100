Q. Great opening round, you were really dropping some bombs out there weren't you?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, everything went really well out there.  Especially I dropped some good putts today, so this way, I was able to shoot a low round and it's always good to have a good round like this before going into a major.
Q. Now, you mentioned the major.  For major season, the tournament before, what are your goals to prepare for that major?
INBEE PARK: You know, just nothing so special, but just want to have all the game physically and mentally.  You know, you want your game to be ready for next week.  It's just the last test before the majors of the just trying to test out some shots and try to get some confidence.
Q. When you have your putter going like you do, that has to give you a tremendous amount of confidence, doesn't it?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, greens weren't as bumpy as what I thought it would be.  The greens are actually in much better shape than in previous years.  So I was quite comfortable on the greens today, and obviously getting some confidence on the greens was huge.
Q. You've played well here before, fifth last year, tied for sixth in 2014.  What is it about this course that you like?
INBEE PARK: It's not like wide open and it doesn't need like long, long drive shots.  You've just got to be a little bit accurate and you've got to drop some putts.  Obviously greens can really frustrate you on this golf course, but if you get over with the greens here, I think you can score.
