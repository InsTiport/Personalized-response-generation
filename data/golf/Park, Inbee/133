  INBEE PARK:   I hit a lot of greens but not really close.   Irons just weren't as pure as I thought it would be.   Missed couple putts here and there.  
Only two birdies and one bogey.   Not a bad start.   Still got three more days.  
   
 Q.   You rolled that last one in pretty nicely.   You talked about it yesterday.   I think your putting has been shaky.   Did you feel better about it today?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, it was wasn't too bad.   Nothing was like really great but nothing was really bad.   It was like a so‑so round today.  
   
 Q.   They're talking about hot temperatures tomorrow.   Is that going to help going off in the afternoon tomorrow?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it was a little bit chilly this morning and ball wasn't flying as far, so it was kind of hard to judge the distance this morning.  
But obviously with the hot weather the ball kind of flies and a little firmer if it didn't rain tomorrow.   
  
Q.You said a so‑so round, but nice to finish strong heading into Friday.   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, always great to finish with a birdie.   Haven't seen the ball dropping in the hole for a while, and then No. 18 putt just fell.   Felt so good finishing like that.  
   
 Q.   Feel better that no one is really running away with this?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, nobody has had a great, great round.   Golf course is playing long with the rain we've got, so we're not hitting like wedges into the greens.   
So we're not getting that many opportunities for birdies.   Trying to get some birdies here and there, that'll be the key.  
   
 Q.   Did it help with the trees being gone today?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I (indiscernible) with the trees gone.   I had a good drive there, yeah.
