Q. The wind and rough, how difficult was it out there today?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, last 12 holes or so we played in the wind.  It has been like that last couple days.  Wind picked up in the afternoon and it was kind of expected.
But course plays really tough.  It wasn't easy out there.  Especially coming into No. 5 -- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  Really tough holes.
Even par on the back nine for me is pretty good.  Hopefully I can go out there tomorrow on a calmer day and play a little bit better.
