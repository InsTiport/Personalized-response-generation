Q. Inbee, obviously disappointed not getting this win.  But you won your first of seven major titles ten years ago, your last one back in 2015.  A couple years ago we thought we'd seen the last of Inbee Park.  Being back in this position, how motivated are you to continue to do what you've done on the LPGA Tour and write records in the history books?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I'm really satisfied with the way I'm playing this year, and even if I didn't win today, I felt like I put up a good play this week all week.  Even in the playoffs I didn't make much mistakes, but I just couldn't make the putts.  The morning greens were a little bit slower than I anticipated, I hit a couple putts short.  I had a couple of opportunities.  But I'm a little bit disappointed, but I'm really happy the way I played this week.
Q. Anybody who has watched you play over the years, including people who work for Golf Channel, Judy Rankin has mentioned it several times, you're one of the great putters in the history of the game.  To make the putts that you did yesterday, how do you keep doing that year after year, when you're not playing as much these days?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I don't know, but it just happened.  Especially on No. 17th hole, I really thought that I had to make that putt.  Yeah, I think I made a great putt there.  I probably should have made the birdie on No. 18, but it just didn't happen.  So, I mean, it's just the putt Pernilla made on the last was a champion's putt.  You really can't beat that.
Q. You know what it's like to win that very first major title as you watch Pernilla and the excitement.  How happy are you for her?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I'm really happy for her.  This one was not an easy major win for her as well.  I mean, 8-hole playoff, I've never done something like that before either.  So, sure, she'll have a great future and a great championship.  Congratulations to her.
