Q. Well-played, a sweet 66 on Sunday.  How special to finish in style, seven birdies on the scorecard?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it was a really good day out there today.  Especially with playing this golf course with no wind was really different.  But I was able to execute a lot of birdies, so I'm really happy with the round today, especially my putter really worked well today.  So, happy with that.
Q. How do you reflect on the week overall?
INBEE PARK:   Well, first day was quite disappointing, but except for that, I think I played pretty well from the second round on.  A lot of positives to take on from this week, and again, it's my husband's first week in a major championship, and posting a Top-10 finish for him is a really nice thing to do.
Fought really well because after the first day, I really wanted to give up.  I didn't give up, but I think that's why I'm here today.
Q. How are the final few holes playing?
INBEE PARK:   The back nine is playing really long, because it's usually downwind, but it's playing long.  At the same time, there's no wind.  It's long.  But I've made a couple of birdies coming in, but it is good to finish with pars, I should say that.
