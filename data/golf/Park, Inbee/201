Q.   How would you assess how things went for you today? 
INBEE PARK:   Today was probably a little bit disappointing today.   The pin positions were very tough for the first day.   Half of the pins, we couldn't go at the pins.   There were very tough pins out there.   I just didn't give myself a lot of opportunities.   Obviously, the opportunities I had, I didn't make the putts.   So it took me a while to make a birdie.   Birdie on the 18th, so it's just hopefully a better day tomorrow, and hopefully I can hole some putts tomorrow.

Q.   How frustrating is it knowing the success you've had here a year ago that you just couldn't get it going in what seemed like pretty good conditions? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, there was no wind; it was perfect scoring conditions today.   Just the pins were a little bit tough, but obviously I could have shot under par out there, but just a few putts didn't go in.   I need to hit more fairways, and more greens, and got to hole some more putts.

Q.   You said that you're really pleased with your ball striking this year, kind of waiting for your putter to get hot.   How is your putter coming along? 
INBEE PARK:   It wasn't a good putting day to day, obviously.   I tried a new putter today, and I'm trying.   First time I tried the thick grip was last week on Sunday.   I felt comfortable over it.   I tried it this week, and obviously today wasn't the best putting day, but I haven't been putting good with any putter, so I'm just going to try to stick with this putter.   Yeah, I just don't know what is wrong.   It just doesn't seem to like the hole. 
The way I'm striking the ball, I'm still pretty happy with the way I'm striking the ball.   Not as good as last week.   Last week was probably like very good ball striking, 100% out of 100.   So this week, even last year here I struck the ball well, but I'm probably striking the same way this year, but the putting is the difference.

Q.   So you're using a new putter today for the first time? 
INBEE PARK:   I used it last Sunday.

Q.   Where did you get it?   Did you pull it out of the closet? 
INBEE PARK:   I actually got one this week, earlier this week.

Q.   Tee to green you feel like everything's okay? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it looks all right.   Just like ten footers, within ten‑footers, you know.   I tend to hole maybe two or three a day during last year's rounds.   But this year I'm lucky if I make one within five feet.   So, it's just hard when you can't pull anything, and obviously you're going to the green you're very good.   You're striking the ball well.   But on the green every time you're disappointed.   So it's just hard to get that rhythm going for 18 holes. 
Obviously, with the good ball striking, you have to make one or two mistakes.   That gives me a bogey, so that's just very tough to get it up‑and‑down because my putting is not going.

Q.   Did you use the same putter for all three of your major wins last year? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.

Q.   What was it? 
INBEE PARK:   A Sabertooth, Odyssey, yeah.

Q.   How many have you used since then? 
INBEE PARK:   How many putters have I used? 

Q.   Yeah. 
INBEE PARK:   I've used a couple.   I've tried a couple other putters.

Q.   Last year? 
INBEE PARK:   Last year to this year, yeah.   Later in the year, yeah.

Q.   What are you using right now? 
INBEE PARK:   Right now is a Jailbird.

Q.   Is it just a matter of well, it's not really working so I'm going to try another one?   Is it sort of just searching for one that works? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I'm just searching for one that works because I haven't really been putting well for a while.   I'm just not comfortable over that putter, so I just wanted to change.   Yeah, so hopefully it gives me a little different feeling and a little bit of confidence with the other putter.
