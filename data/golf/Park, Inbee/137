  INBEE PARK: My ball striking wasn't really there.  I missed a lot of fairways and greens on the first round, but putting was really good.  So I'm satisfied with my putting.  I've just got to work on my ball striking a little bit for next few days and hopefully I can hit a lot more fairways and greens.   Q.  Your position is good, right?  You don't have a lot of people in front of you?  INBEE PARK: It's a good score for the first round definitely.  It's only the first round in a major tournament.  Under par is always good.  Still have a lot of golf to play.   Q.  How do you like the golf course?  How does it set up for you?  INBEE PARK: It's long.  It's wet.  It's soft and long.  I mean, I would like for it to be running a little bit further and playing a little bit shorter.  I'm not the longest hitter.  This is the softest green that I have ever played in the U.S. Open for a while.  It's different and the greens are tricky.  They are softer, have a lot of spike marks and they are slower.  It's really different.  It definitely has some tough side of it.  We've got to hit a lot of long clubs in it and that's the tough part.
