  Q. With the group of girls right there at -10, pretty solid after the first two rounds?  
 INBEE PARK: Yes, I had a really good two rounds. I hit the ball very well. Gave a lot birdie chances out there and made a lot of them.  
 Yesterday I was putting really good, but today I was hitting the ball really good. So I think the combination of really good the last two days.  
  
  Q. Was it more difficult to hit the ball well today with the wind?  
 INBEE PARK: Um, well, it was actually windy yesterday afternoon, too. It was a little more windy this morning, but wind didn't really bother me.
