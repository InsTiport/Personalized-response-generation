Q. Sum up your day for us, Inbee.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was solid day today.  I made couple of mistakes, but felt pretty good over the putter.  I made a lot of putts.
Obviously I could have reduced mistakes, couple of mistakes out on the greens, but I'm pretty happy with the round today.
Q. You birdied the first hole, right?
INBEE PARK: Uh-huh.
Q. Any sense of picking up where you left off?
INBEE PARK: I had very good momentum until about No. 11, and then I had a couple of bad holes.
I finished up strongly.  No.  17 was just a mistake with a three-putt on the green.  I missed green on No. 13, the par-3, No. 13 or 14.
Yeah, didn't get up and up and down.  Easy chip, but didn't get up and down from there.  Couple mistakes, but overall play was good.
Q. Three-putts are probably so unusual for you.  For you is that worse than maybe hitting a ball off line?
INBEE PARK: I think it can happen.  I mean, I feel like I hit two good putts, but second putt was just little less -- I should have hit it a little harder, but did the 360 degree lip out.
Wasn't far.  About two, three feet.  Just unlucky.
