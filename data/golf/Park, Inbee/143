Q.   Obviously you saw the two hole‑outs by Sei Young.   What did you think on the first one to force the playoff, and then obviously the hole‑out for her to win it?
INBEE PARK:   Obviously wasn't impossible to make that chip obviously.   It wasn't impossible.   It was not that hard of a chip.   To be able to do it in that kind of situation, I really definitely give her that.   She had a great chip. 
Obviously the playoff, I just got to say luck was on her side.   I just tried my best today.   Obviously on the back nine I was a little bit disappointing.   Couple of short birdie putt misses, 13 and 14, and I think that was my mistake for today.
1‑over on the back nine is not that great, so... 

Q.   Then the conditions today, windy, not a lot of rounds under par today.   What was it like playing out there? 
INBEE PARK:   You know, just getting so used to the wind here.   It doesn't really bother me anymore because you kind of expect the wind. 
Obviously it's hard, like certain short putts, because it's really hard to concentrate.   But I think it's just getting used to it.   It was tough out there, but I definitely could have done better today.   Couple shots. 

Q.   What did you learn about Sei Young as a player today?   Obviously takes a lot of stones to knock in those two shots at the end. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, the last round she played‑‑ it wasn't her best day today obviously.   She made some mistakes.   Obviously able to chip in and hole‑out from there, she's a good player.   She's already won twice this year and she has definitely proven herself that she can compete out here.
She's a great player; I think she's a great fighter.

Q.   What you do you take out of this week going into San Francisco?   You'll have a chance to probably be able to take No. 1 back. 
INBEE PARK:   I feel like my game is in really good shape.   I'm hitting the ball great.   I just need to putt a little bit better. 
The short ones I missed today, and I missed probably five or six of them all week this week.   If can improve on my putting a little bit, I think I can win.
