INBEE PARK: (In progress.)...just a couple putts that could have gone in but didn't go in.  Hopefully many more to drop next three days.
Q. Just walking around the course it's incredible how many Korean fans that made the trip.  How does it feel to play in front of those guys?
INBEE PARK: Maybe we are very used to seeing a lot of Korean fans anywhere we go.  We have very good supportive fans all over the world and they love golf.  Obviously the women's Korean golfer has been playing great golf all over the world.  So Really part of my (indiscernible) obviously fans that are rooting for us.
Q. For some of our readers that might not understand, can you just explain just how big women's golf is in south Korea as at the moment?
INBEE PARK: I wouldn't say it's the biggest sport in Korea.  I think still like the soccer and baseball are probably the bigger sports in Korea than golf.
But we have a lot of the good fans in women's golf.  I think it's bigger than men's golf in Korea.  I think that just kind of explains a little bit of difference than other countries.  I don't know why, but I think it's because we have been playing very well in the world and becoming No. 1 player in the world.
I think that really helped it.
Q. How do you feel about the round today?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, started a little bit bad today, but I had good birdies in the middle of the round.  Obviously last hole bogey was a little bit disappointing.  Except for that, I think everything went quite smoothly.
Evian Golf Course is not easy golf course.  I made three bogeys today.  Even though I shot 3-under par, there was a lot of mistakes.  I think I got to focus on making little less mistakes over next three days.
