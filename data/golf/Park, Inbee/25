 Q.  Here with Inbee Park. She's atop the leaderboard. Inbee, how confident are you in your game at the moment?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was a really good day out there, especially my ball striking was flawless today. I didn't make any mistakes. I wish my putter could have followed up a little bit better, especially the three-putt on the last was a little bit disappointing.   
Overall, playing was pretty good, especially my ball striking. I was really satisfied.   
 Q.  I know going into today there was some pickup to the wind, some of the holes a little longer. What was the mindset going into this third round?  
INBEE PARK: When it gets windy, the starting holes -- first of all, starting holes are very tough on this golf course, so you have to make maybe a couple of up and downs in the beginning and try to not lose any shots in the beginning, which I did really well. Yeah, I played really solid golf for the last three days. I'm really happy with that.   
 Q.  We said it all week, but this is your first start in January since 2016. What would it mean to you to win in your first start of the 2020 season?  
INBEE PARK: I think it would mean a lot, especially it would give me so much confidence going into this season. Getting off to a hot start is always a really, really good sign for the season. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind tomorrow, and hopefully I have another good ball striking day tomorrow.   
 Q.  Are you any less confident heading into tomorrow after bogeying 18?  
INBEE PARK: Well, it's always disappointing to finish with a bogey, but I kind of thought that make a bogey today and maybe not make any bogeys tomorrow. I think that can really give me some motivation or something that I don't need to think about, like I'm not making any bogeys until now or until then, now I've already made it. So I think I'll just go ahead and make some birdies tomorrow.   
 Q.  You're approaching the top 25 in career wins and you're only 31 years old. Would a win tomorrow show that you have no signs of slowing down?  
INBEE PARK: I think it will definitely give me a lot of confidence. Since I turned 30, having a win in my 30s would be definitely big for me. Yeah, I have one more day, and I feel good about my game. So hopefully I can keep this going.   
 Q.  How well do you know Sei Young now? What do you think of that pairing with her?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I've played with Sei Young a few times. I played with her in a playoff as well, and I've played with her a few times before and after that. Yeah, she's a very aggressive player, and she -- it feels like she likes Florida golf courses. I mean, she won Naples last year. She's a very aggressive player, and she can make a lot of birdies. I'll just try to keep that in mind and try to follow up with her.   
 Q.  In the off-season, did you just kind of look in the mirror and say, okay, I'm going for it this next year? How did your motivation come out?  
INBEE PARK: I didn't do anything really special in this off-season to prepare for this season. I did everything the same every season I go into. It is an important season this year, but I'm just trying to treat it as nothing special. Playing more events, but except for that, I'm just trying to play some good golf, and hopefully that gets me where I want to.   
 Q.  How hard is it to lead the first event of the season? Do you feel more exhausted or rusty?  
INBEE PARK: I don't think there's anything hard about it. I think the better you play, the better it is. Try to get some good golf in early, that's always really good. Starting with a birdie on the front nine, it always feels good to start like that and maybe feel a little less rusty.
