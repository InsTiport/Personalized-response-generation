 Q.  Sum up your first two days.  
INBEE PARK: I wasn't able to make as many birdies, but it's just matter of how many putts you drop.  Obviously the mistake on the last wasn't great, but I'm only halfway done.  A lot more golf left.   
 Q.  The things you talked about, having the time off and your perspective changing, at any point did winning become almost more relief because you were supposed to win, or maybe now winning will feel like that joyful thing again?  Or not really?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think I can say that, because I think I get more appreciative of what I am doing and what I am achieving.   
Yeah, I mean, the win in Singapore definitely felt much more happier than other wins I had.  I think it's because I had to overcome some tough tasks and tough times, too.   
I think you get to realize a lot of things after you go through some tough moments.
