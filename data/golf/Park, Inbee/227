Q.   How did you play? 
  INBEE PARK:   I just putted really bad today.   Inside of that everything else was really similar, but nothing seems to be going.   I gave myself eight birdie chances out of nine holes on the back nine and nothing went in.   So just a bad putting day, nothing else.
Q.   You said yesterday you felt like your putting was coming around? 
  INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, last week I felt like I was hitting bad putts.   But today, even I hit good putts, but it just didn't go in, really burning the edges or a just a little bit off speed.   But I'm feeling good about my stroke, and much better than last week.
Q.   What happened on number 1? 
  INBEE PARK:   Number 1, I went into the right bunker, and I had a sideâ€‘hill lie.   It came up short of the green.   I had a really bad lie.   My feet were in the bunker, and I just don't want bad bunker shots.
