 Q.   How does it feel to be the two‑time Wegmans LPGA champion?  
INBEE PARK:   It definitely feels a big honor to actually put my name on the trophy for twice and obviously to defend my title.   I think I've been in too many playoffs lately.   Yeah, feel very exhausted.  
Yeah, I played good today, especially coming in number 17 and 18 I holed really good putts.   I think that put me in the playoff and actually have an opportunity.   
Just very happy to be part of the history, and yeah we'll be missing Rochester.  
   
 Q.   What was going through your mind as you saw Brittany Lincicome bogey on the 18 hole and you found a chance to win the trophy?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I knew 18 was a tough hole, but obviously Brittany is a long hitter, and she just less club into the greens like that, and she'd probably make a par and I probably didn't get an opportunity, but I was just lucky that I got an opportunity and actually made that a win.  
   
 Q.   Drawing back on last year's experience in the playoffs.   I know it's a different course, but you're experienced in this in a major.   How much did that play to your advantage?  
INBEE PARK:   I didn't feel that nervous at all today when I was just playing the final round, but once I got to the tee on the playoff hole, I just felt the nerves right away, and kind of it was like a replay of last year.   And experience definitely helped me out, and I think I was able to stay calm.  
   
 Q.   How were you able to overcome 7 after you hear the explosion on 8 you had to back off your ball and then you missed that putt.   How did you overcome that?  
INBEE PARK:   I think, you know, No. 8's been the most disappointing moment of today for me.   I think it wasn't‑‑ three‑putt wasn't really necessary at all, but yeah, I mean just a little bit of disappointment, but you gotta forget about it and just kind of move on.  
   
 Q.   Do you feel you can dominate the rest of the year?  
INBEE PARK:   I mean I have been playing very good golf the last month or so.   So hopefully I can keep this going.  
I mean I still feel like last year's putter, that's really tough to beat.   I gotta work really hard to beat last year's putter.   So yeah, I'll keep working hard and see if I can do it again.  
   
 Q.   Congratulations, Inbee.   How disappointed you were in losing the British.   What does this mean now to come back and win this one?  
INBEE PARK:   Obviously I've been waiting for British Open all year, and I actually got an opportunity in the final round, but I wasn't able to do it, and obviously having a very poor Back 9 was really disappointing, and I really wasn't able to forget about the tournament for a while.  
Yeah, I mean I think after this tournament I can kind of feel free and kind of forget about the tournament a little bit.  
   
 Q.   After last week, losing in a playoff, to come back the next week and win in a playoff for a major championship, how much were you focused on that when you found out you were in a playoff?  
INBEE PARK:   I almost felt like I was getting used to playing in playoff because I was in it last week, I was in it this week.   It didn't happen last week, so hopefully I was thinking maybe it didn't happen last week, so hopefully this one is coming in.   Obviously experience really helped me a lot.   Last year I went to playoff here and last week, and I've been in just a lot of playoffs.   So yeah, I felt more comfortable.
