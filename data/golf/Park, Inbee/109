 Q.  You looked so comfortable out there, you must love Serapong?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think I really like this golf course.  I have been playing really well here.  Obviously today was another great day.  My game needs to sharpen up a little bit more but today was actually a really great day and gives me a lot of confidence going into the next three days.   
 Q.  What aspects are you hoping to sharpen up?  
INBEE PARK: I think I'm still a little bit rusty from taking so much break in the off-season.  But obviously today's round is the best round yet of the season.  I hit the ball best out of all the rounds that I've played all year, and obviously I putted best out of all the rounds I played this year.   
Hopefully that's a really good sign.  I just want to keep building my confidence up for the next three days.  It will be good if I can hold the trophy at the end of the tournament, but if not, what matters to me is just building up the confidence.   
 Q.  You're beautifully placed after round one.  How big were the birdies on 13 and 14?  They were quite a long way off.  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, today it seems like I was making the long putts but because I wasn't putting my iron shots like really close today, I was more like 15-, 20-footer.  That's why I said I need to sharpen up a little bit of my iron shots, because it wasn't that far but I wasn't able to put it inside ten feet.  It was more like 15-, 20-footers, and I was lucky enough to make a lot of those today.  But I'd like to hit it a lot closer the next three days.   
 Q.  And 88 holes without a bogey and finally one came today at 17.  Heartbreaking?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was going to come at some point.  It's actually nice to get it over with today and without playing with it for the next three days.  It was a good round.  To make a bogey is disappointing, but it happens.
