INBEE PARK: Four rounds been pretty similar.  Ball striking was pretty good.  Just around the greens wasn't getting the feel yet.
And the putting was a little bit disappointing this week, obviously.  I'm just going to try to stay patient and, yeah, it's going to drop at some point.
Q. Feeling pretty good?  Feeling healthy?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I feel pretty good.  That's really the most important thing, I guess.  I'm ready to play now.  Yeah, it's all good.
