  Q. You said you came here this week to get some reps and warm up.  Are you warm now?
 INBEE PARK:   I'm actually really cold right now.  Yeah, but I actually, yeah, it was a great week this week.  It was my first week back out in three months or so, and I played so good.  I mean, I couldn't believe how I was doing out there this week.
 And like I said, I thought this week was just kind of a preparation for next week, but I exceeded so much more.  I'm just really happy that I played well this week.
 Q. Of your 21 wins, this is your first ever truly wire-to-wire victory.  Is there a different kind of pressure playing the final round...
 INBEE PARK:   Yeah, you know, I really thought that I felt some pressure today, especially the back nine when I kind of knew that I had a little bit of cushion, but I still felt some kind of pressure somehow.  I don't know why, because I knew that I had quite a bit of cushion.
 Yeah, felt some pressure and made a couple mistakes.  But 16 eagle is obviously a great eagle that really had a big relief for me.
 Q. 21 wins, tied the late Marilynn Smith for 25th in all-time wins.  Now, you're only four behind Se Ri Pak as the winningest player in the republic of Korea.  How big a goal of is that is yours?
 INBEE PARK:   Well, you know, she's somebody that I always looked up to when I was growing up, and obviously she's always big in my heart.  Trying to follow her footstep is always a great thing.  Really happy that I'm getting close.
