THE MODERATOR: Inbee, how does it feel to be back?   
INBEE PARK: It feels great to be back since I missed this tournament because of my wedding last year.  It was the week before the wedding so I couldn't come here.   
I had a win here in in 2012.  Except for that, I really haven't played well on this golf course.  I still have a victory on this golf course.  I mean, this golf course can play very tough and can play very scorable at the same time.  Definitely watch out on few holes.   
Yeah, just so excited to be back playing in Malaysia.  Love the people here and the tournament here.  Yeah, happy to be back.   
THE MODERATOR: You took over the world No. 1, but now Lydia continues to make it tough for you with back-to-back wins at Evian and Canadian.  Do you look at that No. 1 ranking at all?   
INBEE PARK: You know, I don't really look at the rankings.  Last three weeks just been relaxing at home.  Yeah, Lydia has been playing some fantastic golf last couple months.  Definitely gives a lot of motivation to finish off the year obviously in a similar situation to last year where I was chasing Stacy.   
Few tournaments to go and obviously it's the opposite, so I'm trying not put too much pressure on myself because that's what I did last year and didn't work so well.  Trying to learn from the experience and trying to enjoy the rest of the year.   
THE MODERATOR: I know you always have a goal in mind.  This year your goal was to win the British Open.  I know you also want the Rolex Player of the Year back.  Is there one specific award Stacy took from you last year that you want back this year?   
INBEE PARK: You know, I think we were very close with the Player of the Year award and also Vare Trophy.  I think it all came down to like the last tournament.  Yeah, it was a very close call, and obviously if I could win that award again this year that would be great.   
That's definitely not my priority.  I set my goal this year to win the British Open and I have won the British Open, so I really have achieved any goal.  If I ask for more I think it's being just a little bit too much.  I am just trying to keep in mind that my goal was the British Open and the rest is just a present.   
Just trying to do my best.  If something comes with it, that's great.  If not, it's just -- it still was a great year.   
 Q.  How is married life treating you?  
INBEE PARK: I really don't feel that much of a difference.  We had a Korean Thanksgiving last week in Korea and I visited my husband's house down south.  Met all the family.  We had a really great time.  I feel like I have a lot more family now.  (Indiscernible), but at the same time, I really feel a lot more comfortable.   
 Q.  How does the break just before the Asian swing help your game, do you think?  
INBEE PARK: I mean, it's always tough to come back from a little break.  Usually takes a week or two to actually get back into the competition position.   
Trying to get the rust off a little bit earlier than -- well, it's couple days of tournament days, so definitely get me going.  Still have a lot more tournaments after this week, so just trying to -- everybody is in a similar situation, so not too much worried.   
 Q.  Is your husband with you this time?  
INBEE PARK: Yes, uh-huh.   
 Q.  You've come to this tournament on a number of occasions.  This is the sixth year of the Sime Darby LPGA.  How have you seen this tournament grow over the years?  
INBEE PARK: Well, you know, I think I wasn't here last year, but every time I come here I feel -- especially this year because they're raising money for the breast cancer research, which I haven't seen last year.  So they're doing every year something new and something more, giving back to the community.   
So I think it's good to see.   
 Q.  Just on the question he asked earlier.  Last year it was Stacy and this year it's Lydia.  Does the rivalry drive you on to achieve better results?  
INBEE PARK: Oh, yeah.  I think definitely.  The last few years it's been changing partners a little bit, but then I was always in the situation.  So I feel actually really honored to be reaching for the No. 1 spot every year, playing for it every year.  I think it's just a very good motivation to play for.   
If you have good competitors you only can improve your game.  You can't stay where you are.  You just got to get better and better and keep pushing.   
 Q.  Inbee, what would it take the last seven events to kind of push this year up to the top of 2013?  Four wins now; six then.  What would it take?  
INBEE PARK: I still really think 2013 was greatest year in my career yet.  Obviously I have five, six more tournaments to play this year.  If I can win more than six or equal six, can will be the best season.  Then if I can win seven tournaments in one season, that will be another goal.   
 Q.  Do you want to win the race to the CME Globe?  Lydia took it last year.  Kind of the only one you don't have at this point.  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, my new goal kind of really became looking for me LPGA Hall of Fame and World Golf Hall of Fame, all those kind of honors that I can now look up to.  It's just a great honor.   
The race to CME Globe is huge as well.  I mean, last year it was up to the last tournament but I couldn't do well in the last tournament.  Yeah, if I can get another opportunity like that this year I think I can do a little bit better.   
 Q.  You've had one the greatest careers of all-time at this point at 26.  Is it crazy to think about the fact that Lydia is going for her tenth career win at 18th?  How do you process that?  
INBEE PARK: I think she's definitely a lot quicker than anybody in the golfing world.  I wasn't even on the tour at her age right now, but she's already won nine tournaments.  That's a great achievement.   
She has so much career to look up to and look forward to.  She's definitely a young, talented player.   
 Q.  It's not the way you begin but where you end up, right?  
INBEE PARK: Right.  That's very important, too.  But, yeah, golf is a long time sport and this is already my ninth year on the tour.  Still feel like beginning still.  Still learning from a lot of things.   
A good thing about golf is that you never stop learning.  You learn every year.  You learn new every time.  So I think that's really the most exciting part about this sport.   
 Q.  Olympics next year in August.  Would that be something you would really want to add?  
INBEE PARK: That would be something very special.  Obviously Olympics is different to professional game.  Just to represent my country and play golf representing my country, that would be an honor.  I wouldn't think so much about the medal.  I think being there would be just a great honor.
