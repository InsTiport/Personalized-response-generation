  THE MODERATOR:   Here with Inbee Park, leader after three rounds, 21‑under for the tournament.   What was working for you out there today? 
INBEE PARK:   I think I played quite consistently with my ball‑striking today.   But I missed a couple of short putts today on No. 7 and 8, which was about a 4‑footer for two holes in a row.   I missed those two.   I also had some long putts, I holed some 20‑, 25‑foot putts. 
Overall, it was quite a good day.   It was quite different situation with the wind.   It was playing a lot tougher.   The downwind holes, it was tough to stop the ball on the green.   We have quite tough holes out there but I think I managed myself quite good. 
THE MODERATOR:   You mentioned the wind.   It was blowing a lot harder today.   How much of a difference does that make on this golf course? 
INBEE PARK:   It makes a big difference.   You can probably tell by the scoring that there wasn't many low scores today, and we kind of expect the wind coming to Taiwan, but today‑‑ it played two days without the wind and today it was just a bit shocking.   The first few holes it was calm and then started to blow on the back nine. 
I think we just weren't used to the wind but I think it was good to experience a little bit of that today, because I think tomorrow is probably something similar to today.   Yeah, I had my mistakes today, so hopefully I learn from my mistakes. 
The MODERATOR:   You're going to be in the final group tomorrow with Stacy Lewis and Shanshan Feng, three of the top six players in the world in that pairing, including yourself.   How exciting is that to you? 
INBEE PARK:   I think it's good players playing good in the event, which is always really exciting.   Going into the final day with such good players like Stacy and Shanshan, we've played together two days in a row.   We're going to have a good competition tomorrow and obviously four strokes around this golf course, it's not impossible. 
So I just need to putt like the way I did for the last couple days and control the ball really good in the wind. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
INBEE PARK:   I think just like three days, obviously tomorrow is going to be probably a little more nervous than the first few days.   I think I've got to control myself out there a little bit.   I think mind control will be very important.   Ball‑striking on the greens is obviously really important, but I think it's more about my control tomorrow than just the golf. 
So I think, yeah, I think I've experienced something like that situation before, so I think that experience will help me go through tomorrow. 

Q.   How important was the eagle on No.2 for you today? 
INBEE PARK:   It was really big for me today, because I was playing good for the first few holes and then made two bogeys in a row on 7 and 8.   Going into the back nine, I needed to make a couple more birdies for tomorrow, and it was tough to make birdies out there with a lot of wind.   And to pick up two strokes on that hole was huge.   I think I've birdied every day on that hole and eagle today, so that hole has been a big key. 

Q.   This year at the LPGA, they just input the CME World Ranking system.   What is the significance of that?
INBEE PARK:   I think it gives players something more, some more extra motivation obviously coming down the stretch.   Before the season finishes, sometimes you kind of can lose your concentration a little bit and you just don't really know what you're playing for. 
But having the CME obviously helps you play really good all the way through the season and makes the end of the season a lot more exciting and obviously the last tournament is quite a big tournament.
