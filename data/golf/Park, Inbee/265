  INBEE PARK:   ‑‑ very happy to win.   Play for the second time, that was the first time (indiscernible) so I'm really proud of myself for that. 
I was really nervous out there.   I wasn't nervous till about 15, then it just got to me.   Was really nervous.   (Indiscernible) play golf today, yeah.   It was a little bit embarrassing finish, bogey, bogey finish. 
THE MODERATOR:   Run us through your day, your birdies, two on the front nine, four on the back, finishing with two bogeys.   Run us through your birdies. 
INBEE PARK:   No. 2 and 3, No. 2 was about a 6, 7‑footer. 
No.3 was the same, 6‑footer. 
No.10 was about a 20‑footer. 
11 was about a 15‑footer. 
THE MODERATOR:   13 and 14. 
INBEE PARK:   13, hit to a foot. 
14, yeah, that was a foot, too. 
THE MODERATOR:   Two out of your three wins in your career have been come‑from‑behind victories.   The win at the U.S. Open 2009, you had a two‑stroke deficit going into the final round.   Is there something you like about chasing going into the final round? 
INBEE PARK:   I think I prefer leading because I think it's much easier the last day.   But, I mean, I had to play good on the final day to win.   I knew that Na Yeon was really strong on this golf course and I knew she really liked this golf course.   So I knew I had to go really low today to win, make a lot of birdies. 
THE MODERATOR:   We have to talk about your consistency in the second half of the season.   This is your 10th consecutive top 10, your second win in six starts.   Pretty unbelievable.   Do you want to share any secrets to your success?   What are you doing? 
INBEE PARK:   I think my golf has improved, everything, hitting the ball, chipping, putting.   Everything has really improved.   I worked really hard on my swing. 
I've been hitting it very solid all year.   So, yeah, that gave me a lot more birdie chances. 
THE MODERATOR:   You're a little wet from the awards ceremony.   You got in a full round with no delays today. 
INBEE PARK:   It's been a lot of delays this week.   I'm really happy that we didn't get any delays today.   I think the weather really helped us today. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions. 

Q.   What was your mindset on 13? 
INBEE PARK:   You know, I knew coming in No.15 through 18 are tough coming‑in holes, I knew I had to make a lot of birdies before that. 
My iron shots were really great on No.13 and 14.   That (indiscernible). 

Q.   Were you nervous on 18?
INBEE PARK:   I was really nervous on No.17, 18, yeah. 

Q.   Your second shot at 18, what exactly happened? 
INBEE PARK:   Well, my ball was sitting down.   It was (indiscernible).   I hit it as hard as I can but it didn't fly that far. 

Q.   From the bunker, you were trying to fly by the green safely?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, the third shot I knew I had a great birdie chance.   I had to think she would make a birdie.   I had to go for it. 

Q.   (No microphone.)
INBEE PARK:   Well, I think I played much better golf in Malaysia than Canada.   Canada, I didn't putt as well as I thought.   This week I putted great.   So I think that was the difference. 

Q.   What was the turning point for you today?
INBEE PARK:   I got to say the birdies on No.13 and 14, and also on No.17. 

Q.   Your husband was following you.   He's your coach.   Were there any words of advice before you started this round?
INBEE PARK:   He's my fiancÃ©, not husband. 
He just told me not try to win, he told me to just do your best out there.   He said, you know, second place (indiscernible) first place.   Even if you try to be first place, (indiscernible) is what he said. 

Q.   Which won you the tournaments, the irons, the driver, short‑irons or the putter?
INBEE PARK:   This year the (indiscernible) and the putting.   All the (indiscernible) shots, I think I hit it to about a foot to like five feet, so... 

Q.   Your putter?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.

Q.   Is that a new putter?
INBEE PARK:   No, I had it almost one year, yeah. 

Q.   You were thinking of going to the broomstick putter? 
INBEE PARK:   The bigger one? 

Q.   Yes.   Have you tried it?
INBEE PARK:   Well, (indiscernible) tried it.   I just decided to go (indiscernible) because it was too hard to finish. 

Q.   Second or third time coming to Malaysia, maybe you can talk about what you like about coming here. 
INBEE PARK:   I mean, I love the food here.   I love Asian food, so I love coming here, eating good food.   I love the people here.   The people are so kind here.   I really like that about. 
Not so much about the weather because it's too hot for me.   But I think I'm going to try to like it because I won here (laughter). 

Q.   You made a remark yesterday I think about liking the wet weather.   Today was all hot.   How did you deal with the hot weather?
INBEE PARK:   I actually like cold weather and rainy weather better than the hot weather. 
But today I think I was really focused and concentrated, weather didn't really come into effect.   That didn't really matter. 

Q.   I watch you a lot on The Golf Channel.   I would like to nickname you the Silent Assassin.   Would you like it?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah (laughter).
