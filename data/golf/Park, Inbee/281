 Q. Talk us through your round. 
 INBEE PARK: Very solid ball-striking day. Putts (indiscernible), so I left some putts out there. 
 But I still have 18 more holes, and I'll try my best to get close.

 Q. What's your strategy heading into the final 18?
 INBEE PARK: I think just hit many fairways and many greens and just no three-putts.

 Q. Mentally how tough is it to play 18 holes and then get in the clubhouse and then go out and play 18?
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, I mean, last three days been like stop, go, stop, go. It's been pretty tough and today 36 holes in one day. 
 I think it's mentally and physically just have to be strong to play good, and that's what I'm going to do.
