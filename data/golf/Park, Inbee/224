 Q.   Very solid day, solid start and then kind of you said a little rough in the middle.   Was there a point where you said, all right, let's get this going?   Was there any point in the round where you felt that way?  
INBEE PARK:   I mean I felt that I was getting a little bit slow, and nothing really wanted to go in in the middle of the round, but I got off to a hot start.   You sometimes get the rounds where you have up‑and‑downs, and I just tried to be patient out there, and finally a few putts dropped at the end.  
   
 Q.   Did you see a leaderboard or anything?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I saw it on the back nine, you know.   I think they were just making so many birdies it was just too hard to catch.   
And yeah, I think I gotta go pretty low tomorrow, too.   This golf course is so scorable and you need to go aggressive and make birdies, so I think it's a lot of fun.  
   
 Q.   Especially, like I said, the last five holes, it's going to be exciting, a lot of birdie chances, you guys, it'll be you, Stacy and Shanshan.   It's a pretty exciting group.   What are you looking forward tomorrow playing with them with probably what's going to be an exciting finish?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   They're, what, 20, 21‑under par, yeah.   So they are like four or five strokes ahead of me.   So I just go out with no expectations and just go low and just make a lot of birdies.  
   
 Q.   And you and Stacy if you do unseat Shanshan somehow, we'll try to get you out safely because obviously everyone will be cheering for Shanshan, but what is it like to see the Chinese fans embrace her and just embrace the tour as well?  
INBEE PARK:   I think it's really ‑‑ I think I'm really happy to see a lot of people here in China watching golf and especially Shanshan playing well in front of them.   I'm really just happy for her.   If it's not me, I would want her to win.   So it's just going to be good for China and Chinese golf and everybody, so yeah, I'm just going to give it my best shot.
