Q. Oh, so close, but a pretty good final round for you.  Yet another tournament where you're playing well.  How do you continue to just play so well?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it wasn't a bad round, but just the way I finished was just horrible.  Bogey, bogey finish with a short miss-putt.  Probably missed about two to three footers, about three to four times today, which you're not going anywhere with that putting.
Just a horrible putting round.  Everything else, I scrambled pretty well out there.  Just the putter.  The way I putted was not satisfying.
Q. That's interesting coming if you, the queen of putting.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, maybe I got to do something because I'm just not comfortable with it.
Q. How was the wind?  It really picked up here later in the day.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was windy, but this is what you expect in Hawaii.
Q. So this is back to normal winds?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, this is back to normal winds.  Yeah, I mean, everything just else seemed to be okay.  I mean, didn't really feel like I gave it a good run at it today.
There was opportunities that I could go low, but just hitting in the water, missing short putts, was really hard to move from there.
Q. What does this say about Brooke's game the way she was able to pick it back up after her poor finish yesterday?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I played with her first couple days and she played really solid.  Especially her short game was really good.  I thought if she put something, some type of putting like that on the final round, I thought she was hard to beat.
