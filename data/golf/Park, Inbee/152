Q.   So today you had another solid round and you're in a very good position.   .
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it was a good round.   I had a bogey‑free round today, so overall, everything tee‑to‑green was perfect today, as well. 
Just on the greens, until No. 1 to 13, I missed about nine, ten opportunities.   I hit the ball great today.   It could have been a much better day.   I had more opportunities than yesterday but just didn't hole as many. 
But I was lucky enough to hole the last three out of six holes, so I think i thought today was going to end with just no birdies.   Nothing wanted to drop today. 
It could have been a better day but I'm really satisfied the way I finished, especially bogey through two days is a great result.

Q.   And the back nine seems to be very kind to you. 
INBEE PARK:   And the front nine is the tougher nine obviously.   But the back nine, there is a lot of birdie chances out there. 
And yeah, it seems like my putter wants to drop on the back nine, and hopefully tomorrow, a little bit different.   I want to play a little better on the front nine.   I had three, four opportunities today but I wasn't able to make them.   So, yeah, hopefully I can make up for it on the front nine tomorrow. 

Q.   Have you ever won a tournamentwith no bogeys?
INBEE PARK:   No, I've never done that before. 

Q.   54 holes? 
INBEE PARK:   I think‑‑ I'm not sure what's exact, my record is.   I think for two rounds, I've definitely done it.   But maybe third round, I'm not sure.

Q.   Is that the most pleasing thing about your round today?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I didn't make much mistakes.   Obviously I had a lot of opportunities, but being able to do a bogey‑free round on this golf course I think is very good.   It's a tough golf course and there is a lot of troubles out there. 
Yeah, that just tells me how the ball‑striking is very good, so that gives me a lot of confidence going into the next two days. 

Q.   Was it just about keeping pace with everyone? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I'm surprised with the scores, because last year the winning score was 10‑under par and this year it's so much better. 
Every week we go and play, it feels like every year is just getting better and better.   You've just got to improve yourself every year, and I don't know, I can't see much of a difference in conditions, but I they just everybody is playing well, and I think I need to play well the next two days to win. 

Q.   At the start of the week you said your putter has to get hot.   Is it getting hot? 
INBEE PARK:   It was hot yesterday, but definitely was but today was definitely not the hot day.   I holed good putts coming down the stretch.   Yeah, hopefully good momentum for tomorrow. 

Q.   You birdied 18 yesterday‑‑ good momentum‑‑
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think birdieing 18 is very important for the next day.   Usually it gives me a good confidence going into tomorrow, and yeah, 18 is a birdie hole and par is a disappointment.   The front nine, I wasn't able to make birdies on the par 5s, or any of those‑‑ I made one birdie for two days. 

Q.   13 straight pars to start the day, you must have been asking yourself when the birdie was going to come?
INBEE PARK:   But it wasn't going to come all day because in 13 holes, I had so many opportunities.   I had like ten shots that was within ten feet but just not making any putts.   I was disappointed but I really tried to be patient.   I thought at some point, one was going to drop, and I dropped three at the end.   So it was a good day but just, you know, it could have been much better.
