Q.   First off, congrats with your finish.   You're going to stay No.1 in the world.   I know we talked about last week and what it meant to you, but having played your way and kept it from your play this week, how much does that give you some confidence?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, that definitely feels better than just being No.1 in the week off.   We played one week and I'm still No.1, so I know I kind of deserve No.1 spot now.   I played very good golf this week.   The first two rounds my putts didn't really fall, but round 3 and 4 it was much better.   Very happy with my game at the moment and very confident. 

Q.   How much now‑‑ we've talked to Stacy about it.   How much does being No.1 kind of factor into your head?   Do you think about it or is it something that you just kind of put in the back of your mind?
INBEE PARK:   I think about it, but I try not to think about it too much.   No.1 is No.1, but it's not like I'm there for 100 weeks or something.   It's going to be only two weeks now, and I don't know, hopefully it's going to be longer, and that's what I play for.   I'm just happy to play for No.1 every week.
