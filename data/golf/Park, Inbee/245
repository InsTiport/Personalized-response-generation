  THE MODERATOR:   All right.   I'd like to welcome Inbee Park into the interview room at the Wegmans LPGA Classic.   4‑under 68 today, just tell us how the round went for you. 
INBEE PARK:   I hit the ball great today.   I only missed like two fairways and three greens and it wasn't really in the long stuff today.   So that was a big help.   And gave a lot of opportunities out there and putted much better than yesterday.
I made some mistakes yesterday, and I didn't do that again today, so that was good. 
THE MODERATOR:   You teed off at 10.   Would you just walk through your birdies for us what you hit and how far the putts were on No. 10.
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   No. 10 was just a tap in, like two feet.
THE MODERATOR:   What club did you hit? 
INBEE PARK:   I hit 8‑iron.   9‑iron.   Yeah.
THE MODERATOR:   9‑iron.
INBEE PARK:   And No. 12 I hit ‑‑ yeah, 9‑iron, about 15 feet left of the hole.
THE MODERATOR:   Bogey on 14.   What happened there, par‑4? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I hit 7‑iron just off the green and I putted from there and three‑putted.   That was my only bogey today.
THE MODERATOR:   Birdie 18.
INBEE PARK:   18 was 7‑iron to six feet.   Yeah. 
THE MODERATOR:   No. 1.
INBEE PARK:   No. 1, 5‑iron, like 15 feet. 
THE MODERATOR:   And 4.
INBEE PARK:   4.   Par‑5, yeah.   I had 47‑degree wedge to like 20 feet.
THE MODERATOR:   47 degrees? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah. 
THE MODERATOR:   Just talk about tomorrow.   36 holes coming up.   We're only halfway through this event, but you're in great shape.   How do you feel going into tomorrow? 
INBEE PARK:   I mean we still have a lot more golf to play.   It feels like just one more round to go, but we have to play two rounds in one day.   I think that's what's going to be very tough mentally and physically.   It's something that I really need to handle.   And I need to get really good rest tonight.   And try to be very relaxed and get a lot of sleep.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Inbee. 

Q.   Do you have any memories of playing 36 in the past that you can draw on tomorrow, do you think, that'll carry you through?
INBEE PARK:   The last 36 holes we played was last year at British.   Yeah, which was very tough conditions.   It was raining and windy.   And I mean I'm sure it's going to be a lot easier than that tomorrow. 
But I think it's very tough physically, I mean especially walking on these wet fairways, it's really hard on your feet.   So yeah, it's going to be tough, but I'm just going to try to concentrate every hole.   I mean there's going to be many holes, but yeah, just try not to lose my focus, hit a lot of fairways and greens.

Q.   Has there been a situation where you played 36 holes in one day that you played particularly well?
INBEE PARK:   I played well in British last year, but Jiyai beat me.   Yeah, I finished second. 
THE MODERATOR:   Can you give us some thoughts on Morgan Pressel?   She was in here just a few minutes ago saying that you guys played quite a bit of junior golf, amateur golf and now LPGA golf together.   What are your thoughts on Morgan? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   We've been seeing each other since we were little and playing a lot of junior golf and amateur.   And just really used to seeing her.   And I'm sure she probably hit it very straight to play that well on this golf course.   So I gotta try to do that like her tomorrow. 

Q.   You just mentioned that you played a lot of junior golf with Morgan.   Now, you've won five times in the last year, I think.   She hasn't won since 2008.   A little surprised that a player of her caliber has gone that long without winning out here?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I know she has been through some tough times in her career last couple years.   I think she was having tough time, but I'm sure she's type of player that she could always come back, and I think it was about time that she was coming back.   And I think she's feeling really comfortable around this golf course. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I mean I would be less nervous than Kraft.   I mean I've experienced a lot of golf, and you know, last group ‑‑ last group in final rounds.   And in the past I have lost a lot, too.   And I've won a lot, too.   So I mean that kind of experience really helps going into major championships like this where you get the situation and you have experienced it before and you feel a lot more comfortable. 

Q.   (Inaudible). 
INBEE PARK:   I mean yesterday and today I hit the ball very good.   I hit a lot of fairways and greens today and yesterday, but yesterday I made just a couple of bad clubs, and you know, very bad mistakes yesterday and didn't make much putts yesterday.   But I didn't do that today.   I putted a lot better and didn't hit it over the green today.   So that's going to help.

Q.   Does the game feel easy this year, Inbee?
INBEE PARK:   No.   Golf is never easy. 

Q.   You're making it look easy. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I mean if you hit the ball straighter, I mean it makes the golf course play a lot easier, definitely on this golf course.
And you know, I have been doing that the last two days here.   So I mean I think I have played the golf course a little easier than anybody else, yeah.   Except for Morgan.
THE MODERATOR:   Somebody in the Rochester media may not know that you're engaged to be married.   Your fiancÃ© is sitting there in the back.   How influential has he been?   I know he's also your coach.   How influential has he been on your career as of late? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I really started playing well since I started traveling with him and he has been a big help on my swing and mentally and everything.   But he's great and yeah, he's a big help for me.
THE MODERATOR:   Now, wedding slated for the off season.   You'll never tell us when it is, though, right.
INBEE PARK:   I'll tell you when it's two months before. 
THE MODERATOR:   Anything else for Inbee?   Thank you so much for joining us. 
INBEE PARK:   Thanks, Mike.
