 Q.   Great overall tournament.   You have to feel pretty pleased with yourself.   You said you wanted to come out and have a good showing.   How do you feel after today?  
INBEE PARK:   I feel good.   I mean, today wasn't probably as‑‑ my ball‑striking wasn't as good as yesterday, I putted better than yesterday.   So I feel like my putter is coming back.   
I played one shot better than last year and didn't win.   Still a very good result.   Tells me I improved a little.   I'm satisfied the way I played this weekend.   Yeah, I played good.  
   
 Q.   How did it feel just being in competition, really competing, going back and forth down the stretch?  
INBEE PARK:   The first two rounds were like, How you going little bit.   Third and fourth round I was pretty much back in the field.   I think I played a little bit better than I thought I would.  
   
 Q.   Coming off four weeks and now you're in the mix, how much of a momentum booster does this give you?  
INBEE PARK:   To play for a trophy on the last day I think is a good goal achieve for the first week.  
   
 Q.   In the first start.   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   
   
 Q.   Going into next week, what do you hope to bring over momentum‑wise?   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think just the way I strike the ball this week I think I'll be quite good next week.   Just I need to hole some more putts.   In Singapore I never had good results last six, seven years.  
Again, not expecting much, but never know.   But I feel like my game is in a good shape.   
   
 Q.   You're modest.   Did do you any leaderboard watching today?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, because I play with Anna so I pretty much knew what the leader was.   I saw maybe on the back nine.   A lot of people had good scores today.
