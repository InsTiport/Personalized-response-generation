  INBEE PARK:   Just the overall day, everything seemed like it didn't go the right way.   It wasn't that bad of drives, but it just ended up in the rough, and you really have no shot from the rough.   I was putting, and nothing really wanted to go in.   I burned a lot of edges.   Just one of those kind of days.   We still have tomorrow.

Q.   All three of you seemed to struggle today, too, which I don't know if that's‑‑
INBEE PARK:   I mean, I really didn't think about anybody else's play but myself.   It just wasn't the best day.

Q.   Surprising?   You're Inbee Park. 
INBEE PARK:   It's not surprising.   Everybody has bad days.   Yeah, today was just one of those days, and a couple of bad bounces and a couple of bad drives and a couple of bad putts.

Q.   Talk about 11. 
INBEE PARK:   11, I think my target was just a little bit too right, but I just really got a really bad bounce into the hazard.   Five more yards it could have been perfect. 

Q.   Are you too far back now do you think?
INBEE PARK:   Well, six shots back is not impossible, but like the leader today, she shot like 6‑under.   It's definitely possible on this golf course, so I'll just go out tomorrow and just try hard.
