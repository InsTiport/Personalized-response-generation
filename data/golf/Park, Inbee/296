 Q.  In-Bee, you finished at 2-under par.  That was a wonderful way you performed in this Women's Open. 
  IN-BEE PARK: Yeah, definitely very, very happy with my finish this week and I know it's a great week. And I really enjoy myself out here. 

 Q.  You were paired with Se Ri for the last round, your good friend Angela Park is playing very well.  Was any of that special for you? 
  IN-BEE PARK: It's really special. 10 years ago and when Se Ri won in '98, I watched TV and I just picked up the golf club then. 



 So 10 years later I'm here playing with her, so it's really, really great and very, very special for me. 

 Q.  Did you learn something watching her today?  She finished with two 68s? 
  IN-BEE PARK: Yeah. She has a really strong finish and I really like her game and she's a great player. 

 Q.  How about your friend Angela, she's doing very well. 
  IN-BEE PARK: I think so. She's not finished yet, but it looks like she's doing very, very well, so I'm really happy for her. 

 Q.  What about your own advancement?  You talked about watching Se Ri and now you're among the top finishers in this what does that say about your future? 
  IN-BEE PARK: This is the best finish of my season and I think that this has to be a good start and I'll play good throughout the season hopefully.
