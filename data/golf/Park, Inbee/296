   DANA GROSS-RHODE: Inbee Park, you are the 2008 US Women's Open, and now you kind of found yourself up at the top of the leaderboard for the Navistar LPGA Classic. How did today go? In it was a good day for you out there.  
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was. I been struggling with putting all this season, and finally this tournament I was putting well. So I was happy with that.   
 I was hitting the ball good and putting good, so I think that worked out.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What were some of the putts you had out there? Were the they close putts or just long putts that were going in?   
 INBEE PARK: There were some long putts that went in, and there was some short putts that went in. I would say about three putts that were over 30-footer. Yes, that was very good.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Questions for Inbee, please.   
  
  Q. What holes were the three long putts on?   
 INBEE PARK: Tough to remember actually. Two yesterday and one today. Let me think. Yesterday was No. 11, and I don't know. (Laughter.)  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: You want to go through your scorecard to see? You started on the back nine, right?   
 INBEE PARK: Yeah. No, I started on the front nine today. Yeah, No. 7 was about six feet.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: What club?   
 INBEE PARK: 7-iron.   
 No. 8 was 56-degrees from about 50 yards to about five feet.   
 No. 9, yeah, that was one of the long putts. About 25-footer. Hit a wedge into the hole, pitching wedge.   
 And the par-3, 7-iron to about five feet.   
 Bogey on No. 17. My tee shot went into the hazard. Yeah, so hit a third shot, just laid up, and fourth shot 5-wood and then 2-putted from 25-footer, two-putt. Just missed my birdie putt. Yeah.   
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Looking at the courses you've played in your career, how does this course play for you, the Senator course?   
 INBEE PARK: Well, they have big greens, so you really have to put the ball in the right tier and right positions. Fairways were really soft in the practice rounds, but yesterday and today it was running.  
 So course was playing shorter, and that really favored me. I think the course is pretty good, in very good condition.   
 Maybe the wind is gonna be the factor here, yeah.   
  
  Q. There had been a forecast of rain, and it never really came. Psychologically were you prepared to play in rain, and how does that affect you?  
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, I saw the forecast, and we were all ready for the rain. I mean, we had umbrellas and rain suits and towels and everything. So I was very happy. I'm lucky that we finish without the rain.   
 It was very good -- it turned out to be very good weather. We're lucky to be here.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Was your caddie upset that the bag was so heavy and he carried it all day?   
 INBEE PARK: Well, I didn't carry it, but my caddie carried it. He was just saying that the bag was weighing tons.  
 DANA GROSS-RHODE: Thank you all. Inbee, good luck.  
 INBEE PARK: Thanks.
