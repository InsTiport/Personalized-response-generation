 Q.   Another very solid Sunday for you.   I know you came up short but you have to be pleased with how you played?  
INBEE PARK:   I played a pretty good round today.   I played good but obviously the field played better than me.   Yeah, six birdies and one bogey, and it was a pretty good round.   But like No.17 and 18, I could have made a birdie but there's really nothing to regret.   
The first two days, I probably had a lot more shots that I could safe.   Obviously today was a good round and I was one short.   
   
 Q.   How long was that one on 18?   
INBEE PARK:   Twenty feet.   My chip shot wasn't that good.   
   
 Q.   Did you watch the leader boards at all today?   
INBEE PARK:   You just knew that after yesterday, you had like 20 players that was in contention and you knew that I had to shoot some kind of low number to actually have the trophy.   We knew that it was a very crowded leaderboard and that's what it was today.   I did my best but just one short.
