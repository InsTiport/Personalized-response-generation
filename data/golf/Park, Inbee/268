Q.   So awesome way to finish the day on 18.   Just talk about your day and how you played.
INBEE PARK:   It was tough putting day today.   I mean I gave myself a lot of chances out there, but obviously Lydia was too far to catch today, and she was playing really good golf out there. 
The pressure she was handling is really amazing.   I'm really happy for her.   It's great for her career.   And I think I was just lucky that I get the winner's check today.

Q.   Yeah, I was going to ask, we haven't had an amateur win since 1969.   So this situation has never really happened where the first place money goes to second.   So you holed out on 18 and now you're going to be in second and have 300,000 in your bank account?
INBEE PARK:   It feels great.   I finished second and get the first place money.   It hasn't happened maybe in 40 years.   It hasn't happened that often.   And I was lucky this week, I guess.

Q.   You started to play a lot in Japan.   You weren't playing as much on the LPGA.   Now you've won Evian.   You've been playing really well.   Tied second this week.   How are you feeling about your game and playing more regularly on the LPGA?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I mean I really concentrate on the LPGA Tour this year and I think that really helped me getting the momentum going on the LPGA Tour. 
And my game's gotten a lot better.   I'm hitting the ball better, putting better this year.   So I think that's helped a lot.
