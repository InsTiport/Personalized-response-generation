  Q. Inbee, you have the clubhouse lead right now at 9-under.  Another steady day with four birdies.  Any of the birdies particularly stand out in your round today?
 INBEE PARK:   You know, I hit good shots, and it's just weird on these greens, because I hit the shots really close and I don't make the birdie putt, but I kind of hit it to 15, 20 feet and I make those birdie putts.
 The holes I made today is pretty much I made probably 10- to 20-footers.  But coming in last three holes I missed probably inside five, six feet.  So it's just greens that really need patience.
 I played good throughout the day today, struck the ball well, hit a lot of greens, gave myself a lot of opportunities, so happy with the round.
 Q. A little nicer conditions than yesterday.
 INBEE PARK:   Uh-huh.
 Q. How did the course play differently today?
 INBEE PARK:   Course definitely was a lot nicer weather today, so a lot less wind and obviously no raining.  So it was just a lot easier to play.
 I feel like I played good, but just didn't putt as good as yesterday.
 Q. Your average place of finish here is tenth.  What is it about Aviara that just has your eye?  You always seem to play so well.
 INBEE PARK:   I just really like the golf course.  It is a beautiful golf course and really suits my game.  I hit a lot of short irons into this golf course, which I don't get every week, so, yeah, I'm really happy that I get to attack a lot of pins this week.
 So I think that's kind of made a difference, yeah.
 Q. You mentioned yesterday that you were just warming up.  Obviously your first event back.
 INBEE PARK:   Yeah.
 Q. I think a lot of people would be like, Inbee, you shot 6-under.  You're just warming up.
 INBEE PARK:   Yeah.
 Q. How did it feel today, the game?  Were you still warming up?
 INBEE PARK:   Obviously I think I will be warming up for probably next couple of weeks.  I haven't played tournament golf in three months.  It's awkward.  We always play week to week, and, I mean, you're always just on the tournament mode.
 But after just three months at home and not touching the golf clubs that much it's quite different coming out here trying to contact the ball.  It sometimes looks weird.  I feel like I'm doing it very well.
 Q. Yeah, I would say so.  Were you able to do anything during the three months off?  Anything outside of practice?
 INBEE PARK:   You know, just spending a lot of time with my dog and just spending time with family, seeing friends, staying at one place for like over two months is just like a miracle for us.
 Yeah, it was great.
 Q. What's your dog as name?
 INBEE PARK:   Rio.
 Q. That's great.  I wonder why.
 INBEE PARK:   Yeah.
