Q. Inbee, so how was the first round back?  How are you feeling?
INBEE PARK: I'm feeling really good.  I don't feel much of the injury anymore.  I feel like I'm really free of injury.
Ball-striking was really good today.  Just around the greens wasn't as sharp as I wanted.  Obviously that's just going to happen.  Just got to be patient.
Q. Is this what you expected for the first round back, how thought you would feel?
INBEE PARK: Yeah.  I was just going to test how I feel.  I was going to test if my thumb is okay and the ball-striking is back.  Just need to sharpen up my game.
