  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Rolex Rankings No. 5 Inbee Park into the interview room.   Thank you so much for joining us today.   Congratulations.   A runner‑up finish.   I know everyone always wants to win the title, but another impressive showing by you this week.   Can you take me through your performance this week and how you feel at the end of the day today? 
INBEE PARK:   I mean after yesterday I think I almost played perfect for first three days.   I mean I try to take the positive out of this week's game. 
Today I hit the ball good, I think.   Just putts just didn't fall.   I mean I holed a lot of putts the last three days, so I guess today was just unlucky day, and just try to take the things from this week and go on to next week. 
THE MODERATOR:   It was a tough battle between you and Suzann for most of the day and the conditions were pretty tough.   How much more difficult was the golf course playing today with the wind having picked up.
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think today was playing totally different than the last three days I played this golf course.   Today we were hitting totally different clubs into the green, and downwind we weren't able to stop the ball on the green.   And just mostly putting‑wise I think windy days the putting is the toughest because it's just too hard to concentrate.   I mean the ball is moving, looks like it's going to move.   And yeah, it's just tough ‑‑ tough day to concentrate, I think. 
THE MODERATOR:   You've been playing such terrific golf over the second half of the season.   It's now 11 out of your last 12 tournaments you've finished in the Top 10.   This is your fifth runner‑up finish.   I mean how do you even begin to characterize this type of golf that you've been playing of late, and do you even look back on it and are you impressed by what you've been able to accomplish.
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   Sometimes I look at my stats, and I mean it's great because I have a lot of runner‑up finishes, and when you have a lot of runner‑up finishes, you know that you are really close to winning and try to take the good side of the runner‑up finishes and try to learn from other players' play.   And maybe next time I will win. 
Suzann played great today.   I mean in this wind, it looks like her ball ‑‑ the wind wasn't touching her ball and she just played great today.   I just want to give her credit for that.
THE MODERATOR:   There are three events left of the LPGA season after this week, and you're set to play in all three of them.
INBEE PARK:   Yes.
THE MODERATOR:   And so is Stacy Lewis, and the two of you seem to be in a good battle now for the Rolex Player of the Year award.   Is that kind of an award that you have in your sights?   Is that something that you've set a goal to achieve?   As we've talked about, no other South Korean has won that award before.
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   Earlier in the season I really didn't think about that much, but it's almost the end of the season and only three tournaments to go.   And I think I have a good chance because I'm playing good and I have confidence.   And these three tournaments, who knows what's going to happen.   Just play tournament by tournament, shot by shot and see if I can go close.
THE MODERATOR:   Questions for Inbee. 

Q.   Great play over the last four days.   The question I wanted to ask is you're so collected and composed on the golf course, so you never really know how you're feeling inside.   What were you feeling inside when that chip on the 14th didn't go the way that you had and did it affect your play after that?   Can you talk a little bit about how you felt when that happened?
INBEE PARK:   It was a downwind, and I think I played it too much for a downwind.   I mean my ball ‑‑ the wind didn't touch my ball.   I think it kind of knocked it down, so it just stayed short, and I thought I had a good lie and it was a pretty easy lie I thought.   And just the ball didn't come up that way.   It just happens. 
It wasn't the easiest chip, so actually getting a bogey on that hole was lucky I think, because it was a good bogey.

Q.   Out of the 18 holes that you played today, which one was the most frustrating hole?
INBEE PARK:   I've gotta say it's 13 when I hit it over the green with the 5‑wood.   But that hole was ‑‑ I really wanted to make birdie on that hole, and I think that was kind of the turning point.   That hole Suzann made a good par putt, and I missed my birdie putt, so I think that hole was kind of the turning point of the round today.

Q.   You and Yani were in the same group, and there was a lot of fans following you guys, but there's a lot of fan support for Yani and they don't want you to give them the ball.   Would that be a distraction for you?
INBEE PARK:   I mean I expected a lot of fans to be with Yani.   I mean that's just a known fact.   I mean but I think today was I think a little bit too much.   And that hurt my feelings a little bit.   But it happens and you're playing in Taiwan, and it just ‑‑ it happens.   I just gotta take it what it is.   And yeah.   I think that's just another experience.
