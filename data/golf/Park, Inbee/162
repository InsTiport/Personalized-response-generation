  THE MODERATOR:   Inbee, what was the key to this victory? 
INBEE PARK:   This week, my putter was very good today.   I was struggling, always thinking‑‑ I felt like I was practicing on the green three and four hours a day, but coming into this week, I really wanted to, on Tuesday, I was putting on the greens for four hours, and tried to figure something out. 
So I had to go back to the beginning and change my posture a little bit and yeah, since then, my putter really started working this week and that's been really the big key. 
So today was the putting, and playing with Stacy was really tough, she almost‑‑ I was lucky‑‑ so it was a really good day but it wasn't an easy day for me. 
THE MODERATOR:   You mentioned Stacy.   Does it mean more to you being able to beat her, because she could have taken over the No. 1 spot with the win.   Does that add anything to the win? 
INBEE PARK:   She was 1 and I was No.2‑‑ inaudible‑‑ but I don't think we ever played on the final day.   We played in the first two rounds but it's different in the final round.   I think this was almost our first match together.   If she had beat me it would have been really tough today.   But I think being able to play good and under pressure, that gives me a lot of confidence. 
I took over the spot last week and I didn't know how long I was going to be able to stay up there because it was just so close and I knew that I had to win this week or I have to win one or two out of the three tournaments left. 
Yeah, she's beat me a lot this year but I still think that it is possible‑‑ there's a couple tournaments left to play and I'm just going to give it my best try.   It was a really fun day.   We have a really good friendship there, as well. 
THE MODERATOR:   You're normally more of a reserved player.   We saw more emotion from you after 9 and after sinking the putt on 18.   What was that about and why do you have so much emotion with this victory.
INBEE PARK:   I think playing with Stacy, I really wanted to play well, and obviously being able to win the tournament after 18 holes‑‑ it was a tough day and I got nervous‑‑ even on the 18th hole.   Sometimes with a four‑shot lead, you put that much pressure‑‑ but on the back nine, the last three or four holes‑‑ (Inaudible.)   But today she was playing so well, and yeah, it was really a competitive day.   She's a very good player and very good competitor.   I look forward to playing with her more. 
THE MODERATOR:   First win as a married woman, how special is that? 
INBEE PARK:   I sometimes take it for granted because we are always together but sometimes we don't stay together like two, three days, and I feel his absence.   Yeah, this week, having a win after two weeks of marriage, yeah, I was really tired after the ceremony and I played in a tournament right after the wedding, three tournaments in a row after that.   And then having this win is a big surprise‑‑ inaudible‑‑ for myself.   It's good and maybe people said, she's not going to play as well as when she was not married about so I think we can put that wrong.   He's a big help for me and huge supporter. 

Q.   Coming back to Taiwan‑‑ (Inaudible.)
INBEE PARK:   Yeah‑‑ came out and watched today because they were expecting wind today.   Golf in Taiwan‑‑ and cheering on for me, so I'm very thankful to all the fans.   I think being able to win finally in front of all the fans here‑‑ it's so special. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you Inbee, congratulations, again.
