 Q. 73 today, not too bad.   
INBEE PARK: It was a tough day out there with the wind and a little bit of rain. Everything was really tough. Started off really good. Felt good earlier in the round but just couldn't really finish it strong. A few bogeys coming in, just a little bit disappointed. I could have played better but my ball‑striking wasn't there. Just a bit disappointed.  
   
 Q. Conditions are going to get tougher in the afternoon, and you're in the clubhouse with a score.   
INBEE PARK: I think 1‑over par, just the score itself, is not that bad of a score. But this overall play of mine, my expectations, it wasn't the greatest round. I know it was tough; everybody was having a tough time. But I just made too many mistakes.  
   
 Q. And you've played two round at Turnberry now. How great is this course? Where does it rank? Is it the best in the world you think?  
INBEE PARK: I think so. This golf course I've played like five, four times, and every day it played different. Different wind every day, different conditions every day. It's just tough. Today is probably the toughest wind that we're going to play.   
The last six, seven holes it's crosswind or into the wind. It was just really tough coming in. I don't know what we're going to get the next two days, but hopefully a little bit better. People might think we got the better side of the draw but it was pretty ugly this morning, as well.
