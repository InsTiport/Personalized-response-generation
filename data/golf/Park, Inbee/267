Q.   Fantastic round today, can you tell me about it, birdies and bogeys? 
IN‑BEE PARK:   Yeah, I had birdies‑‑ I mean, I had the back nine, I had a lot of easy birdies on the back nine, and the front nine was really tough because the wind picked up. 
I've been playing the front nine really hard because my ball is a little bit right‑to‑left shape and the wind is coming right‑to‑left, so I just have to watch the front nine a little bit more the next two days.   The back nine I've been playing great and I've been having a lot of birdies on the back nine, so feeling really confident with the back nine. 

Q.   A lot of people are finding the front nine harder than the back nine.   You said the next two days, but, in fact, it's one day.   How do you feel about playing 36 tomorrow? 
IN‑BEE PARK:   It's going to be a lot of patience tomorrow and got to sleep well tonight, and hopefully good conditions tomorrow. 

Q.   So you're looking forward to it? 
IN‑BEE PARK:   Yeah, of course.

Q.   And today the course was playing a lot nicer weather than the last couple days; so you are enjoying links golf? 
IN‑BEE PARK:   Yeah, the weather's been quite nice for us‑‑ I didn't come out yesterday so I didn't see the bad weather.   But it's really a great golf course and you can feel the history on the golf course.   It's great. 

Q.   And what did you do yesterday with your day off?
IN‑BEE PARK:   I just stayed home all day, relaxed. 

Q.   How did you spend your time?
IN‑BEE PARK:   I'm staying in a house with a couple of friends and we just had a lot of fun. 

Q.   So you feel quite refreshed? 
IN‑BEE PARK:   Yeah.
