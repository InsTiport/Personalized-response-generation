 Q.   Your second major championship.   How good does it feel?  
INBEE PARK:   It feels very good.   It has been a while since I won a major, and this is my second major of my career, and it feels very special.   This week I played very solid.   Today and all week I played very good.   Just happy that I have another major under my belt, and just looking forward to it.  
   
 Q.   Talk about the first hole, you birdied, she doubled.   A threeâ€‘shot swing.   Did that change your mindset?  
INBEE PARK:   Well, that made my day much easier, that's for sure.   I holed a long one on the first hole, and a birdie start is always a good thing, and I never really shot over par starting with the birdie, so that gave me a lot of confidence.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about overall you're having a great year, it's your second win.   Does this help you this year?   You've moved to No.2 in the Rolex rankings now.   Does this help you with your confidence moving forward?  
INBEE PARK:   Well, I haven't really thought that far forward.   Yeah, I've played five tournaments on the LPGA Tour, and I've won two of them, which is a very good start.   It's pressure off me for the rest of the season.   I'm just going to go out there and enjoy the season.
