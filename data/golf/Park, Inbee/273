  THE MODERATOR:   I'd like to welcome Inbee Park into the interview room.   Take me through the day. 
INBEE PARK:   I think everything went well today.   I hit the ball great.   I was able to hole a lot of putts today.   Yesterday I left some out there.   But today the greens were rolling a little bit better than yesterday afternoon because it was a little bit bumpier yesterday.   So it was good. 
THE MODERATOR:   You've had a really good season so far.   You're coming off a win at Evian.   Can you talk about how this year has been for you. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I improved a lot compared to last year.   Especially winning Evian, that gave me a lot of confidence playing this week.   I'm feeling a lot more comfortable around the golf course. 
So, yeah, it's good. 
THE MODERATOR:   The LPGA had a week off after the win.   Did you get a chance to celebrate? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I went back to Korea.   I had to do a lot of media stuff.   It was a little more tiring, but a little fun because I get to spend time with the family. 
THE MODERATOR:   Questions, please. 

Q.   You mentioned you had some improvements to make after last season.   When you took stock of your season, what were the improvements?
INBEE PARK:   I worked a lot on my long game.   I have a new coach.   My swing has improved a lot.   I'm really comfortable with my swing right now. 
THE MODERATOR:   Who is your coach? 
INBEE PARK:   He's Korean guy, also my fiancÃ©. 
THE MODERATOR:   When did you get engaged? 
INBEE PARK:   Last year. 
THE MODERATOR:   Do you have a date for the wedding? 
INBEE PARK:   Not yet. 

Q.   How difficult is it to win two weeks in a row?   There's the high that comes with winning, on another continent, but how difficult is it to win and come back and win again?
INBEE PARK:   I think it is actually easy and tough at the same time because you have such a confidence out there that week.   Playing with the confidence, you feel a lot more comfortable on the golf course.   Even if you're not playing as well as you think, you can be a little bit easier on yourself.   If you're playing really good, I think that's a bonus.   So I think it's more comfortable. 

Q.   You mentioned your coach is your fiancÃ©.   What is the dynamic like there?   You want to separate work from family, but work is family. 
INBEE PARK:   We didn't really have trouble until this point, so I didn't really have to deal with that. 

Q.   Would you ever fire your coach? 
INBEE PARK:   Probably not (laughter). 

Q.   You've had such a great year.   What do you feel like you need to do to take the next step in your career?
INBEE PARK:   I think you have to be good on everything to be actually No.1 player on Tour.   I think I have to improve my long game, my short game, I have to improve my putting. 
Long ways to go, but I'm getting closer. 

Q.   6‑under today.   What did you do better today than you did yesterday?
INBEE PARK:   Putting.   I putted a lot better today than yesterday. 

Q.   Long ones?   Short ones? 
INBEE PARK:   Well, I mean, I gave a lot of chances out there.   Some putts were maybe 20‑footers, but I hit the ball pretty good. 

Q.   What were the longest ones for birdie? 
INBEE PARK:   About 25‑footer today, yeah. 

Q.   What hole? 
INBEE PARK:   Actually maybe like 30.   No.3, yeah. 

Q.   It appears the weather conditions might change.   We're supposed to get some rain, but it's supposed to clear somewhat.   How do you think that might affect the conditions on the course? 
INBEE PARK:   I mean, the course is playing little bit longer, longer than the practice rounds.   I have to hit little bit longer irons.   But the greens are holding really well, so I think you can really aim right at it. 
Play little bit longer, but you can hit it right at it.   So I think it's about same, yeah. 
THE MODERATOR:   Thank you.
