Q.   Inbee, how was your golf today? 
INBEE PARK:   It was a very good day today.   It wasn't a bad putting day but I hit the ball great today.   I gave myself a lot of opportunities at birdie.   This is a very tough golf course, and I had a couple of great putts today, except for I think everything was pretty smooth.   And I didn't get myself in big trouble so that's good. 
I think the ball‑striking was actually really good. I think my iron shots were really good today.   I think I probably left maybe four or five putts out there.   But these greens are very tricky to read.   But three more days to go and hopefully my putts will fall the next three days. 
I think my strategy today going into the greens was really good, so I'm not going to change my ball‑striking plan.   I'm just going to try to read the greens a little bit more carefully.   They seem to not have much break. 

Q.   How difficult was it? 
INBEE PARK:   The wind was blowing, but I think it was quite a tough golf course itself.   I think I played quite good today.   I had good ball‑striking.   I had a couple of 3‑putts but other than that it was very good today. 
This golf course is not exactly a short golf course, but there is a few holes that you need to hit 3‑wood or 5‑wood off the tee.   I think you have to be really smart on this golf course, and obviously with the greens, you need to place yourself in a good position. 
I think the greens were a little bit quicker today than in the practice round and with the dry weather it's going to get tougher and tougher, so you have to get used to the greens.
