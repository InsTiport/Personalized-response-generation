Q.   A little better today?   You felt better overall?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I mean it was much better ball striking than yesterday, but I think I missed only one green out there today, gave myself a lot of opportunities.   Maybe eight, 9‑under was possible today and I missed a few putts, especially coming into 18.   But it just happens. 
Mostly I missed the right‑to‑left putts today, so I'm going to work on that a little bit.   And hopefully I can make more putts the next two days and my ball striking is going to be in better shape.

Q.   Any reason you think behind the left‑to‑right putts?
INBEE PARK:   I think right to left ‑‑ I felt like I hit it a little bit on the short side.   So I think I'm going to set up the ball a little bit more on the hill side.

Q.   Okay.   Make some adjustments?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.

Q.   Did you see Jess and NYC yesterday go out hot, 9‑under, one round.   Did that kind of give you a little motivation knowing that there's birdies out there, everyone's going to try to go low?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, especially seeing the scores yesterday, I thought this course was definitely scorable.   I kind of saw that on the practice round.   And it was even better score than I thought.   I think you just gotta go low here every day to win.   Maybe 20 under par.

Q.   Shanshan said you went to dinner last night, said the parents went out.   Tell me a little bit about that.   Said you had a really good time. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   Downtown Beijing, Shanshan's parents took us out there for Beijing duck and it was so delicious and we had a great time out there.

Q.   That's what she said.   She said I was a little nervous, nobody really spoke the same language, but she said once they had their beer, everyone was fine. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.   Everybody drink beer and we did like Chinese way of cheers.   It was fun, yeah.

Q.   That's awesome.   She said I think that really helped me just kind of relax and enjoy the setting. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I played well yesterday, too.   The three of us yesterday played together and went out to dinner together.

Q.   Oh, you guys played together. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.

Q.   Awesome.   Well, you took the party after the course.   Awesome.   That's all I needed.   Thank you, Inbee.
