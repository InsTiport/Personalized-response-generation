Q.   Okay.   We're here with Inbee park after day one at the Kia Classic.   Inbee, what was working for you today?
INBEE PARK:   Today my ball striking was great.   I hit almost probably every fairway and every green, and I probably hit at everything inside 15 feet. 
Didn't hole anything.   Had two tap‑in birdies and one five‑footer for birdie.   Except for that it was actually a little tougher day on the greens for me, but the ball striking was just really, really good.   The opportunities I had today was just almost ridiculous, I had so many opportunities.
But today was like the day I could have gone 10‑under, but still in the 60s.   That's all right.   Three more days, keep the ball striking like this this week and next week and I think it'll be good.

Q.   People have been talking about the size of the greens here, that you always end up on the greens, but then what.   Do you feel like that was the challenge for you today?
INBEE PARK:   No, not exactly because I just hit it‑‑ I mean I didn't hit it on the green.   I hit it like at the pins and I probably hit at everything inside 20 feet and missed a lot of‑‑ you know, a lot that was within 10 feet today.   Missed probably like seven, eight of them.   I just haven't been putting that well the last few weeks, but my ball striking is really getting better and better, which is good news.
