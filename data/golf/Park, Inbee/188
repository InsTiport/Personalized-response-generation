Q.   That last little putt, able to get a couple shots back towards the end? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, the last putt was probably just a little bit short of the speed.   Today overall was just a really good day.   I made mistakes in the middle of the round, a couple of mistakes there, but I didn't have big numbers there, which is really good around this golf course. 
Yeah, obviously coming last five holes here is where you need to make birdie, which I did the last couple holes.   Yeah, I'm happy with today's play and hopefully I can make some more opportunities tomorrow and go a couple under would be nice.

Q.   Finishing on even, looking forward, did you feel like from what you played through today that there's some opportunities to get some shots back tomorrow? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, definitely, like the last hole, and a couple bogeys I made, it wasn't really necessary, like 3â€‘putts around the greens.   I think I can definitely get that fixed tomorrow and just got to be really smart around the greens here.
