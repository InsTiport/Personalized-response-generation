  Q. Inbee, I've enjoyed watching you.  Last week you had your husband on the bag instead of Brad.  How was that experience for you?
 INBEE PARK:   Well, I really enjoyed that experience.  I just love playing golf in Scotland itself, but my husband being on the bag for that week was really special.  Played really well as well, and he did well as well, so happy with that.
 Q. That was nice.  And now obviously have got Brad back on the bag here.  How important has it been for you to come back and play golf on the LPGA after the COVID break?
 INBEE PARK:   Well, I think I really missed the competition and everyone out here, but I think for safety it was the most important thing that we needed to think about.
 I think things are getting a little bit better now.  I think we know how to protect ourselves and we know how to stay away from each other.
 I'm really glad that we are back here and the protocols that we are doing, and LPGA is doing a great job of keeping everyone safe while they're playing.  I've seen a lot of people competing (indiscernible.)
 Q. You've been at the top of your game now for a number of years.  You've achieved just about everything that anybody could wish for in the women's game.  What keeps you motivated?
 INBEE PARK:   Just about everything.  Some moments I really try to find motivation, but kind of learned that everything can be my motivation.  Could be for mom this week, could be for dad this week, could be for my husband this week, it could be just for the fans at that cheer for me.
 I think it's just everything.  Just change your thoughts I think is what is important.  If you think that there is there is no motivation, there is no motivation.  If you think there is motivation, there is always motivation.
