Q.   Just three shots back after two rounds.   You've been playing really well the last couple months.   Talk about your day? 
INBEE PARK:   It was a good ball striking day.   I was happy with the way I was hitting the ball, but it wasn't the best putting day.   I left three or four out there, but it happens. 
I'm still happy with my stroke, and I'm really confident with the putter, even if it didn't go in.   So maybe it will fall in the next two days.

Q.   Just 3 shots back.   Obviously, you can handle 3 shots.   Just talk about the weekend.   36 holes left, what is your goal? 
INBEE PARK:   I think I've got to shoot a pretty low number in the next two days to win the tournament. 
If my putter works, I think I can do it.   Just play my own game the next two days and maybe.
