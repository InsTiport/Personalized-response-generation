Q.   Probably a little disappointing your score today.   What happened out there?
INBEE PARK:   I just hit it to the place that I shouldn't, you know, but really disappointing day today.   I had three doubles today, which didn't really help, but I think no doubles out there tomorrow will be good. 
Course played very tough today.   The fairways are really firm, and the greens were really, really firm, and the greens are really quick.   But I still did ‑‑ I scrambled a little better today, but I need a little bit better number tomorrow, I think.

Q.   Did the wind affect you much at all?
INBEE PARK:   I think it was the toughest day out there, and the wind and everything just really, you know, firmed up, so that I think really made a tough day.

Q.   Is Na Yeon too far ahead of you guys to catch her or do you think you have something in you to try to catch up to her?
INBEE PARK:   Just like today, if you look at the scoring, anything can happen out there, so I will just go tomorrow and going to go low tomorrow and see what happens.

Q.   Do you think you have that in you?
INBEE PARK:   I'll try.
