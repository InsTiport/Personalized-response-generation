 Q.   You shot 70 today, 7â€‘under overall.   You're in the hunt.   Just talk about your day?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, the front nine was really disappointing for me because I left a lot of putts out there and missed a lot of short putts on the front nine.   But I'm really happy the way I played the back nine.   I played solid on the back nine and able to hole some putts on the back nine.   
I'm happy with the way I finished today, and hopefully I'll go out there tomorrow and shoot a low number and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   You were very young when you started to win.   We've got a leader who is 15 years old right now.   Just some thoughts on what it would be like to be in that position, and if you're surprised to see her there?   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I heard she was a really good player and some of these young amateurs can play golf.   It's not a big surprise, but I would be nervous if I was her.   So we'll see tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you've got 18 holes left and two shots back.   What is your strategy for tomorrow?   
INBEE PARK:   I mean, these greens are really tricky to read, especially the front nine is really tough.   So I try to hit some good putts on the front nine and give myself a lot of opportunities on the back nine, hopefully, that will be enough.  
   
 Q.   Do you think the more players there are putting pressure on her going into the final round, do you think that could help you catch her?   
INBEE PARK:   I don't think it really matters how many people are tied or in the hunt.   Tomorrow's going to be a shootout tomorrow because there are a lot of people in contention, and tough play good tomorrow to win.
