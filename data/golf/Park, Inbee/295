   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  In-Bee, thanks for coming in and joining us today.  You're the leader in the clubhouse with a 5 under 67.  You had five birdies out there on a difficult course and with difficult wind.  How does it feel to play as well as did you in these difficult conditions? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Yes, it was a tough condition to play in.  There was a lot of wind out there than I thought it would be, and some holes were playing tricky. 
 But I was able to handle myself calm, and I played very well today, so it was good. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over your scorecard, starting with your first birdie on hole 5? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Hole 5, I hit my second shot close to the green, and I got a good up-and-down from there. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club did you use? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  I hit a 3-wood off the second shot.  And just a 56-degree wedge into the green. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How close to the green? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Well, five feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay.  The birdie on 7 what, club did you use on your first shot there?  It was a par 3. 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Yes, I'm trying to think.  Oh, I hit a 6-iron, it was short, below the hole.  It was about 40 feet.  It was a very long putt.  And I made a really good roll it in and made that one. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Very nice.  Okay, birdie on 11? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  No. 11, 3-wood into the green.  Missed it just left short of the bunker, and then I got up-and-down 56-degree wedge.  About six feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay, birdie on 12, another par 3. 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Yes, I hit a 5-iron into the green.  And about 20 feet, made that putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Some very long putts today.  And 14, what did you use on your second shot? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  I'm having a difficult time trying to figure these holes out. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Par 4, 390 yards. 
 IN-BEE PARK:  There are so many, I can't really remember. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  I don't know a description of it or I could help you out.  It was number 14, 390 yards. 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Oh, okay, I remember.  I hit a 3-wood off the tee and 9-iron to the green about 10 feet. 

 Q.  She said hole 7 you made a 40-foot putt? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Yeah. 

 Q.  You said you were putting? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  Well, I actually have a new caddie this week.  My friend is caddying for me this week.  He's from California, and he's not a professional caddie, but he's a good player.  And he really helped me with the breaks, reading the breaks. 
He read the breaks good today, and I made a lot of putts.  I only had 24 putts today, so, yeah. 

 Q.  Does he live in the Bay Area? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  He lives in L.A.  He just flew up here to help me out. 

 Q.  How key was that to have him? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  I think so far, so good.  We'll see. 

 Q.  How do you know him? 
 IN-BEE PARK:  He's a friend of mine from Junior golf.  Yeah, he played on many tours. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Thank you.
