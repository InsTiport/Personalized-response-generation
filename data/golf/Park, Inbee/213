Q. Slow start.   How did you dig out of the hole?
INBEE PARK:   I think it was just like I didn't have much feeling that it was a tournament because it has been a while since I played a golf tournament.   I think I was a little bit nervous.
Bogey, bogey, and, yeah, it's a tournament, so I think I should start playing better.   I think I just didn't realize.   I think it was a little bit off today on the front nine, and then I finally realized I was in a real tournament.
So, yeah, just putting and a little bit ‑‑ couple bad drives on the front nine.   Back nine obviously everything worked pretty good, so really confident.

Q.   Playing off of Stacy and Suzann, they started kind of building up, too. 
INBEE PARK:   Stacy had I think an up and down day, too.   Suzann had pretty consistent day.   It was fun playing with those two.   I think all three of us played really different type of game today.   It was fun to watch. 

Q.   That's all I need.   Thanks Inbee.
