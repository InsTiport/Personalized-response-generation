 Q.  19-time winner on the LPGA Tour, Inbee Park.  After sitting out so much of last year, your caddie said he saw some hunger in you this week.  Were you hungry for another win?  
INBEE PARK: I didn't expect to win very early, I mean obviously, after a long break.  In Singapore I felt like my ball striking was quite good I and just needed to work on the putter a little bit.   
It has worked pretty good this week.
