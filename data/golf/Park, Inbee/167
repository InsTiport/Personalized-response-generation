 Q. Just a tough day out there overall?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   It was similar to yesterday, but just nothing dropped.   It was horrible putting.   That's it.  
   
 Q.   Is there a low round out there tomorrow?  
INBEE PARK:   If my putter goes in.   Ball striking is right there.   I can shoot 5â€‘under easy if putting is going in, but just nothing is dropping.  
   
 Q.   Are you thinking about the pressure at all, or is this just any other week for you?  
INBEE PARK:   Yesterday I felt kind of pressure, but today I really played with low pressure.   I didn't think so much about anything else today.  
Somehow just never dropped.   
   
 Q.   What's the game plan for tomorrow?  
INBEE PARK:   I'm in the middle of the pack, so just go out there and enjoy.  
   
 Q.   The Race to the CME is still up for debate at this point.   No one is really running away with that.   Is that good to see coming off the golf course after a tough today?  
INBEE PARK:   I played so bad, so now I really care less about what happens.   
You know, play two days with good golf and see what happens.   I can't control anybody else's game, so...
