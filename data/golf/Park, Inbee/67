Q. Inbee, fantastic start to the week, 3-under par, bogey-free.  This is your first time playing the Ladies Scottish Open but you obviously have experience on links courses.  How did that work out for you today?
INBEE PARK: Played well today.  A couple of missed tee shots but that was about it.  I didn't really make much of a mistake.  Probably could have made more putts.  I had a lot of opportunities out there today.
But I played a bogey-free round, which is very, very good around this golf course, and the windy conditions.  So yeah, hopefully we can stay under the wind for the rest of the week.
Q. The bogey-free out here is really impressive.  There's not many bogey-free rounds today.  What was it you were doing so well?  If you were driving it a bit off, what were you doing?
INBEE PARK: The second shot was on pretty much.  Only a couple missed shots.  I hit a lot of greens and I was very good around the greens when I missed the greens.
Q. The past champion at the RICOH Women's British Open at Turnberry in 2015, you didn't manage to play last year because you were injured.  Looking forward to returning to Scotland and trying to win that title again?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it's always exciting to play in Scotland.  You know, I love playing the links golf courses, and especially playing the week before the British Open, playing in Scotland, preparing for the next week is a great preparation.
Q. Have you had a chance to play Kingsbarns yet?
INBEE PARK: No, first time next week.
