Q. Solid round, 3-under 68.  How would you sum up your final round in these really cold conditions here on Cypress today?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I played just over 12 holes today this morning and it was definitely a little different condition.  It was colder, balls were going a lot shorter and it was tough out there today.  But I'm just really happy that I was able to finally conquer this golf course, I was able to shoot an under par on this golf course, I'm just really happy to leave with the under par score on this golf course.
Q. There in the middle of the round you had back-to-back birdies, 13 and 14.  Just take me through the chip in from the back of the green on the par-4 14th.
INBEE PARK:   I just hit a really good shot in there, it just ran through the green and it was a pretty easy chip.  I thought that it would be nice to just make a par or even a birdie if it was possible and just, I hit it perfectly the way I wanted to and it just went in.
The next hole, I hit -- actually it was a little bit of a miss shot, I hit a little bit of a little heavy on the second shot and it just made it release a lot, so it just went all the way to the hole and I had about 7-, 8-footer for the birdie, so...
Q. Two-time champion of this event.  What are the leaders going to face coming down the stretch when it is playing this tough out there in the final round of a major championship like this?
INBEE PARK:   You know, the last few holes were a little bit downwind, so it's going to be, I think the key would be trying to keeping the ball on the green.  I mean, you are hitting probably a little bit shorter irons into the green, so it's going to be a little bit easier than the last few days.  But the greens are getting faster and it's finally drying up a little bit.
So, yeah, just trying to run at pars and par is always a good score.
