INBEE PARK:   It was pretty crazy out there yesterday and today.  It was the toughest conditions I've ever played, and obviously today was pretty tough in the morning with the wind and the rain.  So I was just trying to make pars and the par is really tough out there.  Then I kind of learned a little bit from yesterday, I didn't play as well as I wanted to play, but I kind of just kept telling myself that you can never give up on these kind of conditions, and let's just try to make some good pars and not to lose too many shots.  That's what I did today, and especially a long putt birdie on the last was a great way to finish.
Q. Only one blemish on the card with the bogey right before you made the turn.  What happened there?
INBEE PARK:   That was pretty much the only tee shot that I missed today.  It was in the fairway bunker, so I had to just -- it was actually a good bogey.  I almost made a double.  So if you miss your tee shot in the fairway bunker, it's almost impossible to get up-and-down for par.  That's the only missed shot I've had today.
Q. You said you would forgive your husband for any mistakes out there while he's on your bag.  How has that been going for you over these past few days?
INBEE PARK:   He's been really good.  A couple of decisions may that I had was probably wrong.  It was No. 16, I hit into the water twice yesterday.  We laid up in the water.  Today we tried to go over the water but we went into in the water.  That was the only hole maybe we have to change the plan the next two days.
Q. Is he getting better at yardages and picks out clubs?
INBEE PARK:   He's doing great.  He's doing a really good job.  This is not an easy condition to caddie in.  This is probably the toughest caddie job that he's going to ever have to do. I'm just really happy that he's by my side and he's done a great job.
Q. What does it do for your confidence, being under par in these kind of conditions heading into the weekend?
INBEE PARK:   I really thought that it was almost impossible to shoot under par on the golf course in these conditions, but I kind of told myself that now I can do it.  It gives me confidence going into the next two days.
Q. Do you think about past memories here at The Open?
INBEE PARK:   Of course.  2015 I won in Turnberry and I was able to complete my Grand Slam, and not far away from here.  So it has really, really good memories.  Like I said, it has been pretty crazy to say that I enjoy playing in Scotland, but it is one of my favorite place to play, and to come and compete.  So yeah, I'm not going to say I'm enjoying this weather, but it is fun competing in this weather, yeah.
