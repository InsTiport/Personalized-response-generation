Q. Thoughts on the day?
INBEE PARK: Trying to get some confidence and trying to work on the stuff that I need to do, learn something from the golf course, and that's what I exactly did last week.  Seems like it has been helping me to play this week.
Q. So confidence is on the up at this tournament?
INBEE PARK: Well, I wouldn't say everything is perfect.  But obviously I am moving the right direction.  I have gained some confidence over last week, and obviously today.
Q. How did you find that after having six months off?  How have you managed to get your game into shape so quickly, because a lot of people take a while to get back.
INBEE PARK: I think it just all comes down to hard work.  Obviously I took some break and obviously because of the break, I felt like I had to work harder for the last couple months before I came out to play.
You know, I worked hard and I knew that it was going to take some time and it wasn't just going to come back right away.  Today's round is very good for me, and obviously I was able to get some confidence on the golf course.  Obviously my putter was a little bit better today than last week, so that's a really good sign.
Q. Some people come off the Christmas break and are like, I'm feeling rusty and you've come off a massive break.  Is it course management or what is it that you find that you're struggling with?
INBEE PARK: I still feel like I'm a little bit rusty.  Hopefully that rust goes away as quick as possible.  But obviously the most important thing is, you know, one round doesn't really matter.  I have to do this for the rest of the three days, and that's what it really takes to win a golf championship.
I am trying to get the ball-striking going and hit some more putts.
Q. Have you had a look at the notes from the R&A about the rules for 2019?
INBEE PARK: No, I haven't.
Q. One of the things is about laying up, not having somebody there lining you up.  Do you agree with that or not?
INBEE PARK: So we're not allowed?
Q. In 2019, you won't be allowed to have help lining up?
INBEE PARK: I think that's good because I don't use anyone to line me up, and I don't think that's doing any good to the players, anyway.  I think the player, you know, they rely on their feel and sometimes they can aim to the left and hit the target or aim more to the right and hit the target, and they have the abilities to do that.  I think it's pretty fair.
Q. What two holes made you most pleased today?
INBEE PARK: There was some longer putts I made today on No. 6 I think.  That was the longest putt I've made in, what, after the Olympics?  So about six months.  I think it was about maybe a 30-footer, 40-footer.  That gives me some confidence on the putting surface.  Obviously I wasn't able to hold it last week.
Q. What was your worst hole?
INBEE PARK: I did not make any bogeys today, so even if I missed a birdie opportunity, I wouldn't say that's the worst.
