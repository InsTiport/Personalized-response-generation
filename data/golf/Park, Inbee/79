Q. Another good round, how did you feel about today?  Some ups and downs.
INBEE PARK: It was really very consistent.  My ball-striking was consistent, but I just could not hole like one putt out there.  I holed two long ones, but I couldn't hole everything else.  Anything inside five to ten feet today, six, seven of them I missed today.  So a little bit disappointing obviously but it's good my ball-striking is still there.
Q. Not missing by much, so you're hitting a good putt but it's just luck of the draw on the day or do you have something to work on?
INBEE PARK: There's been a couple of bad reads obviously, and these greens are pretty tough to read.  I don't know, I mean, I really can't tell whether I read them bad.  I don't feel like I hit that bad of a stroke.  It has to be maybe wrong read.
Q. But all in all, you're still in a very, very good place ahead of tomorrow.
INBEE PARK: I think so, yeah.  Not far back, and obviously at this golf course, if you can drop some putts, there are a few birdies out there.  Yeah, you know, go out there tomorrow and just play aggressively and hopefully the putts can drop.
Q. And if at the start of the week, you could think of yourself in this position, you would have been happy to be in this position?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, of course.  It's somewhere I always aim myself of being, and obviously it was a good week.  Just sort of a few more putts should have dropped but just didn't drop, but obviously I'm going to stay patient.
