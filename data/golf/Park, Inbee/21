  Q. Inbee, an up-and-down day but certainly some highlights.  What is it like for you to be consistent throughout this major?
 INBEE PARK:   It is tough conditions but probably today was the most easiest day that we had for the last three days.  A little disappointing day.  Started off really good but I hit one bad shot that was lost, so double and 3-putts on the last to finish was disappointing.  One more day, don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, and just do my best tomorrow and see what happens.
 Q. What has it been like adjusting to the weather over the last few days?
 INBEE PARK:   Wind direction was a little bit different to the last couple days, and obviously the front nine was a lot less wind, and it got a little bit tougher coming into the back nine.  A little tougher conditions on the back nine, but I wasn't able to play as well as the front nine, so just a little bit disappointing.
 Q. But with one round here to go, former champion yourself, you said there are so many good memories; are you taking in those memories and thinking about those as you enter into tomorrow?
 INBEE PARK:   Yeah, being in Scotland reminds me of a lot of good memories.  I've played numerous times in this country and I have to say it's one of the toughest golfing conditions to play, but it is also fun at the same time and we don't get to experience that every time.  So it's almost once-a-year kind of thing, and yeah, it's just one more day to go.
