  Q. Inbee, obviously a different golf course today with all the weather that came through last night.  A little more moisture, a little wetter.  Just take me through how was Cypress playing today?
 INBEE PARK:   It was playing really, really long, and that's all I could say, because I hit probably seven or eight times 3-wood into the greens and we were getting muddy balls.  Almost every single shot we had to deal with the muddy ball, and, yeah, wasn't easy out there.
 Just really long and mudball.  Just really tough to score.
 Q. Two-time champion of this event.  If you were to just say, what are the leaders going to face coming down the stretch here in round three?
 INBEE PARK:   I just think the course is playing really long so they're going to be hitting a lot of long clubs into the greens, and obviously with the mudball you just don't know where the ball is going to go.
 Just got to stay patient out there.  Just got to probably do a lot of scrambling on the greens, yeah.
 Q. Did the greens play much differently than...
 INBEE PARK:   Greens are playing a little bit slower than the first day because there is some moisture on it.
 Yeah, it's just pretty much getting to the green is the problem at the moment.
