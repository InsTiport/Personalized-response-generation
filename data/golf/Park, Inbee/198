Q.   Okay, we're here with Inbee Park.   Inbee, you had the low round for the day.   What was working for you out there? 
INBEE PARK:   Today was I think a little bit of everything.   Was very good putting day and I hit a lot of fairways.   That was very important.   It was quite windy today and cold, so the only thing was I got a little bit lucky with the weather.   I only had to play in the rain for four holes, so that was really lucky. 
I was really doubting.   I was feeling bad the last couple days and thought I wasn't going to be able to play this week.   I was food poison for last two, three days.   I haven't really ate anything for last couple days or anything like that, so I just don't have much energy.
It was a surprising day for me.   Just glad I finished the round. 

Q.   With the cold weather could you drink a lot?   Were you drinking a lot while you were out there? 
INBEE PARK:   I try to drink a lot, but as soon as I try to eat or drink something it's just still coming out.   It's tough to eat or drink at the time, so I'm trying to eat like a little bit at a time and trying to be healthier.
So try to get a lot of rest today and hopefully I can, yeah, finish the rounds.

Q.   You had birdies 13, 14, 15?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah. 

Q.   Talk a little bit about those three holes. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, 15th hole was‑‑ the par three, I hit 5‑iron that was about five feet from the hole.   Holed that.
No. 14 was 2‑putt birdie from the par‑5.
13 was about 20‑, 25‑footer.

Q.   So the plan for tonight go home, get rest, hydrate, try to eat a little? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I had like very bad fever overnight, so, yeah, hopefully I don't get that so I can sleep some.
