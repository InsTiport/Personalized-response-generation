Q.   How would you describe that round? 
INBEE PARK:   It was great.   I had hit the ball so good today.   I mean, I didn't miss many shots out there.   Gave a lot of opportunities at birdie in this kind of conditions where there was wind and fog.   Everything was very tough conditions out there to play in. 
I think I really played good out there.   I mean, it really made me think today that with the wind and fog, it just really made me think.   I think that is what the U.S. Open is all about.

Q.   (Inaudible) what happened? 
INBEE PARK:   I think just a couple of bad shots on the front nine.   I mean, No. 7 on the par‑3 was in more the wind that really took that ball away. 
And I mean, I didn't miss many shots out there I don't think today.   I probably left a couple of putts out there on No. 10 through 12.   But it just happens.   I got a couple back on the back nine, so it was good. 

Q.   The putt from off the green on 13, can you describe that?   What was that like?
INBEE PARK:   I think it was just giving it back to me for missing 3.   I think I just had to be away from the hole.   I mean, everything that was close from the hole was not going in, and then everything that was farther away from the hole was going in today.   It was weird.

Q.   You had two putts today from off the green, right? 
INBEE PARK:   It was a weird putting day.   I didn't make 10 or 15‑footers today, but I made 30‑footers.   That really makes up.

Q.   How would you describe today?   There was all kinds of different conditions.   It was sunny, hot, cold?
INBEE PARK:   Kind of like four different seasons in one day.   You kind of expect it with the ocean here.   I think it's tough to play in the fog because you can't see it.   You can't see your target.   I think that was the toughest thing.   The wind, I think it was always coming in to factor this week.   Especially in the weekend it will definitely come into play, so now is a good practice.

Q.   At what point did you get to where you couldn't see your shots come down?   16 or 17? 
INBEE PARK:   On 16, I was able to see it. 
And then 17, it just got a little bit very foggy and last hole was very foggy, but I see it to until about 150yards and that was it.   I really wanted to finish today and get a good rest and be fresh for tomorrow.

Q.   You are marching towards history.   Do you allow yourself to think about that?
INBEE PARK:   It's tough not to think about it, but I'm‑‑ I just try to think that's not a big deal.   If I want to do it so much, it's just so tough and it puts too much pressure on you.   Try to not think about so much.

Q.   When the fog first starts coming in, it's still a very easy thought that you'd still rather get that round over with as opposed to having to stop?
INBEE PARK:   I mean, it was just the one hole that we needed to play, so, I mean, I would definitely play it anyways.   You know what the hole looks like, you just really need to trust in yourself.

Q.   Do you think you could have shot like 65 today with the way you were sticking‑‑
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think I could have shot 65 today if my putter was really going.   Yeah, but I mean, 4‑under is I think good enough for this golf course.
