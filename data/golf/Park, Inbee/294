   MIKE SCANLAN: Thanks for coming in, great round out there, 5-under, you're tied for the lead. You've had a pretty good year so far and you're chasing after that win. How do you feel you're playing this week.
 INBEE PARK: I had a good round today and my game is going very good this year and very confident with my game this year. Today was a good round. I had good iron shots and really good putting today so just keep that for the rest of the week. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Can you talk about how you've been playing all year? Are you happy with where your game is right now.
 INBEE PARK: Much better than last year and I feel like I'm improving and getting much better over the year, so happy with that. 

 Q. What were the playing conditions like? Were the greens soft and accepting shots?
 INBEE PARK: The course is playing a lot longer than the practice round. A little bit longer and softer with the greens. They cut the greens from yesterday.
 So, it wasn't as slow, but it's definitely a longer golf course.

 Q. How much longer? 
 INBEE PARK: Was it well, the wind was coming from the other way today than from the practice rounds, so it's really different. It tough to tell how much longer it was, but it was definitely longer.

 Q. What type of scores do you expect for the rest of the day? Do you think five will hold up? 
 INBEE PARK: It's a scoreable golf course. People who hit good iron shots will stick by the pins, so we'll see. 
 MIKE SCANLAN: Thanks for coming in.
