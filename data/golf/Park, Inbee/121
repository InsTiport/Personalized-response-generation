 Q.  Pretty good round today?  Feeling it out there a little bit for a while there?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was much better putting day than yesterday.  Made a lot of birdies, but could have been better if I didn't make three bogeys.   
I feel good about the putter after the round like today, so something to take for the next two days.   
 Q.  Usually seems like once your putter gets rolling you that's usually when you win.  Is that pretty accurate in your opinion?  
INBEE PARK: Yesterday was a really bad putting day but today was much better.  Putting is really key to success on every golf course, and especially this golf course.   
A lot of short irons and when you have a lot of opportunities you got to make those birdie putts.   
 Q.  I was going to say, Shanshan said this is a putting contest.  Is that pretty accurate in your opinion over the past three years?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think so, because you hit a lot of short irons into the greens and you get a lot of putts within 15 feet.  It's a matter of how many putts you can make inside that range.   
 Q.  No one is really running away with it right now.  Is that good to see heading into the weekend?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I mean, closer is always better.  7-under, 8-under is possible on this golf course, nobody is really out it.   
 Q.  I know you said you wanted to win; you've seen Lydia win twice.  Feel like it's about your time again?  Seems like it's been back and forth all year.  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, no, only has been couple months, but it's definitely felt longer.  Everybody is always wanting to win, and that's what I'm trying to play for.
