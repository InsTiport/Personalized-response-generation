Q. Take us through what happened today.
INBEE PARK: It was not a bad day at all. I mean, the course played quite easy out there with almost no wind. It was perfect conditions for golf. But obviously I could have shot a few better, but I I really wasn't in full control of my ball‑striking today. I hit a couple of bad shots which cost me bogeys. 
Could have done better. A little bit disappointed but obviously it's not a bad round at all. A 3‑under round is not bad. Just trying to battle it out with better‑ball striking as the day goes on. We have three more days to play and just try to get better every day.

Q. Wondering if you noticed Donald Trump had landed his helicopter in the middle of your backswing; did you see the helicopter at all?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was just when I was practicing, and obviously I see his helicopter there. It looks nice.
