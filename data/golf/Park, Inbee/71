Q. Saw you just gave So Yeon a big hug.  What did you tell her?
INBEE PARK: Just tell her good luck.   She is really ready to win and she had a lot of chances this season and last season, as well.  She just needs to pull it off and I was really rooting for her and rooting for myself, as well, when we were playing.  I got a really good playing partner on the course today.  Just a couple, I made a mistake where I shouldn't have played but it was fun playing with her and hopefully she can pull it off.
Q. You've been at the top of the leaderboard with a nice cushion to win a major championship before.  When you found out the penalty, the four-shot penalty assessed to Lexi, what was going through your head?
INBEE PARK: Well, I think, I mean, Lexi has done a very good job holding her mentality through the round today.  I think she had to go through a lot of bad moments out on the course today with the bad news.  It's really unfortunate that it happened, but I think that she had a strong mentality to hold on to it.
