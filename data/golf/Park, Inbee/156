Q.   Another very good day, less windy.   Did that help a lot?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think so.   Yesterday I played five holes and a half, and I still played really good in the wind today, but today was much easier to play, golf.   I think we were on the good side of the draw.   The ball‑striking was great today.   I was really happy with it.   I wasn't really happy with my ball‑striking last week, but I think it's gotten much better this week to play under the wind, and three‑putt bogey on the last, that's been my only mistake today.   Except for that, everything has been pretty solid, and I think I gave myself an opportunity on every hole.   A few more putts drop in, then I can make more birdies.

Q.   How is the putting overall?
INBEE PARK:   It's pretty good.   I think I'm putting much better than last week, and I feel like I can roll the ball straighter.   That's all that matters, whether it goes in or not.

Q.   What's the plan for now for the break?   Will you go back, stay here?
INBEE PARK:   I'll go back.   I think the last group is like at 3:00? 

Q.   It's going to be late. 
INBEE PARK:   It's going to be another tough day tomorrow obviously, and today, so we'll see what it comes down to, and yeah, I'll go rest up and get ready.

Q.   Do you do anything in particular to get ready for long days like this?
INBEE PARK:   Just relax and lay in my bed and just do nothing because you have to do a lot of things once you come out to the golf course.

Q.   So relax as much as possible?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   A tough weekend, Saturday and Sunday.
