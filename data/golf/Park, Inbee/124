Q.   Happy with the way things turned out today?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, it was a long day for me today.   I played like three holes in the morning and then another delay, so it was a long day.
But made no bogeys today, which is really good.   I feel like I played pretty solid last couple days.   Still feel like I left few out there.
Yes, satisfied where I am.

Q.   The front nine you really lit up scoring; not so much in the back until the last hole.   Was that a change in the weather conditions?
INBEE PARK:   I don't know.   Nothing really wanted to drop on the back nine.   Made ten straight pars, which wasn't really fun.   But obviously finish with a birdie is always great going into tomorrow.

Q.   How much do you know about Q and Ha Na?
INBEE PARK:   I know them actually really well.   Q is one of my best friends out here.   Same management company as me.   I really know their game really.   They're of course young and talented players. 
Yeah, looking forward to seeing them a lot more often.

Q.   What impresses you about both their games? 
INBEE PARK:   They both hit it pretty long, pretty straight.   I mean, there are so many young players out here who hit it so straight and long. 
They are one of them for sure.   Yeah, they're still young.   They're only like 20, so... 

Q.   Giving them a warning you're coming for them tomorrow?
INBEE PARK:   Not yet.   They haven't finished yet.

Q.   You think your experience will play into tomorrow in an advantage over those two?
INBEE PARK:   They definitely know how to win.   I mean, they won a few times on the Korean tour, so they definitely know what the contention feels like.
Yeah, it's going to really depend on my putting condition tomorrow.   If I can make some putts tomorrow, I think (applause disruption.)
Q.How bad do you want to add another tournament to the list that you've won at?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I said earlier in the week I haven't won this week, so it's a challenge.   I haven't played that well on this golf course, so this is probably the best yet.
Yeah, looking forward to tomorrow. 

Q.   How far was the birdie putt on the last hole?
INBEE PARK:   Like three feet.

Q.   Because you had a good approach shot. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah. 

Q.   How far away were you on the approach?
INBEE PARK:   110 yards.

Q.   What club?
INBEE PARK:   46â€‘degree.
