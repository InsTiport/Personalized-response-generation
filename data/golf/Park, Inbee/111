Q. What happened last week?  You played very well.  It looked like you kind of charged up on Sunday.  I was following live scoring.
INBEE PARK: I played good on the first day.  I shot 6-under the first day, but not a great second day.  But every other day I played great.  Yeah, I felt like I was putting a little bit better last week, so that's definitely going to give me confidence coming into this week and playing.  Obviously I think I feel like I really did the right thing playing the sponsor's event, and they really loved it.  I got to meet a lot of Korean fans, and it was great to play on the KLPGA again, to see a lot of young growing professional golfers, and they are very competitive, and it was good to see the growth and the development of the Korean Tour.
Q. Did you check scoring at all that was going on?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, yeah, because all the writers have been like asking me right after the round.  They were telling me, like Lydia is doing well.  Okay, yeah.
Q. So they did not let you not know what was going on?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, yeah.
Q. They made it very apparent?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was good.  I kind of knew it was coming.  Lydia was playing so good, and she played so well the last couple, two to three months, and she obviously loved that golf course, so nothing really surprising.
