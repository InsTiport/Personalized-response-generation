Q. Does this feel like anything you thought it would feel like? How good does this moment feel?
INBEE PARK: This is definitely one of the special moments in my golfing career and in my whole life. It feels great. Obviously representing your country, winning the gold, representing your country, it's so special. It's just really all I've wanted. I'm just happy.

Q. How proud are you of yourself to go out and do this on Sunday like that, such a commanding win?
INBEE PARK: It looked like it was really going to blow in the first couple holes and then it really died down. It was good scoring conditions. Obviously my putter just worked so well this week. That was really the key to the Gold Medal this week. Yeah, I fought through injury, and so I'm proud of myself.
This is something I've really been dreaming coming into this week. Representing your country in the Olympic Games and getting a medal, it's such a special feeling. There was so many Korean people out here supporting me, and you know, it almost felt like we were in Korea. Seeing how much support I had this week, and just happy that I finished well, I putted really good, and this is definitely a big relief. 

Q. Speaking of those tough times, talking about the pressure a little bit back home in South Korea, here this week, numerous times we've heard you at news conferences talk about the pressure back home, we've heard you in countless interviews talking about the pressure you're under. How would you describe that pressure?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I had a lot of attention coming into this week. Whether it was a worry or whether it was people thinking she's going to do good‑‑ there was a little bit of confusion from me whether I can perform well this week or not, because I really haven't performed well this year with the injury. 
Being able to overcome injury this week and being able to play good, I've worked really hard for this week and hard work really paid off this week, so I'm really happy.

Q. You're such a popular figure in the United States but also back home in South Korea, you've alluded to the fact that you and your husband would like to start a family. There's a lot of speculation back home as to what the future holds for you in your golf career. Now that you've won this Gold Medal and have done so many things in the game, what are your plans?
INBEE PARK: Eventually I'd like to have a family, but there is no plan for retirement at the moment. I really haven't planned for anything right now, so I'm just going to go day by day and just, yeah, see.
