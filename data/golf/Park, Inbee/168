 Q.   Pretty decent start.   
INBEE PARK:   Just a boring round today.   I think I had many pars and nothing seems like it wants to go in.   I gave myself a lot of the opportunities, and I feel like I played really, really well, but it's just nothing seemed to drop.   
We still have so much golf play.   Hopefully I can drop some putts tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   None of the top nine really went away from anyone.   Everyone stayed in the same kind of territory.   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I think it just makes it really a lot more exciting.   I think whoever makes a move on the second and third round is going to be in contention.  
   
 Q.   Is this kind of the perfect season for you, having $1 million on the line, the Vare Trophy, Rolex Player of the Year?   I mean, all of the goals you had for the season are in your grasp this week.   
INBEE PARK:   It's tough to have everything in one week obviously, but I'm in a really good position.   I put myself in a really good position.   I played really, really well this season.   
Just happy that I still have a chance to win everything.   So, yeah, I'm going to play very hard next three days.  
   
 Q.   Think about the $1 million at all?  
INBEE PARK:   I think everybody is thinking about the $1 million, yeah.  
   
 Q.   Do you sense more buzz around the tour this year at the end of the year with this on the line?   Having this playoff system?   
INBEE PARK:   I think it's definitely more exciting until the end.   It seems like last couple events everybody is saying they just want to enjoy and not care so much about the results, but everybody cares about the results now.   
For the fans I think it's great because it's so much fun.
