 Q.  A 4-under round on moving day.  Happy with the way you played?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think things are getting a little bit better and better every day it goes.  2-under, 3-under, 4-under, so a little bit better every day is good sign.  Today I putted a little bit better than the other two days.   
It's a good sign.  Happy with the round today.   
 Q.  Put yourself in contention for the final round of a major.  What's your plan for tomorrow?  
INBEE PARK: Just trying to play a little better every day is going to be my good goal.  Scores look pretty as of today, so hopefully can keep that going tomorrow.   
 Q.  Have you thought at all about the super career Grand Slam that you would get if you won here?  
INBEE PARK: You know, every time I play Evian I kind of think about it.  If it happens, it happens; if it doesn't, it doesn't.  I'm just trying to play better golf every day and that's what I'm trying to focus on.
