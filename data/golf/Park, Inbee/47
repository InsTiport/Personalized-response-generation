Q. (Recording in progress.)...satisfaction from that?  It's the third time.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it's good to be back, obviously, in No. 1 spot.  That really wasn't my goal playing this year; just came as present.  So it's great.
I mean, but everything, all the rankings are so close together.  It can change every week.  It's just hard to keep track.  I'm just trying to play golf, and doesn't matter where I am at.
But if I can get back to No. 1 spot, that's good.
Q. What do I take from today's round?  What was positive?  What was negative?
INBEE PARK: You know, pretty good play throughout the couple months of golf for me.  Last couple months have been good ball striking.  Everything has been pretty consistent.
Just on the greens was just a little bit different.  Some days I was really good and some days I was really bad.
So everything is good.  Just got to work on the little putting.  That's it, yeah.
Q. The shot on the short par-4, you hit 9-iron from 14, normally No.  15.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, yeah, I just got a really bad number there.  I was really in between the club there, and couldn't hit the other one.  It was going to be in the bunker.
So I have to control with the 9-iron, but I pull a little bit and then it just flew too much.  I got a great up and down from there.
Q. (Indiscernible) the recovery shot was also...
INBEE PARK: I thought that was really good, yeah.  It was a tough shot.
Q. (Indiscernible.)
INBEE PARK: I think Moriya was playing really good golf out there today.  I think I got to maybe one shot of the lead on the front nine and she made a few birdies after that.
I mean, I didn't give up until the end, but she played very solid.
