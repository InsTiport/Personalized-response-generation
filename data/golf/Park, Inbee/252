 Q.   All right, Inbee.   You're a major champion for the third time in your career, first time at the LPGA championship.   Tell us how it feels.   
INBEE PARK:   It feels great.   It was a tough day out there.   I didn't hit many fairways out there and I was scrambling really well out there.  
I think I was actually really lucky to get in the playoff.   The amount of fairways I was missing today it's almost a miracle that I won today.   I think I got a little lucky there, too.   And I really tried to fight off and tried not to give up.   That really paid off.   
   
 Q.   Just talk about the back nine.   A couple of bogeys.   You kind of let a few people back into it.   And to come back and win in a three‑hole playoff, how does that feel?  
INBEE PARK:   I felt really good with my swing and everything on the front nine.   I mean the front 18 holes.   But then the final round I think I was getting a little bit tired.   I don't know.   Just couldn't get ‑‑ figure out the right swing, you know, but finally, you know, hit three fairways in the playoff, you know, it helped me a lot.  
And just very happy to win here at Wegmans with all these fans here.   I mean they've been great supporter of the LPGA, and yeah, they've been great.  
   
 Q.   You're playing 36 holes with Morgan.   At what point were you aware with Catriona being in and being who you ended up being matched up with?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I played with Morgan pretty much all day 35 holes and then I got to the last hole and I saw the board and Catriona was right there if I made a bogey.   So I really played with Catriona for three holes and the rest of the day I played with Morgan.  
   
 Q.   Was this the most exhausting day of golf you've had?   I mean to go 36 and then extra holes.   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean I wasn't looking forward to going extra holes today, but yeah, it was a tough day out there, very tired and especially when you're missing that many fairways and have to go from the rough, that's a really tough day.  
   
 Q.   What's this championship mean to you, winning the Wegmans LPGA championship?  
INBEE PARK:   This is a major tournament and it's always in your memory for a long time and I always love to come to Rochester and playing here.   
Yeah, I mean this became a major tournament and this golf course I love and finally winning here just feels great.
