 Q.  How have you felt through two days so far?  
INBEE PARK: Pretty consistent play yesterday and today.  You know, both in the 60s, which is good.  Ball striking was much better today than yesterday.  I had a lot more opportunities today, but I wasn't able to make any birdies on the par-5s today.   
The ball striking was good, but I just couldn't take advantage of it.  A little bit disappointing today because I was hitting the ball so good today.   
Except for that, I think last two days has been pretty good days of golf.  I haven't made many mistakes out there, so...   
 Q.  What would it mean to you to win this tournament?  
INBEE PARK: It'll mean huge because obviously I've won Evian in 2012, but it wasn't a major back then.  Many people has been asking me, Maybe you should win again because it became a major.   
So, yeah, I think it's a great event to have in your career again.  Yeah, I still have my name on the trophy, but I think it'll be just really nice to put it twice on the trophy.   
Yeah, good one to have for sure.   
 Q.  What do you like most about this place, being in France, and Evian?  
INBEE PARK: I think it's a beautiful place.  I know the golf course is not the easiest golf course, and I have been struggling on this golf course, except for that year in 2012.   
Yeah, this year it has been going smoothly so far.  Yeah, hopefully everything clicks in on the weekend.
