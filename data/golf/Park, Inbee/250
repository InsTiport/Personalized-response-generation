 Q.   Both of you just tell me how you played.   Morgan?  
MORGAN PRESSEL:   You know, I scrambled out there, but I scrambled well.  
I didn't make ‑‑ I mean I had a good string of three birdies, but I could have certainly made some more.   And I just need to hit a few more drives in the fairway.  
   
 Q.   Inbee.  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I putted great today and got up‑and‑down from a lot of places.  
You know, I didn't hit it as good as the last two days ball striking wise, so I think this 18 I gotta hit it a little more straighter.
