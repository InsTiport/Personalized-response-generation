Q. Unbelievable round of golf, another major championship, Grand Slam. How does this feel? 
INBEE PARK: Greatest day of my life yet for sure. It was a great day of golf today. I played great golf out there. Even though I made a couple early mistakes, I was able to hold on really well on the back nine. Obviously got a little bit lucky today. The golfing God was on my side for sure. Had a couple of good breaks and obviously Jin Young was really good. 

Q. Was there a point out there today that you knew you had a chance to still win? 
INBEE PARK: Not for a while. I thought after I made a couple of birdies on No. 2 and 3, I thought I might have a chance. But then I made bogeys, and I thought, maybe I won't have a chance. 
After I finally made an eagle on No. 14, I thought, I've still got to make a couple more, but I thought, I have a little bit of a chance. Obviously I thought the winning score was going be to like 13â€‘under. 

Q. How satisfying is the Grand Slam? 
INBEE PARK: That's been my goal of the career, and I've achieved it at the age of 27. So I don't know what the next goal will be but I've got to set some kind of goal. Just seemed so far and so hard that I couldn't achieve the Grand Slam, and I'm here and I've finally done it. It just felt easier. 

Q. You've got another major coming up very soon.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, there's many more tournaments, many more majors and many more things to do, so I'm sure I'll find something to do. Yeah, it's great.
