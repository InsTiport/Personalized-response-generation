 Q.   Defending champion, Inbee Park.   Inbee, evenâ€‘par round today.   Kind of walk us through it.  
INBEE PARK:   I mean I birdied the first hole and then I had a bad No. 3 hole.   
I hit it into the water once today, and I hit it out of bounds once today.   
It was just one of those kind of days.   Nothing went really wrong, but just a couple of bad shots that really penalized me today, so yeah, I feel like I didn't play that well, but just a couple of bad shots.   That's all.  
   
 Q.   To score even par, sitting only four back of the lead currently, you have to feel pretty good about your chances going forward.  
INBEE PARK:   I mean, yeah, I couldn't do anything today.   I mean I didn't shoot right numbers today, but I still have three more days, and I think there is still a lot of birdies out there, so yeah, I'll just be patient and just wait.
