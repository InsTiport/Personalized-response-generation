  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Inbee Park into the media center.   Just two weeks ago you captured the title in Texas.   You mentioned a little something like, My putter is back.   
Can you go through the changes that you've made?   
INBEE PARK:   I just changed the putter to 2‑ball.   I just feel like I feel a lot more comfortable with the putter.   I putted really good two weeks ago in Texas, and I just feel like my roll on the ball with the putter has been much better.  
Obviously holing some putts, looking at the ball going in the hole that often gives me a lot of confidence.   
Having the result with the win is a great.   Yeah, having twice in a season is a good accomplishment, and very early in the season ‑ I can't say too early.   We're already two third the way.  
Yeah, it's good to have a quick start.   Feel good about the game.  
THE MODERATOR:   You're one the best putters.   That's the strength to your game.   Out here, how should the rest of the field be nervous about it, that your putter is back.   
INBEE PARK:   We have a lot of good competitors.   My ball striking is very consistent this year.   Only problem this year was just a little bit inconsistent putting.   
But if I can putt it good like Texas, I think I'll in contention a lot more often.   Yeah, it'll be good to see the ball go in the hole a lot more often.   Hitting the clutch putts and holing the clutch putts will be exciting.  
MODERATOR:   Fourteen wins, and as you mentioned two wins already this season and we're one third of the through way.   No. 1 ranking is definitely in sight.   What would it mean to regain the No. 1 ranking?   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it'll be great.   It's some place I always been wanting to go obviously.   Even if you know you have been in the position, I really want it too.  
That's not my only priority, because I'm looking to go into a lot of the major tournaments this year.   Obviously few of the Grand Slams, the British Open this year will be my biggest goal for this year and probably for my career.  
No. 1 is great and comes with great golf, but I really want to do Grand Slams.   That will be my main priority.  
MODERATOR:   You'll focus there.   Coming off a win in Texas and then an off week, does your preparation change coming into Kingsmill this week?   
INBEE PARK:   Not exactly.   I think just have a little bit more confidence, play a little bit more aggressively.   You know, try to win this tournament.   
You know, my game plan doesn't really change.   Just trying to play really consistent golf and be patient.   Even if the putts doesn't fall, just try to be patient and play some good golf and just wait for the result.  
MODERATOR:   Now from the other players, they mentioned there are a lot of birdie opportunities.   There are also a lot of challenges, too.   What do you think the key to this course is and coming home with the title on Sunday?   
INBEE PARK:   This golf course I didn't play last year.   I played two years ago.   It was really wet then and golf course was playing a little bit longer than this year.   
This year ball seems like it's running a lot further and we're hitting a lot more short irons.  
I'm guessing there will be more birdies out there and good scoring.   It's going to come down to I think good short irons, and obviously the putting.   
I mean, everybody is going to have a lot of opportunities at birdies.   Just depends how many you're going to make.   Yeah, just hitting good irons shots and holing a lot of putts.  
MODERATOR:   Questions.  
   
 Q.   You mentioned having played here two years ago.   I think you were top 10; maybe seventh place or in that range.   You weren't here last year.   Did you have a scheduling conflict last year?   
INBEE PARK:   I think I justwanted to take ‑‑ I think if I took this one off it was like two weeks off or three weeks off.   I think it just didn't fit in the schedule, so that's why I skipped.   
I mean, I love this golf course and I love the place.   I love to play this tournament, but last year this didn't fit in the schedule.  
Happy to be here.  
   
 Q.   This morning was just nine holes; is that correct?   Do you prefer a nine hole pro‑am as opposed to 18?  
INBEE PARK:   I think as ling as the sponsors like it I think it's good for us.   Nine holes you can give all you got and have a full energy to them and show them whatever you got for nine holes and they get another (indiscernible) for full energy on the back nine.  
So I think it's really good move that LPGA made.   I mean, why not the sponsors wouldn't like it.   They get to experience two professionals and two caddies.   Yeah, I think it's a little bit of everything.   
It's good for us.   We get more time to ourselves to practice, and it's a lot easier to schedule because you have a tournament next day.
