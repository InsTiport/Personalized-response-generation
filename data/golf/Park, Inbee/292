   MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, a former U.S. Women's Open champion, Inbee Park; she won at Minneapolis at Interlachen County Club. She's starting off just right this year with a round of 1-under par, 70.   
 Inbee, did you start on the front or back nine?   
 INBEE PARK: Back nine.   
 MODERATOR: You had a couple of bogeys on No. 12 and No. 13. Would you just tell us about those, please.   
 INBEE PARK: No. 12 my driver was in the first cut, but the lie wasn't that good. My second shot went into the left hazard. So it was actually a good bogey. I made a good bogey there, but No. 13 I missed a short one for a par.   
 MODERATOR: Two-putt?   
 INBEE PARK: Yeah. Hit a bunker shot out about three feet.  
 MODERATOR: And then 14 you birdied.  
 INBEE PARK: Right.   
 MODERATOR: What did you hit to the green and how long was your putt?   
 INBEE PARK: 14 was I hit A-Wedge.  
 MODERATOR: A-Wedge?   
 INBEE PARK: A-Wedge, yeah. It was about 20 feet.   
 MODERATOR: And then 17, you birdied that.  
 INBEE PARK: No. 17 was about 40 yards, 40 yards to about 15 feet.  
 MODERATOR: 15 feet? And then 18 you bogeyed.   
 INBEE PARK: Three-putted from left of the green; 8-iron into the green.  
 MODERATOR: And then turning to the front nine, you birdied the fourth hole. What did you hit there, par-5.  
 INBEE PARK: I hit a 54-degree wedge to 15 feet.   
 MODERATOR: And then your final birdie was at No. 6, the par-3.  
 INBEE PARK: No. 6. 8-iron about 10 feet.   
 MODERATOR: Well, what did you think of the golf course overall? Was it as hard as you thought it might be? That's an awfully good round.   
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, it played very tough. It played very tough, as always. I really enjoy being out there. It was really fun out there. I mean, the course wasn't that much fun, but I just found a way to work it out. It was nice.   
 My putting was really good today. I changed my putter this week. I think that was a little bit of a positive sign.  
 MODERATOR: What kind of putter did you have before?   
 INBEE PARK: I had you Rife, and I changed to Odyssey No. 9.  
 MODERATOR: An Odyssey? Okay. Is there a difference in the way the blade is shaped?   
 INBEE PARK: Um, yes. I don't know how to describe, but...  
 MODERATOR: Putters are such weird shapes these days.  
 INBEE PARK: It's a small head, but the shaft is on this side of it. I don't know how to call it. It's like a mallet.  
 MODERATOR: More like a mallet.   
  
  Q. A backstrike?   
 INBEE PARK: Yeah.   
 MODERATOR: Questions for Inbee?   
  
  Q. You have pants on and long sleeves. Playing in the heat like this, why did you make that decision?  
 INBEE PARK: Well, actually, this material is supposed to make you cooler when the breeze is blowing. But it was a little bit breezy today, so it was okay out there. I like to wear this, because sun doesn't get onto my arms as much so it gives me a little bit of shade.  
 MODERATOR: Did you wet those sleeves at all? Some of the players wet them and then the evaporation cools.   
 INBEE PARK: No, I didn't.  
 MODERATOR: But you wore long pants today?   
 INBEE PARK: Yeah. I mean, this year I've been wearing pants a lot. I just like it.   
 MODERATOR: It's a fashion statement. All right.   
  
  Q. Can you talk about what led to changing putters and doing it the week of the Open? A little bit risky, but did you had nowhere to go but up? Just talk about that.   
 INBEE PARK: Last few weeks I was playing -- I was striking the ball very well last few weeks, but I just couldn't putt the way I wanted it. So maybe this week I wanted to give a little bit of a change so that will give me a new start.   
 MODERATOR: How many putts did you have today, do you know?   
 INBEE PARK: I don't know. Something in 20s, I know that.  
 MODERATOR: 20s on these greens is awfully good. Mercy.
