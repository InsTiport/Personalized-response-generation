 Q.   So you're 2‑over for the tournament.   I know it's not what you wanted going into this week.   What's been the struggles?   
INBEE PARK:   The struggle has been definitely the putter.   I mean, the greens are, you know, really tough to read and I don't like ‑‑ I don't know whether I'm hitting it wrong or reading it wrong, but it just hasn't seemed to go in.  
I mean, today I think I putted a little bit better than other days, but just it was tough conditions with the wind.   
Just didn't play well at all.  
   
 Q.   With everything on the line this week, do you think you might have put a little too much pressure on yourself going in?  
INBEE PARK:   Well, I felt pressure on the first day, but since yesterday I didn't feel much pressure because I just of let everything go and just try to enjoy.   
Just the greens just doesn't seem like helping me, so...  
   
 Q.   What is your approach going into the final round tomorrow, last round of the year?  
INBEE PARK:   I just want to finish off well because it's the last day of the year.   I had a really good year, so I just want to have a good day tomorrow and not to think about so many things.  
   
 Q.   Couple of the other people up there on the Player of the Year race, Race to CME Globe, they're in contention.   What would that mean for the LPGA to have a Sunday come down for the $1 million?  
INBEE PARK:   I think it would be just so much fun for the fans if it's not decided until the end.  
If it comes down to like one putt, one shot, I think it's just going to be so exciting.   Everybody is going to look for this next year, and I think it's going to be great, yeah.
