 Q.  So what was it like playing today with an all-Korean group?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I mean, it was a fun day out there with all-Korean group and a lot of Korean crowds following.  It was good.   
I kind of started off a little bad.  I mean, I hit the ball good, but I just missed a really short one on the front nine.   
I was able to come back strong, so I'm really happy with that.   
 Q.  Do you like where you are on the leaderboard?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah.  I mean, Jin Young played really well out there today.  She putted great; I left few putts out there today.   
The greens around this golf course are just really tough.  No matter I'm leading tomorrow, this green is just so tough.  You just don't know what's going to happen.   
I like where I am.  I did the best I can today.  Unfortunately I missed few putts this week.   
Except for that, everything else has been great.  Yeah, happy with the week.   
 Q.  With the putter change earlier, do you feel good about that?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah.  I feel good about it, but it's really tough to tell on these greens whether the putter is good or not.  No matter which putter you play, it's just kind of tough green to putt.   
 Q.  You're kind of creeping up closer towards being at world No. 1.  Do you think about that?  Do I want it more now that you're getting closer?  
INBEE PARK: No.  To be honest, I never really think about being No. 1 again.  If it comes to me, great; if not, it doesn't matter.   
As long as I am playing good golf, that's what I'm looking forward to.  That number really matter.
