 Q.  Bogey-free 5-under round.  What worked for you today?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it was a really good day out there today.  My putter really worked well.  Hit the ball pretty solid last couple days.  It has been like that actually this year.  I've been pretty happy with the ball striking.  Just my putter wasn't working for the last couple events.   
This week my putter seems to be working a little bit better and really good actually.  Yeah, these greens are really tough to read and you have to be really patient.  That's what I try to do, and it has been working very well.   
 Q.  What's been the key to your ball striking being so consistent this year?  
INBEE PARK: It has been consistent last couple of years, and hopefully I can keep that going for the rest of the season.   
 Q.  You've been in every single round this tournament has had over its ten-year career; it'll be 40 rounds total after the next two.  How has your game changed over the course of these ten years?  
INBEE PARK: I think some years with these poana greens, some years I have been really struggling with the putting.  Some years I have been putting really good.   
I think overall I had some good results in San Diego/Carlsbad, so really happy to be coming to California and playing.  It's always really fun to play over here.  Nice weather and such a nice atmosphere.  I really enjoyed my time with my dog on the beach in off times, so, yeah, it's been a thrill.
