Q.   How do you feel things went? 
INBEE PARK:   Just really similar round to what I had yesterday.   I was a couple over through 13, 14 holes, and then I got a couple back on the last four holes. 
So, yeah, I think that's really the way to play this golf course, and if you are level par or a couple under until 13 or 14, I think you can go really low on the back nine. 
So, yeah, I feel like I lost a couple opportunities.   Like short par putts, I missed a couple of them today.   Just get that fixed tomorrow and that will be better.

Q.   Is that something you might work on this afternoon a little bit ahead of the next two round? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, the weather is just really great, and ball‑striking, everything seems fine.   Just a couple opportunities that I just wasted.   So you know, just trying to really concentrate on the next two days.   Maybe an under‑par round would be great.   I had a level par round for two days, so I think that's a pretty good score for two days.

Q.   Halfway through Wednesday, you talked about how much you want to get this Open at some point and how much you want it.   How do you feel like you're placed? 
INBEE PARK:   I think it would have been great if I had two or three shots better.   There was definitely opportunity where I could have gone a couple under every day.   Yeah, hopefully I can do that tomorrow.   I feel like pretty satisfied but still have two more days to play. 
So I know even if I want to win, I need to go a little bit lower the next two days, because the weather is really good, and a lot of people are going to post a good score today.
