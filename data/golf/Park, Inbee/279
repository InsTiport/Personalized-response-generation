Q.   Did you go out after a minus one or did you want to get more out of it or tell us. 
INBEE PARK:   The way I hit the ball today, I think I could have played a little bit better.   I had a couple of three‑putts out there today.   Except I'm really happy with the way I hit the ball today and I keep up this ball striking next three days I think I'll be good.

Q.   You're a veteran of the U.S. Women's Open.   You won in 2008.   Does that help you when the conditions are this tough to focus on just make sure you make pars?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   I mean par is our friend around this golf course, and you gotta think about the golf shots over here, and I really like the golf courses playing like this and tough golf courses.   I think it really challenges me and I think it suits me very well, too, so I like it.

Q.   What part of it is the hardest to you?   Is it driving to the fairways?   Is it hitting into the greens?   Is it the putting?
INBEE PARK:   Well, I thought it was going to be more like ball striking this week, but actually after I played it today it was more like putting.   I think it's really tough greens over here.   Two‑putts from everywhere is good around these greens so if I can keep that in mind I'll be good.

Q.   Did you purposely play away and have a longer putt because you thought it might have been an easier two‑putt rather than going for the flag on certain occasions? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah.   Definitely these roughs are really tough to chip on and I only missed two greens today, which really make me able to put a good score out there.

Q.   Long day, long round, what's next?   You just going to get dinner and go to bed?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it was a long round today.   Hopefully I'll get some rest and go fresh in the morning.
