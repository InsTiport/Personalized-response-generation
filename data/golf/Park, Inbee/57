 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
INBEE PARK: I didn't realize it was the poana greens yesterday because I played in the morning and it was quite smooth.   
Today was just so difficult on the greens for me.  I wasn't able to hole many things.  You know, it's just the way it's on these positive on a greens.   
Just playing in the afternoon, it's so much tougher to hole a putt.  It's just hard to trust your line when you know it's just going to bounce everywhere.   
So, yeah, just I'm trying to be a little bit patient with the putter.  Hopefully next two days -- greens not going to get any smoother, so I think I'm just going to have to be a little bit more patient.   
I mean, we played these greens in San Diego, Carlsbad, and it's similar to that in the afternoon.  Yeah, it's tough greens.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  Does that build confidence?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, on the front nine I wasn't able to hole anything, and then on No. 10 and 11 I holed really long ones.  I told my caddie, Brad, I told him, Maybe we just need to hit it a little further and just maybe it's going to be better.   
I holed the long ones but I wasn't able to hole a short one today.  Hopefully I can do a little better putting job.   
 Q.  Well, you're in contention yet again going into the weekend.  Best of luck.  
INBEE PARK: Thank you.
