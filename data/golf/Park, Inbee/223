 Q.   How do you think your game went today?   
INBEE PARK:   I think just everything else was really good, but just my irons weren't loose enough, wasn't sharp enough.   But I think because a lot of the‑‑ because of the hot weather, that really made it hard to concentrate a lot out on the course.   So I'm trying to relax a little bit more and go for it tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   I'm guessing it's hard to play in really hot weather like this?  
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, it's hard for me to play in that hot weather.   I'm not a good player to play in hot weather.   But I've had success in recent years, like this year in Thailand and last year in Malaysia.   So I'll try to keep it going.  
   
 Q.   What is your aim for the end of the year?   
INBEE PARK:   My aim is the Player of the Year Award that I didn't get last year, so that is my goal.
