INBEE PARK: (Recording in progress.)  It's great.  So much to see and so much to enjoy.  It's great to have the tournament in the center of the city.
Q. Near Koreatown?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, near Koreatown.  The food is great and not even just Korean food, but all the food is great.  Yeah, everything is very comfortable and very close to everything.
So, yeah, a lot of people -- I think a lot of people will come out to watch here.  I think it's a great week to have.
Q. The course itself, it's kind of really an old, old style, old fashioned.  Do you enjoy that style of course?  You see it often on tour?
INBEE PARK: I wouldn't say we see it often, because this is quite the smallest green we play all year pretty much.  So, yeah, the course is not long, but the green is very small.  You have to hit a lot of greens.
Even though you're going in with a little shorter iron, it's not an easiest greens to get.  Once you missed the greens easy bogey can come out.
I mean, around the greens approaching is really hard.  I think one of the key this week is just hitting a lot of greens.  Even though they're going in with a short iron, you have to kind of aim for the big part of the green.
Once you missed the green, some spots it's almost impossible to get up and down.
Q. And the bunkering and fairway bunkers?
INBEE PARK: A lot of greenside bunkers.  The greenside bunkers, I think the bunkers are in great shape, but once you short-side yourself, sometimes it's hard to stop the ball really quick.
THE MODERATOR: You already won this year and you've played really well these past couple weeks as well.  Just talk about how you're feeling about your game and heading into a brand new event, brand new course that you've never seen.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, we have played west side and plus the Hawaii for nearly about two months.  We have been having Asian sponsors for the six events, and the area that we were playing in is a big Asian and Korean communities that we play in, and I feel like we're playing at home.
So, yeah, it feels very comfortable and I always love playing this west coast swing.  I have been playing really good on those golf courses.  I feel good about my game.  Last couple weeks my putter just didn't work as much as I would like to, but everything else about my game has been pretty good.
So I'm just trying to work on the putter a little bit so it can be a little bit more consistent this week.
THE MODERATOR: Anything in particular with your putting that you're doing, working on?
INBEE PARK: Not particularly, but I just went back to my old putter this week.  Yeah, I change for about three, four weeks to like a blade-style putter, yeah, Anser style putter, but I went back to my to two-ball.
Yeah, I think that gives me a little bit more comfortness.  Yeah, I went back there.
THE MODERATOR: Is that even between last week and Hawaii?
INBEE PARK: No, after -- yeah, I changed yesterday.
THE MODERATOR: Okay.  Do you have plans?  You talked about being near Koreatown.  Do you have plans to do anything?  Have you done anything already, like spending your time in L.A. this week?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, actually 12 of the Korean players got together yesterday and went to a restaurant just around the corner here.  Yeah, there are so many Korean restaurants, hundreds of them within five miles.
I mean, this week is pretty much the week where we don't have to carry our Korean food.  You can just go out and go to a Korean place anywhere you want.  It's great, yeah.
Feels like we're playing in Korea.
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Inbee?  Anything else?  All right.  Cool.  Thank you.
INBEE PARK: Thank you.
