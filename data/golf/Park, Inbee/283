 Q. Must have been difficult to just go out and play what, one hole?
 INBEE PARK: Yeah, I think it's better than the afternoon if they have to play 36 holes. Just waking up early two out of three days now is a little bit tough, but I think I can manage.

 Q. How about the way you played yesterday? Did you have to finish just one today?
 INBEE PARK: Half.

 Q. Half a hole?
 INBEE PARK: Yeah. 

 Q. Okay. 
 INBEE PARK: Well, yesterday was really solid ball-striking day. I left couple short putts out there, but I think it happens with everybody out here. These greens are really tough to putt. You just gotta take what you gotta take. 
 I just had bad luck on No. 9, which is my last hole. I laid up with a wedge, so it went straight into the fairway but it hit the sprinkler and kicked like way left into the thick rough. So, you know, I made a good bogey there.
 You know, maybe tomorrow is a better day.

 Q. What's your plan for the rest of the day now? You gonna practice some? What are you gonna do?
 INBEE PARK: (Indiscernible) today, because my tee time right now is 10:55. So I might need to come out later, so, yeah. 

 Q. All right. Well, good luck with the greens. Appreciate it. 
 INBEE PARK: Thank you.
