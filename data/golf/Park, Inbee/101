 Q.  Some would say that the Hall of Fame on the LPGA Tour is the hardest in all of sports to qualify for.  What does it mean to you to now become the 24th player in its history to be a part of this Hall of Fame?  
INBEE PARK: Yeah, it's really an honor to put my name among the other players in golf history.  Being congratulated by the other legendary players after looking up to them.  They are waiting here for me on the 18th green, Annika, Se Ri, Karrie, Laura and just to know they're all out there to make me welcome is such a special feeling.  And it feels amazing.  But if this is only my first day, and just got inducted into the Hall of Fame.  It still feels surreal.  But I'm definitely a very, very lucky player.   
 Q.  You're a very young woman with a lot ahead of you.  At what point in your career did you start thinking about this being a possibility?  
INBEE PARK: I didn't really think about the Hall of Fame until maybe a couple of years ago because I thought the criteria to get in the Hall of Fame was such a hard thing and I thought that I had a long ways to go.   
So I thought it was a long dream.  But it definitely came quicker than I thought.  And it obviously wasn't easy to get there.  There were some very hard moments and very successful moments altogether and made me who I am right now.   
 Q.  Where does this rank in your career?  
INBEE PARK: Definitely the top.  And I was quite nervous this morning.  I don't think I was this nervous when I was maybe going for three events slam or when I was going for Major Championship.  This is a very, very special feeling.  And I'm really going to enjoy Hall of Fame.   
 Q.  Everybody has been out here honoring you all day.  And I think I'm going to do a little bit of it, too.  Congratulations.
