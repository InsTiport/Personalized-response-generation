Q. I love talking to you because you don't play much, when you play, you play really good.
INBEE PARK: Sometimes.
Q. You always play really good.  Came up just short this week.  How do you feel coming back and getting another good finish under your belt?
INBEE PARK: Just really happy to be in contention in the final round.  It was just really fun playing in the last group, maybe playing for the trophy.
Yeah, just unfortunate day with the putter.  Never wanted to go in.  Just one of that day, that kind of day.  I just have to take it.  I think it's still a very good momentum going into next week.
So, yeah, I'm really happy with how I played this week.  Yesterday wasn't the best round.  But, yeah, under par is still good.
Q. Did you know the stakes as you were standing over the putt on 18?  Would've been a solo second.  So close.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, I looked at the board and I knew that, and I had opportunities so many times today.  Just one of those kind of day.
Q. What was it like playing with Nasa?  She's an amazing young talent out here.
INBEE PARK: Yeah, she played really solid.  Didn't really look like she was feeling the pressure, especially in the way she played the last hole.  Just very smart.
Yeah, I think she will be a very good player.
Q. How do you feel going into next week?
INBEE PARK: I feel really good, healthy, and my game feels like it's ready to play in the major.  Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
