 Q.   Great finish today.   It's got to feel pretty good coming into the third round pretty much at the leaderboard.   What was working well for to you day?   
INBEE PARK:   I mean, everything was okay today.   I didn't hit the ball as great as yesterday, but I think I putted a little better than yesterday.   The scoring wasn't as good as yesterday, but I'm really happy with the way I putted today and where I am on the leaderboard.   
I still have 18 more holes to play tomorrow, so I'll just go out there and shoot as low a number as I can tomorrow and see what happens.  
   
 Q.   You've got to be feeling pretty good coming off a win a couple weeks ago.   So what would this win mean to you after that one?   
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, I feel really confident after the win at Evian, and I think my game is going well right now.   So it's just time to play good.   
I'm really happy with the way I'm playing right now.  
   
 Q.   Is there a huge difference between this week which is a three‑day tournament whereas almost every other tournament is four days?   What do you think is the big difference?   
INBEE PARK:   I think three‑day events there is just no time to say, okay.   You've got to play good all three days to win out here.   You've really got to push yourself to put up good scores on the three days, because it's one day shorter.
