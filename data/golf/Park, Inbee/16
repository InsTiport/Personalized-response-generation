INBEE PARK: I think just No. 18 got me yesterday and today. I didn't think that was that bad of a shot, but it just held a little bit at the end. I mean, today's round itself, it was a little bit disappointing. I didn't hit many shots close or made a lot of putts. Yeah, if I shoot under par, I should win, but that's golf.
Q. You have nothing left to accomplish in this game, but yet you have a huge goal to get back on the toughest Olympic team for which to qualify, the Korean Women's Olympic Golf team. Does this help your confidence moving forward?
INBEE PARK: Yeah, this is only my first event back for 2020, and I have already played good golf this week. Just not great today, but it has been great for the last three days. I definitely feel a lot of confidence after playing this week. So I think it's going to be good.
