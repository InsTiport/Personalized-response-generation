  INBEE PARK: Earlier in the week, my ball-striking wasn't really -- wasn't that great.  But over the weekend, my putting was just really off.  I had two or three putts today which just was not necessary.  I feel like I left seven or eight putts out there yesterday and today.  There was so many putts I should have made but missed. It was a close one, but maybe not my time this time.   Q.  How did the golf course play differently today compared to the first three days?  INBEE PARK: Well, obviously we were getting a lot more roll, so the driver was going a little bit further.  So we were hitting a little bit shorter irons and the greens were not holding as good as the last three days.  So we had to kind of play for a little bit of a run.  The greens, they always play tough to me all week this week.   Q.  What were your overall thoughts on the crowds that came out this week?  INBEE PARK: I think it was great.  Since the practice round we had so many people coming out and watching us.  It's just so exciting to see that many people come out and watch us all the time. Over the weekend it was just amazing.  There was roars everywhere on so many holes.  And the last hole was just great.  You really want to hit a great shot into the last green because there were so many people rooting for you.   Q.  How do you feel about your game going forward, going into the next couple of weeks, particularly into the British Open?  INBEE PARK: Yeah, I mean, my ball-striking is really getting there, getting to where I really want it to.  But the putting is just not getting there easily.  I definitely did not putt well yesterday and today.  I hit the ball great the last two days, but I left it out there.  I've got to work on my putting a little bit more.
