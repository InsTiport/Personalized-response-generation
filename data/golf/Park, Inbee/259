  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome third round leader at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, Inbee Park.   Welcome.   I have to ask, are you the best putter on earth? 
INBEE PARK:   My putter was really good today, but I don't think I'm the best putter on the earth.   I mean, there's a lot of good putters out here, but I think I'm one of them. 

Q.   Do you think you got a little bit of a lucky break on No.17 there where your ball just barely made it over the bunker?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, that wasn't planned.   That was a little bit of a mis‑shot.   I pulled it slightly and it ended up perfect.

Q.   I was talking to Paula Creamer on the putting green and she said during junior golf you played the exact same way, you rolled in every single putt, and she always had trouble beating you.   Have you always felt comfortable with the putter in your hand? 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, I didn't really have to worry about the putting for my golfing career.   Sometimes I have to worry about my swing more seriously, but not on the putting.   It's been always good. 

Q.   Do you ever feel nerves out there?   You seem so calm.   Nothing seems to bother you, the crowd noise or anything.   Are you this calm all the time?
INBEE PARK:   Well, nothing, like the sounds from the crowd and like phones, that doesn't really bother me that much.   But I definitely feel pressure out there, like all the other players.   I feel pressure, but my emotions just doesn't show that much in my face.

Q.   And not in your swing, either, your swing seems like it's the same every time.   Is that something you take pride in?
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do, and that's what I'm trying to work on, trying to have a consistent swing every time, even if I feel pressure.

Q.   You won the Women's Open in 2008 and not too many U.S. fans knew who you were.   Now you're ranked No.4 in the Rolex Rankings.   Do you feel the success you've had?
INBEE PARK:   Of course.   I only one won major in my seven‑year career, and after the U.S. Open I hadn't won for a while.   I had a good year last year, but I definitely need to show a little bit more good play and maybe a couple more majors win would be very nice.

Q.   What about Murietta got you there?
INBEE PARK:   Well, I don't actually have a place in Murietta, my coach just lives there so I just go to his house when I have a week off. 

Q.   What clubs did you use on the two that you hit to about two and a half feet on the back nine, 17 and‑‑
INBEE PARK:   17, I hit 7‑iron, and No.12 I hit 9‑iron.

Q.   On 17, that was a pretty tough back left pin, and after you watch her go in the bunker, you went right at that pin.   What were you thinking on that shot?
INBEE PARK:   Well, I wasn't going for the pin, I actually went for right of the pin to the middle of the green, but I slightly pulled it and it just ended up perfect. 

Q.   You said your coach lives in Murietta.   Who is your coach?
INBEE PARK:   Well, he is my previous coach.   He is still coaching me, but I am traveling with my fiancÃ©, right now he is my coach.

Q.   Is he here today?
INBEE PARK:   Yes, he is here today. 

Q.   Did he give you any good advice?
INBEE PARK:   Well, he said I'm swinging pretty good, so he didn't really say much. 

Q.   What about your dad, you have no idea, have you heard anything from him?
INBEE PARK:   Well, by yesterday he said he wasn't coming because my mom is stopping him from coming.   But they're coming to Hawai'i. 

Q.   Do you have a putting coach or is your putting more something that is just natural and all yours?
INBEE PARK:   I mean, I never had a putting coach.   I had a swing coach, but putting has been my instinct and just my feelings.   I never had a putting stroke coach.

Q.   Growing up did somebody show you how to putt or you learned it on your own, too?
INBEE PARK:   No, I just watched a lot of good players putting and just figured it out. 

Q.   There is only one player closer than six shots to you.   Does that suggest tomorrow is a two‑player race? 
INBEE PARK:   I mean, this kind of golf course anything can happen on this golf course, so no, I can't really say that only one player is trying to catch me.   But I think everybody within maybe six, seven shots of the lead is still in the mix, I think. 

Q.   And how would you describe a final round in a major, how it's just different than another final round?   I know you probably want to approach it the same and do the same, but I also suspect that's not possible. 
INBEE PARK:   It is different.   You feel a lot more pressure and you see a lot more people, and especially playing in the last group.   You've just got to handle yourself really good under pressure. 

Q.   You've obviously been in this position before.   How big of an advantage is that going into tomorrow? 
INBEE PARK:   I think it's always good to have more experience.   Lizette is playing very good at the moment, so I think we really inspired each other today playing together, and I'll just try to follow that.   We both played very good today. 
THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to thank you for coming in and wish you good luck tomorrow.
