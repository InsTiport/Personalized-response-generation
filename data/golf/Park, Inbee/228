Q.   Just wondering your overall thoughts on your round today. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I didn't have a really good start.   I started with bogey today, but I really play well rest of the day.
I'm putting really good this week.   My putting has gotten a lot better than last week, so that's really a good positive to take on.
Still working a little bit on my swing.   I guess I see progress a little bit, so on the weekend hopefully I hit it a little bit better.

Q.   Talk about the final two holes. 
INBEE PARK:   Yeah, I mean, it was a tough day.   Just grinded for pars.   The last two birdies felt like heaven.   Felt really good.   Hit in two good wedge shots.

Q.   How much do you play in the moment and how much do you think about playing at St. Andrews? 
INBEE PARK:   I don't really think about St. Andrews when I'm playing this tournament.   I'm just trying to tune my game up a little bit so I'm ready for going to British.   I'm just trying to get myself ready.
