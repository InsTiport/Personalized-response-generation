INBEE PARK: I was on the green and somebody screamed I was going to fall.  Be careful.  I actually didn't fall.  Actually didn't fall.  She was lucky.
Q. 20 minutes later worked it all out.  That shock you or surprise you?
INBEE PARK: Little bit of surprise and shock at the same time.  Just try to get away from that point and move on.
Q. That's what you get when it gets this windy.
INBEE PARK: Tough conditions.
Q. (inaudible)?
INBEE PARK: No.  They invited me to come over this week but I didn't really have the time for this week.
Q. Busy.
INBEE PARK: Yes.
Q. How much do you practice, how much did you play now, how much do you play when you're at home?
INBEE PARK: I try to take like two to three weeks off in December.  Other than that like every other day I play.
Q. Show up to the tee and beat everybody.
INBEE PARK: Live in Vegas, practice so much.  I don't practice as much as them.  Maybe, like I said, every other day I try to take some relaxing time off I'm at home.
Q. When you started to learn how you to play, how much time did you spend putting?
INBEE PARK: Just I try not to burn yourself out.  When you're 10 years old, 12 years old you don't want to force yourself to practice.  I think that's just putting so much pressure on you at a young age.
You can start doing that once you turn professional, you can do it more.  At this point I do it as long as you have fun and just stand there and try to get the time there.
Q. Do you enjoy putting more than other things?
INBEE PARK: I think I did, yeah.
