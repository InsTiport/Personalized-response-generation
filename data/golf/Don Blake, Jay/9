 Q.   Compare and contrast your front and back nine.   How you bounced back.   
JAY DON BLAKE:   Well, I wasn't hitting it really awful on my first nine holes, I just made some stupid mistakes around the greens on the front nine.   
And on one of the par‑5s I played it horrible.   I hit it just‑‑ I thought I hit a good shot, it's like 295 to the bunker into the wind and I still hit it in the bunker.   I didn't think I could get to it.   
And it was against the lip and I couldn't get it out of the bunker and so I make bogey there.   
And then I hit it on 7 in the bunker ‑‑ and actually 3‑putted 6.   Hit 7 in the bunker against the lip.   Just got to chip out and make bogey.   
And I birdie 8.   
And then 9 I hit it green high, but I got a big old mound and I tried to get cute with a chip and thought I hit a great chip and comes up short and I chipped down to about two feet and missed it.   
Just kind of nothing was really working on the front side.   And then finally I started making some birdies and still played kind of erratic.   I made a bogey out there and made some silly mistakes.   But it is what it is.
