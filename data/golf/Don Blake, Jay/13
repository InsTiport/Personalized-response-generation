  Q. Got to be happy with where you stand, considering you start with a double at No. 1?  
 JAY DON BLAKE: Yeah, I started off the bat, hit it in the right front bunker on 1, and blasted out kind of short and then 3-putted. Start with double, and then I 3-putted another hole to go 3-over and missed some birdie chances. And I just ended up making some putts coming in and shot 4-under on the back side.   
 After that start, I feel pretty good with where I'm at right now.  
  
  Q. The conditions seem pretty calm obviously after the last couple of days; much different?   
 JAY DON BLAKE: Yeah, it was a lot different. I mean, some of the holes were -- you're laying up with, you know, 4- and 5-irons, you had to hit hybrids and 3-woods because you didn't have as much wind and then going the other way, going into the wind the holes played easier. Things become -- it's like a totally different course. It's like we have never seen it before with it being calm like this, but it still played pretty tough. The greens were faster and a lot firmer today.  
  
  Q. You said you were pretty pleased with where you are right now?  
 JAY DON BLAKE: Yeah, you know, starting with where I was at and coming back to shoot 1-under par for the day, I felt pretty good. I hit some good shots.
