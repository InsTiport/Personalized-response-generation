Q.   Minus 2, talk about your round today. 
JAY DON BLAKE:   I hit it better today.   Yesterday I struggled a little bit.   Today I hit a lot better.   Didn't putt very good today.   I had some chances to make some birdies.   I just seemed like when I did make a birdie, I would follow‑up with a bogey. 
Then the par‑5s, I made a couple birdies on those.   So it was kind of a ho‑hum round.

Q.   Overall pretty consistent round for the day?
JAY DON BLAKE:   Yeah.   I liked the way I started to hit the ball.   Need to work on the putting a little bit.   See if I can get some balls to go in the hole on the weekend.

Q.   How do you feel heading into Saturday and Sunday?
JAY DON BLAKE:   If I start hitting it the way I hit it today, I would like to continue with that and then kind of get some confidence early in the round, maybe put up a good low number and kind of put some good scores on the weekend, see if we can put a good chase on it. 

Q.   How about the weather here today?
JAY DON BLAKE:   I don't know how perfect a day you can, it can't get any better than what it was today.   It was really nice out there.   Really comfortable.
