 Q. Minus six and you almost didn't make it here?
 JAY DON BLAKE: Yeah, got to come up and try to do those Monday -- or this week, Tuesday qualifiers. You know, just happy to be here. 

 Q. I guess after qualifying, you had a good feeling and you knew that course, we look at the scores, 7-under, 6-under; was it that easy or were you that good today?
 JAY DON BLAKE: We didn't know what the course was going to be like. We've been playing cold, wet, wind blowing, balls are not going far. It was a difficult golf course, the fairways are running out a bit more and they played a bit shorter. 
 So some holes where I was hitting 4- and 5-irons I was hitting 9-irons because of the way it dried out and not much moisture. Not that it played easier but opportunities were good out there and the greens were soft enough that you could go at the flag. 

 Q. But up on the tee box the fairways are pretty wide. I guess the difficulty is that the greens are as fast as 11 but they have a lot of undulation. 
 JAY DON BLAKE: The greens are very big and they have sectioned them where the ridges and slopes and mounds, if you get it on the wrong side, to 2-putt, it's hard to do that. You have to keep it on the right side of the pin and try to get it down in two.
