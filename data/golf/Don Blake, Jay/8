Q.   Bogey‑free golf feel pretty good?
JAY DON BLAKE:   It did.   I had a clean card out there except for birdies.   So it was pretty nice.

Q.   What made you feel like you started hitting your groove today?
JAY DON BLAKE:   I was just trying to stay out of my own way is what I was trying to do.   I played smart shots, keep it in the fairway as much as I could and try to get it on right spot of the greens to have some birdie chances.   And just stayed patient as I could.   And then when the time for being aggressive was there, I tried to take a chance and see if I could do something. 

Q.   Number 5 you had a 7 on Thursday, a 4 today, what was the difference between those two?
JAY DON BLAKE:   Yesterday ‑‑ I finally got it out of the bunker in one shot.   Today I did.   Yesterday I hit it a couple times in the bunker and I actually played it double bogey the first round and bogey yesterday, so it was nice to make that with the birdie today. 
I just hit it in the left bunker, hit 6‑iron down there, and hit a wedge about four feet and made it.   So it sounds simple, but it wasn't.

Q.   Is it still very weird today playing for a bit in the rain, the cold, the wind and the sun or is this how the game should be?
JAY DON BLAKE:   Well, we get used to it, because we have variations of weather like this.   We're outdoors all the time and the climate changes, so it was tough early, winds changing direction, blowing different ways, but you just got to deal with it.
