  Q. How did round two go today?  
 JAY DON BLAKE: It was pretty good. I hit it pretty decent all day again. I just putted horrible the first nine holes, which is our back nine. I missed some short putts, couldn't capitalize. Hit some good shots that I thought were going to be good, but had bad results. That kind of deal. And just got a little frustrated out there.   
 And finally I got on the front nine over here and I hit some good shots, made some good putts, and just got some momentum and started feeling pretty confident with what was going on and played well.   
 I shot 2-over on the front and 5-under on -- well actually 2-over on the back nine and 5-under the front nine and then come in at 3-under.   
 And I hit it good, like I did yesterday, I felt pretty comfortable, so the wind kind of was gusting harder on our first nine holes and then it calmed down, so.  
  
  Q. Did you notice a difference playing between morning and the afternoon?  
 JAY DON BLAKE: Well I can see where in the morning you could probably put a pretty good score because the greens are more receptive. Iron shots in there that were kind of stopping. Yesterday we hit sand wedges in there and the ball skips 30 feet and it's just goes way past, you can't really -- you kind of got your hands tied, you can't hit shots into the greens.  
  
  Q. And at 4-under how do you feel heading into the weekend?  
 JAY DON BLAKE: I feel good. I'm sure I'll, depending upon the wind, if it stays like this, those guys will get to 10-under par probably.   
 So, but yeah, I felt pretty comfortable. I'm hitting it well. Just if I would have done something good on my first nine holes today, I would have had a good score today, but I still played well.
