 Q.   Talk about your last nine holes.   The birdies on 1 and 2 and the double on 5.   Kind of just walk us through that.   
JAY DON BLAKE:   1, I drove it down there, had a sand wedge to the green and actually left it short a little bit, about 30 feet and ended up making that putt for birdie.   
Par‑3, I hit 8‑iron probably 30 feet and had it over a little crest and happened to get the line and knocked it in for birdie.   
5, I drove it right down the middle of the fairway, kind of going for the green there, but I just hit it skinny, hit it awful and hit it in the water.   And I dropped and chipped it over the back of the green and chipped it up and missed it.   And ended up with 7.   
   
 Q.   What are you looking forward for tomorrow?  
JAY DON BLAKE:   Well, I hit it pretty good today, I hit a lot of good shots.   I think I only hit a couple shots that I really didn't like.   So just got to do more of the same tomorrow.   Eliminate the silly mistakes and hope the wind dies down so I can go at some of the pins.   
You had to be really protective of some of the shots into the green because the wind was right‑to‑left, left‑to‑right, into us, it was hard to gauge what it was really doing.   And it was pretty aggressive on how hard it was blowing too.   So we had to play pretty conservative.   So hopefully tomorrow we can free it up.
