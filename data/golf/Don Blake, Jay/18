 Q. What were some of the highlights of round one today?
 JAY DON BLAKE: The wind. That was the highlight all day. I struggled early, hit a couple wild iron shots. I made some pretty good up-and-downs early in the round and that kind of kept some momentum going to kind of keep myself in the game. And then I made a couple birdies to go along with the bogey on the front and turned at 1-under and made a birdie on the back. Just played solid golf. Just tried to keep it in play. And there wasn't nothing spectacular. 
 And it was kind of disappointing on the last hole making bogey. I hit two good shots in there and it is way over the green.

 Q. Other than the wind what challenges are you facing out there on the course?
 JAY DON BLAKE: Pretty much just the wind is the whole thing because you get on the greens and the wind's wiggling you around, the ball feels like it's going to roll all the time, and you got all the undulation you're working with, and it's just a challenge. And then trying to figure out, you're uphill shooting shots, downwind, into the wind, I mean it's so hard to pick the clubs.

 Q. Has the altitude affected you a bit?
 JAY DON BLAKE: It has. It's hard, it's confusing because we got 30 mile an hour winds into us, but then we're downhill 30, 50 feet and just you are almost guessing sometimes. It's been tough with the wind. That's probably the hardest part is just the wind right now. Nobody knows the course that well, we haven't played a whole lot of rounds because it blew so hard Monday you couldn't play, yesterday afternoon it blew so hard you couldn't play, so nobody's had a whole lot of practice out here and it's the local guys, you know, except them, and the wind's just been brutal. And that's it. You just have to fight it.
