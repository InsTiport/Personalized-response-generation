Q. Just run me through how long her birdies were on the course.  Do you remember?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: Within ten feet really.  She hit it great on the front nine.  Pitched in on the second for eagle?
Q. How far was that, do you remember?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: It was probably about 30 yards?
Q. 30 yards on the second?  How far was birdie on the first, do you remember?  Tap-in?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: Three feet.  Yeah, so there was a lot of putts, sort of 10-footers.  Good ball control, pitching control.  Yeah, she rolled in a nice one off the par-3.
Q. That's 14 or 17?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: 14?
Q. How far was that?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: It might have been 15 feet.  Good shot at the pin.
Q. What was the longest putt today do you think she made?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: Probably a putt for par on par-36.  Probably the longest putt?
Q. How long do you think that was?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: Yeah, she missed the green there and chipped it down the front.  So it would have been about 20, 25 feet.
Q. Have you ever seen her roll it in like that before?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: No.  This is my third week on the bag.  But yeah, she's hit it good the last couple of tournament because hasn't rolled any putts.  Today she rolled them really great?
Q. How did you get connected?
ANDREW TSCHUDIN: I think through a mutual friend out here.
