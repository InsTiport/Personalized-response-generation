  Q. If you can just wish everyone a happy national Korean Thanksgiving week.
 HEE YOUNG PARK:   (In Korean. )
 Q. Good start here at the ShopRite LPGA Classic.  What went right for you today to get to 4-under par?
 HEE YOUNG PARK:   I been really try figure out how to make a score, it's been -- wasn't that bad with my golf, but everything together making scoring, it was really tough to do that.
 But today I finally made it 4-under par, which it was great weather plus, and the putting finally drop some today.
 So I really happy with that and keep doing same process tomorrow and next day and until finish.
 Q. Starting out like this, you have to have some good confidence heading into the next few days.  How is your confidence level after a good start like this, especially on a course where you can throw up a low number?
 HEE YOUNG PARK:   So this week usually really hard ground, hard green, fast green, and then windy, too.
 But today was perfect, just slightly wind, but the greens, fairways, really soft.
 So every shot we can hit, attack the pin, which is really great.  And I think all player makes more confident to play strong because a lot of birdies out there and more aggressive golf instead of protecting golf.
 So really exciting to play second round.
