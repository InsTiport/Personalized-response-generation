 Q.  Bogey-free round here at Q-Series. What was the difference between coming off No. 6 and going to No 9?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: Well, No. 9 today, it was softer greens so easy to hit attack about to the pin today.   
And supposed to be rain today, but it was really calm and nice weather. It's kind of help about -- you know, makes easier than No. 9.   
 Q.  What were you thinking over the last couple days going into the final week here of Q-Series?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: This is really pressure about I think any other girls, because eight rounds and then full two weeks have to prepare and two different course.   
But I try to no matter what the fairways and green and try to make the par and then walk away next hole. That's my plan about this week and last week.   
 Q.  What is kind of the strategy to improve upon going into the rest of the rounds?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: I think same plan: never try to take the risk. Just try to more hit on the fairways and greens, and if off the fairway, I try to, you know, back into the position and play regular safety.
