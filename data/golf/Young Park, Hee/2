 Q.  Is it more relief to get your full card back tomorrow or be done with this?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: I mean, very important with the ranking and first, second, third place, but this is not about, you know, who's going to win this event.   
So I just want to keep the card and get off this golf tournament. That's my goal.   
I'm really happy with little less pressure than any other girls so far now. So I'm going to keep play safe: fairways, green, and if I make the par I'm just really happy with the walk away every single hole.   
So I'm really looking forward one more rounds.   
 Q.  You had the break and in a lot of ways this is like any other two week tournament stretch. Maybe a little more pressure with the circumstances.  
HEE YOUNG PARK: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  Is it exciting to get it done?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: Yes. Very looking forward. I don't want to preparing anymore this Q-Series anymore, because this is, yeah, too much pressure. And then make me and also a lot of girls like nervous and a lot of mistake coming out.   
But I trained really hard, refreshed. The beginning this year wasn't that great seasons, but after I prepared and played so far the season, got through, like my mind is more stronger and more -- I think my game is back, so really happy.   
 Q.  And you found that here?  
HEE YOUNG PARK: Yep.
