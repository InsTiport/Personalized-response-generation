MAARTEN LAFEBER: Disappointing but great to be in The Open. I played great today but missed too many birdie chances -- at five and nine and 13 and three putted 15th and that stopped me. I am proud of myself. I played great all week and you need a bit of luck but I didn't have any luck on the greens. I hit it to ten inches and 20 inches at the first two holes. Just tap-ins. Great start and played good the whole day and only missed one fairway, but like I say, if you want to win you have to make the putts on the last day and I didn't manage that.

I played St. Andrews in 2000.  That was my first one and I missed the cut by one, but I feel I am a much more mature player now than I was then. I've had some good finishes at the dunhill links and I enjoy playing there. It's great to play as well as I did today and to finish second in such a strong field. It was a good first week with Jos (Vanstiphout). It's a step in the right direction. It made a big difference working with him. I never felt so low on a golf course as I did last Friday at The K Club. I felt that bad I was going to quit for two months and start back in Munich. I didn't want to be on the golf course. Two good talks with Jos and I changed my mind. I feel good for next week and I am going to enjoy it. I didn't want to miss the Open at St. Andrews and I intend to have fun and enjoy it.
