   MAARTEN LAFEBER: Yeah, it was very good. I played very well. I think we did everything right today and kept the ball nicely in play off the tee and hit some good iron shots, and putted well, especially on the front nine.   
 The back nine, let a few chances go, especially on the last was annoying to miss a pretty easy putt. Obviously I did a lot of things right today and I'm very happy.   
  
  Q. And you scored well because you moved yourself into a prominent position.   
 MAARTEN LAFEBER: I did. I saw Alvaro at 16-under; I mean, he's playing well. But tomorrow is a different day and I'm very happy I'm in this position and I have a small chance to maybe win tomorrow.  
  
  Q. When is the last time you were up here for the final day; been a while?   
 MAARTEN LAFEBER: Yeah, since '05, I haven't played too well on Tour. A couple mediocre years and been injured and didn't play well. But I had a good winter, good break, and ten weeks off after the tournament in Valencia in Spain, and I feel fresh and ready to play again.  
  
  Q. And is it the benefit of that break, or did you have a word with coaches to go back to what you were doing?  
 MAARTEN LAFEBER: Not really. I think the break was good, really good, and I'm working on the right stuff and working hard on the mental stuff and I feel really happy with that. Just take it one shot at a time and go from there. It seemed to work well this week.  
  
  Q. Have to ask how you are feeling, because you were saying not particularly well and it was not a very comfortable night.   
 MAARTEN LAFEBER: I felt a lot better. I think I slept for about 12 hours last night, so it was good. I felt a lot more fresh today and had a good night's sleep tonight and should be ready tomorrow.
