MODERATOR:  All right.  You just talked to your parents?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I did.
Q.  What did they say?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   They said that they are still sitting around the table with big smiles on their faces.
Q.  What time is it there?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   They are nine hours ahead.
Q.  About 11:00 at night?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.
Q.  They follow it on the Internet?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   They did.
Q.  What did you say to them when you first called them?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Hi, it's me.

(Laughter)
Q.  Did you say I won or did they already know?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   They already know.
Q.  Well, that must have made you feel good to talk to them.  What are your overall impressions of the match today?  You took an early lead.  You were never down in the match?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   It was a tough match.  We both played good golf.  We had both holes where we struggled.  And, yes, my irons were not as good as they had been the last days.

Putting was okay again.
Q.  Okay.
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.  I shouldn't complain.
Q.  That's right.  What do you look forward to tomorrow?  You're playing Kimberly Kim.  She's almost 15 years old.  But she's 14.  What do you see happening?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I'm looking forward to the atmosphere with all the spectators and playing the great golf course one more time, or two more times.  I'm going to enjoy it.
Q.  Did your parents give you any advice?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No, they didn't.  They just told me they'd keep their fingers crossed.
Q.  Keep their fingers crossed.  Perfect.

When you first came to Oregon, how did you get here?  How did that come about that you went to school in Oregon?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Another German girl, Erica Heiser, she graduated in Oregon, and I met her during the summer in Germany.  And we talked a while and then she said, hey, why don't you come to Oregon after finishing school.  Yeah, that was the way I came here.
Q.  And was it that you wanted to go to school in the United States, wanted to play golf in the United States?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yeah, both.

MODERATOR:  Questions?  I've asked you everything.  You've answered everything, I guess.
Q.  What was just going through your mind on the first extra hole, can you go over the playoff?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I thought that I just had to stick to the routine and everything is going to be fine.
Q.  So you weren't nervous or anything?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I was nervous.  But I was trying not to show it.
Q.  What advice did your coach give you?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   None.
Q.  He just    did he give you yardages, that sort of thing?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.  He gave me yardages to the pin and to the front of the green.  And when reading the putts, we talked.  We talked about where to aim.
Q.  How long was your putt on the 18th hole?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I think three to four meters.
Q.  So about 9 to 12.  You almost made it and Stacy almost made hers.  They both were so close.  That must have made you go when she almost made hers.
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yeah.
Q.  Do you like to be unknown here in America.  You're certainly well known overseas.  But you don't get much attention here.  Do you like it that way?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Either way is fine for me.  There's no difference.  It's okay.
Q.  Does it motivate you at all?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Not getting any attention?  I think I get attention, so no.
Q.  Have you played with Kimberly before?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No.
Q.  She said you guys practiced together at one point, had a practice round.  Did you have a practice round with her, or is she    she might be getting you mixed up.

A practice round in this event you don't remember playing with her?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No, I don't.  I'm sorry.  I'm not very good at remembering faces.
Q.  What will your routine be the rest of the afternoon and this evening, once you leave the golf course?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   What time is it right now?
Q.  3:00.
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I might hit a couple of balls on the driving range and then get back to the hotel, get a little rest and then go out, have dinner.  And after that go to bed and sleep and then I wait for the call from home.
Q.  They call you again?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Uh huh.  It's my wake up call every morning.
Q.  Good.  I hope they don't forget.

Is it your mom or your dad?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   My boyfriend.
Q.  What does he do?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   He's a soccer player.  He's playing in the Fifth League in Germany.  And he's studying.  He almost finished his business studies.
Q.  What's his name?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Lars.
Q.  Last name?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Brackszhulze.
Q.  Can you spell that for me, please?

(Laughter)
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:     B r a c k s z h u l z e.
Q.  U l z e?  I just didn't hear you.
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.
Q.  You're playing against a 14 year old tomorrow.  Are there any really good teenagers in Germany, or is this kind of strange to you that you're playing against a girl so young in the final?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   There are a couple of good teenagers in Germany, too.  But I guess they are not as good as Kimberly is.
Q.  Do you find it any different that you're playing against someone so young or do you just look at it as another opponent?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yeah, she's another player I have to play against, and I have to stick to my routine and my strategy.  But I'm curious to see how she's playing and how she's handling everything, because I haven't competed in big tournaments at that age.
Q.  So you can't imagine what it would be like as a 14 year old?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No.
Q.  The other day you played two rounds, the double match play round.  Have you ever played a 36 hole final before?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No, I haven't.  No.
Q.  Do you still have plenty of strength and energy, or are you pretty tired out at this point?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I still have some energy left.
Q.  What kind of tournaments were you playing at 14?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Small regional tournaments.
Q.  Were you on a national team at 14?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   No.  First time I was invited to play on the national team was at the age of 17, 18.
Q.  Have you played in the Women's World Amateur Team Championship?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Not yet.
Q.  What do you think, the fact that you're in the Final what do you think that says about amateur golf overseas?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   You can compare it to Europe.  The girls here might be a little bit stronger.  Like they play a little better.
Q.  But being your first Women's Amateur, too, it says a lot that you're able to do this in your first event here.  So would you say that the competition is similar to what you face this week?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   It is.
Q.  Do you have a lucky hat to wear tomorrow or anything like that?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   I'm just wearing the blue one I had worn all the week.
Q.  Have you worn that every day?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.
Q.  The blue one?
KATHARINA SCHALLENBERG:   Yes.
Q.  I'd say that's a lucky hat.

Katharina, thank you so much for coming in.  Congratulations and good luck tomorrow.
