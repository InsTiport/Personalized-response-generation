Q. Tell me about your round out there today.
MI JUNG HUR: It was really good.  All my driver, tee shot, 3-wood, hybrid, iron, everything was good.  Also my putting was good.
Actually I change my grip with my putter to cross, but during the round I switched it again after the nine hole and it works really good.
Q. So what are you going to go with tomorrow?
MI JUNG HUR: I don't know.  Depends how I'm feel.
Q. Okay.  How is the golf course playing this morning compared to yesterday?
MI JUNG HUR: This is one of my favorite golf course on the tour for sure.  Conditions on the course is super nice.  Like on the putting greens if you miss the putt it's all your fault because they're so pure.
I love to play this course.  This morning was a little bit of freeze, but it was fine because I practice in Dallas last two month and the weather was suck.
Q. Was really cold?
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah.
Q. How special is it to have the Founders here this week?
MI JUNG HUR: Really thankful to everybody who build the LPGA, all the Founders.  I really want to say thank you.  I did yesterday after 18.  They look great.  Yeah.
Q. Nice.  I notice your DriveOn button.
MI JUNG HUR: Uh-huh.
Q. Did you get a chance to see the campaign this week?
MI JUNG HUR: Yes, I did.  We had a players' meeting on Tuesday night, and actually we watched twice in same time.  It was awesome.  I love to share everybody this video, to everybody.
