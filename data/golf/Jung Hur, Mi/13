Q. A nice round out there.  Obviously, capped off by a tremendous birdie here on 18.  What was kind of the key to your round today?  What was working well for you?
MI JUNG HUR: I think I had a lot of lucky shots as well.  But I had a good day.  I had a good shot from the fairway, and all the wedge shots on the par-5 were really good, and also the putter was good.  So everything was perfectly doing well.  6-under par today.
Q. How did you find the golf course today versus the first two days?  Was it easier to score well today?
MI JUNG HUR: I think it's less windier than the first two rounds.  That's why all the players had a lot of birdies.  Nelly had seven birdies and one eagle as well.  I think more like the wind.
Q. Now you had five top 5 finishes this year.  So a lot of really good results.  How are you -- are you motivated?  Are you excited to maybe get a win here?
MI JUNG HUR: Yes, definitely.  But I had a really tough day on Thursday and Friday, so I wasn't expecting to play this good.  But I had one other chance to win, so I'll just do my best and I'll keep going to the final day.
