Q. Such a solid final round.  What was the key to your play?
MI JUNG HUR: I made three straight birdies on my first three holes, opening holes.  It was a pretty long putt and I made three birdies and it made me keep going forward to the top.
Q. And then great finish this week.  How much momentum does that give you going into the British Open, where similar conditions?
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, the good thing is pretty similar weather, and temperature, also the links golf course in British and here, as well.  It was good practice.  It was a tournament but it was good practice for the British, to prepare for the British Open.  So I'm expecting to play that course well.
Q. What's been really working in your game that helped you play so well this week?
MI JUNG HUR: I think it's more about the putting because they had a lot of wind the first three rounds, and today, as well.  But even on the green, you have to read the wind direction because even if it's a left-to-right putt, if the wind is blowing right-left, it still goes right-left.  So you have to think about a lot of wind.
I was talking with my caddie a lot on the course and it helps me a lot, too.
