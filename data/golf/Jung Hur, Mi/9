 Q.  1-under par today.  Solid round on a Saturday.  What went well?  
MI JUNG HUR: Actually, I hit a really good driver today.  I hit ten fairways and 16 greens, and had lots of putts.  I had 34 putts, and yesterday I had 24, which is ten putts different.   
But I'm satisfied with my round, with my long game, but hopefully they will drop tomorrow, for my putts.   
 Q.  What was the difference?  Was it the greens?  
MI JUNG HUR: I think it was the break.  More like yesterday, had a really easy break to putt with it, but today, I had lots of double-breaks and some kind of weird reading.  So didn't make many birdies, but I hope tomorrow I hit more, get a chance and drop some more birdies.   
 Q.  You'll be just one shot back maybe tomorrow.  What's your strategy for the final round?  
MI JUNG HUR: I didn't think about it.  I just want to enjoy my game.  Like I don't want to get stress from my game because this is my 11th year on the Tour, and never helps when you get stress from your game.  I'm just going to enjoy my day and talking with a lot of things with my caddie.  That's it.   
 Q.  How hard is it to just not focus on the outcome?  
MI JUNG HUR: It is really hard to enjoy.  It's really hard to get off from the stress, but I will keep try.  I know it's my like 11th year to try, but there will be a good chance if I just enjoy my game.
