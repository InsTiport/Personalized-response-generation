 Q.  How fast was your start this morning?  
MI JUNG HUR: The first three holes, just had a far birdie putt and it was amazing. I thought I'm going to shoot really low, lower than this, but I'm happy with my round.   
I just want to enjoy my golf. I think I'm going to play with Brooke tomorrow. She's my little sis on the Tour and I love her. We just want to enjoy, have a nice time with her on the course, and talking a lot.   
 Q.  If you play with Brooke, you've got her to play with and then your husband here and your family, so a good support network around you.  
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, there's a little bit of pressure with my family. The whole family are here. But they were there last week, as well, so getting used to it. Just try to do my best.   
 Q.  They were there for your two wins already this year, so if you believe in threes, things are looking good for you.  
MI JUNG HUR: I had three wins with him, I will do something for him for sure.
