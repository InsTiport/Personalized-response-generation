Q. Alongside Mi Jung Hur carding an 8-under round today, sitting tied for the top of the lead. Mi Jung, you birdied the last three holes. What kicked into gear to polish off a great round?
MI JUNG HUR: I had a really good day with my tee shots and long game, and the putt wasn't that good, but I still love it. I made a lot of birdies, but I had one bogey on 17, I missed one fairway, which is -- if you miss fairways on this course, you have to take a bogey because it's so tough when you miss the fairway.
Q. How do you continue to score so well when you feel like your putter is not working that well?
MI JUNG HUR: I just try to be patient with my putter because the greens are so good and so fast, so I just focus on my pace on the putter, and it works pretty good. But when you have a downslope putt, you have to be careful because it's really fast.
Q. You've been playing really well coming into this event on top of your win over in Scotland. You've shot a round of 66 or better your last three events. What's letting you play so well in this recent stretch?
MI JUNG HUR: I think my long game is better than last year because I was struggling with my long game and trying to hit a bit of a draw shape, and it works pretty good, and it's getting sharp the last three weeks, and played good.
Q. What led you to change to more of a draw shape long iron shot?
MI JUNG HUR: Yeah, more like a driver, but it's not -- it wasn't that easy, so I worked really hard with my driver and trying to keep my driver on the fairway, and it works good so far.
