 Q.  9-under par today.  Is that your best round?  
MI JUNG HUR: At Kia this year and a couple years ago in China.   
 Q.  Still, a great round.  What were the highlights out there?  
MI JUNG HUR: I started with birdie, birdie, eagle.  I started on 10 first.  On 12, I hit a chip-in and made an eagle and I was so excited for the day.  But next hole, I made a bogey.  Hit a fat shot with a pitching wedge from the fairway.  I was frustrated with the hole but tried to keep it up and had lots of chance to make birdies.   
All the putts were really good today.  Hit a lot of good shots.  Yeah, I had a good round.   
 Q.  What was the yardage on the eagle on 12?  
MI JUNG HUR: Oh, that was like 25 to the pin.  I hit a bump-and-run.  Because I was in the rough, yeah.   
 Q.  You're at the top of the leaderboard heading into the weekend.  How happy are you with your position and what are you looking forward to this weekend?  
MI JUNG HUR: It's like really long time, played as leader in the third round.  I'm really excited about tomorrow and I just want to keep focused on my game and trying to talking with a lot of things with my caddie and it helps good.   
 Q.  What were you guys talking about out there?  
MI JUNG HUR: Just these greens are really firm for the second shot.  So we talking about the yardage, we can carry this number and maybe release this much.  We talking about those things, and it helps.   
 Q.  What were the conditions like out there?  You guys saw a little bit of everything.  
MI JUNG HUR: Oh, actually, I got a really lucky draw for this week.  I had the morning yesterday and afternoon today.  I know it was really tough this morning, but sometimes I need luck for those things, too.  But yeah, I think the pairings helped me a lot, too.
