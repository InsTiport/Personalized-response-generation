  Q. MJ, a solid day, 5-under par.  You're in second place right now.  Six birdies.  Let's just start off how was the round out there from your perspective?
 MI JUNG HUR:   It was really great out on the course.  Driving was good and I was struggle with my iron but my putting drop pretty well.
 And most of holes they move the tee forward and we have to go aggressive few holes, and I made birdies those kind of holes.  That makes me up to second place.
 Q. Yeah.  You moved up very nicely.
 MI JUNG HUR:   Yep.
 Q. You had six birdies on numbers 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, and 16.  Did any of those maybe stand out a little more than the others.
 MI JUNG HUR:   Actually what I said before, like No. 8 and 9 they moved the tee forward, and also 16 they moved the tee forward, so I was focus on I have to make a birdie these holes because other players will make some birdies or eagle.
 So I just play aggressive.
 Q. I like the new haircut.  You mentioned you got it done after Drive On.  Take us through the new style.
 MI JUNG HUR:   Yeah, I got a haircut after Drive On Championship in Ocala.  On third round I shoot 80 and I got to change something, so I just cut my hair.
 Everyone loves it.
 Q. Yeah, it fits you very nice.
 MI JUNG HUR:   Uh-huh.
