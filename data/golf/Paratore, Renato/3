Q. A 72 today. How do you feel today went?
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, today was not an easy day. The wind was blowing all the day more or less, and started with a birdie and then missed two greens and made two bogeys. But then I stayed focused all the round.
Q. The bunker shot, did you hit the pin?
RENATO PARATORE: On 3, yeah.
Q. Looks like luck came back to you on 8 with the chip-in.
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, on 8, they gave me back.
Q. What do you need to do tomorrow to make sure you're in a good position for Sunday?
RENATO PARATORE: At the end, the goal is always the same. Keep focused and try to be focused on every shot and give the best.
