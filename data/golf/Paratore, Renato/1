 Q.  How would you assess your round today?  
RENATO PARATORE: I played good today, just some putts didn't go in. And I made a big mistake on 13 and 8, two double bogeys. But I made four birdies and I actually played good, so I'm happy with my round.   
 Q.  Are these the toughest conditions you've faced this week?  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, today's and the first day are quite similar. The first day the wind was blowing a lot like today, so I think today and the first day was very difficult.   
 Q.  There was an incident on the 10th. Did you see that? Talk us through that.  
RENATO PARATORE: A good incident, yeah, for me. No, it's crazy, on 10 on the slope with the wind against and it stopped, and I almost marked the ball and the ball start to rolling down to the flag and it allowed me to make a birdie. On 11 it almost stopped the same, but it did then stay there so it's okay.   
 Q.  You're five off the lead as we speak, what do you feel you need to do tomorrow?  
RENATO PARATORE: With these conditions, this wind, of course you have to be very focused on every shot. I'm playing well, so I just have to give my best on every shot I can do.
