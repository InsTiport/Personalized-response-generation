 Q.  68 today, how was that for you?  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, it's been fantastic today.  I played really solid the first nine, then one double-bogey stopped me a little bit.  But then I worked over some shots really well for a nice 4-under.   
 Q.  Tell us about the 10th, because you had to take a drop out of the trees, didn't you.  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, on the left, and from there, I made two good shots but I missed the putt.  The first one was really bad.   
 Q.  How do you assess the whole week?  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, it's been nice, because I played more or less solid.  The first days, I was there, and it's been really, really fun.
