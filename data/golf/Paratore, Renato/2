Q. Give us your thoughts on an impressive second round of 65.
RENATO PARATORE: Today I played really solid more or less, everything, also short game and long game. I just had two, three drivers a little beyond the left. I came back good in that hole. I made good up-and-downs, but it's been a good round, yeah.
Q. What was the difference today from yesterday?
RENATO PARATORE: Well, the wind. The conditions yesterday were terrible, really, especially the last six holes starts to blowing more. So I think the round has been three shot less.
Q. Do you feel 68 was a very good score yesterday afternoon?
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, it was really good score, like today.
Q. What's pleased you particularly about your play so far this week?
RENATO PARATORE: I mean, I'm driving good, the ball, far. So it help me to have short clubs this week, and the putter today was rolling good. Yeah, putting and driving.
Q. How close are you to your best?
RENATO PARATORE: I mean, I just keep improving and these two days I played like I wanted, so I'm happy about that.
Q. Going into the weekend, currently three shots off the lead, how excited are you about that?
RENATO PARATORE: Really excited always to be in contention, so yeah, I can't wait to play this weekend.
