 Q.  How was that 67?  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, it's been a really nice day.  I start so-so, the first six holes.  Then I start to play really good, and also coming in, so it was nice.   
 Q.  Bogey-free back nine.  That's been playing quite difficult this week, so you must be really happy about that.  
RENATO PARATORE: Yeah, the second nine I played really solid.  I always said before, the putter work a lot on the last nine holes, so I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  How much are you looking forward to tomorrow?  You're one shot off the lead in good position?  
RENATO PARATORE: I don't know which position because they have to play nine holes but I am in a good position for tomorrow.  We'll see what happens.
