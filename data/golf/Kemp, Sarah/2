  Q. (In progress.)
 SARAH KEMP:   It's a very calming place to be.  It's a phenomenal course as well.  The greens are rolling perfectly.  The condition is fantastic.  It's a little long, so it's a test.  But, yeah, top quality golf course.
 Q. Do you think it'll be one of those courses where players will be able to shoot low depending on the hole locations or different conditions, or do you think it'll be difficult to shoot low this week?
 SARAH KEMP:   No, I think you can definitely shoot a low round.  Yeah, like you said, there will be a few pin positions.  I feel like, I don't know, like they went easy on us today, so I am wondering what the next few are going to be like.
 Yeah, there are a couple tee options that I know that they might move us up and drive some greens and stuff.  But, no, I definitely think you can go low around here.
 Q. Going back to your round, when do you think the momentum started kicking in for you today?  Your first birdie was on the 5th hole, for you 14.
 SARAH KEMP:   Uh-huh.
 Q. When do you think the momentum started kicking in?
 SARAH KEMP:   Gosh, probably about then, yeah.  Once you get to under par for the day it kind of, yeah, you release a bit of tension and you're under par.  So probably about then.  When you roll in your first birdie is pretty cool.
 Q. Couple more questions.  We've had quite a few weeks off.  How did you relax and how did you get ready for this tournament?
 SARAH KEMP:   So straight after CME I went back to Australia and I did two weeks of hotel quarantine, spent five weeks with my family and coach.  So it was quite a busy January and February.
 It was fantastic being home, seeing my coach finally.  It had been about a year.  Yeah, just prepared in Australia, saw my coach, got back here, got over the jet lag, and here you go.  Here I am.
 Q. Well we love seeing you so relaxed.  What are you looking forward to this year with the new season and just kicking it off to a great start?
 SARAH KEMP:   Just everything.  Being back to work.  You know, the LPGA have done a great job with us being able to compete safely.  Yeah, just being back to work and out here and doing this.  There is really no better job.  I'm a bit biased.  I love this.  Just being able to go back to work.
