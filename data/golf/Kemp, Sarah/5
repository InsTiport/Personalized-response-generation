 Q.   Seems like you continued off from last week?  
SARAH KEMP:   Yeah, I played really well the first few days last week and wasn't as good on the weekend.   But I was happy with today.   It was nice and solid.   I got into trouble a couple of times but I just tried to make a bogey and not make a really big number, so I think I did that well today.   Then made a few birdies coming in, but yeah, just nice and solid.   Wasn't too much‑‑ too many stressful holes, which was nice.   
   
 Q.   Have you played this course before?  
SARAH KEMP:   No, first time.   
   
 Q.   So what do you think about the toughness?   Everyone is saying the rough is up and it's really tough.   Do you agree with that?  
SARAH KEMP:   I think it's one of the hardest golf courses I've ever played.   We were lucky today with the weather.   It wasn't as windy.   But I played yesterday, a practice round yesterday, and it was pretty windy.   It's quite tight and it's so intimidating off the tee.   There's a lot of shots where you can't see the ball land and when you get up there, the fairway looks about ten yards wide.  
So it's definitely up there with the top 5 hardest golf courses I've ever played.   But, one of the best golf courses I've ever played, too.   It's all over a great track.  
   
 Q.   Did you have to change your strategy because of the lack of wind today?   
SARAH KEMP:   Well, sort of, just a few tee shots that weren't as into the wind as, say, yesterday.   Like I just hit the 3‑wood instead of the driver.   It's so much easier said than done but you have to place it in the right spot off the tee.   I managed to do that fairly well today.   So it was good.  
   
 Q.   What were the highlights and your best birdie?  
SARAH KEMP:   Probably my birdie on 18.   I hit it in‑‑ there's that bunker right basically in the middle of the fairway.   I had to chip out and hit 4‑iron and apparently it almost went in.   I had about 212 yards and I sort of wanted to hit my hybrid but my caddie said it's probably going to chase out 30, 40 yards, and it did and I hit the 4‑iron and I hit it to about two or three‑foot and made a birdie.   So that was a really nice finish.  
   
 Q.   Just dropped a couple where you went into the rough?   
SARAH KEMP:   Yeah, I bogeyed the 9th.   My first bogey was on 3.   I hit it slightly right into the fescue and then sort of chipped out, didn't get up‑and‑down.   Then I bogeyed 9.   I was a little nervous on that one.   Hit a good bogey.   Chipped out, hit 6‑iron over the back and got up‑and‑down for bogey.   
Did I have any other bogeys?   I don't think so.   I think that was‑‑ oh, no.   I bogeyed 13 I think.   I just hit it in the left bunker.   I had one foot out, one foot in and didn't get up‑and‑down.   Yeah, it wasn't too scary, except for 9, it was a good bogey.  
   
 Q.   Why do you think you played so well?  
SARAH KEMP:   I drove the ball well.   I hit one bad tee shot on 9 which led to bogey but the rest off the tee, I hit it pretty much exactly where I wanted to, where my caddie and I wanted to, so that was probably good.   It's so tight around here, so that's the first objective is try and hit the fairway and I did that well.  
   
 Q.   Mentality tomorrow?   
SARAH KEMP:   Same again as today would be awesome.   If I could do exactly what I did today, I would take it right now.   I don't know what the weather is supposed to be like, but just staying patient, you're going to make bogeys.
