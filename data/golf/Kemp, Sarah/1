  Q. Sarah, what a great second round here at Lake Nona.  How was today different than yesterday?
 SARAH KEMP:   This might sound weird, but I didn't feel like I hit the ball as well, but I scrambled really well.  I putted awesome.  Not sure how many putts I had but, yeah, today my driver wasn't -- like I still hit some fairways but it wasn't as solid.  I had a couple misses and I got lucky and was still in an okay position.
 But, yeah, just an overall really good kind of scrambling day.
 Q. Some holes, 2, 9, 14, I think you birdied both days.
 SARAH KEMP:   Yes.
 Q. Are those some your favorites?
 SARAH KEMP:   Yeah, I like the look of them; 9 is a reachable par-5, especially today.  I hit it really close for two.  What's the other one?
 Q. 2, 9, and 14.
 SARAH KEMP:   2 was, oh, yeah, another par-5.  My wedges have been really good.  I purchased a TrackMan at the end of last year and I've done a lot of work with wedges on it especially, so like calibrating even where I grip it on the grip, the letters that I grip it on and stuff like that and my swing lengths, and it's really paid off with my wedges, so that's good.
 Q. How are you going to relax and get ready for the weekend?
 SARAH KEMP:   I'm tired.  I think I'm jet lagged from my 4:00 am wakeup call yesterday, so I'm actually going home to rest.  Yeah, so just recharge the batteries tonight, get a good night sleep, and try it do it all again tomorrow, same stuff.
 Q. Last question:  Is that the goal this weekend, just do the same thing you've been doing?
 SARAH KEMP:   Yeah, exactly.  I've been putting really well so just keep rolling it and hitting it over my start line is the most important thing.  If I do that a lot of them will go in.  So same stuff.
