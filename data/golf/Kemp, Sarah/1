Q. 67 and an eagle in there, as well.  How does it feel to climb the leaderboard on a Saturday?
SARAH KEMP: Yes, it's really good.  I wasn't sure how we were going to go with the weather, so it's all good, moving day.  Not sure how we were going to go with the weather, but it stayed pretty nice up until probably the last kind of four holes, five holes, we got it more like a two- to three-club wind, so took advantage earlier on.  Really happy with that score.  I'll take it.
Q. It must be pretty satisfying to know you're already in the clubhouse with three rounds done and you see the wind coming in and the rain about to start, do you think you might jump up a little bit more?
SARAH KEMP: Yeah, I probably should.  I don't know how high it's going to get but yeah, hopefully it jumps up a little bit more and gets me a bit of a sleep-in tomorrow would be awesome.  So, yeah, good.
Q. How used to links golf are you?  I know you play predominately in America?
SARAH KEMP: I grew up on a golf course in Sydney that's links and right on the ocean, so very windy.  It's not unfamiliar for me playing in the wind and yeah, getting the bounces.  It's probably helped me a little bit this week, which has been good.
Q. Talk me through that eagle quickly on 11.  What did you hit?
SARAH KEMP: I hit a drive.  It's pretty much straight down, maybe a tiny bit out of the left.  Got it out there.  Had about 195 to the hole.  Hit my five hybrid to about 15 foot and rolled it in.  So it's probably going to be a few more eagles there today, I would say.  It's playing pretty easy straight downwind.  Yeah, take it.
