 Q.  Today's 4-under, you played very good?  
POOM SAKSANSIN: Yes, I hit good but I think more important, I putt good today.   
 Q.  Today was windy.  
POOM SAKSANSIN: Yes, but I played in the first group, so less wind in the front nine, but back nine, still a lot of wind.   
 Q.  Your key to this week, no practice rounds, never played this course before and you're doing very well now.  Are you happy here?  
POOM SAKSANSIN: Yes, I am happy.   
 Q.  What do you think about tomorrow?  Have you set any finish, Top-10, or any target?  
POOM SAKSANSIN: I didn't set the goal yet.  Just happy and keep playing.
