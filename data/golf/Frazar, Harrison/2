 Q.   Obviously right back into position.   Got to be happy where you are.   Just some thoughts about the round.   
HARRISON FRAZAR:   Yeah, I'm not done yet.   I've got 7, 8, 9.   I missed the last few greens in regulation.   There towards the end, it was getting kind of tough to control the ball and to see a little bit.   The temperature dropped, so the ball flies a little differently.   
But I thought I played pretty well so far.   I've played some good putts, I've hit some good shots, driving the ball in the fairway, which is huge.   So I feel fine about it, yeah.   Happy where I am.
