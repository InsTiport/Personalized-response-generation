 Q.   What a clutch day for you, you're bogey‑free out there.   
HARRISON FRAZAR:   Yeah, I thought that I played beautifully tee‑to‑green and I really left a bunch out there.   You know, kind of disappointed with how the putter worked out for me, but I played nice and we'll see what happens.   
I hit a lot of good shots and had a lot of good looks.   I hit some bad putts and then decent putts that I didn't read properly.   But for the most part, they were poor putts and I'm a little disappointed about it.  
   
 Q.   Headed over to the putting green?   You may get another chance here today.   
HARRISON FRAZAR:   I sure hope so.   We'll see what happens.   
Obviously I'm pretty happy with it.   You're always happy if you get two top fives to start the year, but I don't know really how to explain it, I'm just playing golf.   I'm not trying to be technical.   I'm not worried about my grip or anything else or my alignment or whatever.  
I'm just trying to play golf, trying to hit shots and I really feel like I've played well tee‑to‑green.   If a few more putts drop, I think the last two week, both of them might have been different.
