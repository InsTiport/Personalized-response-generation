 Q. The momentum, is it mental or the power of purple?
 HARRISON FRAZAR: I'm a Longhorn fan. It might hurt me to say it; there may be something to the power of purple. The confidence is building a while and really starting to feel better, feeling better with the putter, feeling better with the driver. It's just all adding up.

 Q. When did it begin? When do you think this started in terms of gathering this confidence and the way you've been playing?
 HARRISON FRAZAR: I started feeling better about my game during the Byron Nelson. And I started driving the ball better and that kind of freed me up. That's where it starred, on the third round of the Nelson.

 Q. Was it lessons or practice or it just happened?
 HARRISON FRAZAR: It just happened. Just letting it go, and stop thinking so much, and start playing.

 Q. If ever there was a time to get it all together, this would be the best stage to do that. Talk about today and how it all felt for you. 
 HARRISON FRAZAR: Yeah, it felt good. The golf course is -- it's there for the taking right now. If you can get the ball in the fairway off the tees and take advantage of the par-5s, don't make too many mistakes on the par-3s, it's out there. I think Webb shot 5-under. 

 Q. Yes, he did. 
 HARRISON FRAZAR: But I think someone might hit 6-, 7-, 8-under.

 Q. You can't make up a lot of strokes at one time. But climbing the leaderboard is something you want to do?
 HARRISON FRAZAR: I'm going to do the same thing I did today, just try to hit fairways, pick my lines, and be aggressive. I've got no idea, I've never seen a U.S. Open this soft, particularly on Saturday if you're sitting at level par you're ahead of 50 guys. I'm not sure how it's going to play out tomorrow.
