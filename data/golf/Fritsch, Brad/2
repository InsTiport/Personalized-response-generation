  BRAD FRITSCH:   Yeah, it was uncomfortable and I made a couple of scrappy pars early and almost made eagle on 5.   I thought if I could have that momentum it would have been great and then made a few loose shots.   Didn't have it today, you know.   Too many downhill, 35 footers that broke four feet, you know, trying to get the right speed.   It was tough.   I just didn't put myself in great position to make birdie putts.  
   
 Q.   What was harder, trying to win or the card stuff on the line?  
BRAD FRITSCH:   You know, there's so much that goes along with both of them that, you know, both were -- everything just piled up on top.   I tried not to think about it.   I mean it's there.   But you know, like I said, just too many just uncomfortable birdie putts and just didn't give myself a chance.  
   
 Q.   You got through the final last year.   Playing well obviously going into the finals.   A little bit of momentum?  
BRAD FRITSCH:   Yeah, I know all the golf courses because I've been there before.   So, it is what it is.   I got to go play and you know, I'm not -- I'm playing well so there's no reason just to slide through there in the next month or so.
