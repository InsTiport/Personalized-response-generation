 Q.  From hole 13 on, talk about the putt you made on 13 after India chips in for birdie?  
LILIA VU: Well, she told me, oh, they're going to chip in so you have to make the putt.  I had two inches of break, aimed one inch out and just rammed it, because I knew we needed to make it or else they're going to get momentum from this, and we all know what happens from there.   
 Q.  And then the putt on 16, you can easily putt that thing off the green.  
LILIA VU: Yeah, I had like three people's help.  I had her caddie, my caddie and her helped me on that, so yeah, that was a good par.   
 Q.  And then how about the bunker shot on 17?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: That was awesome.  We put each other in kind of tough spots, and we just did the best we could out of it.   
 Q.  4-2 lead going into tomorrow; obviously getting those two matches at the end of the day today probably gives you guys some big momentum going into tomorrow?  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, just keep going, keep doing what we're doing and see what we can do.   
 Q.  2-0-0 for you today?  
LILIA VU: Yeah.  Yeah, that's fine.   
 Q.  Do you think you guys will be a partnership tomorrow?  
LILIA VU: I hope so.   
JENNIFER KUPCHO: Yeah, we hope so.  We work really well together.   
LILIA VU: Yeah, we do.   
 Q.  I know both you guys are long hitters, but what makes you guys --  
JENNIFER KUPCHO: I think we just have really good personalities.  We kind of have the same game.  We hit the fairway, hit the green, and do what we can do from there.
