Q. GB & I pulled within one after eight.  What were you telling yourself to keep the gas going?
KRISTEN GILLMAN: Yeah, I feel like we were definitely playing well, and so we just let it not get to our head and just knew that -- I think we talked about it, that you just have to make birdies to be able to win the holes out here because they're good teams, so you can't be winning holes with par in this format.  So we just went out there and just tried to make as many birdies as we could.
Q. Did you have a strategy, now having a partner, which typically it's an individual sport, we didn't see that you helped each other out much on the greens.  Was this something that you had discussed prior to today's round?
LILIA VU: Well, we did something different.  We went like the first person to like putt out had to make a par, and then the second person putting has to make the birdie, and that worked out pretty well for us.
KRISTEN GILLMAN: It allowed us to hit our putts, like just not -- like fearless, so I think that really helped us today.
