Q. Well played, ladies.  You were partners at UCLA, and you've won there, and now you've captured a point here for your country for the Curtis Cup.
MARIEL GALDIANO: It's a huge honor.  I mean, it's not easy out there.  We're all fighting really hard.  It's great that we got to play together as teammates.  We know each other really well and our games really well, so it was a good win.
Q. Do you think the pivotal moment of the match was when you said, I got it?
LILIA VU: I think I like had that mentality the whole time.  Like I kept telling her, like we got it, don't give anything back.  Just keep going, keep grinding.  It was a grind.  They're so good, and they were like making birdies.  I felt like they were going to make everything.  I felt like we had to get the birdie and move on.
Q. Mariel, would you say you're a scoreboard watcher out there?  Did you know how all the matches were going at the time?
MARIEL GALDIANO: I call myself a glancer maybe, just to see how everyone is doing.  It's good to know.  But I try not to think too much about it.  That's when I play the best, honestly.
Q. How do you prepare for this afternoon?  Are you going to play -- do you feel like your game is ready to go again?
LILIA VU: Well, I'm going to go work on the range a little bit, definitely go eat, and then just take a break, relax, keep doing what I'm doing.
