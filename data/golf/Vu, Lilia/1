Q. Obviously a great opponent in Sophie.  She's been really good this week.
LILIA VU: Yeah, she's so good.
Q. How were you feeling to close out that match by two holes on the 18th?
LILIA VU: I know she's super good.  I've played with her -- was it yesterday?  Sorry, there's so many matches.  I'm pretty sure I played with her, and she's super good.  Her and Olivia, they don't make mistakes.  I knew that coming in.  They send off their two best players, and I knew it was going to be a grind.  Yesterday was a grind for me, so I just kept plugging away.  All the GB & I fans are like out here, so I've just got to stay in my bubble, just me and my caddie, and that's what we did.
Q. And when you got a birdie on the 15th did you think, this is it, and then she got one back there, and did you think, oh, this is going all the way?
LILIA VU: No, I never think that I'm ever going to lose.  I always think I can get it back no matter what.
Q. What's been the key to your success this week?
LILIA VU: We believe in each other so much.  When we're on the course together, when it's like foursomes or four-balls, we just read each other's putts.  We know it with confidence and just do it.
Q. Being No. 1 in the world, does that fill you with confidence, as well, when you go out there?
LILIA VU: I think I gain more confidence from my teammates' belief in me.  That's just like what it is.  I don't really like to announce it all the time.  I don't think about it.  I just want to do my game, just do what I'm doing.
Q. And what's your plans now after Curtis Cup?
LILIA VU: Well, I have like another month until Arnold Palmer Cup, and then I get to see these girls again, so that will be really fun.
Q. So coming over to France for that?
LILIA VU: Yeah, Evian, yeah.
