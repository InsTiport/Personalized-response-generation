Q.  Just tell me a little bit about your round today.
ALAN SCHULTE:  Well, it started out pretty good actually.  I hit a lot of fairways and greens starting out, which was a good thing.  I was nervous for the first couple of holes.  You know, I didn't play too bad really.  I made four bogeys but recovered really well on 14 and 15 and made two birdies and got it back, and I just had one loose shot off the tee on 16, just put me out of position, made it tough to make a par, so a bogey.

The shot on 17, I don't understand it.  I thought I hit the yardage correct.  It was way long, and I don't know if you know what happened but it was buried.  I had to dig it out with my hand.  It was like a flashback to two years ago when I played at Whistling Straits.  I was playing pretty good the first day and hit a shot and it landed up on the fringe on No. 7, which was my 16th hole, and kicked it to the opposite side of the bunker where I had no chance to do anything, I made double bogey and shot the exact same score and it psyched me out so bad.  I really feel lousy but I feel like I held it in there pretty good.
Q.  What do you think you're going to do different then tomorrow?  Do you think it was the tee shots that took you out of position on those couple bogey holes or unfortunate circumstances like on 17 there?
ALAN SCHULTE:  Well, 16 was just a    I needed to turn the ball over and it went straight into the rough.  17, that's just, I guess, a poor yardage.  It wasn't so much a bad shot.  It flew probably eight to ten yards too far.  Yeah, it was pretty tough.  I don't know that there's much I'm going to do different.  I felt like compared to how I was hitting it on the range, I hit the ball well off the tee.  My game is kind of sketchy right now.  It's nothing quite like what it was in June.
