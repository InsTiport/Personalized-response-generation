Q.  I'm here with Captain Catrin Nilsmark.  It seems only appropriate, I guess, that these two talented teams may end up going into tomorrow's singles matches tied.  What are your observations?

CATRIN NILSMARK; I don't think so.  I think we should be ahead.  It's good.  It's been a good day.  We had, you know    I don't know, it's been okay.  I'm happy.
Q.  How proud are you of Sophie making that clutch putt on 18 after Rosie Jones sinks one from beyond 25 feet?
CATRIN NILSMARK:  It's so big.  It's wonderful.  It's huge.  Our first game, they hung in and it was fantastic, and then for Trish to make a birdie and hang in there when it really counts, that's great.
Q.  Catrin, thank you.  We look forward to tomorrow.
