Q.
Tough morning for you guys.  The Team USA really mounted a charge.  Your thoughts?
CATRIN NILSMARK:  I would have to say we're pretty happy.  If you would have said on Thursday we would be ready to go all even for the last event on Saturday, possibly we would have said yes.
Q.  You had to have felt shocked with the outcome of that Sorenstam/Matthew match, the same way Nancy Lopez was shocked when Annika made the turnaround against them yesterday.

How do you regroup from that?
CATRIN NILSMARK:  It's kind of happening for us.  We did it yesterday.  America did it today.

Annika had good chances on 7, 8 and 9, and if she had made a couple of those, I think they would have run away with the match, but she didn't.
Q.  Very interesting, fun matchup you've created here, first time putting Annika Sorenstam and Laura Davies together.  That should be a really fun match for everyone to watch.
CATRIN NILSMARK:  That's what I think.  I think they'll get some really good energy from each other, and it will be fun and exciting for them too.
Q.  That's the result you were looking for, Catrin Nilsmark, Annika starting off with a blast.
