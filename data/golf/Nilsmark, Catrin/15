CATRIN NILSMARK:  I'm very, very pleased.


Q.  What had you hoped for at the start of the day?  How many points did you think it was possible to get during that first session?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Four points.  It's always possible, but anything can happen.  There's so many good players here from both teams.  So you just have no idea.


Q.  What about this afternoon.  You're giving Iben a game.  You're giving Patricia a game as well.  What's the thinking behind your pairs this afternoon?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  It's important to bring a couple of the new ones in than went out in the morning.  I'm just pairing them up in a way that I feel is good.


Q.  It's all about the momentum at the start of competition.  To actually keep that going.  It's no good if they win three and a half points this afternoon?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  No, it's no good.  It's good to have those three points ahead.  We'll see.  Every morning and afternoon are different.  It's a new start.  But I think they've played well.  Why not take a few more points.


Q.  You managed to get out and about this morning.  Are you still feeling okay?  Are you able to get out this afternoon do you think?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Yeah.  Definitely.


Q.  We look forward to talking to you again.
