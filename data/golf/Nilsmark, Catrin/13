Q.  Anyone you would like to play that you couldn't?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Catriona Matthew.  I thought I'd really save her for tomorrow.  She's playing great.  She hits the ball really long.  The wind is picking up a little bit.  I didn't feel I could leave her out.


Q.  It's going to be a daunting match for the first, Mhairi McKay and Ana-Belen Sanchez.  Of course you don't know who they're going to play against when you make the pairings up?

CATRIN NILSMARK:  No.  But that's fine.  I knew she had one of those players resting, both of them.  It wasn't a big surprise.


Q.  There's nothing you can say, is there, which is going to help in fourball.  It's the way it goes.  The Americans seem to be quite strong.  You just have to keep your fingers crossed and away you go.

CATRIN NILSMARK:  Yes.  You have to make birdies.
