Q.  Catrin, you were victorious two years ago at home.  Are we going to cheer the chants of "Wait until Sweden"?
CATRIN NILSMARK:  Yeah, I think so, but we came here to win, and I think everyone did their very best, and the Americans just played better today.
Q.  You made some great moves along the way, but one of the traditions is the losing Captain will always get second guessed.

Is there anything you would do different?
CATRIN NILSMARK:  No, not today.
Q.  Sorry it didn't work out for you, but best of luck next time.
