  Q. Talk about the round. A little cool and windy this morning, but the scores were pretty good.   
 SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI: Yeah, it was cold and windy when we started, still dark. Yeah, I got off to an awful start. Hung in there; made a few putts; got it turned around.  
  
  Q. Was there anything significant in the round, any long putts or anything that kept the round going?   
 SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI: It was more a matter of getting the round started than keeping it going, I think. I mean, I could barely find the golf course the first couple holes.  
 I got lucky that I only (indiscernible: wind.) The first four 2-over or whatever, because I mean, I was absolutely (indiscernible: wind). It really was.   
 So I hit my drive on the first hole about 150 yards, so... then hit it in the trees right on. (Indiscernible: wind.) Made double.  
  
  Q. Was there any good shots that stand out?  
 SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI: Yeah, I hit a good shot on 3. Hit it in there close and missed it. Finally hit a good drive on 5. Hit a pretty good drive on 6. I mean, hit it close a couple times on the front and made a birdie on 7; 2-putted for birdie and birdied 9.   
 Then made the turn at even, which I thought was pretty good with where I had been hitting it.  
  
  Q. Talk about your year a little bit. We're at the end.   
 SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI: Yeah, we're at the end. Yeah, just trying to keep heading in the right direction I guess. It's been a long year. Been a bit of a struggle. But I think I'm doing better. That's the bottom line.
