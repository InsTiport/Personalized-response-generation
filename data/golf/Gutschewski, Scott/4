SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  Yeah, it was fun, a lot of people out.

Michelle played really well all day until the very end.  It was fun.
Q.  You picked up your game, too, toward the end.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  Yeah, once some people started leaving.  We lost some people at the turn.  I don't know if they knew the front nine was hilly or there was a beer garden over there or what was going on, but it's fun to play in front of people.  That's kind of what we're out here to do, and it's fun.
Q.  What was your capsule of her performance and her game?
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  I thought she played very well, good putter, very good short game, very impressed with her short game, and she hits the ball straight.

So, I mean, pretty good combination for 15.  You don't see too many 15 year olds with a short game like that.
Q.  The folks at home want to know what's up with the pink pants.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  Pink pants?  Well, I've had them for a couple weeks now, so this is kind of    they kind of have the "think pink" going on here.  I thought Friday afternoon getting paired with Michelle would be a good time to wear them.
Q.  They brought you luck today?
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  I played pretty good with them.  I've worn them three times in competition, and I played all right with them.
Q.  You made a few birdies down the stretch there.  Talk about your round and how you feel going into tomorrow.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  I feel good.  You know, I made a couple putts there and played good.  I gave myself a lot of chances.  I only got a couple putts to go in, which you need to do, so that was nice.
Q.  You're very superstitious?
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  I am?
Q.  Yeah, that's what your mom says.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  What did she say?
Q.  You qualified for the British.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  Yeah, I wore these pants when I qualified for the British.
Q.  And her shorts.  She's convinced that she's got the karma?
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  She probably does.  She probably does.
Q.  Do you wish you could have qualified in khaki?  That's my next question.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  No, I think the pink looks nice.  There's no reason fat guys can't wear pink.
Q.  Well, there's a lot of men wearing pink this weekend.
SCOTT GUTSCHEWSKI:  There's nothing wrong with pink.  I think pink is a good color.
