CARLOS FRANCO:  Tough day.  Very windy, too.  If I play good, three in a row     67, 67, I'm happy now.
Q.  You're playing with Tiger tomorrow; have you played with him before?
CARLOS FRANCO:   Yeah, we've played before.

I'm a little nervous, no, because when I check the score, I see, tomorrow, oh, Tiger.  I need support I need good focus come tomorrow and maybe two in a row.
Q.  Three straight 67s means you're on fire.
CARLOS FRANCO:  Maybe 56, 67 or 77, I don't know, but I need to play good, I need to concentrate.  Not be that big of a deal when you play well and when you play good, always you have opportunities play the good players.   And when the course is a little windy, like you said, five, six holes, happy my friend, no.  I hope four in a row is okay, I take it.  I don't know, maybe a little more because Vijay played too strong, too solid and he shoot too many under par.  But today he plays excellent and shoots an easy 7 under.  I think he's coming again, strong tomorrow, but hope everything just clicking for you.
Q.  Not going to go to the range or do anything?
CARLOS FRANCO:   No, I need to go right now because tomorrow, big, big day for me.  I need to be more focused on my game.
Q.  Playing last week does, that help you?
CARLOS FRANCO:   Of course, my friend, a win, more confidence.
