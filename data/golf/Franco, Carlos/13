 CARLOS FRANCO: No, I have my home here no more. I sell before, but I come to play to
Miami, you know, it is more near for my house and it is time difference is nothing. This
is no play last month or this months no play to L.A., but I hit longer and weather not so
good for me, a little cold, rain, and I have 5 hour difference. It is not comfortable for
my game.  
 
Q. What is it L.A.?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: L.A., yes, but I like Miami, but hot, you know, and many Latin guys is
speaking -- people speaking very well Spanish. I have many friends here, but weather is
better. 
 
Q. Where did you play in California?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: No, I know play in California. I no like it there. I rested four week,
no play Bob Hope, no L.A., San Diego, Pebble Beach.  
 
Q. Pebble Beach, hace calor?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: Lucky this year. Lucky this year, yeah.

 CARLOS FRANCO: Nissan Open. 
 
Q. All of them?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: Yes, the people say me the Pebble Beach is nice weather. But the last
week is unbelievable. Last week is not so good weather, but doesn't matter, weather, I
know weather is important, but the time difference is too difficult for me. Sometimes I
don't sleep so well at nighttime. 
 
Q. What did you make of what was going on out there with the six-man playoffs, good
weather, it has been crazy so far?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: Yes, it is good, but sometimes one guys or two guys only to play, it is
good, I think so first time six guys in playoffs, it is wonderful.

 CARLOS FRANCO: No more. I stayed at my friend house. No more, I don't have any house.

Q. Anymore?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: Paraguay many house, but -- (laughter) I come here, no stay here all
day, all week in Miami and I need to move, L.A., need to go to Dallas, you know, Houston.
Doesn't matter, no important take house here. I know have airplane. Ernie Els, everybody
have airplane, they finish tournament, go back home. It is too expensive for me. I don't
have money to pay big airplane.

comfortable. I have many, you know, many connections for San Paolo going to my home.
Everyday two flights to Miami San Paolo, American Airline, it is okay. It is cheap. A
thousand dollar for two-way, and sometimes I go first class, but what do you say, I use my
air miles. 40,000 miles for business class. But I have plenty my friends. Use too much in
America.

don't like it. People say sometimes Carlow no need practice. No, no, no. I say this is my
training, my practice is my -- coming for the Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday I hit
chip and putt and play the golf. I play the game. 
 
Q. How long have you been doing this?

much. I hit many, many, and I put in my mental, I say, I practice too much and I confusing
my swing. I need to hit only -- I need to try only my swing naturally. People go to
practice, hit little cut, little hook, many confusing for swing is not good. I try every
time my swing very simple, very natural, this is not like too much to practice. 
 
Q. What would happen if you practiced as much as Vijay?
 
 CARLOS FRANCO: Oh, I don't know. This guy is like -- he is like -- okay, this -- he is
Vijay Singh, he hit thousand and thousand balls. It is okay. He is Vijay but it is good
for me. It is okay.
