CARLOS FRANCO: I don't know. Golf course condition is excellent today; not windy.
Excellent. Greens are excellent. Pin position not too difficult. Many player under par. I
played good. I miss only one fairway, No. 9 hole, par 5, but I hit 13 fairway very easy.
My putt is excellent today. I got a big concentration. This is Miami, almost my hometown,
Paraguay and Miami only one hour different. Same weather, of course more easy for me. Big
difference from California. Every time play very bad in California, but come to Miami, my
golf changed.

Q. Isn't the treatment for that usually rest?

Q. What was your first PGA TOUR event?

CARLOS FRANCO: 1994 Memorial, my first day is 80, first time 80, then next day even
par, I remember.

Q. Given your background just what did you think that first day when you showed up to
see a PGA TOUR event, everything that everybody gets, courtesy cars and free food and the
phone calls?

CARLOS FRANCO: My first three months I need to pay rental car, I need to pay, you know,
I looking for cheap hotel, room cheap, but after it change. I play Pro-Am, every week play
Pro-Am. First time it is difficult.

Q. Can you get some idea what it was like to play in Japan to be in such a foreign
culture?

CARLOS FRANCO: Japan is very expensive. You take one taxi, you don't have car, you
don't have food, nothing, you need to pay everything. It is difficult, the language is
difficult, time, golf course conditions very, very different. Good golf course, but very
difficult conditions. It is almost up-and-down. Many time it rains and cold, mucho frio
(very cold).

Q. Were you alone? Take any family or friends with you?

CARLOS FRANCO: Single only. Everyone month stay in Japan come home two weeks. Very
difficult, with the different time. I take a big experience for me and come here to
America. Come here stay in America one or two hour difference, I think it is more easy for
me. I am very lucky, save Qualifying School 1998 for one shot, very lucky, last position,
it is okay but inside okay.

CARLOS FRANCO: Callaway is my sponsor two year in Japan and last year in here in
America. This year No. 4.

Ian Moore (phonetic) you know him? Callaway staff. He said this guy is good, need to speak
to him. That is at Casio World Open. I see Mr. Mike Gelosky (phonetic) from Callaway
saying Carlos, I need to talk. Okay. I say, I need big money. He says I only have a
little. (laughs).
