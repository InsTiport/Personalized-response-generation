  Q. This is your debut in the Senior PGA Championship. Can you tell us about the week and any new experiences?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Oh, it was exciting. Tension filled for four straight days. But it was good. I enjoyed it.  
  
  Q. Did you accomplish what you wanted to? You made the cut and that.   
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Yeah, that was one thing I really wanted to do. I wanted to play a little better the last couple days, but it's just hard, the golf course is tough.   
  
  Q. People are going to ask you about the way you played yesterday maybe for a long time from now. What are you going to tell them?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed myself and my brother was on the bag and that made it really special.   
  
  Q. You said yesterday that you couldn't dream up a scenario like that. Does it give you kind of an added incentive to get back?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Well, you know, I started practicing because I knew this was coming. I normally don't practice, especially in Oregon in the winter time. And I forced myself out on the rain and the cold. And I said, you know, I might have to practice some more in the fall when our qualifier comes through. So.   
  
  Q. What do you think you'll be able to take away from what you learned this week?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Playing with a little more added I guess pressure. Focusing, that kind of thing.
