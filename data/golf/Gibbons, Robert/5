  Q. You made the cut, you're one of the club pros, you're going to be playing this weekend. How does that feel?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Very good. I don't know, my expectations were to play solid and if I made the cut, that would be great. And it turns out, it looks like I did.  
  
  Q. For a first timer, are you excited?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Very excited. I tried not to put too many expectations, not knowing really what to expect. And I played good both days. Very solid.   
  
  Q. What was it like in front of the crowds today?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: It was great. But it was very nerve wracking, but that's part of the deal. And probably more nervous tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Did you get into a rhythm on the course today?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: I did. I kind of was shaky there a few holes, but overall I was pretty solid for 36 holes.   
  
  Q. What are you going to think about going into tomorrow morning?  
 ROBERT GIBBONS: The same thing as I did the last two days, fairways and greens.
