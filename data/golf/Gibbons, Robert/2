  Q. If you can, just kind of describe the overall experience this week and some of the highlights of your round today.   
 ROB GIBBONS: The week was good, other than didn't play too good yesterday. I played better today. I wish I could have played a little better yesterday when the wind was blowing so hard. Hopefully the guys will get a little taste of it this afternoon.   
  
  Q. Describe that transition from the afternoon to the morning tee time. How did that affect you?  
 ROB GIBBONS: Well obviously just less wind, you don't have to calculate how much it's hurting or helping. Downwind the ball won't stop as quick which really it's harder I think almost than going into the wind, you can calculate it better going into the wind. But, yeah, it was fine this morning.
