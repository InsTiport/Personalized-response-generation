 Q. Robert Gibbons, who had a great game today. Talk about the back-to-back birdies on 15 and 16. 
 ROBERT GIBBONS: 15, hit a great drive up the right, hit a 4-wood middle of the green, 2-putt, birdie. 
 Then 16, driver, 4-wood, wedge, about 10 feet and made the putt. 

 Q. How are the greens playing today for you?
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Fast. Very difficult and fast. You want to hit the ball pin high and maybe below it. Don't be above the pin.

 Q. You had another birdie as well out there. 
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Yeah, on the fifth hole I hit it about two feet. So I made that one. 

 Q. This is your debut in this event. 
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Yes, it is. I'm the kid of the bunch. One of the kids.

 Q. Did the course play the way you expected?
 ROBERT GIBBONS: Yeah, I played three practice rounds and it helped me on some of the par-3s picking the right club, etcetera. But it played just like practice.
