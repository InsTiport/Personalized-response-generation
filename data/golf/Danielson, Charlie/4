CHARLIE DANIELSON: I was definitely a little nervous.  There were some nerves there.  But I settled down.  My caddie and I, we had a good game plan.  Coach Small helped me prepare this week.  I just went out and tried to enjoy the day.  I had no idea if I would shoot 80 or 66, so I just went out with no expectations and it worked out.
Q. This was a different golf course today.  It was firm and fast and all of a sudden the rains came.  How did that affect the way you played?
CHARLIE DANIELSON: Yeah, that's exactly right.  And it played easier today for sure.  But you know, I chose the same clubs off the tee for the most part but I was a little more aggressive going at pins because I knew that even out of the rough it was just sticking.
Q. Pinching yourself right now?
CHARLIE DANIELSON: Yeah, it hasn't really sunk in yet I don't think.  It was a great day.
