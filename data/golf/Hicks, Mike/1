 Q.  What's it like, obviously had a little different relationship with you and gray son than most player/caddies where you've known him for a long time, he's friends with Jacob and I'm sure you never envisioned when you first met him that eventually you would ever be on the bag with him for a win.  
MIKE HICKS: True.  I knew he was going to be good at an early age when I saw him play.  But, no, it really didn't, we really didn't toy around with the idea until we left college and he said he was going to go to the TOUR school and I wasn't caddieing at the time, I was working at Mill Creek and I said yeah, I'll go work Q-School for you.  That's how it all started last fall.   
 Q.  He said that he would have never gotten through Q-School without you, what does that mean to hear?  
MIKE HICKS: That's nice of him to say.  I don't know if that's true, but he's going to play well with whoever is on his bag.  A caddie is only as good as his player.   
 Q.  You've been for on the bag for Major Championship, what kind of player is he?  Where do you see his potential?  
MIKE HICKS: I think that the sky's the limit for Grayson.  Obviously, there's going to be bumps in the road with whoever's career you look at but the potential is there for him to go pretty far.
