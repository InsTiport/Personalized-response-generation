 Q.  You pulled out a really tight match here.  
HAYLIN HARRIS: I did.   
 Q.  Tell me about it.  
HAYLIN HARRIS: I started out all right.  We kind of went back and forth.  Mika was making so many great up-and-downs, and she probably has the best short game I've ever seen, so I knew it was definitely going to be a tough match.  I just knew if I came in and just didn't get frustrated and just kept playing the way I was playing, I would have a chance, you know?   
 Q.  What did you have to do to beat her?  
HAYLIN HARRIS: Just hit the ball in spots where I know I could play and make par from.  You know, on the way in, I seemed to play that back nine pretty well, so I just had a couple really good shots that helped me.   
 Q.  This must give you a lot of confidence going into the next match here.  
HAYLIN HARRIS: It does, but everyone out here is so good, so I just feel very humbled.   
 Q.  Is that a Michigan State hat?  
HAYLIN HARRIS: It is, yeah.   
 Q.  What year are you?  
HAYLIN HARRIS: I'm going to be a senior in high school.   
 Q.  Senior in high school, going to Michigan State in the fall of --  
HAYLIN HARRIS: 2018, correct.   
 Q.  So this is going to give you some really good experience.  
HAYLIN HARRIS: It will.
