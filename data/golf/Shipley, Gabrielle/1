Q. What was going through your mind as you were standing over that lengthy putt and the final one to win the match?
GABRIELLE SHIPLEY: The second putt on each hole?  Well, the nine-footer on hole 2, I knew I had it right when I read it.  There was just like I had a feeling.  That's why I stepped up when it was my turn and just put it in.  And then this one, I read it when she was done, and I was pretty confident that it was inside left, and so I hit it, and I had a feeling I didn't hit it hard enough, and then thankfully it just tossed in there at the end.
Q. And the big difference between playing the first two days and playing now, did you get any advice as you headed into the match play portion of this?
GABRIELLE SHIPLEY: Yeah, I called my dad last night and just kind of asked him, what are some things I need to kind of think differently for match play and stroke play.  Do I need to be more aggressive or anything, and he said, you need to be more aware of the match, because in stroke play I just try and forget all numbers and it's just really my game, but in match play you have to kind of know what's going on.  I was definitely more aware today, and I don't normally like to know when I have to make putts, but it's kind of impossible in match play.  I read them pretty consistently, and I was confident with the nine-footer and six-footer on this hole, and they ended up rolling in thankfully.
