Q.  Talk about your match today.  Good win. 
STEPHEN LEANEY:  Well, we didn't really play that well.  Fred didn't putt well.  We probably struggled a little bit, and I was fortunate enough to get up after 9, 10, 11.  I hit a great shot into 9 and made birdie.  He three-putted, I think, 10 and 12, which is how things do in this game and you come back.  You can't let the door back open with a few bad drives, and you just have to hang in there.

Q.  Talk about last year a little bit.  I think you beat Justin 7-6 at one point.  Tiger was playing about as good as he could play.  Talk about your experience last year. 
STEPHEN LEANEY:  Last year was a good learning sort of curve for me because I got to play two good match plays and then get up against Tiger, and having sort of played in that situation before, that sort of helped me, I think, in the final round of the U.S. Open.  I sort of drew on the experience I had against Tiger, so that was good. 
I'm up against a great match player in Mike Weir.  You seem to get hot matches around here every day, which is what you expect in match play, but you've got to try to do the right thing and try and keep pressure on your opponent, which is what I didn't do the last four or five holes.

Q.  Playing on The Presidents Cup team you got to know Mike better than you knew him before that. 
STEPHEN LEANEY:  I've known Mike since 1993.  We played together on the Canadian Tour for three years, so I've known Mike for a long time.  We just haven't socialized closely, but we've certainly been friends for a while.  Lots of the guys out here are friends.  You know, that's the fourth time we've played each other.
