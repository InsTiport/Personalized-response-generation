   GREGORY HAVRET: Yeah, it's a lovely way to finish a tournament, 64 in the last round. No mistakes today, I had birdies and ten pars. 
 Obviously a little bit of a shame that I missed this 6-footer on the last. It a very tough hole. So to have six feet for birdie and make 63 is really something, but this hole is in a really silly place. It's really dodgy slope, and I miss-read my putt. Yeah, it's like that but I'm quite happy obviously I am. 

 Q. A bit of a shame about the third day because this could be so much better?
 GREGORY HAVRET: Yeah, it cost me a lot more than a few points, but it's like that. I would have played later with those boys, would have been probably a different day, different game. I was probably very much into it and very aggressive because I had a bad day yesterday, also. So maybe this bad day yesterday helped me to play better today. 
 I'm 18-under after four rounds, every day under par, we are talking about a bad round, still 1-under, so, still fine. I would have some worse rounds. 
 Yeah, it's like that. It's like that. I'm quite happy and I'm quite happy of this result. 

 Q. Do you still fancy your chances for a good finish, knowing there were plenty of chances out there?
 GREGORY HAVRET: Well, I won't be in contention, that's for sure. Hopefully I will be in the Top-10. That will be great to shoot 64 and finish in the Top-10 after being 25th after three rounds. And why not a little bit better, if the wind keeps on moving like this, it's not that easy of a course. You have to avoid big mistakes, like on 18. 
 17, you can easily make a five or a six, and on 16, also, which is a tough hole against the wind, you can easily make bogey, too. So this finish is not that easy, and I'll see that on TV, yeah.
