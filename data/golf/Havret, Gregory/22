 Q. Obviously as your title defence, you must be very proud of the way you played over the weekends?
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, 10-under on the weekends is great and I really struggled the second day to make that cut and just on the mark, 76; it cost me a lot but anyway, it's like that, good week. 

 Q. Two years running now, you've been in contention. 
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, true, again, I struggled one day, but otherwise, last year and this year, seven very, very good rounds. 
 Yeah, I'm quite looking forward to next week. 

 Q. You're going to Crans? 
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, I go. 

 Q. And Mercedes?
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Hopefully, I need a little bit of a move to get in there but hopefully. 

 Q. And start The Ryder Cup race? 
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yes, should have been this week. 

 Q. And you'll want to be in contention this time next year?
 GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yes, absolutely.
