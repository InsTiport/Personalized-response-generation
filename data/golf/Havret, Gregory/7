Q. A windy old day today, 8-under and nicely praised?
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, three days under par in those conditions, probably the toughest day today I think.  The wind switched slightly.  Sometimes you expect a bit more help or a bit less help.  A few mistakes and unfortunately a couple of 3-putts and unfortunately I missed that short one on the last hole, birdie.  Otherwise, yeah, I'm quite pleased with this 2-under today.  Yeah, anything red today is quite good, so 2-under, I'm very pleased.
Q. Essentially, a sweet finish, I know what happened at 18 but with the two previous holes as well?
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, definitely, I finished well.  I had a good opportunity on 14.  I missed it.  I 3-putt 15.  That's one of my two 3-putts and 16 and 17 were obviously well played and birdies there.
Would have been really good for me to finish with a four with the pin position on 18, but five is not bad and 8-under, definitely not bad, too, yeah.
Q. Still a lot of golf to be played, but do you fancy a good opportunity now?
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, we'll see.  I mean, tomorrow is another day of golf.  It's been 16 years now on Tour, so I know that anything can happen.  Obviously on the good, too.  I'll try to do my best and play shot after shot, as concentrated as I am since Wednesday.  And then we'll see.  But if I do well, if I play well, then why not, yeah, we'll see.  But a good result would be to finish in the Top-10 would be already good.  So we'll see after.  If it could be better, why not.
