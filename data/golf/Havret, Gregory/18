   GRÃGORY HAVRET: I am currently 57th in The Race to Dubai so I'm delighted with that start and I played very solidly today after a bad start when I double bogeyed the second hole, but, importantly I bounced back straight away with a birdie and I converted a lot of chances in the rest of the round even though I three putted on 12 for a par. I practised well coming into today and that has made a big difference.
