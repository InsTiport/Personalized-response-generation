GRÃGORY HAVRET: I started, I had my card in 2000, and since 18 years now on the Tour, every year, and yeah, reaching 500 means a lot for sure.  It's a big number, definitely.   
 Q.  Three wins on The European Tour.  Which one gave you the most satisfaction?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: All of them were pretty special.  The very first one was Italy in 2001.  Was my very first year.  I wasn't expecting to win on my first year and that was very helpful for my confidence and the rest of my career.   
I would say the 2007 Scottish Open, defeated Phil Mickelson in a playoff at Loch Lomond, which is probably one of the most beautiful course I ever played, is probably the one I will put No. 1 in those three.  And the Johnnie Walker at Gleneagles the year after, 2008, that's a lot of good memories for sure.   
 Q.  It's a long time to spend on The European Tour.  Is there anything else that really stands out for you in the 500 events?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Well, I feel like it's a big family, honest will he, with all the friendships, we are pretty close.  There's so many players that come to me this week and said, that's very well done and that's great.   
All these things are very nice and I feel really good now.  I feel like, honestly, like to be in a family.  So I will keep that in mind.  Of course, many good memories, also, I guess in the last ten years, the peak of my career, and some disappointments, too, cuts missing by one or two and some doubt sometimes.  This life is definitely an up-and-down thing, as life is.   
So yeah, those 18 years were very decent to me, so I feel fortunate to be there in front of you talking to you, but I hope I keep going because I just love this game so much and I do enjoy those weeks, definitely.  So my family is a big support, too, and thanks to all of them.
