   GREGORY HAVRET:  It was a 4 iron at the 7th. Rafa hit a very nice 4 iron first and I felt full of confidence and he asked me to hit the best shot I could and apparently it was! Seve was there - Nick Faldo was there. Maybe that's a good pointer for next year! It's my first official hole in one, although my fourth in total.   
 RAPHAEL JACQUELIN:  It was a good comeback. We made some mistakes but steadied the game and holed good putts on 15, 16 and 17. At the 15th Greg holed from six metres; then on 16 I hit a nine iron to 2 metres maybe and a four iron to 5 metres on 17. Nice way to close the game. It's all about the short game here. Three wins out of three - we are very positive. A little bit tired but alternate shot this afternoon is okay.
