 Q.   So your thoughts on shooting a good two‑day score around here?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Yeah, my thoughts are good obviously.     Very good day today, tough start but I managed to come back in the game after a poor 2‑over after seven holes, but the finish was good, and especially birdie, birdie to close up the course.   So I feel good.   Driving is really good.   
I didn't miss a single fairway yesterday and missed only two today, so that was definitely the very good thing who helped me to be able to go low, yeah.   
   
 Q.   And you said slow start today, does that mean you needed a wake‑up call, something to click into place?   
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Yeah, I guess, just off holidays and those holidays I was able to go up that early‑‑ that was a bit tough, but we know it and weather was good.   It wasn't cold at all.   So that helps usually, but no, I wasn't able to play as good as I wanted, but that was fine.   Missed a few putts, but that's golf I guess.   
   
 Q.   And it's a lovely position, albeit the leaders raced away, you're in a fine place on that board?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Yeah, it's good to be 8‑under after those two first rounds, two to go, very impressive course.   I think best shape ever.   Good greens and it's very interesting to play and compete on a Ryder Cup course always.   So I'm very happy to do that the first two days and I'm looking forward those next two, obviously are very important.  
   
 Q.   And of course it is a place you know very, very well, so is there something special about Gleneagles?   
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Well, definitely over the years, you've got some courses you feel better than other ones.   This is definitely a course I really like and enjoy to play.   I see it well, and I've got a good feeling on it, yeah, for sure.   
Not all the courses are as well my eyes as this one, so I try to take advantage of it as soon as I'm coming here.   I'm hoping this year will be good, and why not as good as 2008.
