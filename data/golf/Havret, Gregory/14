  GRÃGORY HAVRET:   It's a good round, clean round, into blue and dark stuff, so it was a good day, definitely. 
My game is actually quite good, so I'm quite happy and I didn't miss many drives, which is really good here because the course plays long with the conditions, and a touch of a breeze today, so you don't want to be in the rough to play those very long second shots.   Yeah, that was definitely the good point, the driving. 

Q.   And the greens were receptive, so gave you plenty of chances? 
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Yeah, funny flags today, like No. 8 is quite tough and No. 7 to finish there, it's a strong finish with those pins. 
18 is also a very hard one, and, yes, for sure, if you are quite confident and your game is shaped nicely, then you can go for one or two flags usually don't really go, especially on those greens.   That's what I did today.   I didn't make mistakes and, yeah, the choices were the good ones today.   It was good. 

Q.   Your game has been shaping up nicely, hasn't it? 
GRÃGORY HAVRET:   Yeah, absolutely.   I made a few cuts in a row, five cuts in a row.   It not the greatest thing, but means that you're here. 
Usually when you are Top 60 after two rounds, your game is quite fine, and Sweden was even better, because I finished 10th.   I had a good run of 47 or 48 holes without bogeys, so really means that short game was obviously good. 
But I wasn't in trouble after the drive, and it's all about that, if you want to do well, you've got to find the fairway and distance on the first shot to be able to play and compete against the big boys.   So, yeah, that's what happened since a few weeks now, I'm quite happy, but just hopefully will keep on going.
