 Q.  Pleased with the round as a whole?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yeah, I'm very pleased.  3-under yesterday, 3-under today was definitely a very good start.  It's a bit of a shame, the 3-putt on the last, but it was a tough one.  It's tough to avoid mistake all day long, and I didn't on the very last one, but I'm quite happy.   
 Q.  What are the keys to the game today, the birdies?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Stay patient.  Stay patient.  I mean, those greens are really hard to read, and with the rain, pitched really well.  So you could put some backspin quite a lot, a bit more than yesterday.   
They are tough to read.  So you miss a few ones and you don't want to lose patience because you know everybody will struggle pretty much.   
So if you keep calm, stay cool kind of thing with your head, it could be good, because any time you could put one or two putts -- so that's what happened today.   
 Q.  Obviously in a great position going into the weekend?  
GRÃGORY HAVRET: Yes, it's good to be if a good position.  We'll see that tomorrow.  But it's part of the road.  It's a fantastic tournament.  It's so well organised and one of the best for sure, and I'm very happy to be part of it for four days.  Yeah, tomorrow is another day, but it's a good feeling right now.
