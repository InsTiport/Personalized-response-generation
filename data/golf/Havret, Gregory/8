GRÃGORY HAVRET: I have positive thoughts, definitely.  Played really well, especially the beginning.  I struggled in the end and Seve came back.  He had a very good opportunity at the last to push till the 18th.  Luckily for me it lipped-out.
That was a great game.  Typical match play, when I thought I had this hole No. 15 for me, it turned on his favour.  And I struggled on 16 and managed a great up-and-down to stay 2-up, and obviously it's a great advantage to play.
Good day.  I'm quite happy, definitely.
Q. Looks nice in the scoring that you seem to have been controlled, in the lead all the time, and yet still tested, which is probably to your benefit.
GRÃGORY HAVRET: The thing is, this course, first till say 9, 10, I know I have to do well and I have to take the advantage of it, because then the back nine is wind against and Seve is great driving.  His ball is really low, great from the tee and I knew it would be hard for me because he's probably a touch better in these conditions than me.
So I knew I had to really take the advantage of the first nine, ten holes, to have a bit of a cushion to play with after, and it's exactly what I planned.  Obviously I was very fortunate to make two very good up-and-down on 14 and 16 to stay up, but otherwise it would have been all-square on 18.
In golf, you can't plan everything, but in match play, anything can happen.  But for sure, this course is a testy one.  It's tight fairways and hard greens, and the wind switched completely.  It's a new course for us.  Yeah, I was in control in the beginning and that was probably the key of this 2&1 win, yeah.
