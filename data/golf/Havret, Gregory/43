GORDON SIMPSON:  Well played today.  You are joint leader in the clubhouse with Trevor Immelman, 65.  Tell us about the round and what the key elements were today.
GREGORY HAVRET:   I think it was definitely the putting and the driving today.  Driving is very important on this course because the rough is very big.  You don't have want to miss in the rough.  Pitching was very nice, as well, so made a good score.
Q.  And you played well a few weeks ago in Italy?
GREGORY HAVRET:   I finished third in the playoff.  Pretty similar this week, this day, so yeah, it was good.
Q.  And what are the ambitions for this season?
GREGORY HAVRET:   Well, my big goal is a big goal, my big goal is to finish in the top two in France.  There are so many good players now, the level is very high, especially with that win in Spain, by Christian Cevaer, it's been great     Raphael (Jacquelin), Thomas (Levet), there are a lot of other guys, so if I do this, I think it's going to be a great year.
Q.  Why have the French golfers suddenly come to the fore; do you know?
GREGORY HAVRET:   Good question.  I don't know.  I think I don't know, I don't really know, I'm sure every week it's going on and many Top 10s since the beginning of the year and it's probably a trend and we are together inside and just follow the guys and probably something like that.  I don't really know.  But it's good for us.  We are very friendly together so it's very good.
Q.  You said you want to finish in the top how many in France?
GREGORY HAVRET:   The top two, because at the end of the year, you have the World Cup and it's only the best two players in the country who go.
Q.  Who went last year, Raphael and Thomas?
GREGORY HAVRET:   Yes, and the year before, as well.
Q.  What about in terms of where do you want to get into the European ranking, World Ranking?
GREGORY HAVRET:   I don't have a really big goal on that page because I want to play shot after shot, tournament after tournament.  I mean, I try my best every time, and we'll see.  We'll see at the end.  For sure I'll be very happy if I finish in the Top 50 in Europe.  I will be very happy.  I had a very good year the first year in 2001 but after was not very good.
Q.  Any particular reason?
GREGORY HAVRET:   In 2002 I played really bad.  My golf was bad.  I worked probably on the wrong things, I changed my coach and that year finished 102nd but things didn't really feel like a great move.  So I changed again with another one and definitely we worked very well during the winter, and since the beginning of the year we are very happy with the way it's going on.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Who is your coach now?
GREGORY HAVRET:   Benoit du Colombiers.  He is a federation coach.
GORDON SIMPSON:  It used to be Fabrice Tarnaud?
GREGORY HAVRET:  Yes.
Q.  What's your home course?
GREGORY HAVRET:   Bussy St. George in Paris.
GORDON SIMPSON:  Thank you very much, Gregory.
