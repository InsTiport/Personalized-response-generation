   GRÉGORY HAVRET:  I drove the ball well and hit some nice shots. The first 11 holes I was really enjoying it as the game was right there. I drove the ball well, hit good irons and putted well, the three keys to the round. The birdie on the 15th was important after the two bogeys. Made a good putt. I was happy to make that but a little disappointed not to hole one on the last. 

 Q.  You recently changed to the belly putter? 
 GRÉGORY HAVRET:  I changed last week and finished 15th. It was a good result for me, a nice week. I was happy with my putting and kept it and has been good for me today. 

 Q.  Bit of excitement with your playing partner on the 17th? 
 GRÉGORY HAVRET:  Me and my partner hit a five and a six and Romero chose a 7-iron. It was an awesome shot. A bit of luck to go in but a beautiful shot for a beautiful car and a French car.
