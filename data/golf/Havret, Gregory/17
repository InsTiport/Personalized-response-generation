   GREGORY HAVRET: It was a good round, definitely. I had a bad three-putt on 16, but the rest was pretty good, solid day. Tough day driving, but it's been really good today, so that was good. Practising was so-so and today was really good.

 Q. And presumably you were very conscious of the low scores and trying to get off to a good start?
 GREGORY HAVRET: I thought it was good but not good enough to be -- it's good enough to be on the top of the leaderboard, but 4-under, is at the minute, 30th, and that means there is 29 guys who shoot 5-under and better, which is a hell of a lot. 
 It's still a good course. Of course it plays easy. It was beautiful weather and the rough is not too big. But it's not as easy as this course and the scores. Yeah, it's obviously a very good test and strong holes, like 9 to finish and 7 and 18. It's a strong test of golf and quite happy with 6-under definitely. 
 I started well the season, it's been so-so since my early days, and I had four cuts in a row missing, a couple by one, which is not really far. You feel like you can do better and missing by one. It's the first good round here and hopefully expecting better future.
