CHRIS DiMARCO:  I'm glad it's over to tell you the truth.  My stomach was turning out there.  It was a lot of fun.  My caddie is going down 18, and he's going, "man, isn't it good to be back here again."  I went away for a little while, and it's good to be back, and it is fun.

I'm telling you, a lot of golf to be played.  There's some tough holes.  Tiger Woods is out there, so it seems he can always do something.
Q.  16, 17 and 18, certainly no three automatic pars; nevertheless birdie holes.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Exactly.  The greens are getting pretty beat up.  They're tough to get close to.  16 you've got that water right there, anywhere trying to spin it back and hold the green, let alone make a birdie.  We'll sit and wait and watch and if we have to, we'll go play some more.
Q.  I told you 18 looked good right to left.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  The putt on 17, I don't know how that one missed.  That one I hit right where I wanted to, perfect speed, and somehow it just didn't break in.

18, I spun it out there and said, "this is a tough hole, give yourself a chance."  It looked pretty good with about six feet to go.

I was a little less aggressive out there, and pars are good out there.  I got off to a great start, obviously 3Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½under through 6, and was content with hitting it in spots to twoÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½putt and had some good chancesÃ  Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ I think really one bad shot the whole day.  I hit a bad shot on 12, hit a poor 6Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½iron in there.  Other than that, I hit a lot of really good shots today.  I'm proud of myself because I hung in there.
Q.  Now you've got to wait and see what happens.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yeah, certainly there's a lot of golf to be played out there, but they've been backing up all day, so who knows, we'll see what happens.  I'd like to go out there on 18 and accept something instead of having to go play more, but we'll see what happens.
Q.  What is your mindset at this point knowing that you're done and you've done the best that you could but that guys are still out there?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  It's out of my control.  All I can do is go in and drink something because my mouth is a little dry, and watch and see what happens.  If we have to go play more, we go play more.
