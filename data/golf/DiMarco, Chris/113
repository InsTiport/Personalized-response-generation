Q.
Talk about 17. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  We just kind of fought each other all day.  I don't think -- we only maybe tied five holes all day.  You know, I hit a good putt on 17 and I hit it a little harder than I wanted to, but it went in dead center.  I was looking there, aiming there. 

18, all I had to do was two-putt from 18 and I run it by about three, and I'm like, Oh, God.  Now we have a little match of the Presidents Cup final round, me and Stuart Appleby.


Q.  Talk about you were down early, battled back. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yes, 2 down after four -- 2 down after three, and if you miss the fairway out here, you're dead.


Q.  Chris, how are you swinging at the ball?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  We need to work a little bit.  We kind of gutted that one out today, so hopefully we'll get some good swings later this week.
