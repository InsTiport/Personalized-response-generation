  Q. Chris, a little bit about your round today. Obviously you're now in the hunt.   
 CHRIS DiMARCO: You know, I'm putting good, and I think that's the key. The swing really wasn't where I wanted. Didn't really know where my driver was going, but not so bad where I was hitting it in the trees or anything, but I putted really good. I made some good five, six, seven-footers for pars to keep the round going, made a couple good birdies, and made a couple of long ones the last few days, so that's what you need to do.   
  
  Q. Obviously an important week for you, but I know in some respects you'd rather be in Columbia, too.   
 CHRIS DiMARCO: You know, yeah. This is such a great week for the family, for the kids. It's a shame it's on the same weekend as the South Carolina game, but I do enjoy playing this tournament.   
 This is probably my favorite tournament on TOUR, other than a major, so it's great to be here. It's nice to have friends out and people follow me, people pulling for me, and that's what it's all about.   
  
  Q. Did you have anything today, any long putts or any saves that sort of kept the round going?  
 CHRIS DiMARCO: I made a really good putt on 6, just playing about as hard as anybody out there, driving a 6-iron in and made about a 30-footer.   
 I made a good birdie on 14 to kind of -- at that time I was 1-over through my first four. Birdied there and actually birdied 17 and made a great up-and-down on 18 to keep the round going, going into the front nine, so it's just one of those days where it was just kind of a grind day.   
  
  Q. Okay. Keep it going. Good playing.
