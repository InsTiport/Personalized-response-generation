 Q.  Eight birdies, 16 holes, you are still playing some very good golf.
CHRIS DIMARCO:   Very good.  We both kind of fed off each other.  I'm just putting so good, I'm giving myself so many opportunities.  Actually, on No. 10, I had a chip-out from the fairway and got it from 130 yards.  So it was solid.  I'm playing solid.  Just keeping the confidence going.

Q.  Do you enjoy this format?
CHRIS DIMARCO:   You know what, I've got Calcavecchia tomorrow.  So it should be fun tomorrow.  It will be fun.  Today was fun.  Stricker and I go back a long way, so that was a lot of fun today.  And Calcavecchia, that will be a lot of fun tomorrow.

Q.  Does the hole look like a bucket to you right now?
CHRIS DIMARCO:   It looks bigger than a bucket, I'm telling you.  My speed is really good, and these greens were tough to putt today.  They were a little bouncy and a little grainy, and I was able to pretty much make them dead center. 
(Referring to putting grip):  I'm hoping it doesn't catch on out here.  I kind of like not having too many guys doing it because I know it helps me a lot.  Obviously, I've been doing it for seven years now, so it's not a band-aid anymore.
