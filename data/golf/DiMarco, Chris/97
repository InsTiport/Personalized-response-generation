Q.  You went out against a hot player, you beat him, in a match that looked like it was going to be critical, do you find any good feelings about what you did out there today
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Obviously as a competitor, heck I can't, you know, I'm out there to win.  I try to not even worry about the point out there.

We talked last night about individually getting our on point, getting it done individually, and hopefully at the end it would add up for us.  You know, they played great on Friday and that's probably what the difference was.  They got five points; that's a pretty hard margin to make up.
Q.  Does this make you want to get on the team in two years and go to Ireland even more?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  I can tell you right now, that two years ago when I didn't make this team, I was a little upset.  I didn't really know, and now that I know what it's all about, I'm going to be trying my hardest to make it next time.

So this was an unbelievable week.  I tell you what, it was nice to get that win and get as many points as we could to make this more competitive.  You know what, you take those six numbers, and, boy, that's 11 to 11 with the last six guys going out.  And me being one of those six, I thought, who know, why not?  Why can't we go win 9 1/2 points today?  Is it really that impossible?

Obviously they played really good.  They had a great week.  You can't take anything away from them.  They played really solid from top to bottom.
