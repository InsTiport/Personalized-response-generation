   CHRIS DiMARCO: Made birdie on 2, and then I hung in there all day, and then from 4 I had 200; 5, 204; 6, 204; 7, 204; 8, 230; and 9, 230. To play those holes even, I guess, was pretty good. Bogeyed 8, birdied 9, then went to the turn, birdied 10, and then just kind of made a bad bogey on 14 and then just pulled it left on 15, but then made a great birdie on 18 to finish even par. So it was tough. It's just playing so long. The greens are still soft enough you can do some good with, but they're firming up. I think it's going to start getting tougher, which is good.  
  
  Q. Do you feel what you've been working on is there now?  
 CHRIS DiMARCO: I do. I was telling my caddie actually that it almost feels -- like when I first started doing it, it really felt like I was really trying to manipulate the club, and now I'm not doing that nearly as much, or it doesn't feel like that, so to speak. It's starting to feel more comfortable. So it's a good thing.
