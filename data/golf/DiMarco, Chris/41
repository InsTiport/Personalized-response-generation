Q.  Playing with Phil and the success you've enjoyed and the camaraderie, can you speak to that first?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yeah, we gelled phenomenally at the Presidents Cup and we played a lot of practise rounds together in the last year.  I know that when we came out here the last month ago we played a lot together, and then every day this week we played together.  You know, I really feel comfortable with Phil.  I know he feels comfortable with me.  So it's a nice partnership.
Q.  You're facing a very veteran group; they were comfortable as well together in past Ryder Cups.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yeah, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood are obviously two of their best players.  And obviously Darren being Irish, he's going to have a lot of support from the crowd.

You know, it's going to be fun.  Both those guys I respect very much, and actually both those guys are friends of mine.  It's going to be a fun match and hopefully we can pull through.
Q.  It's like going into an opponent's court, or an opponent's gym and you have to fight through that, the emotion.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  It's going to be loud, no doubt about it.  I'm expecting that.  I'm not expecting too many cheers, but I have seen a lot of Americans over here, so we're going to have our cheers, too.
