Q. A nice finish with a birdie and, taking into account the conditions this afternoon, are you reasonably satisfied?

CHRIS DiMARCO: Absolutely, this is a tough golf course especially the finishing holes on both sides coming right back into the wind and any time you shoot under par it is a good thing and it was nice to finish with a birdie, so I am looking forward to tomorrow.
Q. Did you feel a little bit at home with the overall layout here?

CHRIS DiMARCO: Well certainly compared to courses like the British Open, this is nothing like it. This is more like our type of golf course and kind of reminds me of the type of course the guys will be playing over at the Bob Hope. A little bit of wind and some par 5s that are reachable, but holes that if you are not careful on, you can run up a big number.
Q. Are you hoping the wind dies down a little bit in the morning tomorrow?

CHRIS DiMARCO: Yes, I do, hopefully it will go a bit so we can have some holes where the wind is not such a big issue, because today it certainly was hard hitting some shots into these holes with the wind blowing sideways.
