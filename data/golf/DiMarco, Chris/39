CHRIS DiMARCO:  It was an emotional match obviously with Darren.  We just didn't make any putts.  We made a couple, they made some good ones to save some pars.  It looked like we had the match and then all of a sudden it got away from us.
Q.  What happened on 17, you were all square, coming into 16?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  They both hit great shots.  They made some good ones to save some pars.  It looked like we had the match, and all of a sudden it just got away from us.
Q.  What happened on 17, you were all square, or 16?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  They both hit great shots and I wasn't able to go for the green.  I hit a good drive and laid up to a really tough pin and still hit a great second shot to the green, just in the bunker and blasted it about eight, ten feet by and they putted out for gimme basically and we missed it.
