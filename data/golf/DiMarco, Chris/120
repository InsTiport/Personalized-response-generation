CHRIS DiMARCO:  I played really solid today.  Hit a lot of fairways again.  11 is my nemesis.  I only made four bogeys all week and I bogeyed that one twice.  So we got to get by that hole.  The course is playing tough.  The first three or four holes on the front are playing tough and the first three or four holes on the back are playing tough.  So if you can get by those, there's a lot of birdies out there.
