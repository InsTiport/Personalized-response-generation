Q.
I just want to get some of your thoughts on your round today.
CHRIS DIMARCO:  I hit the ball great.  I hit all 14 fairways today.  The greens, that rain made the greens a lot slower, so it was a lot    I had a tough time gauging the speed.  I hit one more shot today and made double.  Other than that, I played very, very solid.
Q.  What are your thoughts with the Ryder Cup potential here?
CHRIS DIMARCO:  I missed the last two cuts after finishing great at the British Open, so for me to go out today and play a good round and get myself in position to do well tomorrow is something that I really wanted to do, so I did that.

Obviously NEC next week there's no cut, so that's always good.  But going into the Ryder Cup, I want to be playing at my best, and right now I'm hitting the ball about as good as I have all year.
