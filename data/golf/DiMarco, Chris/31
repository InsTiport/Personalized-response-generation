  Q.  How was the course playing?   
 CHRIS DIMARCO:  Playing hard as I've ever played it.  Made a couple of mental mistakes.  Played solid.  Pins are good day, wind tricks you.   
 Success here certainly helps.  You know your way around.  Everyone seems to think it's going to play easier, it's the opposite.   
 Balls are bouncing 10-15 yards off the greens.   
  
  Q.  About the Gators.   
 CHRIS DIMARCO:  Can promise what Gators have done last year and a half has nothing to do with me.   
 Right off the bat the greens were firm.
