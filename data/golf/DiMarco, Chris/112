Q.  Talk about that match, winning again. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  It was a fun match.  Neither one of us -- we both hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens.  I know my stats didn't show I hit a lot of greens, but I hit a lot of fringes and putted from the fringe a lot, and he made a great up-and-down on 16, made about an 18-footer to stay 1 up. 

And then on 18, I'm 211 straight into the wind, 5-wood -- I hit a 3-wood and I hit a great shot in there about 10, 12 feet, and I think that made him kind of -- then he tried to -- instead of trying to lag it up there he thought I had a good chance of making it so he thought he needed to -- he knocked it by and I was very fortunate to win 18, and then I drove it perfect on 1 and then he missed the fairway and then it was pretty much game over.  I hit a good 8-iron in there about 12 feet, lagged her up there and walked off.


Q.  You play Mickelson, who won pretty easily, didn't play a lot of holes. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  Good.


Q.  You went 19 holes. 

CHRIS DiMARCO:  It's going to be fun.  Phil is a good friend of mine and it's going to be fun regardless.
