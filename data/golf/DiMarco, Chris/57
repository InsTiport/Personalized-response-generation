Q.  Nice to get the first one out of the way?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  Always nice to get the first one out of the way.  It was a weird match, Calc and I.  We have a lot of similarities, and we only tied four holes.  It was weird because I won the first hole and actually was 2 up after two, and it never went worse than 1 up and never went higher than 2 up.  It was back and forth.  I'm fortunate.  Calc is a very good player.
Q.  Winning the first couple holes, did you feel kind of in control the rest of the match?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  It felt good once I finally hit the fairway on No. 9, and I didn't miss one the rest of the way.  So it felt good to hit good shots, and I hit the ball a lot better coming down the stretch.
Q.  You did great here last year and played so well at the Presidents Cup.  Do you feel kind of like more confident this year after those good two tournaments last year?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  You learn so much in match play.  You don't have to worry about how you're playing, who you're playing.  A player could get hot that day and go right through you, or you could shoot 72 and win.  It's just a matter of playing your competitor and trying to keep him in sight.  Hopefully you get hot, and everybody would like to do what Tiger does, but not everybody gets to do it.
Q.  Do you know who you're playing tomorrow?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  I think I'm playing either Arron Oberholser or Tim Clark.  I don't know who won.
Q.  Both guys on pretty good streaks right now?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  They both are playing really good.  I've been playing really good.  I played really good in LA, just didn't make any putts, and had two really    13th and a 14th in Phoenix and Hope, and obviously won in Abu Dhabi.  I've been playing good this year, too.  I feel like whoever I play, as long as I play well, that's all I can control.
