Q.
A little unusual round, 18 straight pars at Firestone.  I don't think there's any way you could be disappointed about that.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  No, any time you don't make any bogeys around this place, that's a good thing.  Usually when you don't make any birdies, that's not a good thing.  But I'm okay, 70 around here is a very good score.
Q.  Very consistent play, and that's what you've been striving for.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yeah, I haven't had that lately, so it's been nice to go ahead and play well the first two days.  I bogeyed the first hole of the tournament and that's it, so I feel like I'm doing a lot of good things.
Q.  Pending weather tomorrow, going to be an early start for everybody.  Do you object or are you happy about it or it doesn't matter?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  I don't know, I haven't looked at the weather yet, but it seems like it's awful early to call that.  We could go until 8:00 o'clock or 9:00 o'clock tee times possibly, but if that's what they want to do, that's what they want to do.
