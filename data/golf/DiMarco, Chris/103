Q.   Up and down day, Chris.  The weather and the stoppage bother you at all?
CHRIS DIMARCO:  Not really.  It was fun.  Obviously any time you get to play with Tiger, it's a good thing.  I'm looking like making bogey.  It was obviously tough.  You play, you don't play, you play, you don't play, and you feel like , "I don't know how many holes I played today."  I told my caddie, "what did we hit earlier today?"  And he was like, "that was yesterday," so you really don't know where you're at.
Q.   Do you feel momentum coming from last week?  You know you're playing well.
CHRIS DIMARCO:  Yeah, mentally it's tough.  I was just saying that if this was     obviously it wasn't a World Golf Championships, if it was a tournament where you had to worry about making the cut, I probably would be taking this week off.

I'm playing well, so it's nice to not have to think too much and just go out and play golf, kind of do the things I was doing last week and hopefully it will carry over.
Q.   The first few holes     it looked like you were enjoying the group you were in.
CHRIS DIMARCO:  Yeah, it was great.  That was 25 percent of the Ryder Cup right there, so it's going to be fun.  It was nice to ask those guys questions, what to expect in Ryder Cup and stuff, and they were very helpful.  It's obviously     I hate to look ahead because this tournament is still right there, but I'm looking forward to that.
