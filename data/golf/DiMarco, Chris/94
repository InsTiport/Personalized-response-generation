CHRIS DiMARCO:  I haven't had a great start for the season, so this was great for me to get in the right position here.  I was about as nervous as anyone, and I was able to make it.  I feel very fortunate.  I played pretty good, just happy to move on.
Q.  Any key holes for you?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Yeah, I think the key hole probably was 15.  I made a really good up‑and‑down, made about a five‑footer, and then he hit it in pretty close on 16, to be honest.  And I was hoping to make about a 10‑, 12‑footer, and he missed like an eight‑footer.  And then he actually birdied 17, then I'm down.  And obviously ‑‑
Q.  Was your heart thumping pretty good there?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  It was thumping pretty good out there, just because you want to move on.  You don't want anything to mess up, and it was nice obviously just to do it.
Q.  Do you think that the conditionsÃ  ‑‑ (inaudible.)
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Especially the front nine, they played it so short, it's hard to distance yourself from the other guys.  Even if you miss fairways, you're only an 8‑ or 9‑iron away and still get it up around the greens, instead of having to lay back 50 or 60 yards.  And that's what you're seeing, you're seeing more guys, like a Justin and a John.  You'd think if the course played as long as it was playing, they'd have a big advantage.

On a personal note, this was very big for me, playing three tournaments.

I hit the ball really good today, and for the first time this year I've really got some confidence in my swing.
Q.  (Inaudible.)
CHRIS DiMARCO:  It's amazing.  It was a good match.  It was obviously tough playing one of your friends.
Q.  Have you ever played against John Daly?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  I've played with John a bunch.
