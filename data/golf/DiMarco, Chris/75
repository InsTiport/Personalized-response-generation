Q.  It seems like you play well here in Pennsylvania.  You've always made the cut here.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Well, I don't know.  Obviously my first win was a different golf course.  This is the third different golf course we've played.  This course is fitting to my eye.  I get a lot of good vibes on the tee balls, and when I get the ball in play, I can play out here.  I'm putting good, so that always helps.
Q.  How did the weather affect the play today?  It was a little bit different weather.
CHRIS DiMARCO:  It didn't affect it.  I mean, we didn't have any rain.  It just was a little cooler, so that was nice.  It was just a    the firmness of the greens was about the same.  The fairways were actually a little firmer, so it was good.  The rough was up, and it was in good shape.
Q.  How do you feel about the position you're in right now?
CHRIS DiMARCO:  Well, we'll see.  If it stays right now, I'm only three back.  These guys could make three or four birdies coming in, somebody could be 15  or 16 under, and then there would be a lot of work to do.  I'm hoping it stays right around 12, and then I'm in good position.
