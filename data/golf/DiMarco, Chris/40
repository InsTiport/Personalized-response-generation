Q.  How do you feel you played in the afternoon?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  We really gutted it out.  We really played some good golf and didn't make too many putts.  We played solid, and unfortunately they made a bunch and we didn't make too many.  Colin made a great putt on the last hole.
Q.  What are your thoughts, all the match going down to the 18th hole, that's amazing.

CHRIS DiMARCO:  They were all tough matches, they were all within one or a halve or 1 up or the other way or whatever.  We just never got too much red out there.  If we got more red out there, it would be good.
Q.  What do you have to do tomorrow?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  Go out and try to do a little better.  If we do a little better, we'll be good.
Q.  How was the crowd?

CHRIS DiMARCO:  They were very great, they were fine.  They obviously cheered a little more for them than for us.
