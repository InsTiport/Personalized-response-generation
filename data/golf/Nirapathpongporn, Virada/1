   ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You made a nice climb up the leaderboard today, 7-under for the tournament.  Talk about your round and what's been going right for you on the golf course. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Well, this week, like any other week, I think I've -- lately I've been playing well.  Just, you know, didn't get the ball in the hole.  So I think I learned -- over the weeks off I realized, Okay, well, I got to do something about that.  It's about the short sticks and wedges and chip and putt. 
 So this week it's been going really well.  I hit the ball good and find a way to get the ball in the hole. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  You've got two subpar rounds, so it sounds like it's all working for you out there.  What's the game plan for the weekend? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Same thing, I think.  I've been very consistent:  Fairways, barely missed the fairways.  And then greens, I barely missed the greens.  So I think that that's going really well for me, being very consistent.  And the putting is great, so keep going.  Two days like that I think I'll be in good shape. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Can we go over your scorecard, birdies and bogeys, starting with your first birdie on the 8th hole? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Par 5, driver, and then what did I hit to the -- oh, I hit second shot.  I actually hit it bad. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  What club? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  5-iron.  Kind of a bad lie off the second shot.  Probably the only bad shot I hit.  But then, you know, like before I probably would panic and think, Oh, now what?  You know, but I learned to collect myself and know that, Hey, one bad shot is not going to kill you. 
 From there I got up and down.  Hit a very nice high pitch and putt about four feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  13, birdie there. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  13, Par 3 I think, just 8-iron. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  How far out? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Probably 25 feet above the hole.  Very straightforward putt.  Just down the hill a little right to left and just right in the middle. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  8-iron? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  8-iron to about 25 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And 16, Par 3. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  16, Par 3.  Solid 9-iron just about eight feet, but it was a pretty tricky putt down the hill, slider left to right.  But I think my feel has been very good. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  And that lone bogey on 18, take us through that. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Just a soft bogey.  That's just a mistake that I was making, you know, this year.  Just right around the green and I just -- 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Was it a 2-putt? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  3-putt off the green.  Well, statistically it's a 2-putt.  Any time if I don't hesitate to take that putter I call it a putt. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Okay. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Below the hole four feet and I just didn't make it. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN:  Questions? 

 Q.  Did you ever have any thought of chipping up on 18 to get it close?  Are you a much better putter than you are as far as chipping? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  It was just very simple and straightforward.  I putted exceptionally off that lie this week, so I didn't really -- I didn't have any doubt, you know, but I just didn't execute it as well.  Yeah. 

 Q.  How would you describe the difficulty of this course?  First time you've played it, right? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Yeah.  My practice round I thought it was playing more difficult than the last two rounds.  The greens are huge and they undulating, so I thought that could cause a problem. 
 But so far I feel like, you know, the green is big but if you shoot to the right part of the green so you don't have to -- unless you have to putt all the way across the green.  Then that's tough. 
 It feels like it's playing okay.  You know, not as bad as I thought. 

 Q.  You have to go back several years, but you've won a tournament on the Trail before. 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Yeah, in Mobile. 

 Q.  Has being back here and being on a Trail course rekindled some good memories for you? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  Absolutely.  When heard that we were going to a Robert Trent Jones Trail course I was like, Oh, I like that name.  I had a great time when I was junior golfer down in Mobile.  Stayed with a great family, and maybe they could come up and watch during the weekend.  I'm not sure. 
 Yeah, I like Mobile, Alabama, so anything Alabama I like. 

 Q.  You had a hole in one yesterday.  Talk about what having a shot like that in your round does for you, and when you got to that hole today do you -- you made three today.  Are you like, This shot is worse? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  No, I wasn't thinking that at all.  It wasn't like I got up to the tee and, Oh, I better hold this one or otherwise it's a disappointment.  Kind of it just flew right by me. 
 But yesterday was great.  I've been saying to myself that my last hole in one -- I've had two before, and last one was when I was 16, so almost ten years ago.  I probably played much more golf the last ten years than the first 16 years of my life and I'm like, God I got to be due. 

 Q.  What was the distance and club yesterday? 
 VIRADA NIRAPATHPONGPORN:  176 and I hit my 5-iron.  It goes about 165.  Hoping to just roll over the hill there and it did just that.  I couldn't see it because it was just over the hump.  It landed about two yards kind of left of the flag. 
 I thought, As long as it's up there I think it's close, it's within 10, 15 feet.  And the lady, the one lady by the green, she was like, she just put her hands up on her head.  And I was like, maybe be it's close.  Very close. 
 Like this, and she goes (indicating).  Like this.  So I figured it was in.
