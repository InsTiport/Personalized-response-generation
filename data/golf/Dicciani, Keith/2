 Q. What were your impressions of the first round?
 KEITH DICCIANI: It was good. I played a good, solid round of golf. I struck the ball great. Wasn't great on the greens. A few 3-putts and missed a couple good opportunities but all in all, shooting even in the first round out here in this thing, I'll take it. Could have been better but I'm happy. 

 Q. What do you normally do on a Thursday morning?
 KEITH DICCIANI: Right now, at 7:00 AM, I would be probably drinking, getting ready to teach a couple of members -- no, don't say that. (Laughter) No, teach them and teaching others how to play. It's great out there, the membership is great. 
 This is definitely more fun. 

 Q. Did you come here with any goals? 
 KEITH DICCIANI: My goals are more preparation goals, just try and get my game in shape for the week and then come here and just play. So I really had no expectations, just other than just enjoy it, my first major, and my family is up here and my fiancÃ©e's family is up here. This is actually the first meeting. They officially met Monday night. There was a lot going on so it was fun. It's been a great week so far. Even the practice rounds here, I can't believe the size of the crowds, it's incredible.
