 Q. First off talk about the conditions with the wind being a factor and maybe the effect it had on your game?
 KEITH DICIANNI: Yeah, it's hot out there. It's blowing, it's gusty all day, the greens start getting firm, and the greens were definitely firm and bumpy out there, so putting became an issue. 
 Just wears on you. It's that, and a little bit of the pressure and it was tough. It's tough out there, for sure. 

 Q. Talk about your overall experience, your first PGA Championship, how you think everything went and what you'll take away from this. 
 KEITH DICIANNI: You know, I hit it great, really for two days, and I made some -- I strung together a bunch of bogeys together in the last ten holes, but you know, still hit it pretty good. Just couldn't get up-and-down. Couldn't make any putts. Just missed the fairway. It doesn't take much out here to start getting on the wrong side of par. 
 I was on it there for a while, the back nine, but still a great week and take nothing but good things from it. And I don't think I finished dead last so, that's always good. 

 Q. The joke about eloping yesterday, is that still on?
 KEITH DICIANNI: I don't know what he finished. I think he's still out there. Hopefully he's doing well. But yeah, we are going to elope regardless.
