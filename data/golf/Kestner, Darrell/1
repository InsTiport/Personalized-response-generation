Q.   What does it mean to you to play in these championships? 
DARRELL KESTNER:   250 guys to qualify to come to this, especially at my age and this stage of my career, it's a bonus.   I enjoy it.   I like it.   I'm extremely proud to have qualified.   It's a dream week for me. 

Q.   You did a lot for being over the age of 50. 
DARRELL KESTNER:   Like my friend Bobby Hines once said, he said, you look at Darrell Kestner's game and you look at what people should be shooting because I hit it kind of right with the members, and then whatever I shoot they should be shooting.   It shows you where the short game is more important than that long game. 

Q.   Five guys from your section made it to this championship.   How does that show how great golf is in your section because there's more to it than just the normal operations?
DARRELL KESTNER:   Yeah, just kind of running a golf shop, playing with the members, teaching, organizing the staff and trying to play a respectable game and play with the members, you wear a lot of different hats, but it's fun doing it all the time.   When I think of a professional, my job, I might have a bad moment but I never have a bad day.
