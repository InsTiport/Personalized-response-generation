  Q. If you could just talk about your round today and how the weather maybe affected your play?  
 DARRELL KESTNER: It was very difficult having the morning draw on that first round Thursday, you know, it was very, very cold out here and probably 45 degrees and a little drizzle. And so it was difficult. But you try to make the best of it. And it's such a tough golf course, but it's a fair, good golf course. But you just try make as many pars as you can and try not to make a double or anything, keep the bogeys down to a minimum.   
  
  Q. Are you used to this kind of weather like this?  
 DARRELL KESTNER: Our spring has been just like this, really cold and windy and rainy, so it's what we have been playing in, yeah.   
  
  Q. How would you assess your game overall? 76 I think you had today?  
 DARRELL KESTNER: Yeah, I had 76. I had three like smothered drives that I just, most of them missed the -- once you miss the fairway here you're just struggling for par, trying not to make double.   
 So you have to hit the ball in the fairway. And I didn't do that through the middle of the round. But I finished good and played like even par the last seven or eight holes, so it was pretty good.   
  
  Q. What would be a good winning score do you think this week?  
 DARRELL KESTNER: I think even par could be right there at the end of the week on this golf course. With no more rain and the rough kind of drys out a little bit you might be able to get -- depends on how the PGA sets it up. But I think even par would be nice.
