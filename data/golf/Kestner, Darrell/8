 Q. You shot an even 70 today. What was the biggest difference between today and yesterday?
 DARRELL KESTNER: Ball striking. I hit the ball very straight is all. I didn't -- I hit it really well all day long and I had a 3-putt and bogeyed my first hole. 
 And then I had a 3-putt on 5. 
 And I was hitting all the greens all the way around and just missing birdie putts and it was just I kind of hung in there and made a 30 foot birdie putt and 16 and then I chipped in on 17. So it kind of helped the day. 

 Q. How much was the weather a factor?
 DARRELL KESTNER: Oh, it was a huge factor. Going off early yesterday in the 44 degrees and rain and wind, that was like an endurance test yesterday. I just tried to not shoot myself out of it yesterday to where I could, if I could have a good round today that I could make the cut and have a nice weekend.

 Q. What are you planning on doing tomorrow to keep yourself in contention?
 DARRELL KESTNER: Just hopefully just, I am a club pro and I am enjoying being here and make a good showing and hit the ball nicely, and I'm just enjoying the moment. I always play well when I'm having fun.
