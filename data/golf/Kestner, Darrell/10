Q.
Quite a round, 47 34, roller coaster?
DARRELL KESTNER:  Yeah, another roller coaster.  It was a roller coaster on the other side yesterday and a roller coaster on this side today.  It's a really, really difficult wind.  It swung around.  I didn't play poorly.  I misclubbed on the par 3s and knocked it in the water twice on both of them.

I just changed clubs and just was too aggressive, trying to go at the pins too much instead of middle of the green.  Just a little inexperience or not thinking clearly.

But I played well, take those holes away, I played quite well.  So.
Q.  So like you said, there's some things that you took from this round that you're probably pretty excited to apply to tomorrow?
DARRELL KESTNER:  Exactly.  Tomorrow and other tournaments to come.  This is a Major championship and you can't make mistakes like that.  But it's fun being here anyway.
