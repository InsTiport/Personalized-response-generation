Q.   Talk about your day. 
DARRELL KESTNER:   Well it's a pleasure to be here.   The wind got the best of me yesterday.   I felt like I hit the ball nicely, just it was a very difficult day to play.   And I knew I was playing well, but it was just, usually you try to look forward to the challenge, but it was very, very difficult yesterday.   Unless you're used to playing in those conditions and teeing it up in tournament atmosphere all the time, it's difficult to stay focused. 
So that's where I kind of messed up was yesterday, but today I played nicely and, but was just too far back.

Q.   Coming into this week were you aware of the conditions at all or had you done anything to prepare for this?
DARRELL KESTNER:   No, I was actually playing very well.   I was playing nicely, so I was really looking forward to it.   But then ‑‑ I played well in the section and my practice rounds here with the guys I struck the ball nicely. 
But it was just such a brutal wind that it was very difficult to stay in control of yourself.   But I tried to hang in there and play the best I could and make the best of it and I came back with a nice round today, but it was just not enough.
