Q.  Give us some of your birdies here.
DARRELL KESTNER:  I birdied number 3.  I hit a 9 iron to about six feet.  And made that.

No. 11, I hit a 9 iron to about two feet and made that.

13, I holed a bunker shot.
Q.  How far was that?
DARRELL KESTNER:  About 30 feet.

And 15 was a 10 foot birdie putt with a 7 iron.
Q.  How about    you got caught in the rain.  What was the difference before rain and then after?
DARRELL KESTNER:  Well, it was just an endurance test during the beginning with the rain.  I knew, I said, you know, you just got to try not to get going bad and lose any ground.  If you put up a decent round, you might pass some players.

I was on number 5 green when we got called off.  So I was 1 under par then.  So I was hanging in there pretty well.
