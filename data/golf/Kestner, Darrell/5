  Q. Let's talk about highlights of round one today.   
 DARRELL KESTNER: After double bogeying number 4, I birdied number 5. So that was my big highlight. I get a birdie after kind of a bad break double. But it's such a beautiful golf course, but it's so demanding. The wind's swirling around. But it's an event coming in here. I just kind of hung in there. I didn't play well, but I tried to play my best and hung in there and scrambled well. And it was a nervous round one.  
  
  Q. How does this course compare to a lot of the ones that you've played on before?  
 DARRELL KESTNER: It's big and tough and hard and you got to be great around the greens, you got to be great on the greens and you got to be a great driver of the golf ball. So it helps to be long, but it's a good test.
