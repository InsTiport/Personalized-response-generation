   Q. Talk about your day today. 
 DARRELL KESTNER: It was an endurance test. It was, we played eight holes yesterday or seven holes yesterday, so we played what? 29 holes today. And it was a long, soft, hard walk. But the golf course held up beautifully and I hung if there the best I could. Hopefully I make the cut. But I'm not sure.
