Q.  How do you feel you played today?
DARRELL KESTNER:  I hated finishing with that double bogey.  But it was a wonderful tournament for me.  The golf course played really long.  I had a lot of long irons all day lock long the last two days.  But for me to make the cut and finish, I think I finished like around 30th, that's pretty good.  I enjoyed it.  It's an incredible golf course.  Just playing this golf course is fun in itself, so it's a treat to play this tournament and to play this golf course.  What.
Q.  What are your feelings on shooting and playing the lowest round for a club pro for this tournament?
DARRELL KESTNER:  Well, that was a goal of mine to try to be the low club pro.  There's a lot of good players and it's kind of fun competing against the TOUR guys and then making the cut in a Major is always a goal.  So I played 17 Majors and this is my second cut.  So I was thrilled to make it.
