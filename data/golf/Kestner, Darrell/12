Q.
Talk about your round out there and how it was.
DARRELL KESTNER:  Just pleased to be here for four days.  I didn't play on the weekend like I wanted to.  I have a nice club and nice job to go back to, and thank goodness.  I don't know how these guys on Tour do it.  I'm totally exhausted.  How in the world they play a couple practice rounds, four rounds in a tournament, it's harder than what people think.
Q.  How did the heat affect you?
DARRELL KESTNER:  You know, not making accuses, but it was hard, it was hard on me, hard to keep concentration and hard to keep your swing under control.  It was tough but I had a lot of fun.
Q.  What do you take away from this week?
DARRELL KESTNER:  Just making the cut in both PGAs, the Senior and this one.  And I have a lot of respect for Baltusrol and this championship.  I'm just going to go back to the club and enjoy it.
