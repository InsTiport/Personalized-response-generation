 Q. The score is not the best, but a PGA Championship, a Major, you got to be taking something out of this. 
 DARRELL KESTNER: Oh, yeah, it's always fun to play in the Majors. Play with the guys you kind of watch all your life. 
 And my goal is to make the cut, I made the cut and didn't play well on the weekend, and, but so it's always a pleasure. And this is such a beautiful golf course that it's a memory I'll always have. 

 Q. What are you going to try to improve on, knowing what this course gave to you and what aspects of your game you really found out about yourself?
 DARRELL KESTNER: After making the cut you still have to kind of, you got two more days of golf and I really, even though I shot 79 yesterday, I really didn't play much differently. The putter just abandoned me there. And on this golf course if the putter doesn't save you two or three times you lose your momentum and it's very difficult.
