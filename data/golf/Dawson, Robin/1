 Q.  How would you assess that 71?  
ROBIN DAWSON: Yeah, I didn't feel I played much different to the last four days.  Golf is a funny game.  I thought I played really nice today, actually.  A couple of things didn't go my way on 10, my second shot, I think the only place in the golf course I couldn't actually hit it.  But happy overall.  It's been a good week.  Really enjoyed it.   
 Q.  Overall in terms of the week, what has it done for new terms of confidence?  
ROBIN DAWSON: Gives me a lot of confidence.  It shows that I can play with the top, top lads, and things I'm working on, I'm doing the right things, you know.  So yeah, it gives me a lot of confidence going forward overall.   
 Q.  When you get a taste of a week like this, you want more?  
ROBIN DAWSON: Yeah, definitely.  I really want to go play in Scotland next week.  Obviously I can't.  But yeah, definitely gives me a lot of motivation to get back out here playing golf for a living, I'm very lucky.
