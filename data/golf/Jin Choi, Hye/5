HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  So I played really well today.  I was just trying to get really comfortable these last couple of days to make the cut, but today I felt went really great.   
 Q.  What is it like playing with Inbee?  
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  I played with her once before, but this was my first tournament in stroke play.  I just wanted to do really well and have a great performance.  It was really fun to play with her today.   
 Q.  Do you get more confidence the more LPGA events you play?  
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  Yeah, I feel like I've been able to increase my confidence the more that I'm out here and the more invitations that I get, so looking forward to playing more.   
 Q.  Will you play really aggressively tomorrow to try to catch the leader?  
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  I'm just looking forward to playing the same that I did.  I felt that I did well enough to play today, so I'm just going to play my own game.
