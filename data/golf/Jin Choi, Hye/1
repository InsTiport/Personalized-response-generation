Q. (In progress. )
HYE JIN CHOI: Overall today I think I struggled a little bit.  There were a lot of things that I missed out there.  There is a lot of things that I could have taken away today.
Before the week started I was actually really nervous because I didn't feel all this well going into the week.  But looking back I think I did feel okay, and I'm just glad to be done.
Q. What's your plan?
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  Next week I'm going to Korea and I'm going to be playing in a tournament.  It's a major on the KLPGA, and so I think I'm going to focus, and I want to try my best to do as well as I can.
Q. You were so close to being in the top 3, maybe even winning.
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  The week before I came just I wasn't in all that great of shape, and so I was a little worried going into the week.
I just kept telling myself that I need to play just four days and get through that, and I think I did.  I feel really good about my round, but there were a lot of things I could have learned and took away from this week.
