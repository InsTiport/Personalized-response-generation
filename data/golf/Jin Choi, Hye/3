 Q.  Awesome second round at the Lotte Championship.  The wind was really blowing today.  How tough was it out there for you?  
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  If we compare the conditions between today and yesterday, it was definitely tougher.  The wind was blowing and pin positions made it tough, but I gave myself a lot chances.  I tried my best to take advantage of those chances, and overall think I did pretty well for the round.   
There is still a lot of golf left to be played.  I think it's going to be a lot more challenging as the weekend progresses.  There were some opportunities out there that I missed.  I'm just going to try really hard to take advantage of those opportunities going forward and try my best.   
 Q.  How was your putting today?  
HYE JIN CHOI: (Through translation.)  Compared to how I was putting in Asia, coming to Hawaii I feel like my putting stroke has kind of come together.  I'm able to play well and I think it's doing pretty well.   
The grass in Hawaii is a little different, which makes putting just a little more challenging.  At first when I was out here just the greens were a little awkward to play.  After practicing and just getting more experience on the greens, I feel like I'm getting more adapted to how they're playing, and overall getting used to everything here.   
Yeah, there is a lot of differences between the grass here and Korea.  Still getting used to how they're bouncing and just my play around the course.   
In terms of putting or like in the rough, just trying to get used to how the lies are.  Overall, I think that in order to get a low score on this course I just have to work on my own swing, the timing of that, and everything will come together.
