 Q. Very nice start to the day.   How did you feel coming out the first tee and going through the first nine?  
GENE JONES:   Well, it was a lot nicer than yesterday.   I got around yesterday and knew the course was going to play a little easier today.   
I hit the ball great.   Had a bogey on the third hole and then a nice save or two.   
But there's some birdies out there.   The greens are a bit softer today.   I played the front nine good and just hit the ball better today and played solid all day.  
   
 Q. Without the wind whipping and things being calmer does that make you calmer and give you a bit more patience?  
GENE JONES:   No, because this course doesn't give you a chance.   But that's the thing about this course and playing a PGA.   And it's a Major for us.   And this course, the thing about this course is it doesn't give you any let up.   
They hide the pins and once you get on the greens -- today, like me, I left it short of my mark by a foot and I 3-putted.   There's just no let up on the course.
