   GENE JONES: I started out pretty good today and hit it good early. I made a birdie at No. 1 and another at No. 4 but then I made a bogey on the par-5 (No. 6) which is sort of a sore spot on my card.
 Conditions were so perfect though today that you just had to get good yardage. I hit the ball well all day. The difference for me was that you just have to land the ball a little shorter. It was a fair day; nice in the morning and nice in the afternoon.
