THE MODERATOR:  Dina, thanks for joining us today.  Talk about your day.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Started off quickly.  Hit a really close -- I don't know what happened.  It was so early this morning.  I don't know.  I drove it really well.

I made a few putts in the beginning and got it going, and I hit it a few times, just tapped it in.

THE MODERATOR:  Can we go over your scorecard?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  That's the part I don't remember.  I hit a 7-iron to about two feet.

THE MODERATOR:  How about birdie on 11.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Hit a pitching wedge to about 20 feet.

THE MODERATOR:  Birdie on (inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  I hit 8-iron to about a foot maybe, two feet.

THE MODERATOR:  And birdie on 14.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Yeah, I tapped it in, about a foot.

THE MODERATOR:  What did you hit there?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Sand wedge.

THE MODERATOR:  And then Bogey on 15.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  3-putt.

THE MODERATOR:  How far?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  50 feet.

THE MODERATOR:  And birdie on 17.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Oh, gosh, I can't remember.  8-iron, maybe 20-feet maybe.  3-putted 18.

THE MODERATOR:  And --
DINA AMMACAPANE:  I was just chipping from the fringe.  Just lucked out for eagle and tapped it in.  It went in the hole and came out.

THE MODERATOR:  Bogey on 4.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Yeah.  Choked it out of the bunker and then I had like (inaudible).

THE MODERATOR:  (Inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  15 feet.

THE MODERATOR:  And then the birdie on 9.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  9, 9-iron in there to 15, 20 feet.  I have no idea.  I'm horrible at that.

THE MODERATOR:  You started off very well last week as well.  You had a 66.  You just want to talk about starting out so strong.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  I don't know.  I just -- it was nice being in the first group.  Greens are perfect.  Course is playing a little shorter, but you hit it in that rough and forget it.  You're just roughing it back out.

I don't know, just been playing solid.  You know, if I can just hang on the next two days (inaudible).  I didn't do that very well last week, but I don't know.
Q.  In terms of a 54 hole tournament versus a 72 hole tournament in terms of getting off to a good start, you don't have another 18 holes to work with (inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  It's always nice, regardless of 54 or 72, to get off to a good start.  But I think it's, yeah, it's more important on a 3-day event.  Everybody knows that even par at the end of this week is a good score, so I'm quite pleased.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  The conditions were a little different, say, the last morning tee times, two hours.  They're going to get a little bit more roll.  You know, it's all give and take out here.

I'd much rather get up at 4:30 and get up like I did and go.  I'm up early and I'm always ready.  So it's the later times that kill me I think.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Later tomorrow.  I don't have, you know, 2:00, so I'm okay.  I'll be okay.  Just staying focused.
Q.  (Inaudible).
DINA AMMACAPANE:  From the beginning?
Q.  Yeah.
DINA AMMACAPANE:  It's been a great year.  I've had a lot of good things happen to me.  There hasn't been too many negative things.  I have a different outlook on a lot of things and they've all been positive.  It's all good now.
Q.  Are those your kid's pictures on your yardage book?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Yes.
Q.  Give you any motivation?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  They're smiling, so sometimes when you look at them if you've made bogey and 3-putted it's not that important.
Q.  What are their names?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  Laura, Ann, and Denver.
Q.  Denver?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  As in Colorado.
Q.  You're four under.  Now, you said like target score for the rest of the week, you know, how difficult course is tomorrow?
DINA AMMACAPANE:  I think with the wind picking up it seems like it's going to -- started anyway.  So in the afternoon if the wind picks up the conditions may play more difficult.

Some holes could play easier depending on which way it's blowing.  I think today it's blowing opposite of what it normally does.  So I don't know, just wait and see.

THE MODERATOR:  Anymore questions?  Thank you Dina.
