   ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Dina, thanks for coming in and joining us today. Great round out there. You're currently tied for the lead here at the LPGA Corning Classic. Can you just talk about your round and heading into the weekend tied for the lead? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: I don't know what to say about that. (Laughing.)
 Been hitting it good. Last week I hit it really good. Just trying to put it together, you know. And the driver's been really well. So see if I can keep it in the fairway.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Let's go over your scorecard really quick, your birdies and bogeys, then we'll take questions. Starting with the first bogey on the 2nd hole.
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 3-putt.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How far? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 10 feet, 12 feet, not far.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: The birdie frenzy that began on 5? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 5, I 2-putted, 6 -- I don't know how close it was; it was probably 6 feet.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What did you use on your approach shot, what club? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 9-iron. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: 9-iron to 6 feet? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Uh-huh.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What about on 5, the approach club on the Par 5 there? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: A 5-wood in there.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: How close was the first putt? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 25 feet. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: For Eagle. Birdie on 7? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 6-iron. I was on the lower shelf. Was probably a good 30-footer. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Wow. A birdie on 8? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Tapped it in.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: What club? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: It was a 6-iron from the trees. It was 123 yards. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 13, what happened there? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Missed the fairway, just chipped sideways and then hit it up and 2-putted.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Bogey on 14? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Hit it a little long from-- the third shot was out the right rough, poor chip.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And birdie on 16? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: It was probably about 6 feet maybe.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Which club to get there? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: 6-iron from 80 yards. I just had to chip it. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: And the final birdie on 18 to put you into the lead? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Sand wedge. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: To how close? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: I don't know, 8 feet. I have a short-term memory. (Laughing.)
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: That's all right. Questions for Dina?

 Q. This is, I think, your ninth time here. You have made two cuts before. What are you doing differently? Are you doing anything differently? You said last week it was -- are you in a groove, would you say that, or do you feel something working?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: I feel like I'm hitting it well enough to score. I have got to be patient, is my biggest -- the last two days were a test. We waited every shot for the group in front of us, and we were the third group out the afternoon. It was ridiculous; especially at a course like this. The greens and the tees are right on top of each other. This course should move fairly fast. So that was a big thing for me, a key for me, being patient.

 Q. Do you recall any other time that you played here when even after the first day you've been tied for the lead or in the lead?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Last year I played well. I don't remember. I played pretty good I think.

 Q. Seemed the winds obviously made things out there difficult. But were you satisfied that you were able to overcome that and play so well again in this position that you are in right now?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Yeah. I mean, it played a factor. But usually when you are hitting it pretty well nothing really bothers you. 
 But this golf course can, you know, jump up and bite you right in the ass. Because if you get it on the wrong side of the holes on these greens it's very a difficult golf course. You know it's short but you got to constantly place the ball.

 Q. (No microphone.) 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Nobody went low today. I was surprised. I really -- yesterday I 7-under under those conditions was exceptionally well. And with the nice weather coming and stuff. But if the wind stays up, maybe the scores won't be as low, if it blows next two days. But it's suppose to be beautiful.

 Q. (Question about feeling good about play.)
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Pretty relaxed, yeah. I don't do anything fast but play fast.

 Q. You'll be in one of the lead groups, one of the last groups coming out. The crowd will be pretty much out there for you. Is this an environment you are looking forward to?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Sure, every opportunity. Yeah, this is -- the crowds here are great. It will be fun. And I'm Italian so it helps a little bit. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Dina, I'm not sure if this is something you want to talk about so just tell me. I am looking at your yardage book here and the picture of your kid, and I know your daughter is actually going to be making her holiday debut in December. Do you kind of want to tell the guys here about that? 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: My niece. My niece and nephew.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: I'm sorry .
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Yeah, she is going to be in a movie with Adam Sandler. They live in L.A. And it comes out at Christmas. It's called "Bedtime Stories." She's got the lead role as an 8-year-old.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: We have some information on LPGA.com about that as well.
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Very exciting.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Just a little insider bit for everyone. 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: They're good kids.

 Q. Is that something you would like to do, get in a movie sometime? (Laughing.)
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: No, I'll stick to golf.

 Q. (No microphone.)
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: She may be there some day. 
 Golf, they don't play any sports, the kids. It's amazing. It's interesting. I don't know where they got it from. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: They watch their mom and their aunt in the spotlight for awhile.
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: It's interesting. Yeah, she's very -- for eight years old she is very, very bright. She can memorize the lines and do her deal. And it's quite amazing at such a young age.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Sorry, I just wanted to interject that; I knew that was a little fun for everybody. Any more questions?

 Q. Danielle is your sister correct?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Yes.

 Q. How does it feel having a family member playing on this course; how does it feel? You guys compete again each other obviously for the prize check, but what do you think of when you are going through between rounds?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Well obviously it couldn't be any better to have, you know, family out here. Because it's not a very -- at times it can be a lonely life. We support each other. She was just two groups in front of me. So a lot of holes when I came back and forth I looked over, tried to see how she is doing. She's been struggling sometimes since after the second child. So we just try to be there for each other.

 Q. Do you guys stay together when you come out so there's that support?
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: Yeah, we stay together every week.

 Q. Are you going to be kind to her when you remind her that she usually does pretty well here (inaudible.)
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: She's had a good run here at Corning, yep.

 Q. (No microphone.) 
 DINA AMMACCAPANE: I'll take it. I won't needle her right now. (Laughing.) She hasn't been playing very well. 
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Any more questions? All right. Thanks.
