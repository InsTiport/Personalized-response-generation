 Q.   Eric, some good golf out there.   Tell me about it.  
ERIC AXLEY:   Yeah.   I'm playing solid, hitting a lot of greens right now, being patient, and getting a lot of them close to the hole.   So putting's not been too difficult.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about it golf course.  
ERIC AXLEY:   It's a little soft right now, after the rain we've had.   Yesterday when we played it was kind of getting a little firmer.   You know, if the wind blows a little and no more rain, it could get a little firmer for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   So wind's always a factor here.   Tell me a little bit about that these two rounds.  
ERIC AXLEY:   Yeah.   Yesterday it was windy.   It played really tough.   Like I said, you had to be very patient on when you could be aggressive.   Today on the front nine it wasn't that windy and it's kind of picking up right now.  
But you know, it's soft enough to where you can kind of control it in there.  
   
 Q.   Tell me your experience in Puerto Rico so far.  
ERIC AXLEY:   It's good.   I think I've been here about every other tournament that's been here.   So yeah, I enjoy it here.   It's a good time.   Enjoy the golf course.   So yeah, enjoy the weather, get out of the cold.
