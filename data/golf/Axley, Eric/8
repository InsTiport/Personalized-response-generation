 Q. Short but pretty solid, wasn't it?
 ERIC AXLEY: Well, I didn't hit it very well today, just kind of chopped it, just never got anything going, and just couldn't seem to make that crucial putt I needed to make. Just kind of disappointing.

 Q. Well, a positive thing to pull from this is didn't have the game and hung in there to the bitter end this week. But that's learning a lot when it's not going your way, let's play as well as we can and make the pars we have to?
 ERIC AXLEY: I hung in there and played a little better coming in, just still wasn't quite there. If I birdie on 17 and 18, could have got myself into a playoff and it just didn't happen.

 Q. Well, great playing. Good luck in the future. 
 ERIC AXLEY: Thanks.
