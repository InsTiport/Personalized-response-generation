 Q. 65 this morning. Were you thinking "fire at the pin, fire at the pin, fire at the pin"? 
 ERIC AXLEY: Yeah . From the fairway you could get at these pins today, it was so soft, and some of the watering holes played played downwind today. So, yeah, I would hit a good drive, and that put me in position for most of the pins today.

 Q. Things seem to be working for you and Weir. 
 ERIC AXLEY: We work hard, all of us, and Mike has been out here with us most of the week, and we did a lot of good work then, and most of the guys are playing well right now. 

 Q. You are friends with Mike. Do you hear the roars from the Canadian fans when he's making a move while your on the course? 
 ERIC AXLEY: Well, we were on different sides today so I really couldn't, but I'm sure on the weekend if I'm in the same groups, I will hear them yelling! 

 Q. Have fun the rest of the week. 
 ERIC AXLEY: Thanks.
