Q. Eric, 6 birdies, no bogies and your back-9 was your front-9 today, 16, 17 and 18 to really put some momentum behind this round for you.
Tell us about that.
ERIC AXLEY: Yeah.  I was playing solid early, just no putts were going in and then hit it really close on 16, about three feet, made that one and then again on 17, I hit it five, six feet, had a good number there and made that one.  I did make about 25-footer on 18.
Q. As far as the 9th hole is concerned, probably the last thing you wanted to do was try to use the putter twice from 74 feet away.  Very well done to close out the round.
Recently your success on the Web.com Tour has been outstanding with a victory as well.  How much has that impacted your golf moving forward and especially this week?
ERIC AXLEY: Makes it a little more comfortable when you have a win and kind of in a good spot to get your card back for the next year.  Yeah, free you up a little bit.
Wanted to come out here and play for a week and, you know, just to get away from the Web a little bit and play for a little more money.  Anyway, yeah, it frees you up a little bit I would say.
Q. Feeling good about the weekend now especially the rounds you put together here at this new venue?
ERIC AXLEY: Yeah.  Obviously it's pretty cliche, but keep doing what you're doing.  Gets harder and harder as the week goes on.  If you keep putting yourself in a good spot to make birdies and stay out of trouble, scores usually add up nice.
Q. Thanks for your time and good luck, Eric.
ERIC AXLEY: You got it.
