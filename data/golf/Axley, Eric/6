   ERIC AXLEY: Yeah, they blew it at the right time. We finished our 17th hole and we were kind of doubting whether we were going to putt on the green or not, but we decided to go ahead and putt.  
  
  Q. Talk about the roll you were on today.   
 ERIC AXLEY: I hit the ball really good today. There toward the end, the greens -- it's really been 14 or 15 hours since they've been mowed now, and they were really slow and bumpy. I missed a couple easy ones there on 6 and 8 that I should have made, but I played well all in all.  
  
  Q. Was it one of those rounds that you wish there was more daylight so you could have gotten it in?  
 ERIC AXLEY: Absolutely, I wish we would have just kept going. Like I say, I feel like I'm playing well, so hopefully it will continue tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Talk about having to come back and finish one hole tomorrow.   
 ERIC AXLEY: I'll just go through my normal routine just as if I'm playing all day and play the one hole and go get some rest and then come back in the afternoon and be ready to go.
