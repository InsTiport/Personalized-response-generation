Q.   Belen, terrific round, 69.   (Indiscernible) drained on 17. 
    BELEN MOZO:   I know.   I mean, I shouldn't be proud because the shot that I hit on that with my wedge, it was (indiscernible), but it is what it is.   You just to have take it and smile and go for it on the next hole.

Q.   I think it was a lucky a putt.   It was a good putt.   It was a very good solid round as well with your front nine going out in 33.   You must feel really comfortable on this golf course. 
    BELEN MOZO:   It really fits my eye and we've been really lucky with the weather.   The course is playing in phenomenal shape.   It's just the pure conditions, so it's really easy to play good on it.

Q.   You've been working on some swing changes and they're starting to pay off. 
    BELEN MOZO:   Yes.   Like I said yesterday, it's something that doesn't happen from night and day, so you have to work hard.   It's been a process since January.   It's still not quite there yet because I'm still missing shots, but everyone is going to miss shots. 
    As long as I keep doing in my routine and keep doing what I have to do everything is going to be good.   That's my goal, to keep working and keep getting better every day. 

Q.   It must be very hard to implement those changes.   Certainly something you can't do on a golf course during a tournament. 
    BELEN MOZO:   Actually helps my concentration because it's on one thing I have to do out there and one thing only.

Q.   What is that?
    BELEN MOZO:   Well, it's a technique, say, that I tell myself before each swing.   Just helps me get focused, and I don't look on the distractions and dangers.   It's just that thing that I have to do and keep on doing it all the way through.
    So it really helps me keep me grounded and don't get distracted with misses or birdies or whatever.   Just keep on doing that and try to do the best.
