Q.   Obviously you have to be pretty happy with how you played today.   Are you? 
    BELEN MOZO:   I am.   Yes, I am.   I mean, there has been mistakes out there, which is fine.   I'm fine with that, because I'm working on something in my swing and it's not quite there yet.
    But I'm really happy that I pull it through and I was very relaxed.   Just trying to get better and better every shot.   Didn't effect me that I hit a bad shot.

Q.   What are working on with your swing?
    BELEN MOZO:   It's been a long process since January.   It was something so drastic that it couldn't be made one day to another.
    We're finally getting there.   It's basically the‑‑ I don't know.   You want me to go through...

Q.   As much as you want to share.   How has it helped you?
    BELEN MOZO:   Impact, my hands were coming too weak, was coming weak and open, and I was hooking the ball too much.   So I'm learning to get an impact with more square hands.

Q.   Would you say that has a lot to do with your turn around this year, your exceptional play?
    BELEN MOZO:   Oh, yeah, for sure.   It all started because I started working with my coach from Spain, you know, the one that literally made me.   He worked with me since I was six, my one and only coach.

Q.   What is his name?
    BELEN MOZO:   Marcelo Prieto.   He is Argentinian but lived in Spain for 22 years.   That was a game changer for me.   We set up some goals for this year.   We're about to accomplish them, so we're very happy.

Q.   So more him and your swing change or CoCo?
    BELEN MOZO:   Oh, him.   I have to ship CoCo back to Spain because she's getting very naughty.

Q.   Oh, know.   What is she doing?
    BELEN MOZO:   She's having anxiety, separation anxiety every time I heave her by herself.
