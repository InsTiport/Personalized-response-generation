Q.
You're one off the lead.  You played a pretty good first day, just your assessment.
 RON STRECK:  Yeah, I had the flu the last seven days, so I came in late yesterday and started out well, was 3 under on the front side, got a little tired on the back side, just played real well.
Q.  (Inaudible).
 RON STRECK:  Yeah, bogeyed the par 3 there, left it short and hit a chip shot that went over the side there and hit a long putt, missed that.  Pulled my tee shot on 17, hit it in front of a tree and chipped up short of the green, missed the putt, one of those deals.
Q.  Did you have a practice round?
RON STRECK:  Yeah, late yesterday.
Q.  Did you get through 18?
RON STRECK:  Yeah, it was not dark yet.
Q.  What time did you finish?
RON STRECK:  7:00 or so.
Q.  What time did you get in here?
RON STRECK:  We got in Tuesday night late, so
Q.  Had you been here before?
RON STRECK:  No.
Q.  Maybe you didn't know too much, too much information, just saw it and hit at it?
RON STRECK:  Had a yardage book, so that's good enough.
Q.  You've had a good June and July?
RON STRECK:  Yeah, playing well, putting well, so it's been a lot of fun.
Q.  How low do you think they'll go today?
RON STRECK:  It's hard to say.  Somebody will, I think, go 4 or 5 under.
Q.  Did you ever think about not coming?
RON STRECK:  Only because I was sick.
Q.  Did it ever come to that?
RON STRECK:  Yeah, it was close.  I just stopped having a temperature on Tuesday.  I had the flu.
Q.  Did you lose some weight to go with it?
RON STRECK:  I've lost some weight but I'm getting it back, Pepsi.
Q.  How are these greens compared to what you typically see?
 RON STRECK:  They're about what we've been playing most of the year as far as speed.  There's more slope than some of the greens we've played, but speed wise they're about the same.
Q.  Did that affect your decision making putt wise?
 RON STRECK:  Maybe.  There's definitely some places you want to leave it short of the hole, for sure.
Q.  Did you study the greens especially at all for later
 RON STRECK:  No, just mainly see it and see where you shouldn't be, yeah.
