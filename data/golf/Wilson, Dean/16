  Q.  What's it like out there?   
 DEAN WILSON:  Survivor.  It's really tough out there.  Obviously greens are very hard, fast.  With them mowing the fairways backwards, it's long.   
 Number four is a 3-wood, 240 yards straight into the wind.  Nice save there.   
 On number 14, bad drive in the middle of the trees.  Good shot out.  Then a few yards short, trickled down the hill.   
 Happy to make pars out here.  You don't hear any roars out here.  It's so tough.  Feels different.  Greens are very slopey.  For me it's tough out there.  Couldn't reach 15 today.  Would like to get a birdie.   
 For me, I'm not making birdies, I'm looking at the board and seeing the same thing gives me a boost.   
 It's a little nerve wracking watching the tournament your whole life and then playing in it.   
  
  Q.  How do you approach the tournament?   
 DEAN WILSON:  Same thing.  Try to hit the ball better.  Hit fairways.   
 My mom and brother, friends from Hawaii, and friends from Utah are here.  It's fun.
