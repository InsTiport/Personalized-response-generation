 Q. Eight birdies, one bogey, 64 here in the second round. 
 DEAN WILSON: Thanks. Played good today. Nice smooth greens in the morning versus yesterday when they were a little bumpy.

 Q. Tell me about the round today. Did you ever look up at the scoreboard to see what Rocco was doing? 
 DEAN WILSON: Yeah. I could see Rocco got to 14. So I just made a birdie to get to maybe 8 and close the gap. 
 Rocco kept making birdies, so...

 Q. (Indiscernible) consistently, which seems to be four each day. There are a lot of birdie opportunities. (Indiscernible). 
 DEAN WILSON: I think there is a lot of danger out here. I need to drive the ball well. The last couple days, get it in the fairway and not get -- get yourself the opportunities and a short iron. Start driving a little wayward and you get it in the rough, it makes it rough for us.

 Q. I know money is important to you, especially this time of year. Will you be in Las Vegas on a sponsorship now? 
 DEAN WILSON: Yeah, I got a sponsor. That's really nice to know. And so I will get another start next week. But concentrate on this week and see how it goes.

 Q. It was a lot of fun to watch. Good luck. 
 DEAN WILSON: I appreciate it.
