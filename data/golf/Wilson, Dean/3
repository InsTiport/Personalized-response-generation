  Q. Dean, did you have to fight off any disappointment over the Canadian Open to close the post a good round?  
 DEAN WILSON: Oh, I don't know. I think I got a little sick Sunday night, so I've been fighting a little bit of a flu bug or something. Finally just barely got my voice back today. I've had other issues to worry about.  
  
  Q. How have you been able to overcome that and obviously put up another good round here on the golf course?  
 DEAN WILSON: Like I said, I took a lot of positives from last week. I played well and put myself in contention. I know I didn't get the job done. Could've played a little better on the back. But Carl played great. Carl played great.  
 So but i left there with a lot of positive and a lot of the new hope for the year. Got me in a better position than I was starting to the week for sure, so I'm bringing a lot of positives to this week.  
  
  Q. You're capitalizing on getting in this week. The golf course itself, was it what you expected?  
 DEAN WILSON: Yeah, you know, I went out and played a practice round on Tuesday and got to know the course a little bit. It's a little soft out there, so I think guys are gonna be shooting at pins and making a lot of birdies.  
 There's a lot of the people that are hitting wedges, and so I'm sure the scores are gonna be low.
