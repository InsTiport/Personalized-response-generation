   DEAN WILSON: Got it going on the back. Bad drive on 17 and caught a flier out of that rough, put me in a bad spot to double that hole. Could have made the birdie on the last. Would have left me with a better taste in my mouth.

 Q. At 17, was that a tough lie? You actually had a fairly open shot?
 DEAN WILSON: I had an open shot. It's sitting up on top of the rough, and, you know, I thought I got 180 yards to the front. I'm trying to hit a 6-iron 205 yards. I'm not going to hit a 6-iron 205 yards.

 Q. It seemed as the day went on, the greens got harder and faster. Your shot into 16 was an example where it could have been really close. Kept rolling.
 DEAN WILSON: 16 coming in with a rescue, it's pretty tough. I got a good up and down there. Just had to make those putts. I'll go work on it right now.

 Q. All right. Good luck to you on Sunday.
 DEAN WILSON: Thanks.
