Q.   Talk a little bit about your round now, being in the hunt now, and kind of getting the better end of the weather so far today.
TINA FISCHER: Well, so far.  Well, it was pretty windy though, you know, it wasn't that easy, it's the same for everybody, I think, I think.  Yeah, if it rains later, I think they might get     yeah, but, but the last five tournaments I had a bad draw so, you know, I kind of hopefully would have something this time.
Q.   Talk a little bit about your round yesterday and compare it to today and how you played and everything.
TINA FISCHER: Well, I played pretty good.  I played excellent yesterday, and even left a lot out there, and today it was a little more     you know, my short game wasn't that sharp, really, and I missed a few, you know, 3 footers, but it's all good.  I'm hitting the fairways.  I only missed one so far, and I hit a lot of greens really close, so I don't have a lot of long putts, you know, it was just really solid.
Q.   Can we go through your scorecard just a little bit and kind of run me through it real quick.

(Scorecard done.)
Q.   All right.  Good.  Thank you.
