  Q. Terrific start. I know you're happy.   
 DANIEL CHOPRA: Yeah, it was a good round. By far, I think, my best round here at Congressional. So off to a great start and making putts from everywhere. I played pretty well today.  
  
  Q. Watching you on the back nine, and you were rolling the ball well on the green. That might be the best putting round you've had all year.   
 DANIEL CHOPRA: Absolutely it is, especially the length of putts that I made. Well, the back nine I only made one on 10, and that was the last long one I made, but the first ten holes I made a whole bunch of 20-footers. That was fun to see the ball going in the hole like that, and it just kind of makes the golf course a little bit easier.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised at the low scores so far?  
 DANIEL CHOPRA: The scores are low. I mean, the golf course is soft. The pins were fairly -- especially the ones on the front nine were on low spots. That's where I made all my birdies, kept bringing it back towards the hole. Some of the front pins weren't playing as hard as what they normally would, so just the soft condition of the golf course.  
  
  Q. It looked a little bit like your game from maybe a year ago, hitting it long off the tee and putting really well.   
 DANIEL CHOPRA: Yeah, exactly, and that's what I kind of rely on a little bit. It's starting to come back to me now. I've been feeling good, better and better about my game the last couple months, so this was a good round to kind of get the confidence going a little bit.
