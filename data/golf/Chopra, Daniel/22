Q.
What are some thoughts on your round, it must have been difficult out there for you?
DANIEL CHOPRA:   Yeah, it was a tough day.  I drove it nicely and that's one thing I haven't done the past couple of days.

I got a bad break on 10 and I had a 3 wood to the green that plugged under the lip in the bunker and made double from there and that was a struggle from there on in.
Q.  Do you think that was the starting point to the downfall?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Of course.
Q.  It's hard to gain momentum?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Especially on the back nine.
Q.  But birdies on the front nine?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Yeah, just kept pushing as hard as I could.  Just wasn't able to do it.
Q.  What are your thoughts going into tomorrow after this round, how are you going to bounce back?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Tournament is over for me.  I'm just going to fill up the numbers tomorrow, play a good round hopefully.
