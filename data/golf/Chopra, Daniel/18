  Q.  Daniel, 68 today, great round.  Wind was a little bit rougher today than it was yesterday?   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  Yeah, it was a little blustery today, a little bit more challenging.  They set up the golf course very well for us, though.  They put some of the tees forward on some of those really long par 4s, and it was still playable.  I think if you're striking the ball well, you can still play well out there today.   
  
  Q.  9th hole went a little easier today than it did yesterday?   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  Yeah.  Well, you know, actually that hole is going to be tough no matter what.  Unless it's kind of straight downwind, it's going to be a difficult hole.  It got your attention today with that left pin and the wind straight into you.   
 When it's your last hole of the day, you're always trying a little bit harder to make sure that you finish on a positive note, and I was fortunate enough to make sure I hit the ball on the green on the right side, and I two-putted for my par.   
  
  Q.  We all want to know about your hair.  You've gone away from the platinum blond, pretty much jet black right now.  How long can we expect that to go?   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  I don't know, let's see (laughing).  Just trying to do something different, just change the look up a little bit and give my hair a break.  It's been blond for about five years now, platinum.  It'll probably be white again by the end of the year.
