  Q. Quickly just tell us what your first round at the Masters, what was it like?  
 DANIEL CHOPRA: It was great. I started off, didn't really miss any shots, I bogied my first two holes and so I guess I was a little bit on the edgy side. But I hit a beautiful drive at the very first hole and then I just didn't really pay attention to the wind as much and that was my nerves a little on the first tee shot.   
 But I killed it and the wind just blew it over and it hit the corner of the bunker and it went in. And I made a bogey from there.   
 Then 3-putted the second. And then I mad no mistakes after that. My short game was really good, my putting, I basically relied on my strengths today to get me through. And it felt pretty good to be able to get it back to even par. Especially after those first two bogeys.   
 And the greens were pretty tough out there today, but at least we didn't have that much wind and it was warm so we were able to, if you put the ball in the right places, you were able to get it back.   
  
  Q. Anything unexpected?  
 DANIEL CHOPRA: No, no, nothing at all. I thought that the golf course still played really long. They put some of the tees a little bit further forward, I guess, but the course played the shortest it's played so far this week, but it was still pretty tough. Those high pins are tough to get at. And I wasn't very sharp with my irons today and so it was very intimidating and I really had to rely on my short game.
