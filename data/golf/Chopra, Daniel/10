  Q.  Talk about your round.   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  Yeah, it was good.  I put myself in position where I was not going to be in the close after the first round of the tournament and gradually worked my way back into position to have a good time for tomorrow.   
  
  Q.  You've got a lot of momentum?   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  Yeah, I was not really giving myself a lot of opportunities the first couple of days, and I'm getting closer and closer to the hole now, and I've been playing nicely.   
  
  Q.  That makes for exciting TV to have a shootout on Sunday.   
 DANIEL CHOPRA:  Well, it does seem like it's a very packed leaderboard, so it's going to be one of those days.  Whoever plays well tomorrow and has a good round is probably going to walk away with the tournament.
