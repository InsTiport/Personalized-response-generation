Q.  Just some thoughts on your round?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Well, obviously I wanted to finish    that's what I said, too, I wanted to finish the tournament up well, so to get a good round.  Actually I played better, it's funny but from tee to green I played better on the weekend than I did the first two days.  I just wasn't able to get the breaks.  I hit a lot of really good shots and just wasn't able to get it done.  You know, I guess that's a major championship, as well, and the course is a little harder on the weekend.
Q.  How do you think it played differently today compared to the other days?
DANIEL CHOPRA:  Actually it played the same except there was a little more wind today.  It wasn't that strong that it would actually hurt you.  If anything, it was almost helpful.  We just used the wind to control the golf ball if you're hitting it nicely.

So I think the scores today should almost rival what they were yesterday because the greens are still soft, and a couple of par 5s are downwind so they might be even easier than what they were yesterday.  The course I think is playing great right now.  It's just a shame that I wasn't able to score better.
