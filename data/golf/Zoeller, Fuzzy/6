   FUZZY ZOELLER: I didn't put the ball in the fairway and here you got to put it in the fairway and. 2-over par, I'm very fortunate to shoot 2-over. 

 Q. Were there some surprises out there?
 FUZZY ZOELLER: I don't think so. You learn a little bit more about a golf course every time you go around. There were some shots that played very, very short for the yardage that we had that I didn't pick up on. 
 But other than that, no, I hit it great, it's all right there in front of you. Keep it in the fairway and knock it on the greens.

 Q. A couple small adjustments for tomorrow?
 FUZZY ZOELLER: A couple small adjustments? Yeah, I think a vodka tonic. No, really, I don't think there's any adjustments to make. Just come out and you shoot, you fire, and you score. You got to keep it in the fairway here.
