  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: It's not the end of the world. Some of these guys live and die by it.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: You got to forget that stuff. Just like my second shot my right foot came out from underneath me and I about whiffed the golf ball.   
 Lucky I didn't kill myself. Then I followed that up with a whip. Tried to hit it back up to the fairway and went right under it.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: (No microphone.)  
  
  Q. You surprised by the numbers put up today?  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: Very little wind. The greens were very receptive. I can imagine what they were this morning. A little sticky. They didn't really have the speed which I am used to here.   
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: I told you the other day when I was in the press room that somebody will probably shoot some good scores. You know good players, when they get hot, there's nothing wrong with that. Has nothing to do with the golf course. The golf course is not in bad shape. Just got good players. They played well.  
  
  Q. (No microphone.)  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: It could be.
