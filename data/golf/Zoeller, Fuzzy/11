  Q.  With what Ben did out of that 17th bunker, did that help you?   
 FUZZY ZOELLER:  There's no sand in that bunker.  That's harder than that damn road we drove in on.  It's just one of those things.  They say these things are a hazard and, boy, they are, there's no doubt about it.   
  
  Q.  Talk about the environment out there, Major Championship?   
 FUZZY ZOELLER:  Are you still working for the Golf Channel.   
  
  Q.  I am.   
 FUZZY ZOELLER:  Just goes to show you anybody can work down there.  I'm telling you.   
 I had a good time.  Last two days been very, very good.   
 You've got two classy guys that go about the game a little bit differently, but they appreciate it.  And that's what's fun about it.   
 No matter what we shoot, we're still out there as friends and laughing, giggling and talking all the way around there.   
  
  Q.  How did it play out here relative to yesterday?   
 FUZZY ZOELLER:  The wind's probably about 20, 25, it's about two, two and a half club wind.  Yesterday it was three, three and a half clubs.  So that's the difference.  It's not quite as hard as it was yesterday.  We're not getting sandblasted like we did the last four holes yesterday.  But that's it.  It's beautiful.  I'm going to have a vodka tonic.  Thank you.
