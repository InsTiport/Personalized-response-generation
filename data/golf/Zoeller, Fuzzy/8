  Q. You took Riley Morris out of the crowd; why did you do that?  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: Oh, Riley?   
  
  Q. Her first name's Riley.   
 FUZZY ZOELLER: Yeah, I know what her name is. I had to ask her three times but I know what it is, Riley. How about that putt she made? Isn't it beautiful?   
 I do it every year. I always pull somebody from the crowd on my way up to the last hole. It's kind of fun. Gets them involved. Gets them -- it's just fun for the people, and what the hell, we are in the entertainment business, so could have been a little old lady, too, you know that, but I went for a younger girl. It's because of that bow she's got, caught my attention. It was kind of neat. I'm just glad she made the putt. She hit a great putt.
