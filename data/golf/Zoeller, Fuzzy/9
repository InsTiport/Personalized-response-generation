   FUZZY ZOELLER: That big smile she put on, that's what it's all about.   
  
  Q. That's such a tradition, pulling kid out; why?   
 FUZZY ZOELLER: You have to understand, I'm getting older. We need somebody to take our place, take your place one day, so these young kids are the ones that are going to do it. So you have to give them something that you'll remember and every year they come back, they are going to say, "I made that putt, hey, I done that and they keep coming back." It's great.  
  
  Q. Were the roars for Freddie's hole-in-one on 7 the same as on the course?  
 FUZZY ZOELLER: You mean the way they used to be on the course? Yeah, they are loud here, because everything is so compact on this Par 3 here. It was great. The ground just kind of shakes when the people go crazy when they see the hole-in-ones.
