Q.  Being a past champion of this event, does it hold a special place in your heart?
FUZZY ZOELLER:  Well, I'll be honest with you, any time you win a Major, I don't care what TOUR you're on, you beat the best at what they do under some very tough conditions.  And it's a sense of accomplishment.  There's no better feeling in the world.
Q.  Being the course is in such soft conditions, do you feel you can be a little more aggressive with some of these pin positions and things?
FUZZY ZOELLER:  Well the greens are very very receptive to the shots.  There's a lot of holes that the wide he's part of the fairway is better for a three wood.  Suited for three woods.  But then you're going to be left with a three, four, 5 iron into the green.  As opposed to maybe taking that chance of squeezing on down to the necks and shooting up with a six, seven or 8 iron.  I kind of like taking that opportunity to take the chance to shoot it in there with a little bit shorter club.  When you're hitting three, four, irons, you're hitting more to the fat side of the green as we say.
