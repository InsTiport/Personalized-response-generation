  Q.  Regarding the course?   
 FUZZY ZOELLER:  I enjoyed it.  It brought back old memories.  It wore me out.  The greens, they are hard.  They are very patient players.  I had the golden horseshoe in certain spots out there.   
 18 is a bear.  You have to be play patient golf and get your par.   
 I enjoyed the two guys I played with today.  It was fun.  There aren't a lot of birdies out there so there aren't a lot of roars.   
  "Washington Road is softer than the No. 1 green.  That's the hardest green I think I've ever seen."
