 Q.  So you went up on the 6th hole and kind of kept the lead the whole time.  
JOSEPH PAGDIN: Yeah, I mean, I got off to a good start.  Won the 1st hole with a par, and then bogeys the 2nd; three-putt from kind of a short putt.   
So up until hole 4 or 5 it was a bit of a shaky start.  I was kind of hitting a bit wayward and not making many putts.   
Then on I think it was 6 I holed out for a two from 150 yards, so that was good.  So 1-up there.   
Then par-5, 8, birdied that.   
Birdied 9, 10, 11, four birdies in a row and got 4-up.   
And then I should have -- I was playing pretty aggressive the whole round, but I should have kind of put my foot to the floor on 14, 15.  I lost I think it was 13.   
 Q.  Yeah, uh-huh.  
JOSEPH PAGDIN: Then I just par'd my way in.  He bogeyed the last hole.   
So I mean, I played good.  I think I was 5- or 6-under with two bogeys, so I'm happy the way I played.   
 Q.  Yeah.  
JOSEPH PAGDIN: Good positive things for tomorrow.   
 Q.  I know you say you have a lot of match play experience.  Is that kind of always your game plan, to be aggressive?  
JOSEPH PAGDIN: I'm not overly aggressive when I go out to play.  I don't start taking out pins, obviously because if you don't have to you don't.   
But I find the toughest thing that I have is when I get 3- or 4-up is to finish it to get 5 and 6.  So that's what I mean by aggressive.  When I get 3- or 4-up is stick to being aggressive and not just hitting on the green and taking your two-putts.  So kind of finish it out.   
 Q.  Your mindset going into the next round?  
JOSEPH PAGDIN: Yeah, obviously tomorrow will be early I think.  I think I'm playing another Mexican kid.  I think I'm just going to do the same thing I did today:  just try and play my own game and let the score take care of itself.
