 Q.  So you took the lead on 3.  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: On 3, yeah.   
 Q.  And then how about the rest of the way?  Talk about the match a little bit.  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Yeah, I played really solid.  I just didn't do anything crazy.  I hit fairways, hit greens, and made a couple good putts.  So it was hard for him I guess to (indiscernible) with that.   
 Q.  Talk about 16 where you finished the match off.  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Well, 16 I hit a great driver.  He didn't hit it that good.  He was in the rough but he hit a good shot; went past the pin.   
We had two hard putts, both of us, so we both went past like six, seven, eight feet.  I made it back and he missed it.   
 Q.  Coming in did you know who he was, defending champion?  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Yeah, of course.  I met him in Argentina where I am from in the South American Am.  I played last year.  I knew how good was.  I knew.   
But I'm playing well and I knew I could beat him.   
 Q.  Is this your first U.S. Am?  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: No, I played last year.   
 Q.  How has that experience kind of helped you coming into the week?  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Important, because last year I was feeling little uncomfortable because it was my first time.  I didn't know.  I was by myself as well; this year the same.   
I was there and I didn't know what to expect.   
 Q.  And then heading into tomorrow, anything you're looking change?  Stick with the same game plan?  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: No, same game plan, yeah.   
 Q.  How did the golf course play today?  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Tougher than yesterday.  It was playing long.  Windier.  Love the weather though.   
 Q.  Pars are really important today.  
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Yeah, they were.
