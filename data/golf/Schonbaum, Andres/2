Q. I know it's not the way you wanted it to end, but kind of a back and forth match there.  First thoughts on it.
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Well, we played very well.  I think it's one of those matches that just got to fall to one side at one point.
We played very well.  I thought on 18 when I hit the great shot from the bunker I thought I made it, but he made a birdie.  That's an impressive birdie.  505 into the wind, par-4.
And then on the 1st hole, the 19th, I hit two good shots.  The wind took it a little bit.  The pin was stuck in and just kicked on the edge of the green and just fell.
Hit a good putt; didn't make it.  Made a good up and down, so, yeah.
Q. Then 15, 16 you took the match to all square and got a 1-up lead.
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Yeah, he made a couple long putts actually apart from the on one on 18 in that part of the round.
Then I made two good birdies.  Actually on 16 I didn't have to putt; he made bogey.
So, yeah.  Just we played very well.
Q. I know it's just recent, but what is your biggest takeaway from this week?
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Well, I guess it's confidence that you can compete and you can come here and try to win the thing.  It's a shame I didn't do it this year.  I played well today.  I thought I was going to keep going.
Just looking forward to next tournament and keep playing well.
Q. You know Scott Harvey and Matt Parziale.  Did they give you any advice coming into this week?
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: No, no, no.  As I told you, they were the ones that introduced me to the tournament.  I played with Scott and we have longer chats this time.  We saw each other couple times.
But, yeah, I played match play, so I knew what I had to do.
Q. What to expect?
ANDRES SCHONBAUM: Yeah.
