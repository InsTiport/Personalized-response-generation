  THE MODERATOR:   We'd like to welcome Hyun‑Hee Moon into the interview room.   Great round today, seven birdies, 6‑under par.   Just talk about your round and overall thoughts for the day.   
HYUN‑HEE MOON:   The golf course was going to be difficult so I didn't get to make such a good score today.   I think overall I played really well today and I putted very well.   
THE MODERATOR:   Now, the first time you played here was back in 2004.   It's a long time ago.   You've played in this event several times, and have fared pretty well.   Just talk about how big this event is for the KLPGA players and having an opportunity to play in this event.   
HYUN‑HEE MOON:   In Korea we have LPGA rounds once a year, and I believe all players want to participate in this tournament.   So it's a great honor for me to be able to be here.   My score has not been really good lately, and I heard this time everybody goes to fun, so I kind of wanted to boost my confidence, and I think I did it today.   
THE MODERATOR:   You're 21st on the KLPGA Money List.   Talk about your season so far playing up until this point and coming into this week how you feel about your game.   
HYUN‑HEE MOON:   I practiced a lot before this season began, so I wanted to make a really, really good start to the season, and I felt a lot of pressure because of it.   So I think mentally I was not as strong.   In the beginning of the season I made really good scores, but toward the end my scores kind of went down.   Participating in this tournament I think I will boost my spirit up.   
THE MODERATOR:   Thanks for joining us.
