Q. So ended as a close match, but you started out with a big lead today.  Can you just walk me through what happened when you were 4-up and then kind of lost it a little bit?
PARKER COODY: Yeah, I made a few pars, Ting made some bogeys.  I mean, it was an easy 4-up from my standpoint.  It's not like I came out firing.
On 6 I made a bogey; he 'par'd; on 7 -- no, I take it back.  It was 7, and then 8 I really messed up.  He made par and I was 230 out and made bogey.  Momentum really shifted really quick, especially on the Par 5.
Then he birdied 10 to go -- yeah, we were all square.  After that I started playing well and he did also.  Kind of just hung on until the end.
Q. How did that affect your head space as far as being up and being comfortable to having to catch back up?
PARKER COODY: I was obviously feeling good, just comfortable, and then I -- we both bogeyed 11, which was really bad, and we were still all square.  I mean, I was pretty hot, and luckily I birdied the next.  Got up and down short of the green on the next and then birdied the next two.
Then he covered my birdie on 14, so that was huge, because I would've gone into 15 with a good lead again.
Q. Can you walk me through birdie on 14?
PARKER COODY: 14, par-3 down the hill.  The wind was switching everywhere.  I just punched an 8, so didn't get it high in the air.
Got about 15 feet past the hole; Ting hits in there about eight feet right below the hole.  Knew he was going to make it; it was such an easy putt.
I made mine, which was a lot momentum going into the next few.
Q. How do you feel going into tomorrow?
PARKER COODY: Feel good.  I can't give away shots like I did today.  If he had played a little better I wouldn't be standing here.
I can't do that tomorrow.  Just got to keep going.
