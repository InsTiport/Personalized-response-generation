Q. So looks like you guys, you and your brother, are in pretty good position here.  Playing tomorrow.  What do you think about playing the same day in the Amateur, both of you guys making the cut?  How exciting is that?
PARKER COODY: What we both came here to do.  Still long way to go, but both of us making the cut was first priority, so...
Q. How far ahead can you think on the two of you guys being down the road together?
PARKER COODY: I mean, you really can't.  You got so many guys ahead.  Who knows where the bracket falls.  I can play a couple matches in or I could play in the end, but I play I got to win a lot of matches to do that first.
Just got to get one tomorrow and move forward.
