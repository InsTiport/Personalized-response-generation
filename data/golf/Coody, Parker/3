Q. How much of an influence did Grandpa have on you?
PARKER COODY: It was a little bit.  Obviously, he's watching scores online, and he's rooting for me.  So it's nice to know he's pushing along, helping to keep the process going.
Q. Yeah, does he ever come out and watch you locally when you're playing?
PARKER COODY: He does, yeah.  Every chance he gets, he comes out, so that's always nice.  Obviously, out here is a little far away.
Q. You're a little young to probably remember his Masters event.
PARKER COODY: Yeah, I was not alive then.
Q. Does he show you a lot?  Have you looked through a lot of scrapbooks?
PARKER COODY: Yeah, I've seen a lot of pictures.  He's got his green jacket above -- I've obviously seen his green jacket a few times.
Q. Where does he keep it?
PARKER COODY: Whenever he goes to Augusta.  He has a few, they give you like two or three, but he has one that always reminds him in his game room.
Q. So when you're over there, do you look at it and say maybe some day I can slip that thing on?
PARKER COODY: Yes, hopefully.
Q. This is your first Junior?
PARKER COODY: Second.
Q. Okay.  You played last year?
PARKER COODY: Colleton River, two years ago.
Q. How much of a difference is your game from '15?
PARKER COODY: It's just a little more mature.  I got knocked out in the first round, round of 64 in 2015.  Then I knew I just made a couple too many mistakes.  Today I just capitalized on unfortunate shots.  But I played solid.  No bogeys really helped.
Q. That's always a good thing in Match Play.  You don't make any mistakes.  So is that kind of the biggest thing you took away from your first junior experience is I've got to minimize those types of things in Match Play?  Because an 18-hole match, they can be pounding.
PARKER COODY: Yeah, I've been trying to work on that, minimize the mistakes.  Hit a few more putts.  Hit a few more fairways and greens.  And it can go down pretty quick.  It's funny how that works.
Q. Yeah, that's funny how that works.  What year in school are you?
PARKER COODY: I'll be a senior in high school.
Q. Are you committed anywhere?
PARKER COODY: UT.
Q. So you'll be there with Cole?
PARKER COODY: Yes.
Q. So you guys, do you do a lot of stuff together?  Are you guys from the same area?  He's from Houston.
PARKER COODY: Yes, I'm just outside Dallas.  So every chance we get, obviously, we're good friends and we're looking forward to college.
Q. Have you looked at the bracket to see where you'll matchup this week or are you on opposite ends?
PARKER COODY: No, I haven't looked yet.  I know I'm pretty sure I'm played Logan McAllister tomorrow.
Q. Just worry about the next match.
PARKER COODY: Exactly.
Q. Can't start looking ahead at the bracket?
PARKER COODY: Yes, exactly.
Q. Now you have an older brother, too?
PARKER COODY: I have a twin brother.
Q. He's not playing this week?
PARKER COODY: No, he's playing (Indiscernible).
Q. Did he try to qualify for this?
PARKER COODY: He did, yeah.  He didn't make it.
Q. He's played before, hasn't he?
PARKER COODY: He played in 2014.  So he was in 8th grade then.
Q. So where's he going?
PARKER COODY: He's going to UT.
Q. So was it a package deal then?
PARKER COODY: I mean, they treat us separate and we took our own visits different places, but we both just chose UT.
Q. It's a pretty good strong program of talents that have come through there.  Of course, Jordan, winning this thing, Scottie.
PARKER COODY: Yeah, some talent has definitely gone through UT.  And Coach Fields is a great guy, and so is J.P.  So would love to join that group.
Q. Texas has had a pretty good run in this event the last decade or so.
PARKER COODY: Yeah, they have.
Q. What's in the water?
PARKER COODY: I don't know.  Ask coach fields that one.
Q. Al Torres won it; he's a Wake Forest kid.
PARKER COODY: He's from Texas.
