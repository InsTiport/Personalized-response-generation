  Q. Five straight birdies. That's pretty special.  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah. I really hit it well all day. I didn't miss but two greens all day and I had a lot of really good putts and they just weren't going in and I just kind of hit it a little bit closer, they started to find the bottom of the hole.  
  
  Q. When is the last time you had five straight birdies?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Probably in a low-ball game back home. I can't remember on Tour when I had five straight birdies.  
  
  Q. I followed you at John Deere a few weeks ago. You were playing well then. It's been a little time spell since then. You continue to play well?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: I really haven't gotten in that many tournaments since the John Deere. I actually only played in Reno and played really well in Reno. Didn't make many putts. I ended up missing the cut.  
 And so I've been playing well all year. I just haven't had that many opportunities so I'm glad to be able to have a chance to play here.  
  
  Q. And like everybody else, there's always a chance. You do well this week, you're in next week.  
 GARRETT WILLIS: The FedExCup would be nice. I'm still on the edge of getting my 15 tournaments for my retirement so any extra tournament at this stage will really help me out for getting my 15 tournaments so I don't lose my retirement at the end of the year.  
  
  Q. That's the big story. We talked to you about that at the John Deere. That's big for you?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: It really is. It's a lot of security for me and my family. I'm a working stiff just like everybody else and if you went to some CEO, just regular guy has a job you said we're going to take your retirement away from you, it's kind of nerve-wracking, so I'd really like to get it sewed up and put it behind me.  
  
  Q. Keep it going.  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Thank you very much.
