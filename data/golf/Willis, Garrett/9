  Q. 4-under 66. Obviously, you're happy?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah. I played pretty well out there. I had a lot of good shots and good momentum going out there. I played pretty smart and just took advantage of the putter today.  
  
  Q. You played this course a lot. Today, the conditions, there wasn't a hint of a breeze when you teed off this morning, was there?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Not really. I think the most we might have played was maybe a half club all day. It was probably as easy conditions as you will get out here on Southwind.  
  
  Q. You're a ball striker. This is a golf course that I think fits your game.  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah. I played here a lot, and I've shot some good scores. I think I've got like one top 15 in my career here. I played well on this golf course. I haven't been able to do it for all four days. I'm looking forward to some strong finishes the last three days.  
  
  Q. Are you surprised at all the low numbers as you look at the scoreboard?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: The greens are perfect out here. The golf course is in phenomenal shape. No wind. I expect to see some 7, 8-unders out here, even though there's only two par-5s out here. As good as the greens are without any wind, it's definitely approachable.  
  
  Q. Good luck with your golf.  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
