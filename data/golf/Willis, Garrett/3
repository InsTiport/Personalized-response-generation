  Q. 2-under par today after a great round yesterday. Still good playing and great spot going into the weekend.   
 GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah, I really wasn't feeling out there. Actually yesterday was a great round for me. And getting off to a bogey start was kind of tough to swallow. I made a good solid putt for par on 11, made a couple of birdies and kind of stubbed my toe on No. 1, and didn't make par there, and didn't birdie either one of the easy par-5s out here. To be able to shoot under par today under tough conditions, and having to wait so much, I'm definitely pleased where I'm at.  
  
  Q. You mentioned 10, the bogey, any of the birdies that really stand out today?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: Birdieing the last hole, my caddie told me -- we talked about seeing the scoreboard, if I birdied the last hole there was a chance to get in the last group tomorrow. I don't know if that will hold up. But I would definitely prefer to be playing in the last group. I knew there was a logjam at 8, so I might be teeing off 30 minutes later, now.   
  
  Q. Just talk about the conditions.   
 GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah, the conditions aren't as easy as yesterday, but they were still pretty easy for this place. The wind was down. The wind blew just enough to kind of trick you where yesterday the wind didn't blow at all. So you had to think a little bit more today and that's what killed me.  
  
  Q. And lastly, Luke Donald, 10-under, a win this week puts him at No. 1 in the world. Have you played with Luke before?  
 GARRETT WILLIS: No, I've never played with Luke. I haven't really seen him play that much. Obviously he's a good player, and the chance to be No. 1 in the world. I look forward to playing with him, and maybe I can learn something.
