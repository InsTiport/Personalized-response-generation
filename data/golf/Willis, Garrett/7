  Q. Heck of a run here in Memphis. Talk about your day.  
     GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah. You know, I kind of had the same game plan today as I did yesterday, but I just wasn't able to execute yesterday and was able to execute it today. I knew it was going to play difficult again today.   
     I wanted to go out there and make a lot of pars if I could slop in a couple birdies, maybe ride the momentum. I was able to do that on the back-9. Little hiccup on 17 hurt. Toughest shot on that hole, the tee shot. All in all, it was a good finish, my best finish of the year. I'm here at home in Tennessee, and I got next week off, so I can't complain.  
  
  Q. Then, as you said, sloppy on 17. Come back strong and end in style on 18.  
     GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah. I'll tell you, I had some anxiety playing 18 every year. I've hit plenty of balls in that water. I was happy to hit down the middle of the fairway. Maybe the bogey kind of made my focus a little bit stronger. I was able to make a good putt on 18. Nice feeling.  
  
  Q. What do you think the key was to have the tournament that you had?  
     GARRETT WILLIS: I really played smart all week, really other than yesterday. I played for -- these greens are so firm and the golf course is to difficult. There's so many holes you got to get away with par. I was able to play with a smart shots, 25, 30 feet from the hole. I executed that three out of the four days. One little hiccup round.  
  
  Q. Certainly a momentum builder for the rest of the year.  
     GARRETT WILLIS: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I've got a long way to go to try to keep my card. This is definitely a good jump start in the right direction, but I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer because I like the courses coming up.
