  Q. Take us through the hole-in-one on No. 3, the whole experience.
 XIYU LIN:   I mean, I been playing pretty solid today, especially my irons, and on No. 2 I just made a long putt for birdie, and at the time I still kind of on the cut line so I'm like, okay, I'm going to keep it going.
 Because that pin position with that tee I see a lot in the previous years of hole in ones, so I know probably spinning back in line with the flag had a really good chance.  Just perfect number for me and I hit it really good and it just like a soon as the ball land I think it has a really good chance, so I'm so glad it went in.
 Q. It was pretty exciting.  Did you guys see it go in in?
 XIYU LIN:   Yes, I did.  Yeah, like last couple I couldn't quite see it so it's kind of nice I can see to this time.
 Q. What number hole-in-one is this for you in your career?
 XIYU LIN:   In tournament will be my fifth and in general sixth.
 Q. So you've had a pretty good amount.
 XIYU LIN:   Yeah.
 Q. Take us through how that hole-in-one helped you shoot the 3-under and get to where you are comfortably inside the cut line.
 XIYU LIN:   Yeah, I mean, today I know I have to give it a little bit harder, but, I mean, the weather is so much nicer than yesterday, and yesterday with the cold I just wasn't feeling really comfortable with the swing.
 Today I swing really good, so I'm happy I made the hole-in-one, but I wasn't too surprised because I did have the confidence in my irons.  I know it's going to happen, so of course it's great that 3-under for that two holes.
 And then the last couple holes I play 1-over, which not very, very happy about it, but the main thing is onto the weekend.  So I have two more days to deal within course.
 Q. Onto the weekend enjoy the hole-in-one.
 XIYU LIN:   Yes.
