 Q.  Xiyu Lin, welcome back to your home country of China.  What's it like being back home?  
XIYU LIN: Well, I haven't been back for such a long time, and this is the first tournament I've played in China this year.  I'm very excited about it.   
 Q.  How are you feeling about your game heading into this week?  
XIYU LIN: I feel pretty good, because I was back in the States last couple weeks because I have a very tight schedule coming up.  So work couple thing with my coach and I did practice hard, so, yeah, feeling pretty good.   
 Q.  If there is one thing that people should do when they visit China, what would that be?  
XIYU LIN: They should definitely try some sort of the Chinese local food I think.  Doesn't have to be particular food, but everything in China.  The food is so good.   
 Q.  Do you have a favorite?  
XIYU LIN: Well, I can't really tell, but like right next to our hotel there is a shopping mall.  A little least you should go in there I think.   
 Q.  Great.  Well good luck this week.  
XIYU LIN: Thank you.
