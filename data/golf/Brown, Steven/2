Q. How nice to have the support of the home crowd here?
STEVEN BROWN: Yeah, it's great actually. I don't normally get my family to watch. Last year was the first time I made it. Didn't have my best stuff, so it's nice to get out there and show them what I can do.
Q. Does it put more expectation on yourself when you go to a course that you really do know like the back of your hand?
STEVEN BROWN: Yeah, I think in some ways it does for sure. Everyone expects you to just play like it's your home course, but the course isn't quite set up this fast and firm all the time.
So in some ways, it's really good, but in others, you've kind of got to get yourself out of that mind-set where putts break slightly less than they do today.
Q. 163rd in The Race to Dubai, and a good start here. What is starting to tick over for you?
STEVEN BROWN: I really struggled this year to be honest. I think last year my putting kind of saved me a bit and wasn't quite as good this year. But took Germany off. Take time to really work on the swing and try to find something. Last week, obviously a step in the right direction and played really well for the first three rounds, then just carried that on today. Struggled a bit last Sunday.
But today I felt quite comfortable to be honest. It was pretty cold this morning. Hung in on the first few and got off to a low start and felt really good on the back nine.
