Q. You started off strong.  How did you find that went?
KYLIE HENRY:   Played really solid.  Made a couple of sort of frustrating mistakes on two of the par 5s, and then felt like I got it back a bit and was playing tough, like playing good through the tough holes.  Made some good pars, and then I felt like I dropped a couple towards the end, which was a bit disappointing.  But on the whole, I'm playing really good, and really happy with my game.
Q. What do you think about the two-hour delay?  Did that affect your game at all?
KYLIE HENRY:   I don't think it affected my game except waking up two hours before you needed to, because we were about to leave the hotel when we got the word about the fog delay.  It's just one of these things that does happen fairly often, so you just have to manage your time.
Q. And the conditions on course, how did you deal with the winds?
KYLIE HENRY:   The wind really started to pick up.  It was quite gusty at times out there especially through the back nine.  But yeah, I guess I have quite a lot of experience playing in the wind, so it doesn't -- I don't feel too thrown off by it for the most part, so yeah, I feel like the conditions are good and it's a good, strong test.
Q. Where is home for you?
KYLIE HENRY:   I live in Glasgow, so it's just a bit too far to stay home this week.  I played in the tournament last year, as well, so I had the tournament experience of four rounds last year, so that was good.  So I feel like I know the course well.
