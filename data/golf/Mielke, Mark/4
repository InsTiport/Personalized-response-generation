Q.   Talk a little about your play today.   Hot start for you there early on. 
MARK MIELKE:   Yeah, almost too hot.   Kind of got me out of my comfort zone a little bit.   But it was good.   And I made some bogeys and some birdies, it was a really up‑and‑down round. 
I was trying to keep hitting it solid and not do anything real stupid out there and at worst a bogey maybe.   But it still was good.   I made a good par on 18, made a good birdie on 17, made a good par on 18.   So it was good.

Q.   Talk about the four hole stretch where you had three birdies. 
MARK MIELKE:   Yeah, putter got a little hot there.   I made some unexpected putts that sometimes don't go in, they went in.   Yeah, I got a little adrenaline going there and I got a little bit kind a little ahead of myself a little bit, just because I felt so much adrenaline.   But it was good.   It was good to be it in that experience, it was a lot of fun.

Q.   Being a club pro, how exciting is it to be in contention heading into the weekend?
MARK MIELKE:   Absolutely.   It's awesome.   It's great.   It's something that you don't, you come here saying, hey, I would like to make the cut.   And then when you get up the board you say, hey, I want to play better than making the cut.   So it's real exciting.   But it's a real thrill for a club pro to be hanging with these guys, you know, it was good.
