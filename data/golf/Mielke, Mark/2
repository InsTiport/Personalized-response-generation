Q.   Talk about what this means. 
MARK MIELKE:   It's awesome.   It really is.   Just to make the cut here and be here on the weekend was incredible experience.   Let alone to birdie 18.   It was just awesome. 

Q.   Did you know that you needed to make the 3 to tie?
MARK MIELKE:   Yeah, they were keeping, my wife was staying in touch with my caddie, Will.   And we knew he had gotten to 2‑under and I thought I was completely out of it.   I had a bad experience on number 10 with a triple there.   So that kind of took me right out of it.   And said just keep hanging in, try make a birdie or two.   I made a couple birdies, but I made a bogey in there.   And then they told me he had made a bogey and then I was playing 17 and I felt I had to birdie 18‑‑ or 17.   And then I parred 18 ‑‑ or 17 ‑‑ I knew I had to birdie 18. 
And I hit a great shot in there like six feet and, unfortunately, I don't even remember hitting the putt, I just knew I had to make it.   So it was pretty cool.

Q.   How does this cap off your week here?
MARK MIELKE:   It was just an awesome week.   It really was.   It was so much fun.   So much fun.   It was just ‑‑ we're like king for a week.   We're hanging out with Watson and those guys, I'm in the fitness van with Fred Funk, guys that we watch all the time.   So it's kind of cool for us to be able to experience that.   It was just really incredible. 

Q.   Your caddie told me your wife's birthday is tomorrow.   Is she going to get that or are you going to keep that?
MARK MIELKE:   No, she can have it if she wants.   Her birthday, she goes, just make the cut, it's going to be my birthday present.   So playing on Sunday was awesome and it was great having them out here.   It was just a really great experience.
