 Q. Can you just take me through your day, and what was working well for you out there? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I hit a lot of greens, and the putt worked really well today. I mean I feel a lot better than yesterday. Yesterday was a little bit the greens were soft and a little bit of wind, so it was a lot easier to play today, this morning. It was nice and calm, and I felt comfortable. So I just hit a lot of greens and made putts.

 Q. To shoot 7-under and put yourself right back up near the top of the leaderboard, how great of a feeling is that? 
 SEON HWA LEE: It's good. I mean it was a long time. In the top a few months ago. So it's a good feeling about it, but I'm very comfortable this week.

 Q. I was talking to some of the players yesterday about how easy the scoring conditions were there?
 SEON HWA LEE: Right, this green is so soft, and the fairways are wide open. So it's not any struggling with it. So just hit the fairways and get it close to the pin and just make a few putts. The scoreboard is going to be really low. Anybody can go low.

 Q. I know you just missed a birdie putt on the last hole for 64. Were there other birdie opportunities that you missed? Was it that kind of a day or were you able to capitalize pretty much on most of them? 
 SEON HWA LEE: A couple of the long putts I was a little bit short and just hit it at at the hole and it went out. And there was a little short putt. 
 But I feel good. I mean, I don't worry about that. I'm 7-under.
