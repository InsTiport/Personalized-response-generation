  Q.  Congratulations, just talk about how you played this morning.   
 SEON HWA LEE:  It was a really good start because I made birdie on No. 1.  Then I made bogey on No. 2 and three.  But then I mean she missed a lot of fairways and putts, but then I really had a great back nine because my putting was really good and I made two birdies from 20 feet.   
  
  Q.  You have to be happy that it did not go to a playoff because of the 18 holes you have ahead of you this offa noon.  Can you just talk about looking forward to the finals and what your thought process is?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I think it's getting more and more hard, especially if there was a playoff.  I'm just keep concentrating on my game.   
  
  Q.  Have you played with Ai before?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I think I didn't play this year, but she's a really good player and she's a really famous player in Japan and there's a lot of support with her.  I mean, I'll just try to enjoy it.
