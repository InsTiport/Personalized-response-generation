 Q.  Can you just talk about your round and coming back at the end, you were down two on the back nine at one point? 
 SEON HWA LEE:  Yeah, I was 2-down I think on No. 13 -- actually 3-down on No. 13, yeah.  So she played really well. 
 Then I missed a couple of putts.  So, I mean, only six holes left, I really had to concentrate on my game.  Then the three birdies the last six holes, I think I did pretty good. 

 Q.  When she lipped out on 17 with the par putt, what was going through your mind when you were all-square through 18? 
 SEON HWA LEE:  The par 5, the 18th is a birdie hole, so I had to make birdie.  But the wind is really hard into, and then I missed the fairway but then I still had a chance. 

 Q.  What's your outlook for tomorrow?  Are you excited you're still in? 
 SEON HWA LEE:  Yeah, it's very exciting this week.  Actually I didn't play well last year, so I hope to play well in this tournament.
