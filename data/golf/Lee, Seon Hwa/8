And you played consistently. 64, 8-under par out there. Can you just talk about how you played and how the weather delay maybe didn't affect you? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I mean, I hit pretty good today. I mean, I didn't miss any fairway and pretty solid iron. And I hit a lot of birdies because my irons I was really good today. So I made a couple putts, actually nine birdies today. So that was really, really good. 
 And, I mean, I was real calm. And no wind. The weather was really hot, just a lot of -- drink a lot of water. And, I mean, yeah, just pretty solid today and very consistent with every shot and playing was really good today.

 Q. What was this morning like for you? Did you get to the course real early, and were you here trying to, you know, figure out what to do and just sitting around? What was it like waiting around, just waiting to tee off?
 SEON HWA LEE: I just waited at the hotel. Because the caddie here very early in the morning and then he called told me like three-hour delay, then the five hours delayed. So I just stayed at the hotel watching TV and just relax. It was pretty good. And had lunch at the hotel with my parents.

 Q. What were you watching on TV? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Actually I watched this Korean drama on the computer.

 Q. You said you hit every fairway. Have you been driving the ball that well for a long time, or have you been improving a lot lately on that? And, what have you been doing to improve, if that's the case?
 SEON HWA LEE: I think this is the first time I hit every fairway this year. I mean, I hit pretty lot of fairway every tournament but today didn't any misses of the fairway. 
 So, I mean, my swing feels really good now and I practice a lot of drive shots the last few days. Because some holes real ly new so I think that work.

 Q. When you were warming up, did you hit them all straight? I mean, did you have a good feeling when you were warming up on the practice range today?
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah. When I practiced this afternoon before going to tee shot, I mean, I hit it pretty solid. And I didn't hit many balls because the weather was really hard so I don't want to -- I mean, I don't want to use my energy, so I didn't hit many balls. But feel really good when I practiced this afternoon.

 Q. Can you just talk maybe about bouncing back and getting the birdie on 18 after the bogey on 17?
 SEON HWA LEE: When I miss the short putt I was a little bit disappointed because I made all those putts today so I got a lot of confidence. But when I missed it, it was a little bit disappointed. But I still had one hole left and the Par 5 and I think I can get a good chance with birdie, so back to 8-under. 
 So it worked. I mean, I didn't give up. So I think that worked.

 Q. Did you play here last year?
 SEON HWA LEE: Yes, I did. I played.

 Q. How did you shoot, do you remember?
 SEON HWA LEE: I can't remember. The first day I shoot pretty good, I think it was 69 or something.

 Q. I think four of the top five golfers on the leader board right now are from Korea. What is it like to know that? I mean, is that kind of cool that four of the top five are from Korea; do you kind of think about that kind of thing?
 SEON HWA LEE: I mean, I think at this golf course such good for a lot of the Korean players because the golf course not long and the greens are really soft this week. So I think the Korean players are really consistent. A lot of players are really consistent. So I think that's why a lot of the Korean players play well today and maybe this week too.

 Q. I'm guessing you are friends with a lot of them on tour. Are you guys real competitive with each other? Is there comradery, do you kind of root for each other? I mean, or just very competitive, you want to beat them? What's that like?
 SEON HWA LEE: Not really. No Korean to Korean player. Just LPGA tournament a lot of International players play. So not -- I mean, I just playing for myself and just enjoy it with another player. So I think that's about it.
 ASHLEY CUSHMAN: Any more questions? Thank you for your time. Great round today and good luck this weekend.
 SEON HWA LEE: Thank you.
