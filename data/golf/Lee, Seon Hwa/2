   Q. So you finish at 5-under. So you're tied for the lead. How does that feel? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Very great. I mean, it's the first round, shoot 5-under, top of the leaderboard. So it feels great. So, yeah. 

 Q. How was the course today? Was it tough? Not for you obviously. 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah, I played good. But the wind was a little bit tricky. Some feels really windy, some holes not. So far, the weather is good, afternoon tee time. A lot warmer than this morning. So the greens -- just greens really fast and greens lot of undulations and some of pin positions really hard.

 Q. How has your year been? 
 SEON HWA LEE: It's been not as good as last couple of years, but I try really hard every week and try to win every week. But just not -- my golf game is not going together. But this week is good, and I'm working with my coach, Mike Bender, and we had good lesson a couple times last week. 
 So it helped a lot today. It's going to be a big help this week. Just looking forward this week.

 Q. Your birdies today, was it from hitting the ball close to the pin, or were you putting pretty well on these greens?
 SEON HWA LEE: Three birdies was really close to the pin, and three of them is 9, 18 and 14 was far, yeah. 

 Q. How far would you say? 
 SEON HWA LEE: The farthest one was the 14th hole. It was like almost 25-footer. And then the last one was 15, 17 feet. 

 Q. How aggressive can you be on this golf course, especially on the shots into the greens? 
 SEON HWA LEE: The greens are a little bit firm, so I can't really hit it like really, like hit at the pin. But just try to hit the greens and make the putt and just safe a lot of pars and if I have a chance to birdie just make it.
