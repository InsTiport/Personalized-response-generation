  Q.  Laura Davies obviously has a lot of match-play experience; how does it feel to beat a player of her experience, a Solheim veteran player?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I feel great.  I won today, but then Laura was unlucky today because first hole she made bogey, got to have a really bad start.  I enjoyed playing with Laura today.   
  
  Q.  Was there any point where you felt like maybe you took the advantage or took the momentum?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I mean, actually I didn't play good today.  So hopefully I will play better than this morning in the afternoon.   
  
  Q.  And as far as playing 36 holes, do you have to work more mentally this afternoon or is it -- I'm sure you can physically?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I think so, yeah, more mentally.  Golf is a more mental game.  This is the first time playing 36 holes today.  We'll see.
