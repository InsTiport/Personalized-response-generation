 Q. How exciting is it to play for a million dollars? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I'm so excited. And then I played very good today. Very solid play. And I'm really excited about tomorrow for the million dollars. 
 I never think I can get a million dollars for one tournament, so I'm really excited.

 Q. What is your game plan for tomorrow? Is there anything you want to change, like picking your partner or anything like that? 
 SEON HWA LEE: If it is like this windy day and really hard to play. But some holes are really aggressive like par 5's, you know. But I just want to play really calm and just try best on every hole.
