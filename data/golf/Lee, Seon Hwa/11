  Q.  Setting the course record today, a 64, were you even thinking about that?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  Well, I didn't, but then as soon as my putt is better than yesterday, yeah, I think about that.   
  
  Q.  What was different about your play today than yesterday do you think?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  Actually my putt was way better than last three rounds, so that makes a good score today.   
  
  Q.  Have you been working on your putting, or is it just the pin placements were better or your approach shots?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  Yeah, just I practiced yesterday -- no, I didn't.  Yesterday at the hotel room, I practiced, just 30 minutes.  I just putt like a lot with the long putter, long putts, like 20-foot and 30-foot.   
  
  Q.  What do you do when you're practicing in your hotel room?  Obviously it was raining.  How do you set that up?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  Just short putt.  I just want to work on my tempo and rhythm.  My rhythm was not good last three rounds.   
  
  Q.  Do you mind going over your scorecard real quick and talking about how each hole played?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  2, I hit 5-wood and then 100 yards and pitching wedge, five feet.   
 I hit 5 hybrid to 12 feet.   
 8, I hit 5 hybrid again to 15 feet.   
 6-iron, three feet.   
 And hit pitching wedge to 12 feet.   
 5 hybrid to ten feet.   
 4 hybrid to like 35 feet.   
  
  Q.  How are you feeling right now going into Portland?  Obviously you're pretty confident going into Portland?   
 SEON HWA LEE:  I love the golf course in Portland.  They've been really nice to me.  And then I finished really good the last round this week, so I think I can play well next week, too.
