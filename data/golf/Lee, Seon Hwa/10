 THE MODERATOR: All right, Seon Hwa, congratulations on your third win. This victory gets you entrance into the ADT Championship at the end of the year, so congratulations on that. If you would, talk about your round and how you played today and how it feels to win again! 
 SEON HWA LEE: Actually I feel really great the last three days, and I just tried to do my best last day. I hit really solid tee shot, and especially like the short game is really good this week, so I made -- I made two chip shots yesterday and today, and there's lots of luck. I feel comfortable this week, and I got a lot of confidence in my short game and my putter, putting, so that's it. 
 THE MODERATOR: How does it feel to know you are already in the ADT Championship with a chance to $1 million at the end of year? How does that feel? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I feel really great, and I don't have to worry about point anymore, so that means a lot, so no pressure anymore, so that's good for me. 

 Q. Coming into today did you consider the possibility of winning this golf tournament as far back as you were? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I didn't expect I'm going to win this, because the leader was way --
 THE MODERATOR: 9 shots ahead of you? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah. So I didn't expect I'm going to win today, but I'm just trying to do my best and try to do my best every shot, so -- play smart so I think that helped a lot this week. 

 Q. When did you realize that you were in contention to win? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I just keep on the scoreboard, so was No. 13 when I made the 40-shot -- the chip shot, so that was really big for me. So I think a lot of luck this week, for me, so No. 13 is lots of luck and very good for me. 

 Q. How did that shot go in? Did it bounce a couple of times, go straight in? 
 SEON HWA LEE: It bounced a couple of times and then rolled -- I think it just short of the hole, before the hole, and then go in, yeah.

 Q. Were you surprised when Karrie missed that putt? Were you expecting her to make the putt in the playoff? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I was surprised she missed the short putt. I thought she was going to make it, because she has a lot of experience and she is a Hall of Famer golfer, so I didn't expect she was going to miss it, but I think she got a lot of pressure. 

 Q. Where do you live in Florida? Your history of how long you've lived here, and has that helped you moving over here to play on this Tour? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I live in Lake Mary, Florida, outside of Orlando Florida. I just moved three years ago, and my coach and trainer is over there, so just -- we work together so that's why I move over there. 

 Q. Who is your coach? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Mike Bender. 

 Q. Mike was here this week earlier, so was it helpful for you? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah. Mike -- my coach came here Monday through Wednesday, and we just work on lot of short game. He says short game is very important on the Tour, so I hit it straight, and I didn't miss a lot of fairways when I play out there so we work on short game and chipping and the putting, so I think that help a lot this week. 

 Q. What did it do for your confidence, I guess, heading into a major tournament next week? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah, I got a lot of confidence this week. I play really solid this week, so I'm really, really exciting about going to next week, major tournament. 

 Q. This is your third LPGA Tour victory; is that right? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yes. 

 Q. And I believe you are the first Korean-born player to win this year. Is there a competition between you guys to be the best Korean player out here, or do you have this competition? 
 SEON HWA LEE: I mean, the LPGA is more -- a lot of international players play mand every year the competition is getting harder and harder and stronger. So I think just -- yeah, a lot of Korean players win the last two years but then not this year. 
 I think this tournament -- I mean, I think they just work really hard, but they didn't get chance. So I think the rest of the tournament, I think, everybody -- every Korean player work hard, more and more, and they got chance. 

 Q. Can you give us your impressions on how the greens are played and overall just playing here in Charleston? 
 THE MODERATOR: How are the greens here at Rivertowne and how do you like Charleston? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Really great town. I went downtown last year, and it was pretty neat, really good town, and the people nice every year, great volunteers, so great tournament. 
 THE MODERATOR: What do you think about the greens here? 
 SEON HWA LEE: The greens compared to last year, last year was more firm, but this year really soft and really easy to play this year. 

 Q. Is it special for you to win a tournament with Annika's name on it? 
 THE MODERATOR: Is it special to win Annika's tournament? 
 SEON HWA LEE: Yeah. She special player and host this tournament, so that means a lot, and she gave the trophy to me, so that was -- that was good! 
 THE MODERATOR: Seon Hwa, thanks for coming in. Congratulations, again.
