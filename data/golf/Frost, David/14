  About Roger Chapman: Two years ago island of Mauritius. Won in playoff  
 When you reach these levels, anybody can come out and get hot. His game is on this week.  
 He s striking it well. I don t think the golf course is too threatening. The greens are controversial, but they receive the ball well.  
 If he can stay out of his way (Sunday), I think he ll do well.   
 (His performance) gives everybody hope. You play with people who win tournaments, it gives you hope. 
