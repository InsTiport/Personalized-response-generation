  DAVID FROST: Up to the test.  I said 6 to 8-under would win the beginning of the week.  I wasn't far off.Q. What do you think awaits the leaders here coming down the last couple holes, holes they can attack?DAVID FROST: Luckily there's no wind out there now so it's not as tricky as what it was yesterday.  So, you know, whoever is in the lead, there's not much, you know, elements out there. So, you know, it's going to be -- be nice to watch.  At least you can hit some good shots now.  Not like the wind is blowing and somebody -- you got to play careful golf.  It will be a good test for the guys coming in.Q. What do you think of Gene Sauers and what do you know about his story?DAVID FROST: Everybody out here is such good players.  Anybody on a given day, on a given week can, you know, can show up.  So, you know, it's Gene's week, it was, for him to have right now, and couldn't be happier for him.
