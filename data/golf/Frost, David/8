Q.   68, how do you feel about that that? 
DAVID FROST:   There were some good shots out there.   Just not confident off the tee, so I'll have to make do with what I have and see what's going to happen tomorrow.   Hit some good shots.   Driver just letting me down a little bit.   But, you know, managed to make some more birdies today which salvages the round a little bit.

Q.   You birdied 7, 8, 9, to go out in 31 and you're still not catching him up, he's still one ahead of you; what are you thinking, feeling at that stage?
DAVID FROST:   Just try and stay in touch with nine holes to go tomorrow.   That has been my goal all week.   You can't worry about the other guys out there.   You've just got to try and put the lowest score on the board you can, and hopefully, as I say, if I'm in touch with nine holes to go on Sunday, then the pressure will be on.

Q.   How tough is the challenge out there mentally, because any lapse in concentration could be so costly?
DAVID FROST:   You just have to believe in yourself and believe in the good shots you hit before and just see good things, not worry about anything else. 

Q.   How excited about the possibility tomorrow of winning your second senior major? 
DAVID FROST:   Well, I have to do something really special.   I have to find something that I'm confident with, that I can go out tomorrow, maybe go to the range now, and just find a little key thought. 
But yeah, it would be special to win here at Birkdale, I've come here many years, so hopefully we can talk about that tomorrow night.
