  Q. Well, obviously the wind kicked up a lot today. How different was the course playing?  
 DAVID FROST: A lot different. And it came from the other direction. It wasn't like the wind we were used to. And you know, then just blew a little harder.   
 As I say, it came from the opposite direction, but you know, overall, quite happy with my game. Second is not a bad finish. And Tom played really well. Except for the last hole there. I waited two days for him to hit a bad shot on the last hole. Anyway, it was fun.   
  
  Q. Were you surprised at all that he played well on this course, or this course just sets up for him?  
 DAVID FROST: No. You gotta drive the ball very well, and he drove it very well all week. Just in a nutshell he didn't make any mistakes. He made a mistake on the first hole today, and after that he played -- he knew the holes he had to play away from the turn, he did. And didn't really take any chances, and that's the luxury you have if you do lead the tournament. I wasn't in that position, so I had to try and make up more grounds and had to take more chances than he needed to.   
 But you know, I'm quite happy with my game.  
  
  Q. How's the wine business?  
 DAVID FROST: We drink more than we sell.
