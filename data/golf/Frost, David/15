 to yesterday. 
DAVID FROST:   The hole played different on 7 today because they moved the tee up on us.   Since the wind was in our face.   So I hit 2 wood off the tee again, yesterday it was down wood and I hit 6‑iron, I hit a good shot in to about 15 feet behind the hole.   Managed to roll the putt in.
On number 7, I hit 3‑iron off the tee, which left me a full wedge in and made about a 4‑footer for a birdie. 
Overall, didn't drive the ball very well at all.   I only hit the driver twice today.   Other than that, I managed to scramble my way around the course and actually and hopefully my ball striking will pick up over the weekend and free it up a little bit.
