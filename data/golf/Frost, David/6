 Q.   David, talk about overall how your day went, at 4‑under you have to be feeling pretty good?   
DAVID FROST:   Yeah, happy with the finish.   I made a lot of birdies today.   Unfortunately dropped a few shots but it's kind of gusty out there, hard to pick a club.   The greens are very tricky since the design, they hide the flags.   You have to be aggressive but also you have to play defensive, as well.  
   
 Q.   How about the birdie on 18?   
DAVID FROST:   Yeah, I made a 15‑foot putt for birdie on 18.   Kind of a tricky hole where the flag is all the way in the back and you have to judge the distance that it's going to roll down the hill.   So I was happy with the finish.   
   
 Q.   And the day, it's beautiful out here and you're expecting rain later in the weekend, how big was it to do this well, this early?   
DAVID FROST:   It's like any tournament.   You don't want to shoot yourself out of it after the first round, so staying in touch with the leaders is normally your goal coming out.   You obviously can't win it after the first round, so you want to just stay in touch with the leader, and, you know, just be in contention with nine holes to go is always my goal.   
   
 Q.   Was it more fun with Jay playing well, staying competitive?  
DAVID FROST:   It helps when one of you in the group has momentum and the other guy can sort of piggyback on that momentum.   But we've played so much golf together, we always have our good days and our bad days.   Yeah, it is nice when someone has momentum and you try and keep the ball rolling.
