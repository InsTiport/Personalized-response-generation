 Q.   Talk a little bit about how the course played today.  
DAVID FROST:   Well, the course was actually tight.   It looked like the weather was going to come up, and it just never did.   
I shot 2‑under.   I just feel like I might have done a couple better, but considering my condition, I'm happy the way I played.  
   
 Q.   2‑under, you're one stroke off the lead.   Do you feel like you got off to the start you were looking for?  
DAVID FROST:   Yeah.   Any time you're close to the lead after one round, you don't have to climb the ladder too much over the next two days, so as long as you're in close touch of the lead.  
   
 Q.   Do you think you're going to do anything differently when you play the course tomorrow versus today?  
DAVID FROST:   No.   A lot depends on the weather and just how my health is.
