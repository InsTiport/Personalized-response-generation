Q. So, three days in a row, 71.  Pretty consistent.DAVID FROST: I'd say.  You wouldn't say that by my front-9.  I was all over the place on the front-9 every day and somehow find my way back, fight my way back on the back-9. Just working on a few things on my swing and when I start out I'm a little bit hesitant about it and as the round goes on I try to trust it more and more and more. And, so, you know, played some solid golf on the back-9 all three days.  So, you know, I wouldn't say I'm in position to win but right now who knows, maybe I can just keep playing a few solid holes tomorrow at the start and who knows what I can come back in.Q. Sure.  You shot 34.  Obviously played well on the back-9 today, three birdies.  Can you talk about your birdies a little bit today?DAVID FROST: I made a nice birdie on 11.  I made a nice downhiller.  And then another one on 12, made a good 20-footer there and another one on the par 5 14th and, unfortunately, I flew the green on 16 -- on 15, par 4, and I made a bogey there but, you know, hit solid shots.  Almost birdied 18, 17 and 18.  So, very happy with the finish.Q. What do you have to do tomorrow to put a full 18 together, try and go low?DAVID FROST: Yeah.  You know, it's such a funny game, who knows?  You just play a steady round of golf and try to shoot 2-under the front-9 tomorrow and who knows what can happen on the back.  So, I'm not going for fireworks.  Play a nice conservative front-9 tomorrow.  If you can get to 2-under it will be my goal tomorrow
