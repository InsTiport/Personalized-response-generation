 Q.  I'll tell you what is difficult, trying to find a bottle of your wine in my local supermarket? 
 DAVID FROST: We're working on that! I haven't really spent much time in the UK over the last 20 years but I am trying to play over here for the next couple of years and I'll be working on a few of those things as I have to get it in the country first. 

 Q. You played well today in difficult conditions? 
 DAVID FROST: Looking back I maybe left a couple of shots out there but it was a good score and I would have taken that going out there today. It was very gusty and you had to play conservatively, a little more than you'd like to on the birdieable par fours. But at the end of the day I am happy. 

 Q.  You are having to play on invitations to get your card for next year but so far so good? 
 DAVID FROST: Well, I am enjoying it and my swing has picked up over the last three or four months and I really look forward to the events that I am about to play in. I am grateful to BMW for inviting me this week and hopefully I can end up with a good finish.
