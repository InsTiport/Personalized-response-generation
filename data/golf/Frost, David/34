DAVID FROST:   For me, it was good golf.  I haven't putted that well the last  -- well, actually I haven't played badly.  I just haven't put the scores together.  Unfortunately, you know, I didn't hit the right club on 17, and that hole can do it to you.  But anyway, you know, I'm glad I finished with a 70 and hopefully tomorrow I can come out and erect what I broke down. 
 

Q.  Do you look at the big picture on this, looking at the conditions, and carry that into the weekend instead of the number you shot today?
 
DAVID FROST:   Well, in my case, I just look at myself and I don't worry about the golf course or the leaderboard or something.  I've just got to prove to myself, you know, that I can still come out and play.  I don't worry too much about the conditions.  You know, I'm trying to be concerned more about my own play and no one else's.
