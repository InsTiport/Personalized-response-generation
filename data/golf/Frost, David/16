Q.   Initial thoughts about your round in general?
DAVID FROST:   Very happy.   Very happy to have shot under par today.   Didn't expect the wind to blow that hard and I even thought below par on a no wind day would be a good score around here. 

Q.   Three birdies through holes 1 through 11.   What did you have going for you there?
DAVID FROST:   Well I started on 10 and I hit a wedge very close on the 10th hole and used the slope to roll it all the way back to the hole.   So that was an easy birdie. 
11, par‑3, I hit a wedge about three feet from the hole for that.   I had a great start there. 
Then I parred all the way to‑‑ bad second shot on number 18 and unfortunately made a bogey there.   So 1‑under on the turn, which I was happy with that. 
Then you can't get aggressive on the greens, so you just got to try and play for the safe spot. 
And so I parred 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.   6 I chipped in for birdie. 
7, I had a chance for birdie. 
8, unfortunately, I just pushed my second shot a little bit and I made a bogey there. 
But as I say, overall I'm very happy with the way I played.

Q.   Could you talk a bit more about the greens. 
DAVID FROST:   No, the putts ‑‑ obviously it's a, you need a lot of good feel on the greens, that's for sure.
