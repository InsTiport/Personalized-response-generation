 Q.   I wanted to get your thoughts on your round today.   
DAVID FROST:   I played very steady.   I left a lot of putts just hanging over the edge of the hole.   Two more putts would have put me in a really, really good position, but I guess where I am now, I got to play extra hard tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   About tomorrow, what do you think you're going to have to do to put yourself in a real position to contend?  
DAVID FROST:   In a way the good thing is your playing from ahead of the field, so it would be nice if you can post a score and then make the guys back there nervous.   
So that's one way of doing it.
