Q. You gave it one heck of a run.  Tell me about the chip with your putter on the 18th.
BRETT STEGMAIER: Yeah, it was pretty significantly downhill, so it was all speed.  I mean, if the speed was off, the line was going to be off.  I was probably a foot in the fringe, so I probably just held up that extra foot.  I like to die my putts in the hole, and sometimes you run the risk of leaving it short when you're putting to tie, but I would still hit the ball like that.  Good day overall, good week.
Q. I can understand your disappointment, but I hope in the next few days you understand what you have accomplished this week.  Every goal of every rookie should be to keep their PGA TOUR playing privileges, and you took a huge step in that direction.
BRETT STEGMAIER: Yeah, for sure.  Two months ago I was fighting just to stay on the Web.com TOUR.  I'm sure tonight I'll probably celebrate a little bit.  Perfect town to do that.  So yeah, overall, really good week, just one shot short.
