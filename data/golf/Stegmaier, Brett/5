Q. What was your position?  How far are you from the hole?
BRETT STEGMAIER: 12 feet, I think, 13.
Q. Was it just too dark to even see --
BRETT STEGMAIER: Yeah, it's kind of downhill and the greens are kind of bumpy, so they'll be better in the morning.  It was a no-brainer.
Q. What do you do tomorrow knowing that you're going to come out and the first thing you're going to do when you start your round is putt?
BRETT STEGMAIER: It's fine.  I'll just hit a few 14-footers before I go, and it should be all right.
Q. What was working so well for you today?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Hitting it good, putting well, just haven't putted really that well in the last month or so, and just tried to trust my reads, and I've done a really good job of that, so it's paid off the last two days, today especially.
Q. Is the course playing a little tougher than everybody thinks from your perspective?
BRETT STEGMAIER: There's a few tough tee shots, and the greens were a little firmer today than yesterday.  No wind, though, at all yesterday, and none really this afternoon.  A little surprised the scores aren't lower based on yesterday's scores.
Q. When you look at that leaderboard and see you with all these guys right behind you, how does it impact how you'll approach tomorrow?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Really doesn't matter to me.  I played the last month of the Web.com season under some pretty good pressure.  I was leading in Charlotte, just didn't make enough putts on the weekend to finish it off.  But I mean, just trying to stay in my routine.  I don't really look at leaderboards all that much.
Q. Just too much golf, isn't there, right now?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Oh, yeah, we've got 39 -- 38 and a half holes left, so long way to go.
Q. The 12-footer you have is for a birdie?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Yeah.
Q. I think you're the first guy to ever say I've got 38 and a half holes to play.
BRETT STEGMAIER: Yeah, 38 and a third or something, hopefully, yeah.
Q. Are you enjoying it, though?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Oh, for sure, yeah.  Definitely.  A month ago I wasn't even guaranteed Web.com status for next year, so just kind of turned it on at the end of the year, figured a couple things out.
