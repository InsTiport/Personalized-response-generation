Q. Brett, thank you for taking the time with us.  A good week for you to move up and make sure you're going to be playing in the Playoffs.  Talk about the feeling, what it was playing so well this week.
BRETT STEGMAIER: I thought I was guaranteed to be in but didn't want to leave the chance.  Got my putter figured out during the week and that was huge.  Ton of birdies this week.  Not too many mistakes.  Overall, happy.
Q. Just looking ahead to the next couple weeks, how are you feeling?
BRETT STEGMAIER: It will be fun.  I know I got to play well just to get to Boston next week, I'm sure, but Top-10 in that you can move up.  So, I'm excited.
Q. Anything you're going the to strategy-wise?
BRETT STEGMAIER: I don't think so.  Just keep making putts.
Q. Brett, how rewarding is it after a long season to make the Playoffs?
BRETT STEGMAIER: I didn't even want to come here, to be honest.  I've been pretty beaten up and down on myself but somebody talked me into playing so certainly glad I did, obviously.
Q. What was the key to your week?
BRETT STEGMAIER: Just putting.  Got that figured out early in the week with my putting guy.  Made a few on Thursday, got some confidence and just, you know, kind of rolled it.
