Q. Great round today.  It's playing pretty hard out there.  Can you tell me how you found the course?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I played pretty good.  I hit tee shots pretty good and iron was good.  I missed lots of putts but also make a few putts.
Q. And the greens are putting very fast?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, they have been pretty fast, but it's really tough because it's really firm.  It's so tough to hit like close to the pin.
Q. And do you like the firm greens?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Nope.
Q. But you handled them well.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's okay.  It's pretty tough, especially my front nine because I didn't realise that they played that firm.
Q. And the course has settled last year, and it's playing a little bit firmer and some people are saying a little bit harder?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually a lot harder than last year.
Q. So to score 4-under is very good.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: For me, yes.
Q. And you tell me about your birdies?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have two birdies on the par 5s, front bunker, and hit it to like two feet and make birdie.
Q. Any other highlights to your round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not much.  Not much.
Q. Did you look up at the leaderboard, and see, there's my sister.  I have to finish higher?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I saw her score, I saw 3-under.  I just saw her score on the last hole.
Q. Does that make you more motivated or just excited?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So I saw her 3-under and I wanted to make birdie on the last hole.
