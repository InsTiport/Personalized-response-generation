Q. How did you girls feel walking off the course with a win?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel great.  Didn't expect -- I mean, we want to win the match, but like soon as we saw the pairing, like, you know, Japan is tough for us.  I didn't play that good, but pretty lucky I got her so she helped me a lot today.
Q. Sherman, what did you do to help her out there?
SHERMAN SANTIWIWATTHANAPHONG: Just try to play my best and doing my shot.  Sometime just like ask her what should I do and she help me a lot today.
Q. Anything particular she helped you with?

Q. Is there any particular hole in your match that you felt was a big turning point for you or a good win?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say on 14, the short par-4.  I mean, she hit driver on the green on like 20 feet.  Amazing shot.  Unbelievable shot.
She made me feel so comfortable to try to go hit the green, and we both made birdie.
