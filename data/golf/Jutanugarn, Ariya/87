Q. You started the day 7 shots out of the lead.  How do you feel you were able to put yourself in contention and give yourself a shot?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, today before I teed off, I just felt like I really wanted to keep under control and I just want to have fun, because I have great memories here and I love this course.
Q. You got off to a fast start with the eagle on 2.  Can you talk about that eagle?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just hit a perfect 3-wood and good second shot and holed the putt.
Q. Can you just talk, there are not a lot of players out here that can experience what you're experiencing, watching your older sister out here too.  How does that feel like?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's great.  It's awesome for me because I played good, and I have a chance to watch her play, and I'm rooting for her to make some birdies and make some putts.  It's great.
Q. Did you have nerves out there even though you won before?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have.  I have a lot, especially my putt.
Q. Overall today you felt comfortable though?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel great.  I gained a lot of confidence after today.
