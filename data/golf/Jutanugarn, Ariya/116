Q. 2-under 70 in your second round, how did you feel about your round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I hit a lot of good shots today.  Just didn't make a lot of putts, but overall, it's pretty good.
Q. And you had to finish your first round this morning and play another 18 holes in the afternoon.  How was that mentally and physically for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I don't feel that tired because I just had to play like 11 more hole more in the morning, so it's not that bad.
Q. And how will you prepare for the weekend?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm just going to try to work on my putting a little bit.
