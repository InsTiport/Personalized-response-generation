Q. Did you play here last year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I did.
Q. Your name is at the top of the leaderboard again.  Been a couple starts since your last win, but how does that feel?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel good.  Today I played pretty good.  My tee shot was good and I make some putt.
Q. What do you think worked well for you today?  Driver and putting for the most part?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, because I didn't bring my driver this week also, so I hit my 3-wood and 2-iron.
Q. When is the last time you had your driver in the bag?  Do you remember?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I try to think.
Q. Did you have it last week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  Wal-Mart.
Q. Okay.  To look at the leaderboard and see your name up top, obviously you can't win it after round one, but you have to feel pretty good about the position you put yourself in.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel good.  I'm not feel good because I'm top the leaderboard.  I feel good about my game today.
Q. Did you look up and see your sister on the leaderboard at all?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I did.  2-Under.
Q. Have you guys had any kind of duels, head-to-heads, with your sister?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.
Q. But you got to feel good about both of you playing well going into the UL Crown next week, right?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. The round today, the course, did it all feel really well, like everything came together for you really well today, or do you think you can play even better?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, my iron was okay, too, today, but I make some putt.  I think can be a little bit better with my iron and putting.
Q. So really good but encouraging as well, I guess.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Uh-huh.  Thank you.
