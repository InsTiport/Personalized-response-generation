Q. How did you feel overall today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel good.  Today I start to make some putt and shot like 4-under.  I mean, today was pretty good day for me.
Q. Did you find something in your game late that you feel good about heading into the weekend?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  Especially like back nine.  I feel like, okay, just have to putt, so don't worry about the outcome.  I think if I keep do this last two days going to be pretty good.
