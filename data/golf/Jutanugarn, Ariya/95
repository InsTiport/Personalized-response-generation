 Q.  Tell us, you had 4-under today, hot enough for you out here?  How are you feeling?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel really good.  I'm just not really a good start today, but I come back like pretty good and I just like stay focused on my game.   
 Q.  Was there anything that you want to work on for tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Right now, not really.  Just keep working on the same thing.   
 Q.  I saw you were limping a little bit.  Is there anything wrong?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Maybe I'm too fat (laughter).  Last week, it's pretty soft and it's like really hilly.  I think a few people got that, too.   
 Q.  It's nothing?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hope nothing.   
 Q.  I've been told that Thai girls feel like a team and you help each other.  Would you say, do you get a feeling of being a team, coming from Thailand with your sister and the other girls?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going say to be honest, me and my sister, we not really talk about golf.  So we're not really talking about golf.  So sometimes we practice together but I think we are a good team to play in a tournament anyway.   
 Q.  What about as a whole country?  The six of you last week, all the Thai girls hanging out together, do you feel like, you at least seem to be friends and enjoy spending time together?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, like we all friends and we have so much fun last week.  We try to cheer for each other all the time and see other Thai people on the leaderboard and we feel great.   
 Q.  I think you made two bogeys in the first three holes.  What happened?  Do you tell yourself something?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not really worried about that because I feel like I don't want to remember all the bad things, and I know I just make some mistake, like one shot, and I just make bogey.   
 Q.  Do you tell yourself anything?  Because you made six birdies after that.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just focus on the thing under my control and try to focus on my shot, nothing about like something behind.
