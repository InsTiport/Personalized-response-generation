 Q.  So I got to ask, what happened there on 18?  Looks like you hit a little low.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just miss the shot.   
 Q.  Okay.  What were your thoughts when you saw it go off into the water?  What were you thinking?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, it's just like one bad shot, so I mean, next shot I have good commitment.  Second shot I hit a great shot.  You know, like just one bad shot.   
 Q.  Overall what are your takeways from today?  You're one stroke back now, but heading into the final round what are your big takeaways?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know what?  This course anything can happen, especially it's windy, the greens so tough.  I feel good about my game today.  I miss a lot, but still got a lot up and down.   
 Q.  You kind of did the same thing as yesterday:  started out quiet and picked it up.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yep.   
 Q.  Is that just the way you work on this golf course?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I try to not make bogey early in the round, but I can't.  I keep make bogey early the round.   
 Q.  And then Gaby's hole-in-one.  Did any of you see it go in?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I saw it - I mean, I'm pretty sure it's in but I'm not sure until the camera guy said, That's a great shot.   
 Q.  It was great seeing you guys all give her high fives.  You're all friends our there, right?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, we have so much fun.   
 Q.  How do you feel heading into the last round?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Still have a lot the things to work on.  Just like going to go work on my putting, a little bit with my swing.  Feel okay.   
 Q.  Goals for tomorrow at all?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just be patient.  Don't think about the outcome.  Go out and have fun.
