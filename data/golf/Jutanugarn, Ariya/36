ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really good front nine, but back nine come back really good.   
 Q.  Confident for tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, but still have a lot of thing to work on.   
 Q.  Okay.  Still not using the driver, huh?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Nope.   
 Q.  What types of things are you going to work on for tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think mainly going to be on my commitment.  Like when I have better commitment back nine I just play so well.  I have four birdie with like no bogey.  So front nine just like maybe not really have like good commitment because I'm worry, I'm scare, and I start to make bogey and double and then double again.   
Pretty tough for me.   
 Q.  Home crowd make you more nervous playing at home?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  I'm just nervous and worried because I'm not really play well in the last few tournaments and not really have good commitment, so I have a lot of thing to work on.   
 Q.  You're world No. 1 and you still are open to share that you are scared or nervous, maybe not as confident.  Talk to me about just the balance of having the fierce competitiveness, and also just being true and real to what you're feeling.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think we have to understand we're humans.  We always going to make mistake and always going to have worries.  Because like when I'm worry means I'm care about, so I'm just keep working on that fight and face it.   
 Q.  I was talking to your sister a couple days ago about how much you love kids.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Me?   
 Q.  Yeah.  Everyone knows it.  Talk to me about just being able to play in front of kids here at home.  How huge is that support for you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's mean, so much to me, especially when I saw the kid come to me and say, I like you; you inspire me.  It's mean so much to me.   
Especially I can speak Thai to them so they understand me well.  In the U.S., What you talking about?  Yeah, this week good.
