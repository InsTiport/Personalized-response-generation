THE MODERATOR: Welcome No. 3 Ariya Jutanugarn, also our defending champion took a four-stroke win last year in 2016 at Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club in Calgary.
Welcome back to Canada, Ariya.  Thinking back to last year, such a great, great win for you.  What are your best memories?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Last year I had a great memory.  I think I love Canada.
Q. You do?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have great memories in Canada.  Last year I remember the final round I played with Sei Young Kim and In-Gee and we had so much fun.  I had a pretty good round that day, and it's great memories going to stay with me forever.
Q. You said you really liked Canada.  Earlier this year you won still here in Ontario, a couple hours away, with that birdie putt on the first playoff hole at Manulife.  What is it about Canada that seems to agree with you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I played Canadian Open since I was a junior.  I got in the field a few times and I really appreciate what they give me.  I love everything here.  All the spectators, they're so nice.  They come support us and not only the tournament day and even practice rounds they come out and give us full support.  I feel like my second home, you know.
Q. Well, it certainly agrees with you.  One last question.  I know your shoulder had been bothering you a little bit.  How do you feel coming in this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel better.  I'm getting better, and I work on it every day, so I feel better.
Q. You had the two weeks off, I'm sure that helped.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it is.  I rest a lot, not practice much.
Q. Despite being the defending champion, normally when you're defending champ you get a lot of attention.  This week there is a lot more attention on Brooke.  Do you feel like you're sort of watching her get all the attention instead of you?  Is it a bad thing, or you understand why?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I understand why because I played in Thailand this year and there is a lot of expectation on me.  To me I'm not really worried about that.  So even if they put the expectation on me, I'm not really worried about that right now because I know what I've been working on and what I have to do.
Q. So the golf course, you said you had your 18-hole Pro-Am today.  You said it was kind of windy.  What are your thoughts on the golf course?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: The course is nice and in great shape.  It rained so hard yesterday and the greens were so fast.  I'm not really used to it because it's so fast compared to the last few tournaments it was pretty slow.
Q. Ariya, have you talked with Brooke about what she expected this week?  And what I mean is this is special for her and it may never happen again.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I haven't talked to her.  I mean, I haven't played with her for a while, but when we play together we more talk about life, so we don't really talk about golf.
Q. Big groups of fans.  You said you're used to that playing in Thailand?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not used to (laughing).
Q. But you've seen it playing in Thailand and other events.  What's it like playing out there to see all of these big crowd?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, it's incredible how they support us.  I got nervous every time I teed off on my first hole.  I was really excited, a lot of people come out and watch us.
Q. What does Ariya Jutanugarn have to do well this week to have a chance to win?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have to focus the things that I can control and don't think about the outcome.  Just stay with my process, to hit the ball good and stay committed.
Q. Is getting back to No. 1 in the World Ranking a big goal of yours?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Right now I think I haven't thought about the rankings for a long time.  So I know I'm struggling the last few tournaments and I'm just working on that thing and trying to be more calm.  I'm not thinking about ranking right now.
Q. Are you concentrating more on getting healthy, I guess?  Would that be fair to say?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, I want to be healthy and I want to be able to go out and have fun and enjoy.
Q. What kind of exercises do you do on your shoulder to strengthen it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: My physio lets me do a few of them, but I don't know how to say.
Q. Your success in Canada started with winning the Canadian Women's Amateur a while back.  Do you have any fond memories of that event?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Which one?
Q. The Canadian Amateur, memories of winning that.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I remember I played with my sister and I beat her, yeah, that was a really good memory for me (laughing).
Q. You've played with her a couple times this year.  I know you get the question a lot, but still fill everyone here in on your relationship and what it's like to play with her?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's so much fun.  I feel like even though I played with her in Match Play in Mexico, and it was kind of weird for us because she made a putt and a few good, but I lost the hole.  So it's kind of like weird, but we have so much fun.
