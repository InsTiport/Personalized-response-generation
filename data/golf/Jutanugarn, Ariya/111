 Q.  (Wind.)  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I just can't believe I win the tournament, because when I got here I didn't feel comfortable to hit the golf ball and scared to hit my tee shot.   
I can't believe it's end up this way, the tournament.   
 Q.  Feeling of relief right now?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, feel a lot better.   
 Q.  Congratulations.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.
