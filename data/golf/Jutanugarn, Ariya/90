Q. 4-under par.  How was it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's good.  I mean, my iron was way better than yesterday.  I just missed some tee shot.
Overall it's pretty good.
Q. Did you feel like you have to make birdie on every hole out here?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel like -- because when you saw the leaderboard and Inbee just like 9-under, but I still really want to focus on like my game.  So don't think too much about like in the future.
Q. You're only two back for the final round.  What's going to be your game plan?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tomorrow I think it's going to be the same.  Just be patient with every hole.  You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
