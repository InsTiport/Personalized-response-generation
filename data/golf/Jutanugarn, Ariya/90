 Q.  Ariya, 67 on day one.  What was the key to doing well out there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, it's rain today and a little bit windy, but my irons help me a lot.  I been hitting it pretty good today.   
 Q.  You started your day on the back; on the front nine you had five birdies.  What changed there at the turn?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, just start to make some putt, because I keep (indiscernible) like front nine, back nine.   
 Q.  What are your thoughts on the course here and how you feel like it is sets up for you?  Do you like the layout here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually it's pretty tough for me.  I always feel like the course here is really hard because the greens really bumpy, and you're not going to hit far here.   
 Q.  You ever put driver in the bag here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, not yet.
