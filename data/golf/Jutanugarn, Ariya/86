 Q.  9-under par for the tournament heading into the weekend.  What was the highlight today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today?   
 Q.  Uh-huh.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not much.  I mean, I been putt like 20 feet I make four or five time today.  I still miss like few short putt, like four feet.   
But overall pretty good.  My iron was pretty good today.   
 Q.  I heard on the telecast no driver here.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I use yesterday.   
 Q.  You used yesterday, okay.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I hit like two hole and I feel like, Oh, maybe not.  So I just no, no driver.   
 Q.  Okay.  Well, it seems to be working; 9-under going into the weekend.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yep.   
 Q.  Are you happy with the way you've played overall?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  I mean, I have a lot more confident because I feel like my game have like improved.   
 Q.  Yeah.  You have good memories here obviously.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Does that boost...  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, it's not only like two years ago, but I been play here since I was like 17 and I finished Top 5; I going to say I love here.   
 Q.  Are you surprised you've been able to get 36 holes in based on the forecast, the weather?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, but, you know, it's all the time.  Every year here is just like all weather have like pretty bad; keep changing.  We finish four day all the time.   
 Q.  Imagine living out here and how unpredictable it is every week.  On the telecast they were talking about you and your sister and Brooke Henderson playing the most on tour.  Why do you guys play so much?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Because I like to play.  I feel I can improve, I can learn something when I play the tournament.   
When I -- actually I'm lazy, so when I have too much week off I'm not do much thing, so better for me to keep playing.   
 Q.  What did you do last week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Last week I went to PLAYERS on Friday and nothing much.  Just like lay on bed, watch drama.   
 Q.  What do you watch?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I watch Thai drama.  I almost finish everything.  I watch too much.   
 Q.  One more.  U.S. Open, you have a major coming up.  Does it change the approach as you guys get closer to a major?  The tournament before, do you work on things differently than maybe the middle of the season?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  I think I been trying to improve like same thing.  I feel like U.S. Open is really big tournament, but if I take it's like really big, I'm going to be like nervous, excited about that.  I just want to take like it's just other tournament.   
Just do my best every day, every shot.   
 Q.  There was a lot of the talk coming into this tournament about trying to get it closer to the conditions of the U.S. Open.  I'm guessing the weather has softened and hasn't held up as much as a normal challenge before a U.S. Open.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't understand you.   
 Q.  Has this course been easier than you thought?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: This one?   
 Q.  Yeah, because of the weather.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I never thought this one easy.  Always tough for me.   
 Q.  Easy for me to say because I'm not playing.  I appreciate it.
