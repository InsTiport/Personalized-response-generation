ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm very happy about my round today because I started to make some putts, because the last few days, I missed a lot of putts.   
 Q.  What kind of club would you specifically use for this tournament here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: This week I use 3-wood and 2-iron.   
 Q.  Tomorrow, if you do win, let's just say that will be your sixth title of the season, but right now overall, you're just one behind the leader, and what might be your take on that?  What do you make of it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just focus on have fun and enjoy tomorrow, because like I'm not really worried about like if I'm one shot behind.  I just want to have fun tomorrow.   
 Q.  Your sister is also part of this tournament.  As an elder sister there, would you two actually have some communication about the ongoing tournament and so forth?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, always, after the first round we talk a lot about everything on the course because like we always try to help each other and she gives me advice like always.   
 Q.  Right now you're ranked No. 2 in the world, and Lydia Ko, of course, the rivalry goes on in the next year and upcoming years.  What do you make of this rivalry right there against Lydia?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Do I think about it?  Not really.  I mean, I have my goal.  I want to be there and improve something with my game.  But of course, all the players want to be No. 1.  But I just really want to have fun, and have fun with this -- inaudible -- and play golf.
