 Q. How was today for you compared to yesterday's day on the course?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Oh, you know, today was really (wind interference.)   
I hit like a lot of bad shot today.   I cannot control my iron and I still miss like a lot short putt.  
   
 Q.   How much of your game do you have to change because of wind?   Did you change your approach because of the wind today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know, like sometimes you have to adjust the yardage because it's hard like really windy.   Sometimes it's pretty hard and have to hit like low ball.  
   
 Q.   How did you feel finishing up today?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Today I have a lot of bad shot, you know, and sometimes when (wind interference) not very good, so have to work on it.  
   
 Q.   How do you hope to improve or what do you hope to change going into tomorrow?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Should be my iron and my putting.   I miss a lot short putt today.
