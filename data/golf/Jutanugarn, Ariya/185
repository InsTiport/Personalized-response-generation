Q.   Congratulations, talk us through your round, what did you come in on? 
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Today I have only two birdies, so I don't make a lot of putts today and I made a lot of short putts.   But I have like 3‑putt one hole.

Q.   And what did you finish on? 
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   10‑under. 

Q.   And how have you found the week so far?   How have you found the week, the course?   Have you enjoyed the week? 
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   First time I played here, the course really hard.   Amazing I thought like 3‑under is very good. 

Q.   Obviously you did fantastically well last weekend in Thailand but also disappointing just not to win; were you able to putt that right behind from you the moment you arrived here or has that been in the back of your mind?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know, I remember every shot on 18 last week, because it made like really good experience, it make me be like stronger golfer.   So I remember every shot I play.
