 Q.  Had a bit of a rough spell early on but managed to turn things how.  How did you do that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, this front nine I just wasn't really committing to my shots really well, so when I made the turn I felt I wanted to be able to have more commitment with my shot, and it turned out pretty good.   
 Q.  You had a nice eagle; how did that feel?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty good.  I made like three good shots on that hole.   
 Q.  8-under par, one round to go; how do you feel and what do you expect for tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tomorrow I think it's going to be a tough day.  Final round, I just want to go have fun and enjoy every shot I hit the ball.   
 Q.  Now that you've already won a major, do you have a weight on your shoulders?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  Not really feel anything.  I'm not feeling overexcited like I did before.  But last hole I'm really excited because they moved the tee up, and I really want to hit it good, and I did.
