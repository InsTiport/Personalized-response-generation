Q. Tell me about when it started hurting yesterday?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After the round. I mean, I feel a little bit tight in the round yesterday, but it's okay. It's not too like painful. After the round, I started feeling pain. I feel a little bit tight, like second round, like almost last three holes, but I finish okay. After that, I rest and I start to hit the ball after I play yesterday, and then I hurt, so I stop. 
I went to putt and I can't bend like down, like a sharp pain just happened. And they have the physio Thai Doctor, they help me. Last night I feel no pain, because they tape everything. This morning, I start to hit the ball, start to feel pain.
