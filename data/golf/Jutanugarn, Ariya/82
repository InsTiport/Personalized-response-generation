 Q.  Can you just sum up your day for us?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I had pretty good day today.  I've been working, my game was pretty good today.   
 Q.  How did you find the golf course?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I play only 9 hole yesterday so I played back-9 so it's tough for me today because I didn't see front -- I see front-9 but didn't play front-9.   
 Q.  Earlier in the week you didn't play.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just my golf bag didn't come on Monday.   
 Q.  So you got your golf clubs on Tuesday?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tuesday.   
 Q.  So which 9 did you see yesterday?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I played back-9 yesterday.   
 Q.  Can you talk about the difficulty that you faced on the front-9 and maybe what was the hardest part about that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say course still pretty wet so pretty tough because we're not going to get much distance and pretty tough to hit the second shot on the green.  To me it's not much different between front-9 and the other one.   
 Q.  So you would have played 18 holes on Monday if your clubs were here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  I'm tired.  I might just play 9 holes even when my clubs were here.   
 Q.  When your clubs didn't show up, how did it affect you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm oh, good, so I can watch all day.   
 Q.  What did you watch?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thai drama.   
 Q.  Were you nervous today going into it, not having seen the whole thing?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  I can trust my caddy.   
 Q.  Tell us about your eagle on No. 6.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit 3-wood and hit 5-iron to the green and within five feet and make the putt.   
 Q.  Did your caddy get to walk all 18 holes?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hope so, yeah.  His job, I think.   
 Q.  What was on your second shot?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit 5-iron.   
 Q.  Did you find the golf course playing long?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty long some hole but some really long hole, moved the tee up so it's not that long.   
 Q.  Just checking, no driver, right?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.   
 Q.  You're on a nice roll, what's working for you on this roll?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going say I've been working on commitment.  It's pretty tough for me because I've been playing pretty good and my focus like I want to win and never win.  Kingsmill.  I really want to have good commitment things and I start working on that.   
 Q.  When you say commitment, what do you mean by that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say most of the time, you know, like before I get ready to do the shot, I try to think about like outcome so, of course, I want to hit it good.  I just thinking all I want to hit it close, miss right or anything.  But commitment to me mean like I'm just going to do what I want to do and that's it.  If I miss it, so what.   
 Q.  When is the last time you played a tournament without having seen the golf course in its entirety?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.  Maybe long time ago.   
 Q.  Maybe not as a pro?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  Thank you.
