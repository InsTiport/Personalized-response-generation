Q. Ariya, 68 here on day one of the AIG Women's British Open.  Take me through the day.  How would you describe your round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, because I have great memories here, so when I played I felt like I compared this year to three years ago, but actually the course is totally different.  We played almost like a different course, almost 500 or 600 longer than before.  It's pretty tough out there, but I'm pretty happy with my game today.
Q. Is this your first time back since you won in 2016?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it is my first major I won here, so it's just like all the great memories I have here, especially Pete on my bag, and this year he's on my bag, too.
Q. You've been playing great in recent weeks, top 5 finish in your last three starts.  What do you need to do this week to break through and get that first win of the year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I just need to keep having good commitment, have fun out there, because I'm laughing when I struggle a little bit to be happy on the course, but right now I'm getting much better at just keep doing the same stuff.
