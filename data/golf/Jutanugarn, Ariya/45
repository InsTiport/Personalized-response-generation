 Q.  How would you characterize that round, especially after the rough start?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It was pretty tough day today because it's really windy and it felt like the pin pretty hard today.  I have three bogey in a row first three holes.   
Just try to be patient, and I feel pretty good after make four birdie.   
 Q.  Was there something that maybe you said internally on the fourth tee after the rough start?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say after my first three I had pretty bad attitude.  I'm just like mad and like I'm not play anymore.   
After that I try to come back and just like be patient and try my best.  So just like be better commitment, so it's getting better.   
 Q.  12th hole, par-3.  What could you see back there from the tee, how close you were?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I can't see anything.  I hit 8-iron not that good.  Actually hit a little bit behind and end up pretty close.   
 Q.  Yeah.  You grazed the edge of the hole with it.  Almost like a perfect shot, right?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Your ball striking seemed to be on pointe.  Hit it tight on 9; hit it tight on 10.  What sort of turned things around with that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I just like too much worry in my front nine because I worry about like I bogey, especially after I make three bogey in a row.  So come back like my back nine just don't care about the outcome.  I'm just like, you know what?  If I have three more bogeys, so what.  Just play golf.   
 Q.  Now that you finish with the long birdie on 18, how do you feel about your position going into the weekend?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel great.  Not only I make birdie on the last hole, but I fight with like my back nine.  I very proud of my back nine.
