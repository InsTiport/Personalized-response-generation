 Q.  So first round of the year, are you pleased?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I'm so nervous.  I didn't play golf for so long.  I have a new caddie.  So everything is so new.  After a while, I realized I have to play golf.  So I'm getting better.   
 Q.  How did you and your caddie get along?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty good.  He did a good job.  He keeps me calm and really positive, really good attitude.   
 Q.  In this sort of a format, it doesn't appear -- it's supposed to be more relaxed.  I'm surprised you were more nervous.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Because I didn't play for so long, especially play with them, I feel upset.  He hit like 60 yards past me.  Every hole he has a chance to make eagle, and I thought, maybe I'm not that good.   
 Q.  Which one hit it 60 yards past you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, Josh.   
 Q.  Josh Beckett?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Now, did you know who they were prior to playing with them?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't know, but I know they are baseball players.  I know both of them are really famous.  And nobody asked me for an autograph.  They all asked them.   
 Q.  Really?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Asked them for autographs and pictures.  Nobody wants me.   
 Q.  Did you guys talk?  Did you talk to them while you were playing?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I talked to them -- what's his name?   
 Q.  Josh and Kevin.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Kevin is so nice.  He keeps talking to me the whole time.  He's so nice.   
 Q.  Sounds like a fun day.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So much fun, yeah.
