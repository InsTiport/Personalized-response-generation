 Q.  Talk us through the round and the highlights for you, especially that eagle on 18.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today my putting work pretty well so I make a lot the putt.  Yesterday I miss a lot fairway, but today much better with my tee shot.   
On 18 I have eagle so I hit 3-wood and I have like 220.  Hit 3-iron; have 15 feet and make a putt.   
 Q.  Did you and Moriya have some tactics for today?  Your sister is having a great round as well.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  Like yesterday I try to go to bed early because I have early tee time, so just try to rush her because she do everything so slow.   
 Q.  Conditions out there, just give us your thoughts on how the course is playing.  A little bit forgiving today?  Little bit easier?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I will say the greens are a little bit easier.  Like when you hit like stop easier, sooner.   
But it's just like hit really short.  I feel like it's so hard, but it's like shorter than yesterday.   
 Q.  Same for Sunday?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.   
 Q.  You've got the rest of the day.  What are you going to do?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course I going to have lunch, have some ice cream, and just rest.   
 Q.  You deserve it.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.   
 Q.  7-under, bogey-free round.  What kept you so consistent out there today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say like yesterday I miss a lot of fairway, so today is much better with my tee shot.  Also pretty lucky.  Made few long putts.   
 Q.  What kind of momentum does that give you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After I make eagle on No. 18 I feel much better.  Because after like 4-under, so I feel, okay, being maybe today is going to be good day.   
 Q.  Today you started at 1-under and were nine back of the leaders.  What kind of freedom does that give you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say that not think about the outcome at all.  Not pay attention with the leader.  Just want to go out and have fun and have good commitment.   
 Q.  How does not thinking about the outcome help your game?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel so free and not worried about the outcome at all.   
 Q.  How do you carry that feeling of freedom over into tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's very tough.  Of course very more tough.  But just have to work harder and try harder.   
 Q.  What made the difference today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say like first two round I miss lot tee shot.  Today is much better.  My iron is work pretty good and make few like long putt.   
 Q.  Did you feel like today given the weather forecast for tomorrow today had to be the low score?  (Indiscernible.)  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: What does that mean?   
 Q.  Tomorrow it's going to rain.  Do you feel like today was the day to get...  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say I'm not think about how the weather going to be.  I don't know like what's going to happen tomorrow.  All I know is I want to have feeling of free and go play golf.   
Because this course, like I feel like it's never fit my game.  I feel like so narrow, so tight, and I never play well here.  So one of my goal is just like want to play my best possible.   
 Q.  What kind of score do you think you'll need to shoot tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't need to shoot anything.  I just want to go out and have fun and have good commitment.  We'll see.   
 Q.  Do you like to come from the back?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm pretty far back, so I don't care.  Just whatever.
