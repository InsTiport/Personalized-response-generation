 Q.  How happy were you with that round?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel pretty good today because I hit my tee shot pretty good, and I was calm on every shot, so I feel good.   
 Q.  How are you feeling particularly after (Inaudible), are there any lingering issues?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I know what's wrong.  So I know I hurt my knee, so that's why I didn't play very good on the third round.  And after the draw I just felt okay.  I just had to rest and take care of my knee.  So after that I feel like just play golf, and it didn't feel like anything changed.   
 Q.  Was there any thought of skipping this week to get another week of rest?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm thinking about that.  After to withdraw, but I feel like I'm okay.  I wanted to see how I'm feeling.  But after that, like on Monday, it didn't hurt that much and today it's getting a lot better.   
 Q.  What's your comfort level on this course now?  You've seen it a few times and does it suit your game?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Honestly, I don't think it's like so good, my game.  Because to me it's a little bit narrow and I can't hit my driver.  But right now I feel more confident because I can hit my iron on the fairway and my 3-wood on the fairway.   
 Q.  Is it a long day for you?  How are you holding up?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not too bad.  I mean, I had fun with Stacy, so I didn't feel like it was that long of a day.   
 Q.  What, besides the physical part, like the knee, obviously you were looking forward to the Olympics for a long time and having to withdraw, how did you put that behind you emotionally?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm really disappointed withdrawing from the Olympics, but after that I felt like I have a good future, I hope.  And you know, like Japan, we have 2020 Olympics, so I'm just looking forward to that.   
 Q.  It's been two years, I know, since you won the Canadian Amateur.  Do you remember much about that?  No, nothing at all?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, I know I won the Canadian Open, but I think it's like four years ago.   
 Q.  That's a good sign.  That means you've been winning a lot since then.  How do you feel now being four shots ahead?  I mean, it could change, but how do you feel heading into the weekend?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel good, but I didn't honestly, I don't really care about who is leading and leading.  I just feel like I want to have fun and happy on the course.   
 Q.  To go out there and hit irons off the tee.  Would you have done that a few years ago?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I started to do that last year, yeah, at the end of last year.   
 Q.  Is that just realizing that you were getting yourself into more trouble than you needed to be?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Sometimes I feel more confident with my irons.  So I feel like this one I've got to make sure it's on the fairway so it's good enough for me.   
 Q.  How many drivers have you hit?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't bring my driver out, so only 3-wood and 2-iron.   
 Q.  You were playing behind the group that Brooke Henderson was in.  Did you see the following?  Was that good to see?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It was great.  It was great to see all the people support Brooke in her hometown.   
 Q.  Are you carrying a driver?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.   
 Q.  You don't even have one?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, not this week.  I mean, some weeks I use my driver if it's wide enough and if I need the distance, but this week I don't need that.   
 Q.  Did you put an extra wedge in?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Normally if I'm not going to bring my driver, I'm going to have 4-iron and 3-iron, so I bring my 4-iron in.   
 Q.  Does it feel like the course suits your game very well?  Do you feel more comfortable there?  Is it starting to suit your eye a little bit more?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel better.  I have more confidence to just stick with my game.
