 Q.  5-under today, what was the key?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I hit a lot of good shots today, especially front nine, but I just missed some putts.  Back nine I just start to make some putts and that's the key.   
 Q.  With the new course, actually playing it for the first time in tournament competition, what were your thoughts on it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think the course pretty challenge, like some holes pretty hard to get up-and-down, and the green is really firm to stop the ball.  Even like rain already today.   
 Q.  What do you think the key is going to be for the rest of the week?  A lot of pretty low scores out there so far and a lot of players bunched near the top of the leaderboard.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think this course, we mostly rely on putting, because it's pretty wide open, so we can hit the ball in the fairway.  So I think it's going to be like, the key is going to be on the putting on the green.   
 Q.  And how is the course playing from the fact it's very new; are you liking it compared to the Serapong?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I like both.  I think it's just different challenge.  Like old one is pretty tight and really hard, but this one is wide open and greens are firm.   
 Q.  Is there any particular hole that stands out today as one that got you going, your best hole?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No. 12, because that hole I feel like is a pretty hard hole, and I made birdie today.   
 Q.  And 18, that must have been great to finish.  What was your worst, bad hole today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Bad hole, I don't have bad holes.  I just have some bogeys.  Doesn't mean it's a bad hole.   
 Q.  Tell me about the bogey.  What happened?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Don't really remember, sorry.   
 Q.  Which one is most difficult hole do you think?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think No. 12 and No. 8.
