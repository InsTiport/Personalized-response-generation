Q. How was your week?  Take us through it.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I had a pretty good week because it's pretty tough conditions.  Of course,  I didn't feel great with my game right now.  So after the week, I feel better, and I feel pretty happy about how I finished this week.
Q. The last two days, in your mind, probably much better than the first two, right?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, it is.  Actually, I feel I'm getting better every day.  Like start after the first round because kind of not really have good commitment with my iron and my tee shot.  I feel a little bit something with my screen, but last few days, I feel a lot better.
Q. As the winner from last year, how was your reception here in Charleston?  How were you received?  Did people greet you well, the fans and all?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, of course.  I love to be here.  I love all the USGA stuff because they always treat me the best.  When I won't last year or when I start to play first time here when I was 13, it's nothing different.  They did great job.  They worked hard for us, and they're the best.
Q. The course, did you like it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like it, but maybe the golf course not really like me.
Q. See you next year.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.  Thank you.
