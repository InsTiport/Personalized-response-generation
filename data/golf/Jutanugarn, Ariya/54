 Q.  So your eagle.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What was that like?  You said you didn't see it.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, because like a little bit slope, so I have like 153 downwind and the light wasn't good.  It was like in divot - not in divot, but divot here my ball just like sit up.   
So I hit it and I didn't it hit good so I thought it was going to be short.  I didn't know it was make it until I walk to the hole.   
 Q.  Because you still had the putter in your hand.  You were like ready to go putt.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, yeah.   
 Q.  How do you feel after two days?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel good.  I mean, I didn't have a good front nine, but had pretty good start.  My back nine is pretty good.  Just try to come back, like feel more confident after I make the putt.   
 Q.  Does what make you feel better that even though you had not a good start, that you're still able to bring it back together?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, feel good because I'm actually like fight for it.  Because like my front nine I just lost it.  I didn't try to do anything.  But my back nine I'm just like I'm just going to try hard and I did.   
 Q.  Very cool.  Is that something you think you're getting better after over time?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I think my front nine I was just thinking about I want to play good.  After I make eagle so feel I should make more birdies, so I didn't focus on like what shouldn't focus on.   
 Q.  But being an experienced player, is something that...  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't have experience.   
 Q.  Yeah, you're very experienced.  So you're more comfortable when you're not playing well, more comfortable knowing that...  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, yes.  (Plane interference.)  Because like every time when I have bad hole or have a bad shot, I know it's not the end of the world.  I just keep doing my routine and I focus on the thing I can control.
