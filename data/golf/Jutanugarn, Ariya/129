THE MODERATOR: Everyone, we had now like to welcome Ariya Jutanugarn, winner of the 2016 Rolex Player of the Year award and also the Race to the CME Globe.  What a year.  How are you feeling right now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I'm really excited.  I mean, I never think I can win like this trophy and CME.  You know, I really happy about that.
THE MODERATOR: We talked a little bit earlier this week about the turnaround after the ANA earlier this year.  Looking further back, last year you went through a stretch of ten straight missed cuts.
Now you come out this year and have the type of year you had.  What was really the key for you of turning all of this around and being able to have such a fantastic year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know even like last year I miss like ten cut in a row, but I feel really appreciate it.  Because if that thing not happen I'm not going to win all this stuff this year.
This year just like try my best, so I am not really worry about in the past.  Try to be focus on positive thing, not think about all like bad thing.
THE MODERATOR: I know earlier in the week you also said that the Player of the Year honor was the most important for you.  What does it mean now to put your name next to you will these legendary players that have won this award?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's great.  It's like my dream come true.  I never think like my name can be in this trophy, and right now I'm really proud myself.
THE MODERATOR: Okay.  And the burning question for everybody:  $1 million, what's the first thing you'll buy with it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know yet, but we plan going to Disney World next week, so maybe can spend a little bit with that.
THE MODERATOR: I heard it's a birthday celebration, right?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Wednesday, yep.
THE MODERATOR: You already got a few birthday gifts.  Now what are you going to get some of your family with the money?  Are you going to spend some money on Mo?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Maybe a little bit with Mo, but like a lot with my mom, yeah.
THE MODERATOR: Questions.
Q. After Friday Lydia lead you by 8 shots and you said, She's going to win everything.  Saturday you were both tied.  What were you thinking after that?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After Saturday I just feel more like a lot more confident because I shot like 7-under.  Before this round I feel like it's pretty good chance for me to win the Player of the Year.
Before this round I just feel, Okay, just do my best.  Like whatever going to happen, I just going to be really happy about that.
Q. And how did you recover today after you had bogeys on two of your first three holes?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: When I got bogey I'm not really feel anything, because I just missed for like three-foot putts like twice.  So I not really worry about that.  I just keep playing my own game.
THE MODERATOR: Another stat, you finish now with the most birdies in a single season by any LPGA player.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Because I play a lot of tournament.
THE MODERATOR: You did play a lot of tournaments, but you also were making a lot of birdies.  What do you think that says about your game?  Is it a lot to say that you kind of are aggressive?  You're not afraid to go for it.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't feel I'm play aggressive golf this year.  I mean, no driver, and today I'm not even one 3-wood.  Only 2-iron and 3-iron around.  So maybe I'm aggressive sometime.  I don't know.
THE MODERATOR: Whatever you're doing, it's working out pretty well for you.
Any other questions?
Q. Did this week feel like a major to you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hmm, I didn't feel like it's major, but I feel like this week is really, really special for me.  Because before this week I'm really nervous, to be honest.  I'm really nervous.  I keep calling my psychology, like, I can't do this.  Even like before this round I'm like, What should I do?
But it's pretty hard for me this week.  Like I never have this feeling before.
Q. And you became the first player from Thailand to win an LPGA event, then win a major.  What do you think being Player of the Year will do for your country?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, of course especially after winning, everything I want to bring to the Thai people.  Right now I really proud of myself I can do that, especially with Player of the Year.
Q. You spoke about confidence and about being nervous.  Most people can't hit a 2-iron to save their lives, but driver you can get in the air.  You are exactly the opposite.  When will we see the driver?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: When?
Q. When?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Next year.
Q. Next year driver is coming out?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Some tournament.  (Laughter.)  I going to try harder to bring my driver out, yeah.
Q. For those of us who have not been to Thailand, how would you describe your fame in Thailand now?  How famous are you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: How famous?
Q. In Thailand.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't think I'm that famous.  I think all the golf are might know me.  Yep.
THE MODERATOR: Do you think after Player of the Year, exposure in the Olympics, golf will continue to grow in your country and it might help elevate?  We've seen a lot of Thai players already come out on tour.  Do you think that number will continue to grow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.  Especially right now.  I mean, you have already how many lady golf in Thai, and they going out like pretty good.  They are such a great golfer.
I'm pretty sure going to be a lot more Thai player on tour.
Q. What's been your favorite moment of this season?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Going to be my first win on tour, that tournament.
THE MODERATOR: I saw earlier you had a little good luck charm sitting in the back of the room.  I heard she was there to watch you win in Alabama and she that was following you around.  What does it mean to have her?  Was she your good luck charm?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, of course.  I saw her, and like today she show up and I won money Player of the Year.  Of course I hope she goes every week, every tournament next year.
Q. On Sunday night at ANA after that tough afternoon, could you have imagined sitting here in this type situation now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not at all.  Never.  I mean being to be honest, after ANA I feel like maybe I'm good enough to win the tournament, but I never expect I'm going to be in this position today.
THE MODERATOR: That's been a pretty special 2016.  Now you get to take this nice money box with you and these trophies and go enjoy Disney World and celebrate your birthday.  We now have to remind ourselves you'll be 21.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel old.
THE MODERATOR: Oh, so old.  Enjoy every moment.  Off-season.  Thank you for putting on such a great show for us in 2016.  We look for more great things coming from you in 2017.  Congratulations.  (Applause).
