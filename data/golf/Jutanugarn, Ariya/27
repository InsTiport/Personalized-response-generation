 Q.  You've had some pretty good results in Hawaii.  Anything in particular you really like about this place?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just love to be here.  I love the place here and actually I love the course even the course really windy.  Just feel more challenge and you have to be more patient, and I love that.   
 Q.  Seemed like today no one was able to go out and get anything going.  How difficult was it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It was tough, especially today really, really windy, more than first three rounds, so it's pretty tough.   
 Q.  How do you feel about the way you just finished out?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Okay.  I had double last hole, but it's okay.   
 Q.  Game right now?  I know you were No. 1 for a while and now you're getting some good finishes.  How do you feel about where you're at right now?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel pretty good.  Feel like everything getting better.  (Indiscernible) last few month because like thinking about like the outcome too much, so right now it's getting a lot better.   
 Q.  Did you fly here straight from Augusta?  Because you were in Augusta?

 Q.  You got to caddie, right?  Hit one shot on the par-3?  What was it like to be there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually that my second time so not excited but not nervous like last time, because last time I was like so nervous.  So three of us hit the same time, so so much fun.  Great experience for me.
