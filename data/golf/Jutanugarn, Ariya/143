THE MODERATOR: Ariya, what was the key to your strong play this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Especially this week, I mean, because I just come back from like injury, like my knee hurt, and I feel like I really want to be happy on the course.  I really want to have fun with my caddie on the course.  That's the only key I want to be.
THE MODERATOR: When did your knee start feeling better to where you felt like you could play this week and play well?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually after I withdraw, I feel like I'm going to withdraw this week because my knee hurt so bad last week, but when I got here on Monday and Tuesday, it's getting a lot better, and first round of the tournament it's fine.
Q. Last year at this time, I think you had missed like 10 cuts in a row at one time, and we know that you had the shoulder injury in 2013.  Can you just talk about how hard it was to get through that and how much work it took to get your game back to a level that it was when you first turned pro?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: To me, I think it's really, really hard because like when I start to miss first cut and I missed like 10 cuts in a row, and I just feel like at that time, the only focus, I'm scared to miss the cut.  I really want to make the cut.  But after that I feel like I changed my focus, so right now my focus is like what's going to be good, like what I have to do to be good, so I'm thinking about like what is under my control, not thinking about like anything else.
Q. You mentioned the knee injury obviously that you had this year, but then going back to the shoulder injury, how long did that actually take to feel perfectly normal, that shoulder that you hurt in 2013?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think it took me almost -- I think it's like a year like to get normal.
Q. If you go back to May when this kind of roll started, to have won like five of your last ten events now, what's gone so right for you over that four-month stretch?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After I won my first tournament, after that, I feel like I reached my goal, and after that I feel like I don't care like what my ranking going to be.  I don't care if I'm going to win the tournament or not.  The only thing I want to be is I really want to be happy on the course.  That's the only key I want to be right now.
Q. Can you describe what that does for your golf game when you're not thinking about the ranking, you're not thinking about making the cut or whatever maybe was on your mind before?  Can you describe how that translates into your golf game?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Because like before when I'm thinking about making the cut, I want to win, I want to finish top 10, everything is getting worse.  It's never getting better.  I just changed my focus to be like -- like to be honest to myself.  I just really want to be happy on the course.  That's all I need.
Q. We've talked so much here the past few weeks about the impact Brooke Henderson is having on young girls in Canada and young golfers, period.  What impact do you hope that you might be having in Thailand?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I got inspired from my sister, from Pornanong, they play on Tour like before me, and I just hope I can inspire somebody when they look up and they know like some Thai people can win the tournament.
Q. Going back to your mental approach of trying to be happy out there, what inspired that?  Who have you been working with to kind of get that mindset for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I work with like Vision 54, so they helped me a lot.  After I win like three tournaments in a row, I really strayed.  I feel like a lot of expectations.  A lot of fans really want to see me do good, play good.  But I figured out what is the main thing for me to be happy on the course, and that's the key.  That's a big key for me.
THE MODERATOR: We appreciate the time.  Congratulations again.
