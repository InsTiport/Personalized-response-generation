 Q.  So 1-over through 10 holes, but then you turned it on.  Did you give yourself a pep talk at the turn?  What was going on there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, actually I shot it pretty good, but I just missed a lot of putts.  Actually back nine my putting was getting better, so just have to make a few more putts.   
 Q.  Was it long ones your putting was off or did you just miss a couple short ones?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually front nine I missed some short and back nine I made some short putts.   
 Q.  Coming into this week, how did you feel?  You hadn't had great finishes in the past two weeks, but what were your expectations this week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I got more confident because I know what I had to work on from last week.  Because last week and the week before I just can't putt.  I missed like every single putt, and this week I just know what I have to work on and my putting's getting better.   
 Q.  What are you working on in your putting?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually more like my speed and little bit my stroke.   
 Q.  Is there something specific that you're doing?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I just have the same problem for a long time, so just keep working on it.   
 Q.  How much do you like this golf course?  Does it suit your game do you think?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I like it.  This week I didn't bring my driver, so only 3-wood, and 2-iron, it makes me feel good because I can hit the fairway easier than I hit driver.   
 Q.  So you said you didn't bring your driver?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No (laughing).   
 Q.  Are you playing with 13 clubs?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, actually I added a 4-iron.  So I have 14 clubs.   
 Q.  Interesting.  Have you ever done that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I do that a lot.  Yes, because some courses the fairway is pretty narrow and I don't need to hit my driver, so I just bring my 3-wood.   
 Q.  You don't even want to tempt yourself.  Good for you.  For a major like this week, did you have any added pressure, added expectations to try to treat it like a normal week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, no, I just want to do my best and have fun.   
 Q.  Huge week for finishing for International Crown qualifying.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Crown, we made it, right?   
 Q.  You guys are in.  You guys are in as of now.  But to finish high in the rankings, is that something you guys have been still talking about?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, not right now.  I mean, we talked about that before because we're really excited.  We really want to beat the top eight, and before we were just like seven or eight.  So we worked hard before.  But right now we don't want to move up.  We're fine with right now.   
 Q.  You don't want to jinx anything?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.   
 Q.  You did the work, and now you're up and you're safe?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.   
 Q.  Expectations for tomorrow, just keep the putting going?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, just work a little bit with my putting and everything's good.
