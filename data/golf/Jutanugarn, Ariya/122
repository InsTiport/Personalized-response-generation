Q. Another good round today.  Can you talk me through how it went on the front nine?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: On the front nine, I hit very good on the front nine and I made some putts.  Just back nine I didn't make the putts like front nine.
Q. But when it went a little bit wrong on the back nine, you brought it back by birdieing each time.  How did you stay calm and how did you turn it around?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: When I had bogey, it was just like miss some shots, so not really worry about that.  It was just like try to commit with the other shots.
Q. Did you miss putts or was it driving?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: On 12 I missed second shot, ten feet and missed the putt.
Q. The birdie on the last, how good was that to get your momentum back?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not really feel like I lost momentum, because I know I just missed the shot and I just tried to come back and commit to the shot.
Q. You're still in a very strong position for tomorrow.  Are you going to go work on anything now, or what are you going to do now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to hit some balls and work some on putting.
Q. Been a long day with the rain delay.  What did you do?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I eat.  Actually I eat too much.  Food is too good, so I eat too much.
