 Q.  Ariya, great round today.  What was going right for you out there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, today I have very good start, start to make some putt and (indiscernible) three bogey; not really good.   
But I have so much fun, and like last four holes amazing for me.   
 Q.  Speaking of fun, that eagle on 18 was magnificent.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, like before tee off I just really want to make birdie because I haven't make birdie for two round already.   
 Q.  Was it nice playing alongside Pornanong and having another Thai in the group and so much support from the crowd?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: We had great fun today.  I mean, I have so much fun, especially play with Pornanong.  Like she play good today, and play in front of all the fan in Thailand is a lot of fun for me.   
 Q.  There is a very real chance -- we thought it was going to be an all-Korda final; it might be an all-Jutanugarn final.  How much fun would that be?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, we just going to have to wait and see what's going to happen.   
 Q.  Spectacular third round.  65 capped with an awesome eagle at No. 18.  Quite a roar there.  What does it feel like for you right now?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel great.  I didn't expect to have like eagle and like last three birdie at all.   
 Q.  You have so much support out there.  Playing with Pornanong, playing all home.  What's it like hearing all the love for you going on out here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel grit.  I mean, before I tee off today I'm like, Oh, I play with Pornanong.  Going to be lots of fan come support us.   
And obviously shoot 7-under is great for me.   
 Q.  Your sister playing well as well.  The Korda sisters are playing well.  What's up with the sisters here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, she keep playing well since lasts year, so to me it's not surprise.  I know she's going to keep playing good.   
 Q.  What if you get paired up with her tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's going to be good.  I know we going to have fun.  Especially I think we not going to fight, so that's good.
