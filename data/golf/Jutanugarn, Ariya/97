 Q.  Remind me where you finished today.  What was your score?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 4-under.   
 Q.  4-under.  Good way to start the tournament.  How did you feel coming off the golf course?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel great.  I did my best every shot, and especially I have very, very good start.  I'm quite surprised.  I never didn't expect anything.   
 Q.  Tell me about the eagle on No. 1.  Both you and Lexi eagled it.  That's got to be fun.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  For two hole our group have like maybe 8-under.  I'm like, Wow, have so much fun.   
I hit 3-wood right in the fairway and hit second shot 4-iron and make the putt.   
 Q.  What's it like playing in front of these fans?  They always turn out for you here, but it's got to be such a good feeling.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's great for me.  I have so much fun playing in front of them.  They give me the best support ever ask for.   
 Q.  Do you have any tips for people like me who don't like this heat?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just stay in the clubhouse.   
 Q.  I like that one.  Stay in the shade.  Do you think about the water you drink, Gatorade, anything like that?  What do you do?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have to drink lots of water of course.
