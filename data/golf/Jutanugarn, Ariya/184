ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Just come back from like surgery so take like nine month off, so it's hard to come back.   Just really want have fun this week and do my best.   
MODERATOR:   How hard was it not being able to play?   Give us a timeline of having the surgery.   How long did you not swing a club for?

MODERATOR:   How hard was it to sit back?   Was it nice to have a break or hard?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   It's hard.   You feel like very nice I can have a break and can do everything I want to do I never do before.   It's fun, but still like boring.   Nothing to do.   Cannot play golf.   So fitness, rehab, that's it.  
MODERATOR:   Awesome.   Talk about the International Crown.   I'll start with you.   How long have you guys known each other?   
PORNANONG PHATLUM:   We know long time.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Ten years.   I know her but she not know me.   Actually we know each other kind of like on news or something.   Because she was turning pro early, so we like see...  
MODERATOR:   So you watched her turn pro and you kind of aspired to be her?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah.  
MODERATOR:   Obviously you get questions about the Crown all the time and you guys are being picked to be the dark horses.   Have you talked about who will play with each other, any of that stuff?   
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know what, it's really exciting to answer about like the Crown International, I mean answer the question, because a lot people ask me like, How do they do, and I'm like, You know what?   I'm not sure.  
Yeah, like we just four of us in the team, and we just like ‑‑ one day I just sit down and talk with my sister, and it's like, Who going to be a captain?   Just like thinking about that.   Maybe her.   
MODERATOR:   You don't need a captain, but you can chose one if you want.  
MORIYA JUTANUGARN:   Nothing just like talk.   I think it's pretty fun because we going to sit down like four of us and kind of like mix up what you going to do.  
MODERATOR:   And you guys all get along very well.   No cattiness.   You think that will help because you're all so laid back?   You're carefree.   Don't get too nervous or caught up with anything.   You're very friendly.   You think that will help?

But everybody kind of like, You do it, and it's like, Yeah, you.   Something like that.  
MODERATOR:   Okay.   I get it.   So this week you're all very familiar with this course.   What do you think about the conditions?   What's the key to playing well?   
PLAYER:   I think the key is going to be approach shot and putting.   The fairway is not really narrow and the course is not really long, so just play, hit it.   I think the putting and the approach shot going to be key.   
MODERATOR:   You guys?   Same?
