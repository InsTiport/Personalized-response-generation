Q. How was your day out there and how did things go?  Rough finish with that lip out?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Especially today, lip out probably five time, I think.
Q. You had a little struggle there in the middle of the round, consecutive bogeys.  Can you talk about getting it back and trying to stay positive during that time?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, I try so hard to stay really positive today because is very tough condition today and it's major.  So when I just miss a little bit it feel like I miss a lot.  And just be patient, especially this course I have to be really patient.
Q. Have you felt calm this week knowing what you're potentially shooting for, a fourth straight win?  Have you felt calm?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, it is scary, it is a really hard course.  I just have to play my game.  I have to focus on my game.
Q. What was tough about the conditions out there today compared to yesterday?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel like yesterday is more tough.
Q. You spoke about working on confidence with your clubs, getting the irons more confident.  Did you feel that today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  I work a little bit yesterday, but I didn't get better, but have to work more today.
Q. Are you aware of when you hit that 2-iron off the tee so nice, so long, so straight, that a lot of the fans ooh and aah?  Do you hear them?  They're getting a kick out of that shot you hit.  They don't see that from every player.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
