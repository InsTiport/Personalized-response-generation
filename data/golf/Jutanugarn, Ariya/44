Q. Ariya, got off to a good start.  The rest of the round was kind of average.  What would you have to say about the round today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I didn't hit good shot in like front nine because I miss a lot like tee shot, but overall pretty about.
Because like I try hard to just like, you know, hit the ball in the fairway, and back nine is getting a lot better.
Q. How much did the changing weather conditions, the wind, change thing a little bit on the back side?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually the wind start to pick up only last few holes, so it's help actually because like downwind, so easier.
Q. So how much do you have to work on going into tomorrow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have to work on a lot, you know, because I still like some shot I worry, didn't commit.  I have to work on a lot.
Q. Are you looking at the scoreboards at all today assessing your lead with the Globe?
