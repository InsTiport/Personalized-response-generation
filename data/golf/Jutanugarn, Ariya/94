 Q.  So 4-under round.  Pretty steady.  Bogey there at the end, but overall a pretty good round for you.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's pretty good.  I had so much fun.  I haven't played with Jess for a long time, and really see some amazing shot from here.   
I hit pretty good feel-good shot today.   
 Q.  What's it like playing out here?  Great crowds, great weather.  What's it like being our here at this event?  It's a fun event.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I have great memory here, so I love this event.  You know, like all the people come support all the players, especially like American.  It's so much fun.   
 Q.  Any particular moments on the golf course that stood out today that you thought you played particularly well?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I start on back nine and I have three birdie in a row.  Pretty good start.   
 Q.  Tell me about those birdies.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, No. 10 I hit second shot like 15 feet and make a putt.   
11 I hit second shot in bunker and I have pretty good (indiscernible) there.   
Then I made very long putt on 12, maybe like 40 feet.   
 Q.  Oh, nice.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yep.   
 Q.  Were you out here early working with Pia and Lynn?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.   
 Q.  What are those experiences like for you?  I know you came back from Singapore, went to L.A., and then came here.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I was really tired after Singapore, and when I got here I'm just like ready start everything.  You know, practice with like more quality.   
I just been working on the same stuff with them and they been helping me.   
 Q.  Do you do drills with them?  Is it mental?  Is it physical?  Al of the above?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say it's more like work on my commitment.  Because like sometime I lost it.  I'm not really have a good commit.  They just help me to be able to have a good commit.   
And like what I been working hard on is just like same like in the beginning of the year.   
 Q.  Do you go into those sessions with any specific goals?  Do you sit down and talk with them?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I sit down and talk with them.  Mainly we just like -- because sometime I want to play good; I want to go out and finish good.   
Sometime when I focus with the outcome it's not help me, so they just help me to focus on the thing in control and don't think about the outcome at all.
