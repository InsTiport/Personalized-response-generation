Q. A solid round of golf?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, a really great start.  I have like two birdies my first two, and also missed from three feet on another hole but overall was pretty good, even though I have not really about back nine today.
Q. What was the difference on the back nine compared to the front nine?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I miss a few shots, especially irons.  So I'm going to have like really long putts.
Q. It is playing pretty long, the course, out there, but looks like the greens are receptive and it seems like a good scoring course for you.  Do you feel you're in a really good position heading into the weekend?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.  Like how I played today, have like that good round, 2-under, so I'm really happy about that.  Even though the greens pretty soft, but still tough because we have like 5-iron into the green.
Q. You know this course very well and had success here.  Have you been remembering moments as you've been walking around this year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.  The first day I got here, bring all the great memory here because I won my first major here.  The course, same course, but totally different golf course because it plays a lot longer than before.
Q. How special would it be to do that again?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I can't think about that yet.  Lots of golf still coming, so just have to do my best.
