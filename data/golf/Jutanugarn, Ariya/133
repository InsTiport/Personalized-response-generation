 Q.  You've gotten better every single day.  What was key to the 6-under round today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think today I just try to focus shot by shot, not think about outcome and not think about like too much future.   
 Q.  What about tomorrow?  As you get ready to win your sixth title of the year, how will you stay calm?  How will you control those emotions?  You've been here plenty of times before.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm ready to have fun and be happy on the course.  I don't know I can win or not, but I'm going to do my best.   
 Q.  What's your key to being happy out there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Enjoy with every single shot I have chance to hit.   
 Q.  What was so good today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, just didn't putt good like last few days, and today my putting working pretty good.   
 Q.  Were you feeling any sort of the pressure after Thursday to sort of the step on the gas and score a little bit more?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't feel pressure at all.  I just try to do my best and have fun on the course.   
 Q.  You had a great round yesterday; when you saw Lydia's round, did that spur you to go a little bit lower today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  I mean, I know she's a great golfer and she can do like anything.  She just like 10-under.  Two day in a row she can do, too.
