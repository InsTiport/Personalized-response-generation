Q. Was it maybe a little easier the second time?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, a lot easier.  I didn't get nervous.  I didn't get excited until the last putt.
Q. And on the last putt, was it the same emotions as you had two weeks ago?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  Actually a little bit harder because the lie and a little bit longer.
Q. What do you think, with the Olympics coming up and now you being the first player from Thailand to win in back-to-back fashion, what do you think this will do for golf in Thailand?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think right now we have a lot of players like starting to play golf, a lot of juniors, and if I can inspire somebody, it's really great, and I hope a lot of players come here on the LPGA, as well.
