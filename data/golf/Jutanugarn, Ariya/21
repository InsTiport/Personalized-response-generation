Q. Tell us how you played today.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hits it good.  Hit lot of good shot today.  I hit my driver twice today.  Pretty good.
Q. Driver twice.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Made bogey.
Q. First time you had driver this year.  Which holes?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Par 5 on back-9, both hole.
Q. How did you play (inaudible)
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually on 11 I shouldn't have hit driver.  Had to keep it low under the tree, hit the tree, I had 180.  Hit pretty good shot, 3-putt bogey and another hole I hit 15 -- I -- I hit on that hole.  Par 5?  Yeah, hit on that hole.  I hit pretty good.  Leave it right in the rough.
Q. How far did you have in the rough?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Second shot?  260.
Q. Does that mean you won't hit driver anymore?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I feel good.  I feel like hit pretty good.  Just fairways are too narrow for me.  I still like it.
Q. Does it seem like the par-5s are too long?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Little bit long but you know like today on No. 7 is downwind so I hit 3-wood.
Q. Did you make birdie?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.
Q. Congratulations.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: That you.
Q. Did you like this course the first time you played it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say I like it because I feel like I don't have to think, I just get up, hit 3-wood.  Hit it hard.  Because like at least -- on two hole I have to hit 2-iron and actually even that hole I still can hit my 3-wood.
Q. (Inaudible)
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, I am.
Q. You like 2 and 3-iron so much, is that part of the difficulty in deciding whether to play the driver?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It is but I think it's easy for me, this course, because I'm always hit 3-wood.  I don't really need to hit 3-iron.  I don't need to hit 3-iron at all.  To me like 3-iron I'm not going to use it anyway.
Q. Is the driver staying in or coming out?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tomorrow?  Don't know yet.
Q. How would you describe your style of play out there today, do you feel like you were aggressive or how would you describe it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I wasn't aggressive.  This course you can't be aggressive.  You have to be patient.  1-over like last four hole, still 1-over.  Just need to be patient, just make three birdie in last four hole.  Didn't expect to make birdie because of tough condition today.
Q. How did you make (inaudible)
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Par 5, 7 --
Q. 3-wood, 4-iron?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No. 6 I hit 2-iron on the tee.  Have 109 to the pin.  Hit like one foot, made the putt for birdie and last hole missed my second shot by 20 feet and make a putt.
Q. No. 8?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 9-iron right, almost water.
Q. How would you sum up your year so far, how do you feel about it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Okay.  I mean I know the outcome is not the way I want to be but I still want to improve myself and I learn so much and right now I feel like I feel much better because last few months all I thinking is just like outcome, I want to play well.
Right now I will say I want to have good commitment and I just want to go out there and feel free.
Q. Is this a fairer test that the Women's Open?  Is this golf course stronger than Charleston?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like this one better.  U.S. Open was pretty tough.
