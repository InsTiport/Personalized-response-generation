 Q.  You really came home strong today.  You've got to be happy with the way you finished off that under round.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I'm pretty happy about my game today.  It's really windy and so tough out there today.   
 Q.  How difficult was it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So tough.  I mean, I feel like every shot, like tee shot, second shot to the green, you have to play with the wind.  Sometime I just forgot.   
 Q.  You also have a driving iron in your bag.  Do you feel like when it gets windy that's a real advantage for you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It is sometime because when I want to keep the ball low I be able to do it.   
 Q.  It's getting towards the end of the season.  How are your energy stores and how are you staying fresh?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel pretty good.  You know, I have one week off before.  Right now I feel pretty good.  Just like focus on the same thing:  just keep improve my game.   
 Q.  When it gets windy like this they always say it's a mental game out there.  How would you rate yourself today between the ears?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I felt I didn't did a good job.  You know, sometime I feel I want to make birdie but I just have to be patient.
