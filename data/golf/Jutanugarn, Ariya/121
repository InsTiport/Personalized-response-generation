Q. You did all you could do out there to catch Inbee.  You must be delighted with how it went this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm really happy about my game, especially this week, and today, like I had so much fun.  You know, I have so much fun playing with Inbee.  She's awesome.  She's the best player.
Q. What will you learn from Inbee today?  Because like you say, everybody watches her and goes, oh, my goodness, what a silky, smooth swing, and she seems to sink every putt.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I learned a lot from her.  She's very calm.  I feel like she makes every putt.  I think she not miss one putt today.
Q. You are working with Gary Gilchrist; how often do you get to see your coach and what do you work on when you do see him?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to see him during my week off and in the off-season most of the time.  We work on same stuff last year, so my hip turn too fast, so he gave some drills to work with that.
Q. As you were saying all week, your ball-striking has been phenomenal and probably thanks to Gary Gilchrist; how would you rate your putting?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually my putting get a lot better today.  I feel a lot better.  I feel a lot more confident.
Q. And that accounts for your tremendous score today.  Finally, what is next for you?  Where will you go next?  You've got a couple of weeks off; what will you do?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to go back to Thailand for one day.  I'm going to leave Tuesday to L.A.
