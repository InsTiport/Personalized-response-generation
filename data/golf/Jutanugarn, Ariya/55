 Q.  Ariya, how enjoyable was that round out there today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I did enjoy it.  I have so much fun because the weather is -- out there it's getting windy, so I didn't expect anything.   
 Q.  You played beautifully?  You have to explain to us.  We see you hit some shots and you take your hand off the club on the way through.  Many of us think, Oh, no, she's hit a bad shot, but you stripped it down the middle.  Tell us what's going on there.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I did it a lot.  I thought I missed it, but it was pretty good.   
 Q.  Rooming this week with your sister, Moriya, who says you might be one of the best golfers in the world, but you're a bit messy in the bedroom.

 Q.  You're known for your long game.  When you look at your stats, it's your putting.  You are No. 1 in putts per green in regulation.  What's been the big improvement in your putting?

 Q.  (Regarding the difference playing Blue Bay and in Shanghai.)  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, when I play in Blue Bay I haven't went out so I don't really know how the city is, but when I'm here I went out every day.
