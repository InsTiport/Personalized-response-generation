  Q. Ariya, 1-under 70 on Cypress Creek.  How would you assess your round out there today?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Actually I hit a lot of good shots.  Actually I hit a lot of good shots, but my putting is not working well today and yesterday, also.  I've been trying to work on it, but it's not getting better yet.
 Q. Is there one part of the putting?  Is it the speed?  Is it the line?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   I would say my speed is not that good, and also I felt like my ball didn't start on line that much.
 Q. Even though you're not putting that well, you're striking the ball well.  Do you feel like you're in position to make a run this weekend?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah, I'm really happy about my game right now, even though I don't feel like my putting is working well, but just have to keep working on it.
