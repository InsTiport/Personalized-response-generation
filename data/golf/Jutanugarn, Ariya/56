Q. Great round by you today.  Maybe not the best of starts but six birdies after the turn, what was working for you there?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I think I didn't worry about the outcome.  I wanted to play well because I feel that I'm in a good position, and then when I turned around the back nine, I just feel like, you know, what it's not help me.  So just come back to myself and just focus on the things that I can control and that's helped me a lot today.
Q. Were you hitting it close, making long putts or a bit of both?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think it's both my back nine.  I hit a few shots pretty close and I make some long putts.
Q. Were you watching the leaderboard much today?  The lead has been changing hands a lot?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I will say I didn't watch at all because after my front nine, I feel that I don't care about the lead.  Just play golf.
Q. Big picture, you are ahead in so many categories on the LPGA Tour this season, race to the CME Globe right up there, how much is that a focus this week or are you just locked in on the tournament?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say I just focus day by day.  I don't think about I'm going to win about anything or not.  I think it's still pretty far ahead.
Q. Conditions today, looked as though the pins were a little tougher, the wind maybe down a bit?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, the pins pretty tough, like today, especially the front nine.
