Q. A victory here for you in a very exciting final round.  What are your thoughts?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I mean, I had so much fun.  I didn't expect to win a tournament because it's a links course and minute I didn't keep playing so well.  She played solid and she made lots of putts.
Q. What is the key to your victory this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think patience and not think about the outcome.  Especially when it's windy, raining, you try to make putt, you try to make birdie, it's not going to help.
Q. Did that eagle late yesterday really give you momentum when you chipped in on 16?  Do you think that's fair?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: For me, yeah.
Q. And it's an extra special win because it brings you back to world No. 1.  What does that mean?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It means a lot to me to win the tournament.  I told the caddie this week, you know, what I really want to win on a links course, even one time in my life will be good, so right now my dream come true.
Q. And going into the British Open?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel a lot better with links course, so I hope I play okay next week.
