THE MODERATOR: We are here with Ariya Jutanugarn who shot a 5-under, 67, currently our clubhouse leader.  How was it out there?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So much fun today, especially so today is like my first time playing the front nine.   
 Q.  Talk about the eagle on 6.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit a pretty good tee shot.  Little bit downwind and hit pretty good 5-iron second shot to the green.   
 Q.  Reaction to the course?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: The course is playing pretty tough, and some holes pretty long.  It's pretty wet and it's pretty hard to have like -- to hit like tee shot to have like good distance, second shot to the green.   
 Q.  How many 3-woods did you hit off the tee or did you hit iron every day?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit 3-wood almost every hole.  I hit 2-iron maybe twice today off the tee.   
 Q.  Was it an advantage that you were longer than everyone else given how wet the conditions were?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't hit that long because I hit only 3-wood.  Some holes I have to hit it far to the green.   
 Q.  What is the plan for the rest of the day?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm mostly going to do nothing.  I'm just going to practice a little bit and go back and rest.  I woke up pretty early today.   
 Q.  Which nine did you say you hadn't seen before?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Front nine.   
 Q.  Was that a worry not having seen that for a major championship?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  Because my clubs didn't show up on Monday.  So I have like more time to do something else.  And I pretty trust my caddie.  I know he's going to do a good job, so I can trust him.   
 Q.  You didn't play on Monday because your clubs weren't here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  I guess they just didn't bring my clubs with the airplane.   
 Q.  When did they arrive?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Monday night.   
 Q.  You obviously won last week.  What is so good about your game at the moment?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say my game been improving I feel like every week because I work so hard with my short game.  I feel like I have better (indiscernible) because the last few months I have been playing pretty good.  I really want to win a tournament.  I never -- at Kingsmill, I started I'm not going to think about the outcome.  I'm not going to think about winning tournament.  I'm just going to go out and make sure I have good (indiscernible) every shot.  After doing that, I think it's pretty good right now.   
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  Great playing today.
