Q. Pretty good way to start tournament.  How do you feel right now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel great.  I mean, you know, I feel I been playing pretty good like last few week and I didn't finish the way that I want to be.
Today my goal is just like don't worry about the future too much.  Don't think about like what I'm going to shoot today.  Just try to focus on thing I can control.
Q. Do you think, if anything, you could have went lower than 8?  Five in a row and then you burned the edge.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I had four in a row.
Q. Four in a row, and then you burn the edge on the fifth and even the sixth.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't think about like what should I do better.  I just feel like I have pretty good round today and I have really good commitment, so that's all I'm asking for.
For me it's good.
Q. You made the point that the greens were rolling true on Tuesday, I think.  Obviously that's the case today.  You commented that you really like the greens.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, yeah.  Actually I love the green until like maybe after my first five hole.  I feel like the greens so fast and I hit like ten feet past the hole.
It's pretty tough, because when it's getting more firm it's very quick.
Q. And was it getting more firm?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It is, yeah, after like my five hole.
Q. Ariya, I heard in a press conference that you love playing Canadian courses.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. What makes Canada so special to you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I love here.  Like all the crowd here, they're so nice.  When they see us they say, Thank you for coming, so we like really appreciate what they do for us.  They come and support all the LPGA players.
Q. I know you work with Gareth, your short game coach.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. How did that relationship start?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually my sister start with him first like maybe four years ago.  Then I start with him, so I work with him like three years already.
Q. How does he give you tips that are special for the Canadian course?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  He's very nice to me so he keeps saying I'm okay now.  Everything has been good so that what he keeps telling me.  Yeah.  I trust him.
Q. Yesterday he you experienced the wind Saskatchewan can bring.  How important was it to take advantage of a calm morning?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I'm pretty lucky play with no wind this morning.  We never know what's going to happen tomorrow.  Might be really windy.
Q. If the wind picks up for your round tomorrow afternoon, how does this course change?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think going to be totally different course.  Going to be harder, it's going to be longer.  I just have to play and wish I'm going to play okay.
Q. There has been I think the figure I saw was 200,000 square feed of new sod that was laid.  Can you tell at all?  The grass, new grass from the ice damage.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Oh, new grass.
Q. Could you tell at all?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I saw it but I didn't know because everything was fine.
Q. What about the rough?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: The rough too long for me.  (Laughter.)
Q. You come from a place at that can get pretty warm.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Uh-huh.
Q. Can you wrap your head around the fact that it's 30, 32 degrees right now and six months from now it might be minus 32.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Well, I love to come back here again then.  I want to see how it is.  (Laughter.)  I never see this before in my whole life.
Q. Playing in this group, everybody played very well.  Does that help the momentum of even your own round?  Does it push you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I love my group today.  I play with Jessica and In Gee, two of the nicest player on tour.  I have so much fun.  Jess shot like 6-under, so I just try to catch her.
