Q. A really great week.  How did you feel throughout the day and then coming down the stretch?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually it's pretty good, just only the last three holes.  I really get nervous, especially being my first time leading.  Next time it's going to be so much fun to be there, but I got a lot of experience from this week.
Q. Did you know exactly where people stood?  I know you said you weren't going to look at leaderboards.  Did you check at all?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, no.  Actually I don't really know when I turn around sometimes I saw it, so sometimes.
Q. What happened on 16, 17?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually 16, I think it's fine.  My tee shot missed a little bit left, so it's normal I missed, and second shot was good, but I got a putt that's pretty long and uphill and I hit it short.  On 17 I just missed my tee shot again to the left, so I had bogey, and I missed my tee shot again on 18.
Q. What did you learn the most from this week?  You said you had a great experience.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, like learning how to play golf when you're really nervous and when like all the spectators around you and cheering for you.
Q. What were your feelings going through 9, 10, 11 when you had three in a row?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I didn't feel nervous, didn't feel excited at all.  I just feel okay, I'm just going to do this.  After No. 9, okay, next hole, I just try to make birdie.  After 10, okay, try to make birdie again.
Q. You didn't look nervous.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Right.
Q. You made some pretty clutch par putts down the stretch.  Have you played that well in that stretch of a middle of a round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I did in Thailand three years ago, and I just missed that.
