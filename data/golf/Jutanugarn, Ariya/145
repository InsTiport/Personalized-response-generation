Q. Just a little bit of a tough finish today.  How are you feeling about your round right now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feeling good.  I mean, I had two bogeys the last three holes, but I still shot 5-under, so it's still good.
Q. You bogeyed the 18th hole a couple of times.  Is it something that just doesn't fit your eye off the tee?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  I just missed my tee shot today, but the first day I didn't miss my tee shot, I hit both shots pretty good.  No, nothing wrong with 18.
Q. What did you hit off the tee today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 3-wood.
Q. Big crowds today, obviously.  What was that like coming into the big crowd on the 18th?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, a little bit excited when I saw a lot of people here.
Q. Do you kind of think of it tomorrow as maybe a two-person race between yourself and In Gee?  She's obviously playing really well and you played with her today, so are you going to keep your eye on her tomorrow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I keep the eye on me.  I'm not really care like who the leader is, like what I say yesterday.  I really want to play my game and be happy on the course.
Q. You've won a few times already this season; what's been the key to finishing when you are in this position?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After I won my first tournament, I kind of know how I play under pressure, so I know when I get really excited what I have to do.
Q. You won a lot as an amateur, but is it different winning on the LPGA Tour?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, a lot different.
Q. What's going to be the key for you to come away with another win tomorrow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tomorrow I really want to have fun, and I really want to be happy on the course.  That's all I want for tomorrow.
Q. Do you pay attention to the bigger picture at all in terms of how many victories, Money List, Player of the Year, any of that kind of stuff?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really, no.
Q. It's a nice position to be in when you're doing so well that you don't have to worry about it, I guess.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, right.
Q. This last hole, tomorrow it might be set up a little closer.  Do you think it could be an eagle on the last hole?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't think I have to think about the future that much, so I don't know.
Q. You seem pretty relaxed.  Do you kind of just live each day, each round, and just get some rest tonight?  What's your focus tomorrow?  Is there anything you want to work on tomorrow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I'm going to work on a little bit with my tee shot, yeah, today.
