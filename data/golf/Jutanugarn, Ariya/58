Q. You took on the world No. 1 playing in her home country today in Sung Hyun Park.  You were 1-down after 12.  You turned that match around.  How did you do it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually it was really tough for me because I feel like she make everything; she hit really solid; she so good today; she play well today.
I just start to make some birdie and make me feel more confident.  I just feel maybe I can do this.
Q. What turned it around at key hole where you got a couple birdies to turn the match in your favor?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say on 14 because like we all square and I thought I'm going to lost that hole.  She didn't putt that good on that hole and we tied the hole.
Q. What was it is like playing in front of these huge crowds who obviously have one player in mind?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's amazing.  I thought it was going to be like nobody rooting for me, but actually not.  They're still like rooting for everyone; it's very nice.
Q. How cool is it that you win your match; Mo a few moments earlier sinks a 15-foot birdie putt to win her match.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's amazing because I think she play really well.  We both won on this hole.  I feel great.
