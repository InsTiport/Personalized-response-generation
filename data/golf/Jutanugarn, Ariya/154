Q. You followed up an opening 7-under par yesterday with a 3-under par today on Friday to be back in contention again at a major championship, as you were at the ANA Inspiration.  Didn't go your way on Sunday that time around.  What did you learn from that Sunday at ANA?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I learned how to play under pressure, how to play, really excited, I know how to play.  I really want to focus on what I'm doing and what I can control.  At ANA, I just focus like all about the result.
Q. You did pretty well after the three consecutive wins on the LPGA Tour, and now we are at the British Open and not the typical links course that we are used to.  Do you prefer this style?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like this style so much.  I think it fits my game.  I like the course.  I like everything here.
Q. What is it about the smile?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I had to find like what is my pre-shot routine to be relaxed and not think about the result.  Couldn't play thinking about it, wasn't under my control.  I really wanted to be happy before I hit the shot.  I think an easy one is just smile before the shot.
