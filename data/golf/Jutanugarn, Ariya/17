 Q.  You played amazing all week; such a low score.  To come away with a runner-up finish, initial thoughts?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually overall like my whole week was really good.  It's like amazing because didn't expect to play that good at all, so I'm really happy about how I played.   
 Q.  You mentioned during the week your 3-wood wasn't going well then your putter.  Seemed to really have it going today.  For 13 holes you were 7-under.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  What changed?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say I make a lot of putts and putting help me a lot, and I still didn't feel comfortable to hit the 3-wood but just keep trying.   
 Q.  Talk me through the birdie on 18.  Obviously you knew you needed a birdie to get into contention or have a chance of winning and you did that.  What do you do?  Just tell me about the hole.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, just make sure I have good commitment and I hit like perfect 2-iron, perfect 8-iron, and I make the putt, yeah.   
 Q.  How far was the putt?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Two feet, yeah.   
 Q.  So are you playing next week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Nope.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to the majors, Women's British Open.  What confidence does this give you?  I know it's a slightly different course, but being able to make so many birdies.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Everything is different.  British Open of course going to be different so not expect anything.  Just keep working on my like stuff I have to work on.   
 Q.  How much have you enjoyed this week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I love to be here.  This is my third time here, so I just come back here every time, every year.
