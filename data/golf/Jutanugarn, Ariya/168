THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome in the 2016 Kingsmill Championship winner, Ariya Jutanugarn.  Two wins over the last two weeks.  Was this one any easier than the last one?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: A lot easier.  I mean, like I didn't get nervous or excited until like the last putt.  I just want to play golf, have fun, enjoy every good shot and I have a chance to hit the ball.  Only the last putt I'm a little bit excited.
THE MODERATOR: When you said you got excited, what does that mean?  Were you nervous?  Were your hands shaking?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: My hands were shaking, but it's just a little bit, not like last tournament.  Last tournament was so bad.
THE MODERATOR: What were your thoughts in your head when you were standing over that last putt?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hmm, I only thought like, okay, I want to make -- for sure I want to make the putt, but what I have to do is make the putt, so I just have to control my stroke and make sure I get the right line, right read, so that's the only thing.
THE MODERATOR: You mentioned before that that last win, this one was easier.  Why did that last one prepare you for this win this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, last win was like breakthrough everything, so after I won one tournament, because I really want to win one tournament this year, and after I do that, I just feel like whatever it is, I'm just going to take it and have fun, so that's the only thing.
THE MODERATOR: Do you think this is going to open the floodgates for you now?  Do you expect more wins, like next week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I expect more wins, but I don't know about next week.
THE MODERATOR: In your pre-tournament press conference you called it and said that Team Thailand was going to win the UL International Crown.  Do you believe that still?  Are your odds better?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I always believe in that, because like what I told you, I have great teammates, so I have my sister, Pornanong, and Nontaya, so they're all great.
Q. I was wondering if you could sort of take us through 18, the tough second shot and then that third shot was just pretty incredible.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: My tee shot was good, so I feel comfortable with my tee shot.  But the second shot is like the distance between, so I have to grip a little bit and hit my half swing, and normally I don't really like half swing shot, and I really don't want to go left, so what I did was push it right.  And third shot, I knew it wasn't hard, so I was just like, it's an easy chip for me.  Last putt I was just a little bit nervous, excited, and six feet, so I don't have a chance to make that one, but I also know I have a chance to miss that one, too.
Q. How far were you on the chip?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.  Sorry.
THE MODERATOR: In 2013 you were a sponsor exemption here at the Kingsmill Championship.  How much more special does it make it to finally win an event here just three years later?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Last three years I really want to win this tournament because I lost in Thailand and I have a chance to play this one, and I like have a chance to win and I lost.  Right now, so I feel good because I can win the tournament I really want to win from like three years ago.
Q. Molly mentioned you coming here in 2013 as a sponsor's exemption.  If memory serves, you shot 64 the first day, you were leading the tournament, I think you birdied your first three or four holes.  Did you immediately when you first saw this course really like it and think that it suited your game?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I really like this course because it is in great shape, and it's hard but it's like mixed in, and the course is very nice, and I like the course because I can hit a few drivers because some of the courses I didn't even hit one driver.  Even today I hit only two times with my driver, but I still really like the course because I can hit my 3-wood and I still have short irons to the green.
Q. Can you talk about the third hole or third shot on No. 15 with the ball way below your feet in the high grass?  How difficult was that shot?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think the ball sat up pretty good.  It's not that bad.  So I know it's a little bit hard with the lie, but when I see the ball, I just think, it's okay, because I feel like I can make birdie from there, because I didn't feel it's hard.
Q. Were you aware that the three groups ahead of you, Su Oh and Gerina Piller and Sei Young Kim were putting a lot of pressure on you to try to catch up?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't feel pressure.  Today I just feel like whatever it is is fine because I just really want to have fun.  I'm not really care -- actually I know they play good, but I'm not really care about them.  I really worry about like what I want to do more.
Q. Going back six weeks or so to the unfortunate experience in California for you, can you sort of talk about what you did to overcome that, because obviously something like that can mess somebody up for a while.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: After ANA, I didn't feel bad.  I didn't feel like I lost the tournament, but I feel like I get something.  I feel good.  I feel more confident after ANA because I didn't think about it the last three holes, but I think about what a great -- a key play in ANA.  After that I just have more and more confidence, so I didn't feel bad about that.
Q. We saw you in the ninth fairway today because the group ahead of you was on the green and you had a pretty extended wait before your approach, and you looked so relaxed, you just sat on your golf bag, chatting with your caddie.  You didn't look like you had a care in the world.  Is that a sign of how calm and confident you are these days, especially since two weeks ago?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.  Like I'm not care anything today.  I mean, I just really want to have fun and have fun with my caddie.  Actually I went back to Thailand last week.  I'm so tired, so I just rest like any time and anywhere I can.
Q. Are you going to share your money with your sister, and what's the first thing you're going to buy?
THE MODERATOR: Great question.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not going to share my money with my sister, but I might going to get something for her.  That's a good question.
Q. Do you have any advice for younger girls?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hmm.  I think you guys should have like a goal, like have your target, like what you want to do.  If it didn't come good, just try again, try again, and try something like further away to reach your goal.
Q. Is it inevitable that your sister also wins out here and then you guys join the Sorenstams as the only sisters to have won LPGA tournaments?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: She has her goal, like this year she really wants to win her first tournament, and I'm going to support her, and I really trust in her, and I think she's going to win her first tournament this year, because she tries really hard.
THE MODERATOR: Well, congratulations, and safe travels.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.
