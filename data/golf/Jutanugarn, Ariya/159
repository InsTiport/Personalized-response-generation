Q. Three-round playoff there.  Talk about the emotions going through your head and everything.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I got a little bit excited the first time, but after that it's fine.  I just missed my short putt and kept hitting my 3-wood left.
Q. Were you trying to be more aggressive?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I played to play more aggressive because like only one hole and I tried to go my second shot to the green.
Q. Have you been in a four-hole playoff before?  How crazy is that?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I never -- I was in a playoff last year, but always first hole I lose that time.  It's pretty crazy for me because it took a long time.
Q. Were you thinking as it was going on, this is cool or stressful or --
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: To me it's really cool because it's good enough for me to get into a playoff, yeah.
Q. Did your nerves get to you at all?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: A little bit, just the first time, but after that, I'm fine.
Q. How about being tired?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not really tired.  I'm okay.
Q. How would you describe this entire experience, coming to close to a victory?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It was a really good experience, like I said.  It's really nice for me to have a chance in a playoff.
