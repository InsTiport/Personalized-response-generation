 Q.  Can you talk about your highlights?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think today I hit my tee shot pretty good and my approach was like really good today.  I just like missed some short putts on the front nine but back nine I start to make some putts.   
 Q.  And did you find playing in a group with Inbee, was good, encouraging you to play better?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have so much fun playing with Inbee because she inspires me a lot.  Like when I play with her, even before, I feel I try to be better golfer.  I love play with her today.   
 Q.  What is it about her game that inspires you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just feel like she's chilling and not really bad when she hits a bad shot.   
 Q.  She's very calm, so you admire that calm?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like that a lot.   
 Q.  Does it make you a little bit calmer?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it make me feel better.  I try to be calmer.   
 Q.  Can you remember your birdies, any long putts you holed?  Any ones that made you happy, best shots?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Everything.  On 17, I made a long putt.   
 Q.  How long do you think it was?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Like 25 feet.   
 Q.  And what about on the front nine?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Front nine, I had birdie on No. 8.  I like it because I miss my second shot to the right and it's a pretty hard shape and I get up-and-down.   
 Q.  And are you going to do anything differently tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, I'm just going to work on my putting a little bit today.   
 Q.  How does it feel to be at the top of a tournament's leaderboard like this?  Is this one you would like to win?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course, I think everybody want to win this tournament.  It's special tournament, but I just want to try to play my own game and have fun tomorrow.   
 Q.  And of course the sponsors, HSBC, gave you an invite when you were younger, so you have a long history here; so makes it more special?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, it would be nice.   
 Q.  Tell us about your round today, five birdies.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel really good with my round today.  I start to make some putts, especially on the back nine.  But like front nine, my approach was perfect.   
 Q.  You said earlier that your putting is still not 100 percent.  Where would you say it is?  Is it good?  Is it not so good?  How would you describe it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I feel a lot better than yesterday or last week.  But maybe the outcome is not that good but I'm still really happy.   
 Q.  What are you working on with regards to your putting?  Is it green speed, alignment?  What is it that you are struggling with?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I'm working right now especially like today, I think I'm have to work with commitment, like sometimes not really commit on my tempo a little bit today.   
 Q.  What is your game plan for the weekend?  Obviously you are now tied for second.  Are you going to be playing aggressive tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I try to be aggressive every day.  So tomorrow I think the plan going to be the same.  So not really worry about like today too much.  Get up to the see and see what I want to do.
