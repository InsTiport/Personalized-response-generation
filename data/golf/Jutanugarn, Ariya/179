  ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Actually I have only two bogeys, and before the final round, I think about I'm going to win or chance for playoff.   I think it's going to be good if I don't have bogeys because the first three rounds I had bogeys, but I started the first hole bogey, so that's still a pretty good week.  
   
 Q.   You had great playing out here.   As a rookie you have a lot of expectations out here, but you played well throughout the week.   What was working especially with the crazy weather conditions?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know, just like after last week, I have a lot more confidence, so this week made me more confident, and I think my caddie, Jeremy, helped me a lot.   
   
 Q.   And are you happy with your confidence?   I know before the Playoffs I saw you over on the range with Mo, and she was kind of trying to calm you down.   Were you nervous at all?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Not really nervous.   I mean, I just worry about my second shot because I miss it like two times on this hole, but I still‑‑ still fine.   
   
 Q.   Did you know Kim at all?   Do you know much about her?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   I played with her at Q‑school, I think, final round, yeah.  
   
 Q.   What did you think of her game?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   I think she have like really consistent, long hitter, and she is perfect‑‑ she has like really good game.  
   
 Q.   You're a long hitter, so it takes a lot to keep up with you, right?   Are you guys pretty close?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Actually not really remember, sorry.   
   
 Q.   This is your first playoff, correct?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Uh‑huh.  
   
 Q.   How was the experience heading into when the rules picked you up, brought you to the front?   How were you feeling?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   It was really exciting, but before I hit the shot, I feel like it's pretty good chance to have playoff, and what's going to happen is fine, so that's good.   
   
 Q.   Well, you did awesome today.   Congratulations.   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Thank you.   
   
 Q.   How was it playing in the tournament here?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Very nice.   After Q‑school I'm very excited and looking forward to playing the same tournament with my sister.   Now I've played with her, so very nice.  
   
 Q.   This is the first tournament you've played together?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Oh, no, second tournament.   
   
 Q.   I understand there was some bet going on about who's going to get the dinner from last night?   
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yeah.   Actually I win.
