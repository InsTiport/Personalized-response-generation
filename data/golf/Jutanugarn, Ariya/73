Q. What were your thoughts on that?  Are you happy with today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  I think the wind picked up my back nine, so it was getting pretty tough my back nine.  So it was hard to control the distance to the green.
Q. What do you feel like you did well?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I didn't miss a lot of putts today, but I didn't make a lot of putts too, so I think the putting is okay.
Q. Just one bogey in two days.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't have bogey today.
Q. Yesterday.  One in two days.  How are you feeling about your game right now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty good.  I'm a little surprised because I didn't play golf for like two weeks.  I didn't practice at all, and I don't really like windy or links course.  So I feel like after two rounds 10-under is pretty good.
Q. What did you do for two weeks that you didn't play golf?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So I did something for sponsor and I eat a lot and I sleep a lot.  So mostly do nothing.
Q. Were you home or in Thailand?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: In Bangkok, in Thailand, yeah.
Q. Oh, cool.  Just hanging out with family?  And not practicing?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  Actually, only one day.  So I leave Saturday night, so I practice on Friday for like 30 minutes.
Q. So the Friday before you left to come here was the last.  And did you say you don't like links golf?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't really like because it's so tough.  It's really challenge, but always I have so much fun.  But I just feel like everything is so tough.
Q. Maybe are you starting to change your mind, because 10-under.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hope so.  Maybe after this week I feel better.
Q. So all of the holes you birdied today were different than the ones yesterday, except for No. 2.  So what do you like about that second hole?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Second hole.  It's par-5.  I can hit to the green pretty easy.  Like today I have 8-iron to the green, yesterday I have 9-iron to the green.
Q. Do you feel you can birdie every hole out here?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  You still have pretty tough holes.
Q. What's the toughest hole?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I kind of forgot because all the holes look similar to me.
Q. Which hole sticks in your mind?  Is there a birdie you remember today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'd say on 15 I made pretty long putt.
Q. And how are you feeling about the weekend?  Do you feel like you have a good chance?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know about winning, but I feel pretty good for myself.  Because like links course I've been playing pretty good for two rounds.
