Q. How did you spend your off-week last week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just practise a little bit but not much.  Mostly resting.
Q. This week starts two weeks back-to-back in Scotland, links golf.  What do you think of the challenge here?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's going to be so hard and a real challenge for me because I think links course, really challenge because like degree and everything.  It's going to be fun.
Q. So what about this course specifically; how many times have you played it so far and what do you like about it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I only played yesterday nine holes.  What I like about it, I think it's hard.  So it's going to be really hard to make like low score because the greens are really firm and a lot of the greens, we have to do something else.
Q. When you're back in Orlando and you know you have a couple links-style tournaments coming up, do you change your practise at all or do you do the same thing?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really, because I know what type of shot I should practise a little bit but more like focus on my swing because I've been working on my swing a little bit.
Q. Do you feel comfortable with where your swing is at heading into this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel really comfortable.
