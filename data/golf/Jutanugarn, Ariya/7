Q. 27 good holes and you're right back in this thing. How did you turn it around on 10 yesterday?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 10, actually after my front nine, went over, Okay, don't give up. Just play golf best you can. Okay.
So actually like after front nine I plan, okay, what I'm going to do. I'm going to go shopping on Monday; I'm going to leave on Tuesday. So like not expect anything at all. I told myself just like, Okay, I'm making sure I have no fear when I swing. Just hit the ball. Even if I finish last, just make sure if going to miss everywhere, make sure not because I'm fear. Just hit the ball.
So turn out pretty good. I should think this way before first round.
Q. Obviously you play aggressive anyway. You almost make an albatross on 14 yesterday. What did you drive, 2 today was it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today?
Q. Yeah. Was it 2 or 3 that you hit it so far? Today. You hit your tee shot way down there on...
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Which hole?
Q. Was it 2 or 3? I can't remember.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 3, yeah.
Q. 3, okay, yeah. Very aggressive playing. Did you come in with that mindset?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I will say when you have like no fear, so if I feel so free, so I hit it hard when I want to. I do whatever I want to do.
I have like struggle with like chipping, so I'm like, okay, I'm just going to do it, because like last tournament so I need to get my feeling back and feel like better.
Q. How would you assess the year? Looking back on the entire year, what do you think?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel like so much thing going on. Not bad thing, but, you know, I'm not like -- I would say (indiscernible) success. To me, I feel like I pretty success about like what happened to me because I learn so much.
I learn to be more patient. I learn that -- I understand that I can do my best. Doesn't mean the outcome going to be the way I want. I just need to be patient and keep doing that, and this year it's like test me by doing that.
Q. Right. You look great. What have you been doing?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty?

ARIYA JUTANUGARN: So basically I got yell by my mom a lot by keep eating dessert. So I do blood testing and everything come pretty bad so I have to do like that diet.
Q. Okay. Is it a specific diet?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually just making sure -- normally I love to have dessert. I can have cake even right before I play, so right now I have to cut down. If i want to have I have only one bite, two bite, because I have issue.
Q. So are you going to have birthday cake tonight?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Don't think so.
Q. Are you taking everyone out for birthday?

I want to make sure I have good feeling and memory before the off-season, because I know I'm not going to touch the golf club for like five weeks. I have to making sure I have a good memory before I take a month off.
