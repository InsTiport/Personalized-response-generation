Q. 10-under total.  How is it going for you today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: A bit more tough today because the tee box move a little bit so we hit a bit longer, and we play a bit longer.  But overall it's pretty good.  Miss some.  I have bogey on par 5, which is like pretty stupid.
Q. A few players have said that the course has actually hardened up despite the rain.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, it is, especially on the green, but with the tee shot, I don't feel much different.  I still hit it short.
Q. Are you hitting driver this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.
Q. Did you manage to take a glance at the leaderboard and see your sister up there?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I saw her and I try to catch her, but I can't.
Q. Maybe tomorrow?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hope so, yeah.
Q. How funny is it between you two, you have a competition between who is going to win as a pair --
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: She beat me the last few weeks and this week she did a pretty good job.  But like this week we didn't talk about try to beat each other much because she's playing so well, so I keep rooting for her and cheering for her.
Q. What's been your mind-set and your focus this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I just want to rest as much as I can because I'm so tired.  This is my fourth week.  A little bit too tired.
Q. Have you scaled back your practice or warm up this week?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I do everything less.  Warm up shorter and practice less than before, yeah.
Q. You said at the start of the week that your sister was doing most of the cooking.  If she's overnight leader tonight, will she still do the cooking this evening?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Have to because we stay pretty far away from everything.  Nobody going to get food, so she got to cook anyway.
Q. What will she cook tonight?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Like some Thai, easy stuff.
