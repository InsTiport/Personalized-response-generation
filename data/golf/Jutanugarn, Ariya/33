Q. Tell me about your round today.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Pretty good.  I mean, I start pretty good front nine.  Make a lot of putt in my front nine.  Back nine I still hit it pretty well; I just missed all the putt.
Yeah.
Q. Do you feel different than the first two days?  Still trying to get into your groove?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I feel a lot better.  I feel more comfortable.  I have a lot better commitment and not really scare anymore.
Q. What was that mental switch like for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Even after yesterday I just feel like nothing to lose, so just play golf.
Q. As you probably know there was a lot blow up over social media about what happened on 18 yesterday.  What are your thoughts on that?  One question was had you ever heard of back stopping before?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  But, you know, like it's nothing because we been waiting all day.  It's very slow.  I play so bad yesterday and I kind of like wanted to get off the course.
Actually it's like Michelle turn and she call for rule, so I don't want like to hold everybody so I just hit it.  I'm going to walk like mark my ball, and then I saw Amy was ready, so I let she hit and that was it.
Q. Yeah.  There was no agreement between you guys.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  We not even talk.  Yeah.
Q. So over social media someone accused whatever had happened to cheating.  Even though you guys are both clear, there was no penalty given, was it hard getting ready for the round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually it's not that tough, because one thing we know is we not cheating.  We not talk, we not agree with that, like help each other, nothing.
So I saw Amy when we make turn or something and we give a hug.  We know it's nothing.  We not try to cheat.
