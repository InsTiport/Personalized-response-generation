 Q.  Tough day.  What are your immediate thoughts?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I mean I hit some good shots but hit some bad shots, also.  Still a good week for me.  Not finish the way I want to be but still a good week.   
 Q.  Conditions were quite tough out there.  It's quite swirly?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's tough, windy.  The greens always tough and the green really firm, so it was tough, yeah.   
 Q.  It's actually a surprising score that was out there, considering how hard everybody found it.  Compared to earlier in the week, what were the conditions?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say every to me is the same.  It's always tough, every day.  I'm kind of surprised, Sung Hyun, she's such a great golfer; I'm not surprised she shot 8-under because she's the best to me, so just congrats to her.  She's great.   
 Q.  And you'll take positives?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, I just had one bad day, but overall the week, I did a good job.   
 Q.  Top 10 is still a very good finish?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: My first Top 10.   
 Q.  Do you feel that the two double-bogeys were the turning points today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm not going to say that because of that two double-bogeys, because you know, before that, I'm not making any putts.  I'm not making any birdie, so a pretty tough day for me today.   
 Q.  On the fourth, you found the water?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I hit a pretty good shot, and it just went in the water, so I can't really do anything.   
 Q.  And 14, you 3-putted, the par 5?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I 2-putt.  I have to take unplay for my second shot.   
 Q.  Where was that ball?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I went right.  Second shot went right under the tree.  So I had to take unplay.   
 Q.  The search goes on next to win in Asia.  The next opportunity will be in China in October.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I'm not really paying attention on, only one tournament.  But I know I have so much things to improve, especially after this week, I have to go back to see my coach.  I have to work a lot of things.
