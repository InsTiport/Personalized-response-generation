Q. Tough conditions out there but you had a strong back nine, three birdies in a row, 14, 15, 16.  Talk us through those birdies.  What worked well?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit a pretty good shot on 14 and made the putt, maybe like ten feet, uphill.
Then on 15, I hit a great shot.  I hit one foot with 6-iron.
And par 5, just like up-and-down, make birdie.
Q. Pin placements seemed to be more difficult today than yesterday.  How tough was it out there to score?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's so tough because especially when you keep playing and you're not make any birdie, you just really need to be patient and you know, you just have to understand this course, you're not going to make much birdie.
Q. And what's been the strongest part of your game these first two rounds?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: This week, I'm going to say nothing.  Nothing yet.
Q. Nothing yet?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Hope tomorrow something show up.
Q. Now, everyone calls this Asia's major.  What would it mean to you to have a victory here on Sunday?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, I just never win in Asia, so if I can win, it's going to be like my dream come true.
Q. You said nothing yet, and you still find yourself 5-under, and right up there in the mix.  Surely that must be a good sign?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it is because you know, I feel like I miss all the putts.  I just have to really work on it.  You know, even iron is not that good, so really have like good chance to make birdie, so I have to kind of like make -- work on everything.
Q. Is it more windy today out there?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I feel like yesterday more windy.  But today, the pin is just so tough.
Q. The pin placements?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. Last week, and then there was the back-stopping incident and all that.  Were you bothered by the reactions?  Were you disappointed?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not at all.  It's over.  We know we not do anything wrong.
Q. Like you said, it doesn't bother you, but how do you stay focused?  You're on social media, as well.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: First thing we have to know we do nothing wrong.  We didn't break the rule.  We didn't cheat, so that's all.
