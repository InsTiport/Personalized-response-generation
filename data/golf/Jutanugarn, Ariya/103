Q. So only one bogey today.  Sounds like you had a pretty good day, considering the conditions.  How do you feel?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel pretty good.  I never think I'm going to play okay in these conditions, and I had so much fun today.  I played with So Yeon Ryu and Shanshan Feng.
Q. Only the one bogey.  What stood out to you on the golf course today, other than the weather?  What was the best part of your round?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I hit the ball pretty solid today.  I'm not worried about the outcome, so I just like focus on the things I can control and that worked out.
Q. I think that has to be a good mind-set when you're playing in weather like this.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.
Q. What was the conditions out there like for you today?  Tough?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's pretty tough.  It rained all day, and it's very windy, especially the back nine is getting harder and harder every hole.  It's very challenging.  Not expect anything.  Just go out, hit the ball, that's it.
Q. It's also got to feel good to get a good round.  I know you've not played your best recently perhaps, but this has to feel good, especially considering everything that was going on, how well you played today.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel very good today, especially the weather and everything like what I said before, I feel really good because I'm not thinking about the outcome, so that's the most important thing.
