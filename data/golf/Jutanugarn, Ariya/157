 Q.  Congratulations for that super start here at the RICOH Women's British Open Championship.  Tell me first of all how much you like this Marquess Course at Woburn?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I love this course.  To me I think it really feeds on my game.  I like this course so much.   
 Q.  It's been a wonderful season for you, not the least, three wins in a row.  Can you tell me why you have had so much success and what has been the major spark in your career this season?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think this year I have so much fun when I play golf, and I really want like to have fun with like every single round, and right now really happy and I just focus on like what is under my control.   
 Q.  You came so close in the first major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, and I wonder how much momentum that has given you, how much confidence you can bring into that major championship now.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think I got a lot more confident after ANA and KPMG, so now I feel really confident.   
 Q.  How do you like playing here, as opposed to on a links course?  Do you find it very different, not playing at the links seaside course?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I not really like the links course.  I think it's too hard for me to win.  When I saw this course, I like it.   
 Q.  You felt good when you saw it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.   
 Q.  Does it remind you of any other course you play?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think it's like Canadian Open last year.   
 Q.  And why do you think it suits you, because you're long?  Do you think that's why it suits?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: To me it's not really too narrow and I don't have to hit my driver, so it's like to me, it's pretty like not too long.   
 Q.  How would you assess your play?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today, my tee shot pretty good and I make like a lot of putts today.   
 Q.  This golf course, did you feel like you could come in and make a lot of birdies early, or were you feeling it out first?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: To me, it is not windy.  I think I can make birdie because it's not like really hard for me because I like the course so much.   
 Q.  How do you build off this round going into tomorrow?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I just really want to maintain like focus what's on my control and not really worry about the result.   
 Q.  You've had a lot of experience at the top of leaderboards, does that really help you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's helped me.  Not really nervous, not really excited anymore.   
 Q.  Tell us about your strategy.  You didn't have driver in the bag again, right?  Why not, and what is your strategy?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I try to hit driver this week in the practise round two times and I feel like if I'm going to hit only two times, better for me to not bring my driver, because I can bring my 3-iron and 4-iron in the bag.   
 Q.  Do you have a 2-iron in the bag this week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.   
 Q.  How comfortable have you become with that 2-iron?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I feel like really comfortable with my 2-iron, because I feel like I can hit it hard and I can do whatever I want to do. I can hit draw.  I can hit fade.   
 Q.  You've won three events in a row.  And you finished second at the KPMG Women's PGA.  How important is getting that first major to you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's really important for me because like my goal right now, I mean, even one time in my life, I really want to win a major.
