 Q.  We had a little discussion while you were playing the 18th hole.  How close are you to playing the absolute best golf you can play right now?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Right now I would say -- I mean, this course pretty good, but I still feel I can get better because I missed a lot of tee shot.  I didn't hit much fairway at all today.   
 Q.  Is that it?  Just basically the tee shots is the only part of improving this week; overall are there other things you would like to improve in your game?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say other thing is pretty good.  You know, I roll my putts pretty well today and I made lots of long putt also.   
 Q.  Do you like courses like this where you have to make a lot of birdies to be in contention?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I feel like it's really tough for me because I felt like every hole everybody have the chance to make birdie.   
 Q.  And you've made the most so far.  Must be working for you.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.  So far, yeah.   
 Q.  Any change in your game plan for the weekends?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  Just keep doing all the same stuff.  I still have to work on my 3-wood today.   
 Q.  If you keep doing the same stuff the rest of the field is going to be a little worried.  Good luck this weekend.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.   
 Q.  Career low through 36 holes of 15-under par.  Finished at 4-under through your opening seven.  How did you get started off with such a great start?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, you know, I keep doing the same stuff.  I really like this course because I love the green here I feel like I can roll my putt in really well today.   
I would say I'm not thinking about the score or outcome at all.  I still miss a lot of tee shot today.  Miss a lot my 3-wood.  But, you know, I feel like my putting is working really well today.   
 Q.  How do you stay in the moment when you're missing off the tee yet still scoring?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually when I miss the tee I made birdie so it's kind of make me feel better, so it's just like shot by shot.  Don't think so much about future.  Just keep doing my best.   
 Q.  Six sets of back-to-back birdies throughout your opening 36 holes.  What is it about birdieing one hole that gives you momentum to birdie the next one?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say not thinking about making birdie.  Just try and have good commitment and try to roll the putt like where you want the ball to start.   
 Q.  That commitment is there; really good consistency this week.  What's kept your scoring so consistent?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say like what I said before:  Keep commit my shot and maybe pretty lucky today.  Make lots of birdie also.
