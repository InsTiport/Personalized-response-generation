ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I need to really be me today and be tough today.  Just like I feel so much better because I learned to be patient.
Q. You have driver in the bag yesterday, used it twice.  Didn't have it today.  Probably the longest course you'll play all year.  Will it be in the bag this weekend?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Maybe not because I just like to hit -- feel I can punch it with my 3-wood better.
Q. (Inaudible)
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit 6-iron.
Q. How close?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Three feet, I think.  I'm not sure.
Q. Good hole.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Thank you.
Q. (Inaudible)
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually it's pretty tough front-9 with wind and I need to be patient.  I also play really good back-9 and hit good shot last.  Just didn't make the putt.
Q. What were you trying to do on 15?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 15?
Q. The par 5.  Which club was that?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 2-iron.
Q. Both off the tee?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: 3-wood off the tee and, second shot, 2-iron.
Q. Was it a tough lie in the bunker or just tough --
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: The lie was fine.  It's just really bad -- I mean really tough bunker shot.
Q. You like your position?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Of course.
Q. How differently do you think through a weekend compared to Thursday, Friday?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: What different?  Of course, the course going to be very tough and I don't know it's going to be raining or windy.  Just this course is tough.  You need to be patient and I feel I did pretty good job today to be patient.
Q. Which do you prefer, wind or rain?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Wind.
Q. What was the driver situation today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: What's the driver situation?  I want to hit driver today but I saw it's really windy.  You know what, I just need to hit something that I feel comfortable and be able to keep it low and can control it.  So decide to not hit driver and bring 3-iron today.
Q. Will it stay there if it stays windy like this?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.
Q. Did you hit your 3-iron today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.
Q. You talk about being patient.  After having the season you had last year, how challenging is that this year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's really challenge but I just felt like it's life.  We always going to go up and down.  I just fight with it and be patient and do my best, like do my best I can because I never know when a good round will show up and never know when a bad round show up.
Q. When is the last time you lost your patience?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: When is the last time I lost my patience?  Today.  Just like a few hole but not like all 18 or something but few hole, not so well and missed the hole.  I lost my patience a little bit.
Q. Was your group down there on the par 5 where that big tree limb cracked and fell, down around 4 or 5, a big tree limb cracked and fell?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. Did it startle you at all?
Has the starter pronounced your name correctly?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not yet.  He know my first name they will be wrong anyway because my name is "Ailya".  Nobody called it right so last name, of course, going to be so tough.
Q. Be patient.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Be patient, yes.  Have to stay on LPGA ten years.
