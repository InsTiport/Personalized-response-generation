Q. The week in Thailand is done.  Are you relieved?  Satisfied?  Sad?  How do you feel?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel a lot of thing going on this week, but still so much fun.  I feel like first day of the tournament I didn't feel comfortable at all.  I feel like I'm nervous, worry, I didn't play well.
Right now I feel a lot better.  I feel like I gain confident and I feel like I should -- you know, working on something and it's going to get better.  That what I feel.
Q. Do you think that's because of the pressure of having to perform at home in front of home crowds?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I don't have that much pressure anymore play in Thailand.  Just like first two tournament I didn't play well and I just hit like everywhere, so I just like lose confidence on that.
Q. How about you, Mo?  Playing in Thailand, glad it's over?  Sad?  Mixed feelings?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, it just feels like another week finish.  Feeling is like, you know, more cool week, and, I mean, it's not like really sad, but also if it going to be like two weeks in Thailand it would be perfect.
Q. Yeah.  Tell me about playing this week overall, just the state of your game.  You haven't talked about that yet, Mo.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: My game?  Well, it's pretty much the same all week.  I kind of hit it everywhere.  I mean, it's just like in the work in progress.  It's not like anything like super bad or real good.  It's just like, you know, just keep working on it.  Same thing just on the golf course.  Just trying to play with what I got, what I have.
Q. So typically thunderstorms are common in Thailand; today to have been interrupted with the lightning and the rain coming down, was it tough to mentally get back into it?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually before blow the horns I just feels like -- I had a feeling I want to keep going, you know.  I think we stop for like one -- I think we stop for one hours.  Just kind of have to get me to a mood of playing again.  Just, you know, it's just kind of like a bit -- it's actually make me feel more tired to like stop for one hours.
But, I mean, we got a little bit of rain like on the last hole when I have to hit pretty tough bunker shot.  I mean, it's just something you have to be pay attention.
Q. How did you feel about having to deal with the rain delay or lightning delay with the rain?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel okay because after that I make three birdie.  I have very long putt and I have to go in, have to went in, and then I missed the putt.  I have bogey, but three birdie after this.  Pretty good, so thank you for doing that.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Basically she's happy; I'm not really.
Q. Mixed feelings.
