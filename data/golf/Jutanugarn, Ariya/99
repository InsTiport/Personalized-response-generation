Quick Quotes   
 Q.  In your last eight starts you had three missed cuts, one top 20.  What was the difference this week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: This week, to be honest, I have no expectation at all.  I really not think about the outcome.  I really focus on the thing I can control and I have so much fun this week.  I have great memory this week.   
 Q.  Were you paying attention to the leaderboard?  Did you know exactly what you needed to do coming in on 18?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I try to not because my caddie told me like, Just don't look at the leaderboard.  Just go make the putt and be done.  Like he just like really positive.   
I'm like, Yeah, I'm not going to look, and soon as he say that I look at the leaderboard right away and I know I have to make birdie.   
But I didn't expect to make it.   
 Q.  After everything that happened last season, five wins and just one this season, a little bit of a slump after getting to No. 1, how important is this victory for you heading into next year?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's really important to me that I win the tournament because I have a great memory, I have a lot more confidence.  What I say before, right now I not have outcome expectation.
