Q. You said this week, you can't read putts, but you certainly can read putts because you made a lot today.  How was it on the putting greens for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm getting a lot better because my first two rounds, I felt like I can't really do, but today makes me feel -- finally I made some.
Q. One-shot lead going into the final round.  We find it unbelievable that although ten wins, you haven't won yet in Asia.  Are you aware of that?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, one of my dream, maybe start like five years ago.  I really want to win in Asia because I never have.
Q. You have a good luck charm.  Your mom has arrived.  Is she keeping a close eye on you and your sister?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: She just went to my room and she just like shocked.  She haven't do anything yet but I'm pretty sure they are going to have to do something today.
Q. It's a big job, tidying up after you have.  You have a big day ahead of you, so many good players and once again, playing with Minjee Lee, every day, so far this championship?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I played with her for three day and tomorrow final round, I'm going to play with her.  She's such a great golfer.  I feel like she makes everything and plays so well the last three days.
Q. You have been playing fantastically well and going into the final round, what are you thinking?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I've been playing pretty good this week but one thing I have to keep doing, just focus on the things I can control because I never know with my shot -- 12-under, I don't know, I just have to do my best.
Q. Are we going to see that 2-iron out?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not sure.
Q. Looking forward to a break?  Maybe hit some balls now?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Maybe go practise a bit on the putting green.
Q. And do you sometimes practise with a wedge to work on your stroke?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: See how I'm feeling.
