 Q.  You really closed the gap today.  What was working well for you today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today I feel like I trust my decision more, because like it's pretty windy and a lot of thing going on.  Last few day, especially yesterday when it's windy, I'm feel like I'm not really trust the shot I pick.   
Today I feel like, you know what?  I'm just going to do every shot my best and trust my decision.   
It's getting better.   
 Q.  With the wind picking up today definitely posed a huge challenge; club selection, distances.  Where do you think that switch in your mindset came from?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think most important thing today is like I feel I'm really too far behind the lead.  I feel like I can't catch anyway, so what I want to do is just be patient, do my best every shot.   
When you not think about the outcome, (indiscernible-wind.)   
 Q.  Yeah.  So you're in a really good position right now.  Still 18 holes left.  Are you thinking about a win?  Top 5?  What are your goals?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say try to not thinking about that, because like especially what happened to me today when I say like I'm too far from to the lead.  I'm not thinking about that.  I'm just going to come back to myself and really do what I need to do, and turn out pretty good.   
I'm just going to keep doing that tomorrow.   
 Q.  That's good.  Sounds like you want to keep it pure golf.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It is.  Because like what I say, last few month I'm not trust my decision; a lot of thing going on.  Today I'm very trust my decision, and tomorrow I hope I can do it again.
