 Q.  All over again, another round, another low score.  What is this saying about your game and how this is anyone's game at this point?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I mean, I hit lots of good shot and also like I had really good chance to make birdie on my front nine but I miss-read it, over-read it.   
Today we miss lots of short putt.  Overall pretty good.   
 Q.  For you are you looking at the leaderboard as you're coming around?  Have you seen glimpses as you were walking up 18?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I think I saw it, yeah.  But after front nine I just feel like, You know what?  Just don't care about the leaderboard because Sung Hyun keep playing so well.   
 Q.  Yesterday you said you were going to be working a lot on your tee shots.  How do you grade your tee shot execution today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say it's getting better.  Not like real good, but a lot better than yesterday.  Just like today I feel I have a lot of chance to make birdie, but miss a lot of the short putts, too.   
 Q.  I know the mental game a big with you as well.  What are you saying to yourself when you miss that putt or miss that fairway?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just have to understand that, you know, mistakes always going to happen.   
 Q.  Just from listening to you it sounds like you're happy to be where you are because you maybe didn't play as well as you expected.  Going into final round where you are, are you excited to know that if you play your best tomorrow a championship is out there to win?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not think about win the tournament, but of course I want to bring my best game tomorrow because still have a lot of thing to work on.  Like today I'm getting better with my 3-wood, but you know, my putting struggle a little bit.   
So hope tomorrow everything can come together.   
 Q.  You know how low people can go here.  What's the score going to have to be to win here, do you think?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say I have no idea.  I don't know.  I feel like everyone can shot like 10-under tomorrow, so I don't know.   
 Q.  Between yourself and Shanshan and S.H. Park, there is a lot of the championships in those three players right there.  Kind of the cream rose to the top on the top of the leaderboard today.  Does it feel like that, the best players moved to the top today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I would say I just feel like everybody here is the best, you know.  So I feel like what I say before:  Everybody have chance to shot 10-under and win the tournament tomorrow.
