Q. After your win at Woburn, how do you feel to be playing at the Olympic golf course?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, really excited, one moment in my life I have a chance to play the Olympics, it's really cool.

Q. Have you seen the golf course?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I played 18. The golf course is beautiful, great shape, and the greens are hard, it's windy and really long, the course.

Q. Do you like the greens? 
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like it. It's really a challenge. I think it's fast and slopey.

Q. So how do you rate your own chances of success here? Do you feel confident, like maybe you can get a medal?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel good with my game right now, so I just really want to do my best.

Q. If you win this week, and also a major, what's going to be the highlight, a major or a Gold Medal?
