 Q.  Talk about this weather conditions out here.  It's a little windy, a little cold, but still, you went around in a really good score.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You say a little bit, I say a lot.  It's really windy, like so tough today.  I feel like a lot of great shots that I still make bogey.  It was really tough.   
 Q.  How good was it to finish with a birdie on 18?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm really proud of myself I finally made a putt, because I feel like I missed all the putts today.   
 Q.  You're still in contention, very close to the lead going into the weekend.  Do you have the same game plan for Saturday?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to see how the weather, how the wind is going to be tomorrow.   
 Q.  Was it tough out there, unpredictable with the wind?  Was the wind hard to judge?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it was really hard.  Even like the tee shot I had to be really patient and focus on where I want to start the ball, and the second shot is really hard to adjust to the green.
