 Q.  The 13th was a bit of a turning point with the double-bogey.  How much nerves and tension did you feel at that point?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel a little bit nervous but after that hole, I didn't feel like that -- because I feel like I can make the shot I did.   
 Q.  There was one beautiful shot into 17.  Can you describe that putt and the relief that you must have felt in holing that putt?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I really want to make myself happy -- because I miss a lot of putts.  I feel like, come on, just make one.   
 Q.  You smiled all the way around, and there was a bigger smile with your mum, very special moment at the end.  What did she say to you?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I think she cried.   
 Q.  How important is this victory for Thai golf, the first-ever Thai golfer to win a major?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think it's really important for me and for Thai golf, also.  Like my goal, I really want to win major and I did.   
 Q.  Three consecutive LPGA events in a row, and the next thing you wanted was a major, and now you've done it and you've become the first player ever from Thailand to win a major championship.  How proud are you of your achievements?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm really proud of my achievement because I accomplished my goal this year.   
 Q.  You told us yesterday you now know how to play under pressure.  Did you get a little bit nervous on No. 13 today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I did, on 13, I'm like, oh, what's wrong with me.  But after that, I'm really like be patient and I can come back really good.   
 Q.  You are now No. 3 in the Rolex Rankings.  Did you ever believe you would be in this position this early on in your career?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, I mean, my target, I really want to be like Top-10, but I give myself like two years after my rookie year.   
 Q.  This must be the best possible preparation going to the Olympics, so much done for golf in Thailand.  How much are you now looking forward to the chance to win a Gold Medal?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm really looking forward.  I can't wait.  I'm really excited about that.
