ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today getting more confident.  And tee shot better.
Q. Did you feel like you were pretty patient out there today?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes, better than yesterday.  Yesterday I feel more patient, but today pretty good.
Q. You and your caddie were joking around after you made that putt, what was so funny?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: We were joking around.  He said it happens, because major.
Q. How important is it to finish this early?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today I just really want to play under par, and I did.  So I make birdies.
Q. Have you talked to Pia and Lynn the last few days?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I did before first round.
Q. What was their advice for the major?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: They tell me to be patient and keep play my game and not really care about some other people expectation.
Q. How much are you hitting a 3-wood off the tee, and how much the 2-iron off the tee?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I hit 2-iron.  I hit only three or four time my 3-wood today.
Q. Tell us about the 2-iron.  There aren't many women who hit 2-iron.  How much do you like that and how comfortable are you with that club?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like my 2-iron so much.  I feel like I can control and I can hit it as hard as I want to hit it.
Q. Is that your favorite club?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yes.
Q. Did you have to get it replaced this week or did you need a new 2-iron?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.  Is not broke, but I don't know how to say, but the head --
Q. Did you get a new one?  Did they fix it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I get a new one.
Q. Do any of the other players want to hit your 2-iron?  Does your sister mess around with it?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I try to let my sister hit, but she said she don't want to hit it.
Q. How did you -- most women won't hit a 2-iron.  How did you come to like a 2-iron?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually from last year.  I can't hit my tee shot.  I can't hit driver.  I can't hit 3-wood.  My caddie said let me try 2-iron, so that why I like it.  Because I feel like I can control my 2-iron.
Q. Are you thinking about the streak at all, trying to win four tournaments in a row, does that come in your head much?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  This one major, and last year I miss the cut this one, so I really want to make cut.
Q. Well, you did that.  What do you think of this golf course?  Do you like it?  Is it challenging for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like it.  I think it is really, really challenging for me.  It is really narrow and the green is pretty firm.  Everything is pretty hard this major.
