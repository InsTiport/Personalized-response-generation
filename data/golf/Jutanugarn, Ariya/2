  Q. Ariya Jutanugarn, great round of 66, bogey-free out there.  I know a lot of tees were moved up today.  Looks like you were able to put some power out there on the course.  How are you doing?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Actually the course is different today.  It's like more firm so I hit the ball longer.  And I just feel more comfortable because like last two days pretty new for me because I haven't play for so long, so everything is kind of like shock me a bit.
 So today feeling much better.

 Q. Lucky?  It wasn't talent?

 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   I love San Diego.  The weather is so nice and the course is so pretty.  I just love being here, and today everything is like perfect condition.
 Q. And so what's the game plan heading into the final round?  You jumped way up the leaderboard.
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Nothing much.  Just keep doing the same thing.  Because I been working on my commitment because first two rounds I just don't know how to have good commit.  So today getting much better, so I hope tomorrow can get better, too.
 Q. Still bringing out Lynn and Pia lessons?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Yep.
 Q. What do you think about specifically when you work on that?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   You know, especially like today it's just like -- actually after yesterday I take like no more golf, I'm done, because I think I'm going to miss the cut and I been playing like not good at all.
 But today just have like good -- better mindset, so I just want to go out and have good commit.
 Q. And just one last question:  Was your practice round here truly the first time you picked up a golf club?
 ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   It's not that, because, you know, I play a bit when I'm back home, but maybe like once a week.  That was it.
