 Q.  How have you worked yourself back into contention for the title?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Today I hit my tee shots really good, really a lot better than yesterday, and I get more comfortable with my putting, so my putting is getting better.   
 Q.  Talk about closing it out with a good hole there and getting a birdie on the last hole.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I had birdies last three holes -- I mean, last two par-5s there weren't too many birdies anyway, but I had one birdie on 16.   
 Q.  What's your mindset heading into tomorrow?  Do you think you have a shot at it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Tomorrow?   
 Q.  Yeah, going into tomorrow, do you think you have a shot at winning?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't really care about like who's going to win or I want to win, so I just really want to do like what I can control and focus on what I have to do.
