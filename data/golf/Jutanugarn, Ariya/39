 Q.  I'm here with Ariya Jutanugarn, back to back 67s to start the first tournament of the year.  A little bit of a difficult finish, but 4 under, in the hunt today.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't expect to finish 4 under today at all because I hit everywhere.  I keep missing fairways and greens, and I'm at 4 under.   
 Q.  What do you do to stay patient on a day like that, when you feel like you are a little bit all over the place?  How do you regroup and stay in it?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, don't give any meaning to a bad shot or anything.  My caddie helped me a lot to be patient, you know, calm.   
 Q.  You played today with Cole Swindell and Ray Allen.  What was it like playing with these two?  Did you get to chat at all out there?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I talked to Ray a lot.  He's a very nice guy.  He taught a lot of things to me.  He told me about his experience and tell me a lot.   
 Q.  You're still very close to the lead despite your struggles today.  What's your game plan, and what will you work on heading into the weekend?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have to work on everything and a lot.  I'm just going to work on it after this.   
 Q.  Even though you were frustrated the way you were hitting it, is there something more satisfying when you still put up a score when you're not happy with your play?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say my short game helped me a lot today because I keep missing the green -- and I'm not missing by two yards, I'm missing by like 10, 15 yards.  So my short game helped me a lot today.   
 Q.  Is that something you kind of learn, that this helped you become a better player, is that you can score when you're off and not to get too worried about that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I'm going to say yes because like before, when I missed the shot, I feel like, you know what, it's the end of the world.  I can't hit a good shot anymore.  Especially the last two days, today and yesterday, I'm just like bad shot, so what?  Just keep my head down and go hit the next shot.   
 Q.  You also spoke about how busy your off-season was.  Do you come here also being patient with yourself because you know you'll need some time to warm into the season?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I've been complaining a lot and way too much because I'm like why it I miss that?  I never missed that before.  And I keep saying that.  But my caddie has helped me a lot to be patient.  I didn't practice a lot in the off-season.  Maybe I have to plan my off-season this year.  I have to practice more.   
 Q.  What are some of the things that you and Ray talked about?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I asked him how to manage when you're like the best player, like how to manage everything.  He taught me -- we talked all 18 holes, and he helped me a lot with like how to manage, be like a top player.  He told me like, especially, you're a top player, what's your next goal be like?  Not only play here and wait for somebody to share with us, but we should have a next goal.  It means so much to me.  Ray is so nice to me.   
 Q.  Did he ask you anything?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No, I kept asking him questions.  He's so nice.
