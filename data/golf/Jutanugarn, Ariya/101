Q. Both rounds of 69, well played.  How is it playing together today?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: It was nice.  Keep making birdie and she made a lot of birdies.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Had so much fun, especially front nine.  I had like four birdies and she had like four birdies.
Q. Eight birdies on the front nine, so that was very good going.  Do you enjoy -- how often have you had the chance to play with each other in the professional ranks?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Not a lot.  Maybe twice this year.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Third time.  But I have a good memory the last time I played with her in MÃ©xico and I beat her in match play.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: I really enjoyed that round.  I enjoy today more.
Q. Were you playing for anything, drinks tonight?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I actually almost going to ask her before the round but I feel like, oh, I don't know how I'm going to play today, so just not say anything.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: She worries she's going to lose.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: She the big sister, so she's going to pay dinner.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, always.
Q. This golf course suits you on the front nine but the back nine was more difficult.  How were some of the hole locations out there today?  12, for example, all the way back on the par 4?
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, like when we make the turn to like No. 10, the wind just pick up.  So it made it different.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I like my back nine.  Maybe the course not really like me, but I still like it.
Q. This course does like you.  You came very close to winning last year.  But you play different types of golf.  Ariya, you're slightly stronger.  A couple of clubs less off the tee?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I feel so strong like when I play with her, and especially on the par 3.  When I look at her, oh, seven; so I hit nine, make me feel good.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: But it come up short.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Like way short, like 20 short.
Q. And you have more birdies on Tour this year.
MORIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I make more birdies than her today.
