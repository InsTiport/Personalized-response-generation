Q. How would you summarize your day?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I didn't hit that good.  Maybe I got some luck today.
So, I mean, but still have so much fun.  Just been working on my commitment, so not very good on my tee shot today.
Q. How difficult was the wind today?  It was down today, but still looked like it was pretty tricky.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, I mean, totally different than last year.  I feel like different course.  It's pretty hard this year.  When the wind pick up it's pretty hard because like the fairway is not that firm, so we didn't hit that far like we did last year.
Q. Is it more than just the wind then?  Is it the way it's set up?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I think set up the same, but the wind pick up and the fairways like pretty long and it's not firm like last year.  Because it's cold, so we're not going to be able to hit that far anymore here.
Q. How do you feel about where your game is?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel happy with my game right now.  I didn't hit like real good, but I just be patient and fight with like every shot.
Q. What have you been working on most this year?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I work the same.  I been work with Pia and Lynn like mostly for my coach, and just work on my commitment.
Because like most of the time I'm just thinking about the outcome, because all the player want to play good, win the tournament.
But when I think about the outcome, it's not help me.
Q. I'm trying to remember how well you've done here.  Have you done well here?  Has it been more challenging for you?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I mean, I always like here.  I have good memory here.  I just really want to come back here.
Q. How are you able to not focus on being in the lead and winning?  How do you keep that out of your mind?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It's very tough for me.  It's hard.  Before, every putt we just want to make it, but I know that when I'm thinking about make it I'm not going to make it.
I have to thinking about like what my coach said.
Q. What are you thinking about?  The stroke?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Just make sure I have to finish my stroke before I look at the hole or at my ball.
Q. Did you avoid looking at any leaderboards?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Do I look?  Yeah, I do.
Q. You do?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah.
Q. Does that make it harder to not focus?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.  It's only second round, so it's nothing.
