Q. Obviously conditions weren't great.  Talk me through how the course is playing today.
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   Pretty tough today, like because we have like longer iron to the green and the green is pretty tough and the pin position is also pretty tough today.
Q. How did you feel about your overall performance?
ARIYA JUTANUGARN:   It's okay.  It's not bad.  I miss lots of short putt.  I just have to working on it.  Overall I pretty happy about my game now.
