 Q.  3-under round today.  You're just one shot off the lead going into the final round.  How much fun was it out there for you today and how happy are you with your form?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I have so much fun today.  I start pretty well my front nine, halfway three birdies.  I actually have so much fun and the crowd was amazing.  They come and support all the players.  It's amazing.   
 Q.  Your first nine holes today, three birdies on the front nine and giving yourself a lot of opportunities.  A couple more putts could have dropped?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, especially the back nine I feel I have pretty good chance to make birdie.  I roll the putter pretty good.  Just didn't go in the hole.   
 Q.  How important was it for you to be playing with Charley Hull and Sung Hyun Park?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: We had so much fun.  I've been playing with Sung Hyun a lot this year and I haven't played with Charley much this year.  We just have so much fun.  They both played amazing golf today.   
 Q.  You are leading so many of the LPGA Tour categories, including the Race to the CME Globe and you're not thinking too far forward.  Are you just thinking about winning this tournament?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not even the tournament.  I have a lot of things to work on today.  I miss some shots and I just want to come back to myself.  Today I start to think about make birdie and try to catch the lead or something and it doesn't help.   
 Q.  Many of the fans supporting Sung Hyun but many of them were wearing Ariya Jutanugarn hats?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: It means so much to me.  I mean, I didn't expect to have any fan in Korea at all but this week is amazing.
