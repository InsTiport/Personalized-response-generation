 Q.  On 18 was it a misread or poor execution?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I think I just have too much break on the line because I think it's like inside left but I go outside, so I misread it.   
 Q.  But still bogey-free today; how much confidence does that give you going into the final round?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually I'm gaining a lot more confidence this week because my putting is getting better because the last few weeks my putting is not very good, but my irons and my tee shots is what's good always.   
 Q.  Just your second year on the LPGA Tour, seeking your first title.  What will the nerves be like on Sunday?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: You know, right now I'm a little bit excited, but tomorrow I think it's going to be so much fun.  Whatever it is, I'm going to take it and have fun and enjoy tomorrow.   
 Q.  Bogey-free; how hard is that to do on this course?  I know you said you liked this course earlier in the week, but how hard is that to do?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually today is not that hard.  Yesterday or the day before is a little bit hard for me, but today is pretty good.  I hit my tee shot good and my irons was good, and I still missed some irons, but I can get up-and-down good, so today is good.   
 Q.  Do you think your scrambling was the strongest part?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, actually this week, even I missed my tee shot, but I still can get out from the rough easy this week.   
 Q.  You said your putting, you kind of changed the alignment a little bit?  We talked on Thursday; have you been doing that the rest of the week, Friday and obviously today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, actually I tried to work hard on my putter because I feel like my iron and my tee shots is what's good, so I just have to work hard with my putter.   
 Q.  You haven't had necessarily great finishes this season, but did you have a goal coming into this week, particularly because it's a major, or did you try to treat it like a normal week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually before I played this one, I feel like I just want to finish top 10 because I never finish top 10 in a major, but right now I just really want to have fun and enjoy tomorrow.   
 Q.  So top 10 was the goal?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, before.   
 Q.  You're changing it now?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Maybe.   
 Q.  So seeing your name at the top of the leaderboard, you're thinking hopefully going into Sunday that's going to turn into a win; that will be the goal?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, it's my goal, but tomorrow I'm just going to do my best and have fun tomorrow.   
 Q.  How exciting is this?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Right now?   
 Q.  Yeah.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Not really.  I mean, after I finish today I just feel like -- I feel better, like feel more confident, so not really excited, but tomorrow maybe.   
 Q.  How many times did you hit driver today?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I didn't bring my driver out this week, so no driver, only 3-wood and 2-iron.   
 Q.  That's why I never saw it.  You said you do that pretty frequently just because you aren't in control with your driver?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually this course I don't think I need driver because it's pretty narrow, and I think to put the ball in the fairway is more important.  I did it in Singapore.   
 Q.  And that worked out; you thought that was the right play?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Uh-huh.   
 Q.  Whose idea was that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Who?   
 Q.  Did your sister tell you to do that?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually more my caddie.  He's like, no, no driver.  Actually in Singapore, too, he's like, no driver, hit a 2-iron to make sure it's in the fairway.   
 Q.  Did you thank him and say, okay, you're right?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, yeah, always, and nice.
