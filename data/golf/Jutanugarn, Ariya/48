 Q.  So maybe not the final round you wanted, but you still got to feel good.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, feel pretty good.  My back nine made three birdies.   
 Q.  Exactly.  That just kind of seemed the way you played this week, starting off quiet and picking up.  Do you like the back nine better?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I feel I like the back nine better, yeah.  They not really like me the front nine.   
 Q.  What about it is different?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: I don't know.  I think it's more tough on the front nine.   
 Q.  Tell us about playing with Gaby the last few days.  She seemed to be playing so well.  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Have so much fun.  I mean, it's amazing like she did a great job last two day.  Like even I know she excited, you know, nervous sometime, but she still did a great job, and so much fun to watch her play.   
So pretty good chance for me to watch like really good two golf round.   
 Q.  And now how do you feel heading to CME?  You won so much; now the $1 million on the line.  How are you feeling?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Feel okay.  I'm feel better, but I still know I still have a lot of thing to improve, especially the last two day that I know what I should work on next week.   
 Q.  I have it on the record, no driver next week?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Nope.   
 Q.  No chance?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: No.
