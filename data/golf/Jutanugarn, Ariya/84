 Q.  Are you as oblivious to the pressure?  Do you not feel the pressure that all of us think of playing in this situation?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Actually, I feel it.  I just like really excited about that.  I not feel that much pressure because I did a great job today.   
So whatever I'm going to win or loss, I'm very proud of that.   
 Q.  Finishing birdie/birdie on one of the toughest holes on the golf course, though, was that the mentality in the playoff?  
ARIYA JUTANUGARN: Yeah, you know, because I hit my same shot and (indiscernible - clapping)  ...same line.
