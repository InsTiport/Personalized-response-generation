IAN POULTER: I think the word is disappointed.  I gave him no fight at all.  It was rubbish.  It's a shame is all it is.  I didn't give him any fight at all.  Real shame.   
 Q.  In such a stark contrast to the way you played the rest of the week, can you explain it?  
IAN POULTER: No, not really.  It's bizarre.  Bizarre.  A couple of poor shots early on.  A couple of shots going left.  And that was disappointing.  Just didn't have it this afternoon.  It's a real shame.   
 Q.  And obviously the implications are, just the way the other results have gone, you come up a fraction short in terms of the Masters.  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I guess I should never listen to other people.  When you finish a round of golf and the press and everybody telling you you're in the Masters, and then you get a text message ten minutes before you tee off to correct everybody, to say, oh, we've made a mistake, actually, no, that was wrong, you're not in.  You need to go and win.  Not that that's an excuse or any form or factor, it's a little disappointing.   
I asked three times, four times, are you sure, are you sure, are you sure?   
Yeah, you're definitely in.   
No, I'm not definitely in.  So next time I won't listen to other people.  I'll do my bit and focus better.   
 Q.  But definitely not a factor in this afternoon?  
IAN POULTER: I don't think so.  I mean I can't put that down as an excuse.  It would be an excuse if I said it.  So it's disappointing to be given the wrong information, but that's -- that wasn't any part of this afternoon.   
 Q.  You're going to head to Houston next week, and give it one last crack?  
IAN POULTER: I don't know yet, I haven't decided.  I'm tired.  It's been a long week.  It's been a draining week.  I don't know.  I'll wait until Monday night and if I have the energy then I will.
