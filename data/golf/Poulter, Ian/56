Q. Through the weekend, and Kevin had to withdraw there, talk about the match.
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I mean it's a strange outcome, strange finish to a match.
I kind of conceded the first hole, he was 20 feet away.  I knocked it over the green, didn't get it on the green.  So I gave him that hole.
Both of us in a similar position, 30 feet away on 2.  He three-putts, I two-putt, so it's back to all square.
And then from that point he had a little bit of trouble in the hazards.  He hit it in the hazard on 3 and hit it in the hazard on 4, and was short right in some sort of hazard on 5.
I warmed up with him in the trailer this morning.  Didn't know anything was wrong, but obviously something wasn't quite right.
And then I chipped it down to a couple of feet on 9, going to tap that in to be 3-up going to the 10th and he comes over and says, "Ian, I can't go anymore holes.  My back is not right."  So hopefully he gets better soon.  Strange ending to a match.  I've never had that happen before.  But I guess it's a rest this afternoon for me, even though it's twenty past four.  Hopefully I can conserve some energy and have a strong weekend.
Q. Did you feel like you were hitting the ball well?
IAN POULTER: Yeah, hitting it good.  I feel like my game is real solid.  I'm starting to roll the putt quite nicely, which is good.  That's the one area that I feel that I needed to do some work this week.  So hopefully we can continue that theme.
