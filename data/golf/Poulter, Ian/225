Q.   Do you feel like you're giving the boys behind something to feed off of?
IAN POULTER:   I mean, it was a very intense match right from that first tee shot, and it was really important to come out on top of that match.   We was 2â€‘up, poor second shot from me on 15, really; 16, which caused us to lose a hole there.   But a win is a win. 

Q.   How much pressure do you feel coming down the last when it's not only crucial for your match but possibly crucial for the Cup? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Absolutely.   We won ugly today.   I felt like that was a good point for us.   I felt like we didn't have our best stuff today, so to win that point was massive.

Q.   Tell us about that first tee. 
IAN POULTER:   I'll tell you about it:   It was ridiculous.   It was a special moment.   That was pretty special with Bubba yesterday to pump them up.   It was an amazing amphitheater to stand there and hit that first tee shot anyway when it's quiet.   I knew Bubba was going to do it today, so why not join him?
