Q.   Thoughts on the game? 
IAN POULTER:   Needs evaluating.

Q.   Certainly it's been a tricky couple of days; is it health that's an issue? 
IAN POULTER:   No. 

Q.   But your own play not up to your normal high standards, I'm sure? 
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, fair assessment. 

Q.   What do you think playing Thomas, it was nip and tuck throughout, wasn't it, in some respects. 
IAN POULTER:   Look, you know, Thomas has played well and he's played well enough to beat me.   That's what the match says. 
You know, my view is, I'm disappointed, simple.   I should have been able to finish.   The match.   I didn't; so I'm going home.

Q.   No consolation taking it to the wire?
IAN POULTER:   No.   There's no consolation about any loss in any match.   It's completely unacceptable as far as I'm concerned.   Concentration simply wasn't there.   So therefore, you make mental errors when obviously you haven't used your brain the way you should.
