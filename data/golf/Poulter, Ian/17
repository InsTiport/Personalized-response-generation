IAN POULTER: Not making a double bogey and four bogeys.   
 Q.  Do you think the new schedule this year has made it easier or harder for you to get your game where you want it to prepare for the four majors?  
IAN POULTER: I actually like the schedule.  I think the schedule is pretty good.  It enables me to have a good amount of time at home in the UK, which is great.  I travel back from the U.S. Open and then back to the UK after the WGC.  So I don't mind it.  I actually think the schedule is okay.

IAN POULTER: It's pretty good.   
 Q.  What is the expectation for a golfer --  
IAN POULTER: To win.   
 Q.  What does it do for the golfer when he gets on the course and how does it affect him and the playing?  
IAN POULTER: I mean, there's no affect at all.  We're here to win, right?  So when you tee off you play with a mindset to win, that's it.
