  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 IAN POULTER: A little bit disappointed. Three bogeys, one was a 3-putt. Yeah, just a little bit disappointed. I played well, hit some good golf shots, left a few putts short and that's what I felt on our front nine; that they were a little bit slower for some reason.  
  
  Q. You've been putting poorly this year by your standards, averaging over 30; are you trying different things? Is it getting frustrating? What's happening?   
 IAN POULTER: I've got a new putter in the bag. It seems to be working all right. I'm making enough birdies. But it's the bogeys that are costing me right now.   
 Looking at my statistics, four tournaments previous to the U.S. Open, 57 birdies and three eagles, so if you look at that, I'm making my fair share.   
 But what I am doing is still making some bogeys and a couple of them out there today were a little bit frustrating. I don't like to 3-putt and it's unusual I do 3-putt. Yeah, things are all right.   
  
  Q. New challenge for you this, golf course, not being played on the Tour before; what change does it represent?  
 IAN POULTER: I think it's good. I think it's a testing golf course, even though you see 9-under par on the leaderboard right now.   
 You have to play well, and if you have hit a few wide tee shots, there's some wispy stuff to contend with, but you still have to hole putts. And to shoot 9-under par which is a good score today, you have to do that. But you've got your good golf shots as well and you can't just keep rolling balls in from 25 feet.
