IAN POULTER: Danny had nothing to lose, did he.  So I had to come out and play strong.  That's what I did today.  I played pretty solid.  A couple of sloppy holes but to be honest, I played well and holed some decent putts and obviously made it very difficult for him.
Q. Elaborate on the putting, and to clinch the match itself?
IAN POULTER: Obviously want to close this match out as early as possible and get back out to see the lads.  A little extra concentration on the 25 footer and obviously rolled it in the middle.
Q. You've said throughout it's a team event, but from a personal point of view, it's nice to have this form at the start of the year?
IAN POULTER: It's always nice to play match-play golf whether it's the start or the end.  It's nice to get that buzz out on the golf course to, get that nervous feeling going, and I played good golf, so I'm pretty happy.
Q. Going to be a big year, isn't it?
IAN POULTER: I hope so.  I'm looking forward to 2016.  I need to get back to business and see if I can take care of a couple of wins.
Q. Good for The European Team?
IAN POULTER: We have got a very, very young team out here this week.  A lot of these guys playing this week are going to be putting that shirt on come what September.  So this is good for them.  It's good to have that team room experience.  And the guys that make it come September obviously are going to feel pretty good.
