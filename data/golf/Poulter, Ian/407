  Q. How are you feeling with your game?   
 IAN POULTER:  I am very, very happy with my game. I have had some good success over in America, so I am certainly looking at getting off to a good start this week   
  
  Q. You have a nice pro-am group to start with today.   
 IAN POULTER:  Yes. I played with Ray (Parlour) last week, which was good fun. I played with Lee (Dixon) a few months back. Two good guys and I am sure we will have some fun out there. I have not played with Andriy Schevchenko, so that should be interesting.   
    
  Q. As an Arsenal fan, I guess you will have a few comments for him?   
 IAN POULTER:  Oh, I'm sure I will!   
    
  Q. What would it mean to put your name alongside some of the other great champions of this tournament?   
 IAN POULTER:  This is a tournament that I have watched for many, many years. I came here to watch Woosie, Faldo, Seve, Ernie so many times, even before I was a golf pro. It means a lot. I would put it up there with the Volvo Masters I won. It would be a nice win if I get that far on Sunday.   
    
  Q. Are you staying at home this week?   
 IAN POULTER:  No, I'm staying at Foxhills, down the road.   
    
  Q. What are your thoughts on how the course plays after Ernie's changes?   
 IAN POULTER:  It's good. There are a few extra bunkers. He seems to have moved the ditch on 12, which makes that par five a bit funky. It will play a bit different this year again.
