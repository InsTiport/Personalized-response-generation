  STEVE TODD:   Ian, many thanks for joining us here back at the Ballantine's Championship, your second year here.   Just wonder if you can start by reflecting on last week, you finished with a 66 on the back of a good performance at the Masters; you must come in here with a bit of momentum. 
IAN POULTER:   That's always nice.   Looking back over the last month how I've played, looking at Bay Hill, I played great; had a chance to win there.   So finishing third at Bay Hill, taking a week off, going to Augusta, and having a great showing there with nine holes to play, I really felt like I had a great chance to win, which was very nice. 
And then last week, got off to a slow start, didn't really hole many putts early in the week, and then on Sunday, made nine birdies, which was nice.   And hopefully I can carry that form and that putting into this week, which will make it a great week. 
STEVE TODD:   Your second year, as you said, back here at the Championship, but wonder if you can reflect on the tournament.   Ballantine's put on a great event, and also reflect on the course and how you feel it sets up for you. 
IAN POULTER:   Ballantine's know how to run tournaments; this being one of their prestigious events of the year, and I think they do it very, very well. 
For me last year, obviously I didn't kind of play as well as I would have liked to.   I was pushing right towards the end, and made an eagle at the last, unfortunately to miss the cut by a shot.   Westwood, who made the cut on the mark, went on to win the golf tournament.   So that's how close it could have been. 
So this year, I would like to turn that around.   I would like to take the good form on to the golf course and be able to have a chance to win this golf tournament.   You know, I think to be here, to represent Ballantine's this week, they have done a great job and I'm very happy to be here. 

Q.   So just as it is around the world, you have many, many fans here in Korea.   Last year there were many galleries because of you, and I think maybe that somehow could have impacted your game.   So if you could talk about the attitude of the gallery and also why you have so many fans here in Korea.   Could you tell us why? 
IAN POULTER:   Why I have so many fans?   I guess I'm popular.   I guess, you know, Koreans to me, like to dress well.   They like lots of colour, and obviously for me to be able to bring my clothing line to Korea and wear it and basically showcase it over here, I think people relate to that. 
So therefore, I have a good relationship with pretty much most of Asia, but Korea especially is a place that I like to come and play golf because I've got such a good fan base. 
I thought the galleries were very good, actually.   It was only my second time here in Korea playing golf.   The first time was in the Kolon Korean Open, where I finished second; and obviously last year to come back.   
I thought everybody was very, very good, and I'm very much hoping that the galleries this year are going to be bigger and better.   I think to come to this golf course for the second time, I think is good.   I think the facilities that they have here are very impressive.   Hopefully the fans can come out and hopefully the weather is nice enough for everybody to come and see us all play. 

Q.   Two questions.   You are known a very fashionable gentleman, so would like to know about your favourite colors and favourite style.   And the second question is beginning this week, how are you going to manage the course? 
IAN POULTER:   Well, firstly, I'm going to manage the course a little better than I did last year.   I'm going to hold more putts this year than I did last year, and you know, I will gain more experience the more times I play this golf course. 
So tomorrow for me to play in the Pro‑Am, to have another look at this golf course, I'm very much looking forward to that, and obviously then to go on and try to win this golf championship through Sunday. 
Second question, favourite colour?   Pink, Poulter Pink for me I think is obviously one of the colors.   But generally, fashion in general, I like all of my colors.   And I think to be honest, Ballantine's saw that last year.   It was very popular here in Korea.
So IJP Design, we have come up with the Ballantine's Championship to be the Official Sponsor and Official Apparel Partner for this Championship.   So for me, I think it's a big move to be able to do that and something that we have been working hard to do. 
I hopefully can showcase this week, play very nice, and everybody can enjoy the week. 

Q.   You are the top 25 in the world, and you are also known around the world to be one of the most fashionable golfers.   So of the two adjectives, which do you prefer, great golf skills or great fashion sense?   So out of those two, which would you prefer?   And also, I heard that with famous golfers, before the game starts, they decide what they are going to wear on the different days, so I was wondering if you also have your clothing plan in place before you go into the game. 
IAN POULTER:   Yes, to answer that question.   I have my outfits picked out for the week.   So I before I come to Korea, I know exactly what I'm wearing and on what days, which is always good.   
Would I like to be known as a good golfer or someone who wears great, great clothes?   I'd like to be known for both.   I'm not picking one over the other.     First and foremost, I've been able to win more than 13 tournaments around the world, so I am a good golfer.   It's dead simple. 
But I also look good on the golf course.   So I'm not going to pick one over the other.   So I think they both go together very well.

Q.   So how many different outfits do you wear throughout the year? 
IAN POULTER:   Ah, how many times do I play?   (Pausing to think)   I almost wear a different one every time I play.   So hundreds.   Hundreds and hundreds.   It's easy for me because the tartan trousers that I wear have four different colors, so therefore, one pair of trousers, tartans go with four different shirts, so you can mix‑and‑match.   But general outfits throughout the whole year?   A lot. 
STEVE TODD:   Ian, many thanks for joining us.   Best of luck this week.
