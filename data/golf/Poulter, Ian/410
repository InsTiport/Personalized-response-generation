Q.  Comments on the day, Ian; are you happy?
IAN POULTER:  No, I missed too many putts on the front nine and I missed two great chances on the back nine.

On 12 and 13, two six foot putts, which really, you know, would have put me right back in there and made another couple of birdies.

But, you know, frustrating.  Tiger hasn't really done anything yet today.  He's 1 under par and he's let everybody back in it.  So I'm just annoyed to be at the minimum six shots.  I think it was a great chance today, certainly with him not doing anything around the front nine there, was a chance to shoot a decent score; Adam did.  He holed the right putts.  He hit good shots.  And unfortunately, I missed a couple.
Q.  You could have been three or four closer.
IAN POULTER:  Yeah, realistic chance is four closer, really, and that would have been 14 under par.  That would have been really nice.

If I have a low, low, low one, I mean, it's possible.  Depends what he does tomorrow really.
Q.  Obviously you're still giving yourself chances so the form is still there.
IAN POULTER:  Yeah, it's all there.  It's all there.  Patience.  Kind of gets frustrating.
