 Q.   What is your verdict on the week?   
IAN POULTER:   Well, I guess it was a good defense.   Obviously a little disappointed not to put my hands back on the trophy, but 15 birdies and an eagle at the weekend is some pretty good golf.   
So it's exciting for the next few weeks ahead, and obviously it's some good points on the board obviously for Ryder Cup and Race to Dubai.   So been a good week.  
   
 Q.   Earlier on, looked like The Ryder Cup, the three of you‑‑  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, it was nice, we all shot 66 today.   Everybody's made birdies and it made it interesting.   Obviously Dustin, going birdie, eagle there at 15, 16, kind of finished the job.   It was good golf and it was good fun to play in that group.   Obviously plenty of birdies.   
   
 Q.   This bodes well going into Dubai.   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I'm in great form.   I really am playing well.   The work I've done, obviously leading up to this run of tournaments has really worked and I couldn't be hitting it any better right now and obviously rolling a few putts in.
