Q.   A bogey‑free, 3‑under par 68 today.   How did it go?
IAN POULTER:   It was a nice day.   Obviously no mistakes.   3 birdies, I could have got a few more, but I guess it's in a nice position right now heading into Sunday and Monday.   I'm looking forward to the weekend. 
If I keep up this type of golf, hopefully I can be within a shot or two.

Q.   You picked a great time to start playing well.   You're a little bit outside the bubble for next week.   I know that's looking a little bit ahead of yourself.   What's your goal, what do you want to get yourself going into that last week in Atlanta?
IAN POULTER:   This week?   If I win this week I'll be in a nice position.   I've got no idea where it would take me.   I don't even know where I need to finish this week to move forward.   I don't care. 
If I go out and win this week then I know I'll move forward.   I know that for a fact.
