   IAN POULTER:  One bad golf shot. That sixth doesn't fit my eye. Tricky tee shot. I pushed it 15 yards right and mad double. 
 Eighth I went in the bunker, hit it a tiny bit heavy and made double. 
From there, I played flawless golf. Hit the green on the tenth and lipped out from 15 feet for eagle. I knew how to hang in there and keep hitting decent shots. It is frustrating as I am hitting so many good golf shots and missing a few putts. But if I keep doing what I am doing a few will go in and there is a chance for me tomorrow. 

 Q.  How do you control the fuse burning in your head as you go to the tenth tee? 
 IAN POULTER:  There is no dampening at all. I am fuming inside. There was nothing in my mind but have a go at that green. I will never give up and I am passionate about how I play golf. I don't want anyone to try and stop me being like that as I enjoy playing golf that way. 

 Q. Four back at the moment? 
 IAN POULTER:  Keep doing what I am doing and I will have 15 birdie putts tomorrow. Take away a few of them, and who knows. 
I drove the ball very well and had a lot of birdie putts. Seven birdie putts within 12 feet on the back nine. There is 18 holes to go tomorrow. 

 Q.  You know how to win? 
 IAN POULTER:  There are other winners out there but how I felt today was as nice and burning inside as I have felt for a long time. It felt good and I was happy to play golf. When you you keep hitting to 12 feet you want to keep playing. I am aggressive and looked at every pin today. I am good enough to play at every pin.
