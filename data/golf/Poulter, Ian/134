 Q.   How is your son?  
IAN POULTER:   He's gotten a little better. I got back last night, he was a little more perky.   He had a few nebulizers during the day, the antibiotics and that kicking in.   He had a smile on his face, which is good.  
   
 Q.   What's it's been like to play golf with him on your mind the last couple of days?  
IAN POULTER:   You know, obviously I can't do anything, I can't miracaly (sic) make him better.   I'm on the golf course for four and a half hours.   Obviously when I get off obviously I want to get home and I want to be there with him.   
So, you know, I can kind of switch it on and off.   But it was good to see him make an improvement yesterday when I got back.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on the round.   1-over making the turn for the day but a nice finish on the front-9 getting 3 back.  
IAN POULTER:   Two simple up and downs which I didn't make on the front half out, I would have expected to get 9 and 10 up and down.   Then 16 the par 5, I'm in the back bunker and 95 percent conversion for a birdie and I don't do that out of the back bunker.   
I probably left three on that 9.   Played some good golf on the front side.   I had a lot of chances.   Took a couple.   I'm in position for the weekend.  
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts because we got 13-under on the board but not a lot of people between you and the top.  
IAN POULTER:   Anything can happen on this golf course.   We've seen it through the years.   The greens are drying out slightly.   They were a tiny bit quicker today.   They obviously cut them down.   They're getting baked out there in the sun.   We're all roasting right now.   This afternoon won't get any easier.   The breeze will pick up slightly and I'm in position.
