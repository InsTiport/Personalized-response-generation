Q.   3‑under through 11 yesterday, 3‑under for seven today; what's your verdict overall?
IAN POULTER:   I would say relatively pleased.   Would have been nice to birdie the last.   I was going in there with 4‑iron, really should have hit that green.   Coming off there with par‑‑ so 6‑under par is right in position.   I need to keep pressing obviously over the next three days and continue to hole some nice putts and play good golf.

Q.   Receptive greens at the moment and the course is obviously able to be attacked, you love to attack; does it feel like it's right in your wheelhouse?
IAN POULTER:   Five par 5s; I've picked up a bit of length off the tee in the five weeks off and that's definitely made a difference on the 5s last week and it's making a difference this week, as well. 
So if I can be aggressive on the 5s, then and keep attacking the golf course, as you said, the greens are soft and guys are rolling some putts in.
