   IAN POULTER: To be honest, I actually played pretty well today, drove it very well, had a lot of good birdie putts but just shaved edges, and that's how difficult this golf course is. You know, when you hit good golf shots and they miss the odd ridge by a foot, kind of leaves you a tricky birdie putt, and that's a little frustrating.

 Q. You got to 7-under par with a birdie at the 3rd, and I think at that stage you were just four shots back and we thought you might make a charge from there. Were you feeling that out there?
 IAN POULTER: I knew I had to make birdies, and I certainly played well enough today. I hit two very poor tee shots today, one on 10 and one on 8, both making bogey off of, and you can't really do that. 8 is a par-5, you should be making birdie to that easy pin position and I made bogey, so I gave two shots away to the field there, and a poor tee off of 10 and that cost me, and that's that.

 Q. What you're saying is the difference between today's round and your first two rounds is actually very, very fine margins?
 IAN POULTER: Yes, fine, but I played pretty flawless the first two days. I didn't drive it as well at all, though, yesterday; hung in there, but a double bogey on the par-3 12th was no reason to get frustrated with the driver. I was level par every time I hit driver. And then today I just made two poor tee shots, but I played well enough to make more birdies.

 Q. In terms of the overall performance, it's another good week for you at Augusta. Does it kind of increase the conviction you think you could win here one day?
 IAN POULTER: I'm not happy walking away from this golf course finishing 10th. I'm pretty mad right now. I've got every reason to be. I was leading on Friday. I didn't play at all yesterday, I played well today, and I'm not happy.

 Q. But atmosphere over the week, have you enjoyed the week?
 IAN POULTER: No, I finished 10th. I mean, the whole week is awesome. Every time you come and play Augusta, it's great, don't get me wrong. But I just hope Lee makes a couple of birdies to come in and win this tournament. It's a shame I finished where I did, but I'm rooting Lee on now to hopefully close this tournament out.
