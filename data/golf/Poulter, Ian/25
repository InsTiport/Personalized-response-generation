Q. 8-under, was it as easy as you made it look today?
IAN POULTER: No, it wasn't easy.  Greens are starting to firm up and a couple of those pin locations are tough to get at.
So going out today, knowing you're going to have to go really low, and you've got to play smart into some of those pins.  Hitting it to 25 feet on some of those holes would be a great shot, and you don't need to short-side yourself because chipping on to the firm greens, downgrain, it's kind of impossible.
So really happy obviously with that result.  Last week was a slightly different feeling, tripling 16.  But to finish with three birdies in the last three holes today is obviously kind of makes amends for some of that last week.
Q. Sixth in Abu Dhabi and second in Houston, you've only missed two cuts in 22 tournaments since winning in Houston.  Consistency is there, but obviously you want to take it up a notch?
IAN POULTER: I didn't know the stats until you just told me.
When I look back at last year, when I look at the form I'm in, when I look and plan my schedule for this year, I feel good.  I don't feel 43.  It's quite funny, you know, playing today, being told afterwards that he followed me around 11, 12 years to go and now we're playing against each other.
It's nice -- I'm getting old but there's still a few miles left in these legs.
Q. Some of the older generation featured in our Content Committee, a hit in social media, as well as Monty's Pythons; do you wish you'd been in that circle?
IAN POULTER: I've made myself look silly enough through the years.  It's nice to be left out of that for a change.
I love what The European Tour boys do from a perspective of having a laugh on Tour.  We enjoy it.  I think the fans at home quite enjoy it and it brings a different side of us out, which maybe some of the fans don't already know.
