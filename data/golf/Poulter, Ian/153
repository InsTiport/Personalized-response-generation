 Q.  Involved in yet again another successful European Ryder Cup Team.  How does that feel for you now?  IAN POULTER: Amazing, truly exceptional.  The boys had to dig deep today.  And the team speech, we said it earlier in the week, don't get complacent.  I don't think anybody was really getting too complacent. But the Americans were coming at us strong.   The board looked very good for them for a long period of time, but a lot of key matches today, G-Mac turned his match around.  I haven't watched all of it obviously because I was playing -- I've been busy.  Jamie finished his match early.  You have to look at Justin, he was down quite considerably and managed to turn that around, as well. So the boys dug in deep, and I'm so happy for Paul.  He's worked really hard this week.  He's been an exceptional captain and I can't wait to see him hold that trophy.   Q.  Looking back, when you reflect on this Ryder Cup we'll realize how important your chip-in was yesterday in terms of momentum for Team Europe?  IAN POULTER: It's not just about the odd chip in.  When you look at the matches that did turn, you can't just say one shot.  You've got to say about all the putts and chips and bunker shots and everything.  This is a team effort.  Everyone has done their job this week, and I can't be more proud right now.   Q.  For you personally, how does this compare to all the success you've had in Ryder Cups previously?  IAN POULTER: Ryder Cups are Ryder Cups.  You take these to your grave.  You remember lots of things.  You make stronger friendships in these weeks, and that's exactly what we've done again.
