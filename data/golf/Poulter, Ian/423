Q.
Still just two behind.
IAN POULTER:  Steady.  If you'd asked me this morning what I would shoot in these conditions, 3-under par would be a good score.  I shot 3-under par.  I've left quite a few out there.  Especially the last couple of holes it was really tricky.

We probably teed off a little bit too late today.  The last couple of holes, just the last couple of holes it's getting a little bit dark.  You have a 20-foot putt with a little bit of break and it's quite dark, it's quite difficult to read the line in the putt because it's a little bit too dark.  But I played lovely.
Q.  And for the weekend?
IAN POULTER:  Perfectly, perfectly poised.
