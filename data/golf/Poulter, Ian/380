  Q. Looked like you may have lost your cool midway through the round, what are your comments on that?  
 IAN POULTER: Apparently I just have to clear something up for everybody. It was windy; it was rainy; it was on the 10th green; and quite frankly, what was heard was not what was said. You know, I was frustrated that I had left a putt short. I said, "Get it to the hole, you ponce."  
It was heard completely different from what I hear, and if that's the case I apologize to anybody out there that was listening that would have heard it any different to that.   
 I spoke to my playing partners, I spoke to my caddie, I spoke to the guys out on the green. That is clearly what I said, but obviously it's been interpreted another way, and that's a shame. I'm a bit disappointed that it's come across another way, but I haven't done anything wrong.   
 So I'm quite happy and I'm comfortable with myself that I haven't said anything that I shouldn't have said. So if it has, and if it's come across that way, apologise to anyone that's listening.  
  
  Q. You have shot a 69, you're 4-under now and it is a course you've done well on in the past, you've had four Top-10s in the last five years. Clearly this is a pace where you feel you can return to some of your best form?  
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, it is, very comfortable out here on this golf course. I like it. It fits my eye. Just need to get that ball going in the hole, stop leaving it short, get it to the hole. I've played well here in the last five years, and I'd like to continue to do so.
