IAN POULTER:  I didn't really hit it that great actually last few holes but managed to pick up a couple of birdies.  Hit it fat into 15 and hit my second shot fat into 16 and managed to chip in.  Played a lovely shot into 17 and holed the putt and a lovely bunker shot at the last.
Q.  Lovely is an understatement, you enjoyed that one, didn't you?
IAN POULTER:  Yes, I wanted to finish without making a mistake at the last and it was nice to get up-and-down.
Q.  We know a that a couple of greens were mown accidentally; was there any difference in the way they putted?
IAN POULTER:  No, they were absolutely fine.  17 wasn't any quicker, although I had an 8-footer that it didn't look as if it had been cut.  It wasn't as if there was any advantage gained by anybody by them being cut.  They were fine.
Q.  Does it matter whether you are in the last group or not?
IAN POULTER:  I'd like to be in the last group.  It's always nice to be in the last group.  You're playing well and you can see what's happening and you know what you have to do, so I would like to be in the last group.
Q.  You're known for your attacking style of play and on this course you need to be patient, have you had to pare down your aggressive style?
IAN POULTER:  A little bit.  I think I am taking on the pins that I really want to go for, and I'm not going for silly pins.  I'm not taking too much club to put it past the pin on some of these holes which you just can't do, otherwise you are going to make bogey, so I am playing sort of cautiously and on the other hand I'm attacking when I can.
