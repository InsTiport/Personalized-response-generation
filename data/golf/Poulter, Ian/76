Q. Good bounceback, wasn't it?
IAN POULTER: I had 34 putts.  So I'm a little warm still.  I'm really frustrated to be honest.  I've come over here to play well.  My game's in shape.
The saviour to this golf course this week is going to be the pins on the front of the greens, because the greens are firm.  I don't think I did a very good job yesterday with leaving it the right side on some of those pins.  And because of that, made a couple of silly, sloppy mistakes.  Should have got up-and-down a couple of times.  Didn't putt great.  Didn't putt good at all today, and you know, I've had chances all the way down the stretch coming in.  You know, I really didn't take them.
I holed a 25-footer on 10, which was great.  I holed a 15-footer for eagle on the par 5, and from there in, I really good opportunities to birdie all the way back into the clubhouse and I didn't do it.
So I could have given myself a lie-in.  Obviously going to have to get up at 5.00 in the morning, but the early plus is I'll be able to watch Arsenal beat Chelsea tomorrow.
Q. Continuing on your game, you did highlight coming into this that the putting was an area that you were looking for improvement in.  So is it a continuation of that situation?
IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was absolutely shocking today.  Not good enough.  Unacceptable.  I don't know how many words to describe how poor I thought it was to be honest with you.  It was pathetic, it really was.  It was unacceptable.  The putting's not good enough.  My game's in shape.  I've hit 17 greens in regulation today on a tricky golf course.  So I'm pleased about that.
And I'm pleased that I haven't flown all the way across the pond to not be playing golf at the weekend, because I would be seriously pissed off if I was sitting at home this weekend.  I mean, I would be not happy.
So job well done today but it not good enough.  It's just simply not good enough.  Not from how I've been playing.
Q. So a man of your experience, do you have any clues, any ideas on how to remedy it?
IAN POULTER: No.  Have you?
Q. No, I'm the wrong person to does.
IAN POULTER: You've been watching it.  No, it's frustrating because I'm not holing the putts I feel I should.  When you hit good golf shots on tricky golf holes and you hit it to eight feet and you want to take advantage of it, and play the hole in three when guys on average are going to play it in 4.4, you're not doing your job when you've broken the back of the hole with two great shots and you're not taking advantage where you should.  I didn't take advantage at all today.  25-footer and a 15-footer, that's it.
Q. Quick word on the Cup final.  Early tee off time; Wembley is not that far away.  Would you be able to get there?
IAN POULTER: I suppose I could.
Q. Looking for a ticket?
IAN POULTER: I know the right man to ask.
Q. What are your thoughts on the game?
IAN POULTER: I mean, it would be a tiny bit of consolation in some respects.  I mean, it will still be a very disappointing season, won't it.  No Champions League is going to upset a few players on the team, big players that expect to be playing big football, and simply, they are not.  It's going to be disappointing.
I think the only outcome is going to be the team will have to come out and spend money, very quickly, in the window, which is probably what you're going to see.  Unlike normal, leaving it till the last four minutes.  Panic buying, just to please a couple of fans; I think it's been too little, too late.  They need to spend some cash.  They have got enough of it.
