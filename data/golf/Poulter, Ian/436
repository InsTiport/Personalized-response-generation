Q. What a great day again for you, Ian.
IAN POULTER:  Yes, for the large majority of that round, once again my game was flawless, incredible. Stewy missed the fairway left at the first, and I followed him left off the first tee and I knew he didn't play very well yesterday and I didn't want to keep following him into the rough because then it is going to be a hard day so I then looked away every time he was hitting his shots and just concentrated on making sure I hit the fairways and I started to do that after the third or fourth and I got on a run where I hit it to about ten feet and holed it and just kept hitting it close from there and kept rolling the putts in. He is then on the back foot and every opportunity I had I seemed to take it. Holing my second shot on the tenth helped as well obviously, nine iron from 132 yards, very nice.
Q. You seem to have gathered a lot of momentum this week already.
IAN POULTER:  I feel good, I am hitting it close and I am rolling my putts in which is obviously going to upset your opponent and that is what you have got to try and do as early as possible in your matches and what I will try to continue to do. I am a very happy camper.
Q. You don't seem to be having any problems with the greens.
IAN POULTER: Well, they are the same for everybody, aren't they? You have to take it, everybody knows the situation and you know you are going to miss a couple of putts because they bobble off line but as long as you stay focused, you'll be fine.
