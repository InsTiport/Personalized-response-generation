Q. You've been close here twice.  Is there something about this golf course that's difficult to catch a leader on a Sunday?
IAN POULTER: It's going to be difficult now.  If I think back to when I was chasing Henrik down, Henrik played incredible golf in tough conditions.  It's a hard golf course to press on.
I think this morning I was surprised to see as many decent rounds underway around that front side.  The greens were softer at 12:20 than I would have expected, so I think they have kind of put all the juice on them last night, I don't think there will be much on them tonight and that's going to make it even more difficult.  I think the greens need to be soft for someone to go very low to catch someone that's out in front.  Unless we get -- you're going to need to do what Tiger did on that front side tomorrow; you're going to need to be 6-under through nine.
Q. It was a big week for you last year and it could be again.
IAN POULTER: Walking off 17 having a look at the board, T-2, finished that last year and would have been very nice to par the last, I'll say that.  That water is going to taste like acid in a minute when I finally have a drink.  I'm raging right now.  Not happy.  Extremely disappointing from the position I was in on 18.  I couldn't imagine if I would have had 50 attempts again from where I was where I would make double, but I managed to do it right there.  So it's a shame.  I was in the position, 10-under par, I needed to be in to have a realistic go probably of catching them tomorrow.
Q. Along the same line, in the last six years there have been 25 Europeans with top-10 finishes here.  What is it about this golf course that seems to fit, that seems to -- that the European players seem to do well on?
IAN POULTER: Not really sure.  I haven't really studied it enough to work that out, but it's a tough golf course.  It's a clever golf course.  You need to play super smart.  It can get windy around here and the greens can get firm.  We like tough conditions, so I guess that could be one of the reasons why we like it.  You can't be overly aggressive when it toughens up.
