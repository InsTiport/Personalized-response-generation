  MODERATOR:   Ian Poulter, thanks for joining us again for a few minutes.   1-under 69 Round 3 of the Crown Plaza Invitational at Colonial.   You're glad you got the round in and you find yourself in good position heading into tomorrow, so just a few comments.
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I think it was a bonus to get done today.   When we looked at the forecast this morning or even last night, we knew there was a storm coming.   I think it was breaking up as we were out on the golf course.   So pleased we got done, pleased how I played.   Just a little mishap there on 10, in a good position, felt like I hit it on my line.   I was looking at a right edge putt, I hit it right edge, it didn't break and then a few more putts it took to get in the hole.   Two more good birdies coming in on the back nine.   Shame I couldn't convert the one there at 17 or 18.   I'm in good position.   Kevin's playing well and there's a few guys right behind as well, so hopefully we can get some golf in tomorrow.   We're going to have to wait and see what the weather's going to do with us.

Q.   When you go into tomorrow, what kind of strategy do you have knowing there are a lot of guys up there and with the weather being the way it is, you know, low rounds are out there, do you just kind of wait and see what happens?
IAN POULTER:   Stay dry, make a few birdies and try to finish one ahead of the rest.   I mean, you know, I'm hitting the fairways, I'm hitting it into good spots on the green, so I'm having a lot of looks for birdie.   I've got to do the same thing.   If I convert a couple more putts -- my putting's very good this week, if I can continue with that, then obviously I'm going to be right there or thereabouts.

Q.   Ian, are you concerned that the Colonial plaid may clash with the tartan IJP stuff?
IAN POULTER:   No, I can always deal with another plaid jacket in my closet so it will look just fine with my outfit tomorrow.

Q.   Ian, given your stellar match play record and the fact that you're in the final group again of Kevin, do you like that kind of being able to stare at the leader, or because there's so many people bunched up behind you that maybe it doesn't matter?
IAN POULTER:   I'm not thinking about it match play/stroke play.   It's very easy to think too far ahead.   You know, as you said, there's a few good guys right behind and that are only a couple of shots off.   I just have to focus on the first hole tomorrow, make sure I put it in that fairway, make a couple putts and then move on to the second.   I won't be thinking anything past that, to be honest.   This is a good golf course, there's some testy holes out there and you have to play smart.

Q.   Now that you've got your putting straightened out, you look really comfortable out there.   Do you finally feel like you're playing Ian Poulter golf again after a stretch?
IAN POULTER:   I feel like I'm playing good golf.   I'm not sure what Ian Poulter golf is or when you're referring back to, but I would like to continue hitting the ball as well as I have from the start of this season.   I've led strokes gained from tee to green a number of times this year, and if I continue to do that, if I keep rolling the ball the way I have been this week, then I'm certainly going to be able to take my chances soon enough.
MODERATOR:   All right, Ian, we appreciate your time as always.   Best of luck tomorrow.
IAN POULTER:   Thank you.
