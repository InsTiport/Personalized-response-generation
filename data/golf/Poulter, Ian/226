Q.   Ian, one of the great performances I described in Ryder Cup history.   Did you have a sense that was coming when things were going along pretty slowly on the front side? 
IAN POULTER:   Well, no.   We needed to get something going. 
I mean, it was very flat at the back there today and we was down and it was really hard.   I mean, the guys kept putting it in play and making it difficult for us to kind of get back at them. 
But we had to make birdies, and, wow, I mean, five in a row, it was awesome.   It was just‑‑ I mean, I've got world No. 1 by my side backing me up, and it allows me to go ahead and hit some golf shots. 
You know what, it's pretty fun, this Ryder Cup. 

Q.   He said it was awesome.   How would you describe what you just watched your partner do? 
RORY McILROY:   Incredible.   Incredible.   Standing on the 13th tee 2‑down, making that run like we did, at least I had a little bit to do with it; I birdied 13 and then this man took over.   Incredible to be a part of, and you know, when Poults gets that look in his eyes, especially the week of The Ryder Cup, it's really impressive.
