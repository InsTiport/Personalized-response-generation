  IAN POULTER:   I think I left some shots out on the golf course.   And 5-under is not really a true reflection of how I've played, and I'm a bit disappointed.

Q.   You certainly put yourself in a position to win, with English only at 10-under.   Do you think you have a pretty good chance going in tomorrow?
IAN POULTER:   We'll have to see.   He's probably got 6 holes to play.   Providing doesn't go anywhere too far forward from where he is right now at 10, absolutely I have a chance.

Q.   Did you see anything that surprised you out there today on the course, the way it played?
IAN POULTER:   No.

Q.   Couple other golfers consider the tees a bit easier today.   Would you agree with moving day?
IAN POULTER:   I don't think so.   I think the course played fair today.   I shot 2-under par and I'm disappointed.   So I felt, you know, there was definitely 4, 5, 6, 7-under par available out there for guys that played well.
