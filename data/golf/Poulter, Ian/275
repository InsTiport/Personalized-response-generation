 Q. How do you feel about playing in Korea this week?
 IAN POULTER: Obviously very excited to be back in Korea. It's been a couple of years since I have been to Korea. I finished second place the last time I visited Korea, so hopefully I can go one place better.
 My game is in form, and I'm very excited to play this week. 

 Q. Have you seen give of the golf course yet, or is it new to you? 
 IAN POULTER: I haven't seen the golf course yet. Very much looking forward to get out there in the Pro-Am tomorrow, have a good look at the course, and then come and do some practise afterwards. 

 Q. The top-ranking European players have stated that they are not interested in getting PGA Tour membership. What are your thoughts on that? 
 IAN POULTER: That's their decision. It's very hard to play both tours. It's very difficult. I've done it now for six years. A lot of people have family; a lot of people have homes in different places; it's their decision. 
 You can't play every week. We could play every single week of the year, and it's just not possible. It's their decision and people have to respect that. 

 Q. You're known for your fantastic performance in golf, but also your interest in fashion. I understand, or I heard, that you're particularly crazy about shoes. So can I ask why this particular infatuation for shoes?
 IAN POULTER: I'm interested in, obviously, clothes, I love very much, and obviously shoes. You know, my golf shoes, I have a huge collection. There's probably 300 pairs of FootJoys right now, and obviously my casual shoes I also like. 
 It's just something I enjoy shopping and I enjoy buying new shoes.
