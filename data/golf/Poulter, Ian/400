   IAN POULTER:  It was a surprise to make those two birdies in that torrential rain but it was a long time coming. I hit some good golf shots out there, was steady, hitting the fairways and greens to ten or 15 feet and it didn't hole any until it was chucking it down. It was nice to finish like that.  Puts me in good position for tomorrow.   
I have played well for some time and when you keep hitting good golf shots and putts slide by it is frustrating but it was a nice way to finish with birdies on two of the last three and hole a nice eight foot par putt on the last. Nice feeling and I will be going into the weekend with a lot of confidence.   
 I played lovely. Standing on the range I knew it would be a tough day and it was a day of patience. 30mph wind is never nice to play in, especially at The Belfry. It is a tough golf course an they tucked a few pins away today which I thought was a bit naughty of them. I'd be interested to see who put those pins out. But it was tough and I did a good job today. The 16th was a long time coming, 16 holes. I hit a lot of greens and felt I gave myself a lot of chances. When one goes in it is nice.   
  
  Q.  A win this week would make a nice wedding present?   
  POULTER:  I have thought about that. I have one week to go before I have a great week next week so hopefully a good weekend will pay for a few bottles of win and maybe some champagne.
