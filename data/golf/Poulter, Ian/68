 Q.  Happy with that?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, pretty good.  The back nine, my front nine, I had four birdies on the spin.  Nice to have a little run like that.  A couple of missed greens once I made the turn but made a couple of decent up-and-downs.  Sloppy bogey, really, on 7.  Just hit hybrid off the tee, pulled it left, missed fairway and it was awkward from there being blocked out.  But decent bounce-back birdie there.   
I'm playing well.  It's nice to come over and play well.  It's nice to be in contention.  Will be hopefully a nice weekend.  Hopefully we get some decent weather.  This morning was pretty miserable, I have to say.  Brolly up-and-down all morning, and we got quite wet out there at times.   
 Q.  Your four birdies at the stop, what was the key to those birdies, do you think?  
IAN POULTER: I'm not sure what the keys were really.  I'm hitting the ball pretty solid, so I'm going to give myself decent chances if I continue to have looks from kind of inside 15 feet.  I feel like I'm hitting it how I want to hit it.  Putting it in play a lot.  Giving myself plenty of chances, and when that happens, hopefully you get a few putts to drop and it adds up to a decent score.   
 Q.  You had a few that were just on the lip that were maybe frustrating you; maybe come good at the weekend?  
IAN POULTER: I'm always frustrated if I miss a few putts.  That's how it goes.  The greens, obviously being soft, they get a little footprintish, so they can bobble about a little bit.  The guys this afternoon will feel that out there; obviously with the moisture we've had and the more traffic they get on them.  But then they should obviously improve for the weekend.  There will be less feet on them and hopefully week roll a few putts in.   
 Q.  As a whole, great position going into the weekend?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, feel good.  Feel happy.  Ten-year wedding anniversary today, so it was nice to post a decent score, as well.
