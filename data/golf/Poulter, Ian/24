 Q. Talk about how key that putt was on 18.   
IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was, I mean it was nice after 17, I hit a great putt at 17 and had a sort of horseshoe out there, so I've obviously got to stay as close as I can, Frankie just birdied four in a row. You know, I can only do what I can do at this point, so I need to make some birdies tomorrow.   
   
 Q. Your mindset going in, are you going to be aggressive tomorrow, knowing that you ‑‑  
IAN POULTER: No, I'm going to try and par every hole.   
   
 Q. I mean, will your game plan change at all knowing that you're a few shots back?  
IAN POULTER: The greens are soft. This course is receptive, we're all out early tomorrow morning, so we're all on the golf course and we're going to know what's happening. If someone's going low, we're going to see it. Just got to go as low as you can go and see what happens.   
   
 Q. Seems like you got a string of birdies there on the second nine. Talk about the momentum that you had there coming in.   
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I mean I birdied 13, 15 and obviously the last. I had a couple of other opportunities which I didn't take, didn't get up‑and‑down on 11, which was frustrating really going in with 7‑iron, should have really hit it in the middle of the green, didn't, pushed it a little bit, paid the price for the only mistake of the day.   
But tee to green I'm playing well, I just need to hole a couple more putts and hopefully have a chance.
