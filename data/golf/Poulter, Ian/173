 Q.   How do you assess your round today?   
IAN POULTER:   Good score, 2‑under par.   I think before you tee off, you know anything red around this drying golf course is going to be a good score.   
I made mistakes today.   My three mistakes, my three bogeys, were three 3‑putts, and that leaves me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.   
I played exceptionally well.   I hit some phenomenal golf shots today.   Proximity to the pin on second shots for me was pretty special, but I didn't manage to capitalize on all of them.   
Obviously the three mistakes are kind of what's tarnished the round.  
   
 Q.   I heard conflicting stories on the wind, how it is affecting guys.   How did it affect you today?   
IAN POULTER:   It's windy.   What more can you say?   
11, 12, 13, even 14, 15, are difficult, because it's that part of the golf course where the wind seems to come over from Augusta Country Club and it kind of swirls through the trees.   One minute, it's into the wind, and the next minute, it's downwind.   All of those holes that I just described are fraught with danger.   So it's easy to get affected and it's easy to make mistakes.  
   
 Q.   Are you amazed at what Bubba has done so far here this week?  
IAN POULTER:   I mean, you know, Bubba's played a great round of golf today.   This golf course very much sets up in his kind of favor.   You know, he hits it 350 off the tee.   I don't see much trouble around Augusta National at 350 off any tee.   A left‑hander around this golf course has got a couple of easy drives, as well, where he can hit a big cut, and that certainly favors‑‑ it favors him.   
So, hasn't surprised me.   He already has a green jacket and when you have one of those, you obviously can play golf and you can obviously play this golf course very, very well.   No, it wasn't a surprise to see.   
   
 Q.   On No. 5, the pin is in an unusual spot‑‑  
IAN POULTER:   It's never been there.   
   
 Q.   How did you play there?   
IAN POULTER:   I hit it to three feet and made birdie.   
   
 Q.   Were you surprised to see it there at all?  
IAN POULTER:   First time I've ever had it there and obviously there's a number of pin locations out here on this golf course which they have never used, and I guess they felt it was time to use it.   I guess some people might have made birdie, but you can also make bogey there quite easy.   
   
 Q.   Do you like seeing new pin spots or does it matter?   
IAN POULTER:   Doesn't matter where the pin is.   You've got to play it.
