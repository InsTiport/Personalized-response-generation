  Q. Talk about 16. Pretty fascinating moment I would think.   
 IAN POULTER: Pretty exciting moment. Any hole-in-one is a nice one. But to do it on 16 with all those spectators to the left-hand side, it's a great amphitheater to have a hole-in-one. Great timing.   
 It gave me a great boost and a great adrenaline rush. It was pretty special.  
  
  Q. The other day you seemed to emanate a great deal of confidence and determination from your tone and body language. Talk about your state of mind coming into the first round here. Is that reading correctly?  
 IAN POULTER: Absolutely. I'm confident in the work I've done in the last couple of weeks. It's good. I hit the ball good in practice. I had two good practice rounds two weeks ago here with Justin. And I feel comfortable out there on the golf course.   
 So if anything, I got to say, Tuesday morning I was itching to play. I was ready to play golf. And kind of killing time through Tuesday and Wednesday. And I got out there today and I executed pretty much every single shot I wanted to today. And it's probably one of the best ball striking rounds of golf I've ever played.   
  
  Q. There was talk about the, what you classified about the misconception about beating Tiger, what you said. That attention that was paid to you, has that motivated you in any way?  
 IAN POULTER: Not really, because nothing was said which was untoward. The comments were the comments. Which they were hard to take at the time, but I think that the article was fine. I think what I said was fine. And I think that if people read the whole piece then they can understand exactly what I was trying to say.   
 From No. 2 to a thousand in the world is the same as where Tiger is between one and two. So I was just saying that he's one in a million.   
 It's a great time to be playing golf and how hard it is to achieve No. 2 in the world if you play well. I don't think any pressure has been put on me. I obviously want to play golf well all the time and there's no better stage to play golf than the Masters.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about how good a round 2-under is going to be today with the conditions?  
 IAN POULTER: It's going to be good. I would like to have rolled a few more putts in. Especially the chances I had today were very makeable. And I probably had a good 12 or 13 makeable putts.   
 The greens are very tricky, they're very, very fast and we always know what 2-under par does, where that puts yourself on the first day of the Masters. You're in good position. It's a good round of golf.  
  
  Q. Is this the best you felt coming into the Masters?  
 IAN POULTER: I think having two weeks off, getting prepared the way I did, I certainly feel fresh to play golf this morning. As I said, I was itching to play. I wanted the Tournament to start early. I was ready a couple of days ago. So it's nice to carry that forward into Thursday.   
  
  Q. Justin had a great year last year, do you think he can maintain that as well? Has he got the potential?  
 IAN POULTER: He certainly does. I think we all know he's got the potential to play great golf on the main stage. And he was a little unlucky last year. He played good and he's playing good right now. So it wouldn't surprise me to see him on the board at some stage through the weekend.
