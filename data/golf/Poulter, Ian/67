 Q.  How pleased are you with that?  
IAN POULTER: Early on it was pretty scrappy, I have to be honest.  It wasn't my best stuff.  Disappointing that I broke my concentration on the par 3.  A couple phones going off right next to us; I should have backed off.  I didn't stop my swing.  Resulted in a double-bogey, which is -- that's my bad.  I really should be able to hit a shot with people taking photographs.  They should have it on silent.  But anyway, a good rally around the back nine and a bonus there on the last to roll a 15-footer in.   
 Q.  Great chip at 3.  Describe this one for us.  
IAN POULTER: Down left-to-right, a chip, only had to land on the edge of the green and the contours would have done the rest.  I obviously chose the line quite nicely and got that in, which was needed.  The first two holes were scrappy, and even that one, missing the green with 8-iron wasn't my best.   
 Q.  And the last?  
IAN POULTER: I hit a lovely 5-iron in there to 15 feet just outside the right.  You know, chose the right read and it went quite nicely in the middle.   
 Q.  You've played in an awful lot of golf tournaments around the world.  You've never won in England.  
IAN POULTER: Thanks for reminding me.   
 Q.  Tomorrow is a great opportunity for you, and also, 55th in the World Rankings, one big performance and you're back in that Top-50.  How excited about what could take place tomorrow?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I've come here this week to do a number of things.  One is to get back in the Top-50 and two is to win this golf tournament.  I'm now in position going into Sunday.  I realistically have to feel I'm in with a shout.  Just one back at the minute.   
I need to play better tomorrow than I did today, that's for sure.  I'm going to go to the range just now and work on it for maybe an hour, get rid of the frustration.  Come out tomorrow feeling somewhat refreshed, and hopefully I can be aggressive to those targets out there tomorrow.  Hopefully I can hold a trophy and get back in the Top-50.  Be lovely.   
 Q.  How good to finish with a birdie on the last?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, that was a highlight today.  Nice birdie to finish.  A shame I missed an opportunity on 17 from about four feet, five feet, to birdie there.  I think it was a scrappy day.  I didn't play my best golf around that front nine.  Wasn't giving myself that many chances, and you know, distracted on the par 3, which was a shame.  I should be able to focus better than that.  A couple of guys didn't have their phones on silent, and just poor concentration, not committing to the shot.  Made double-bogey there.   
So I think it was a scrappy day.  I've got a way with one today.  I definitely need to play better tomorrow to have a chance, and I need to go to the range just for an hour and clear the mind.   
 Q.  Lovely chip-in on the third.  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was a nice chip-in.  It wasn't really about -- it wasn't a difficult chip.  It was a chip that the slope was always going to take it down to the hole, so it was a matter of choosing the right line.  I obviously got the right line and pace, and that obviously dropped in, which was great.   
 Q.  Hearing you talk to SKY, your goal is to win the tournament and get back in the Top-50.  What do you have to do to win tomorrow?  
IAN POULTER: I certainly have to play a lot better than I did today, because that's not going to get it done.   
So don't make mistakes tomorrow, and if you do, obviously don't make them expensive ones, and keep doing what I'm doing.  I'm hitting a lot of decent shots.  My short game is pretty good.  I'm putting it in play.   
You know, I just need to keep ticking along.  I'm ticking boxes.  I'm slowly improving my World Ranking.  I'd like to get back in the Top-50 so I'm in the HSBC Champions in a few weeks' time, and obviously tomorrow, if I can play a little bit better than I did today, I might have a chance to win.
