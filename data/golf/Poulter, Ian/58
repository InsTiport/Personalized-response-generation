IAN POULTER: It was a tough match.  I knew I needed to throw a lot of birdies out today.  I did.  I putted nice.  Hit it nice.  I made seven birdies.   
 Q.  You made eight.  
IAN POULTER: Eight?  Okay.  You're going to be tough to beat if you make eight birdies.  I knew I needed that today against Louis.   
 Q.  You're getting into the Masters?  
IAN POULTER: I mean, is it confirmed?   
 Q.  Yes.  You're guaranteed top 50.  
IAN POULTER: That's great.  Phase two of four phases done.  So three to go.  And all will be good.   
I'm buzzing.  I had adrenaline out there to get it done.  It was a tough match for that reason.  There was a lot on the line.  I knew I had to get up.  I was up.  And then it's obviously hard to close out when Louis has obviously got nothing to lose being dormie and throwing birdies at it.   
 Q.  What do you continue to do well now after these four days?  
IAN POULTER: Stay patient.  Just keep doing the same.  If you make eight birdies like that, and if you do that stuff you're going to be hard to beat.   
NOTE: Please be aware that Ian was misinformed regarding his projected World Ranking following his victory over Louis Oosthuizen.  New projections indicate that he will need to win his Quarterfinal match against Kevin Kisner to guarantee his position within the top 50 of the official World Ranking at the conclusion of the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.
