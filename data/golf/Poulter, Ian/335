 Q. Good round today. You double bogeyed on 4, but otherwise a pretty consistent, solid round. 
 IAN POULTER: Yeah. Hung in there. I mean not a fantastic start, but you know, looking at the board at one stage I was seven behind Graeme, so it was not looking good. 
 I just had to hang in there around that Back 9 and make a few birdies. You know, took advantage of the 5s. And that's what you have to do on this golf course and hang in there. There's a couple of tough holes to finish, and I played them pretty solid.

 Q. You're within striking distance going into tomorrow. How do you feel? What do you think you need to do differently, if anything?
 IAN POULTER: Nothing. Play golf. Enjoy it. Two off the lead, probably going out there having a bit of fun firing at pins and seeing what happens. 

 Q. Good deal.
