 Q.  Good start, five 3s in the first seven holes and a little glitch towards the end.  How did you feel overall? 
 IAN POULTER:  I felt as if I pretty much stuck to my game plan apart from one shot out there.  The way I played, I played great.  I played really, really well.  Just had one 3-putt which was a little bit frustrating.  Just gave it, you know, too much, hit it four or five feet by, and it's easy to miss on these slopey greens. 
 And then, you know, on 8 we stand on the toe box for ten minutes waiting for the group in front to clear.  You know, I should have just hit an easy 5-wood in the middle of green, but probably tried to hit it a little bit too close and turned it over too much and made double-bogey.  That's what the U.S. Open does to you. 

 Q.  Sum up just how difficult this golf course is. 
 IAN POULTER:  It's difficult but it's not -- I mean, I think it's very scorable.  Certainly today, I think I kept it very tame with quite a few fairly accessible pin positions.  I think the storm last night certainly softened the greens up.  I don't think anybody was really expecting that, and that's why the scores are actually pretty good today.  I felt as if I could shoot a couple under par out there the way I played, but unfortunately walked off 2-over. 
 It's very difficult, but if you're on your game and you have a decent game plan, I think you can have a really good week. 

 Q.  Year-by-year, your results in this tournament are getting better, you got in the thick of it last time; are you ready to go close this time? 
 IAN POULTER:  Definitely.  The homework I've done early last week and certainly Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week, I've just got to stick to my game plan and stop being greedy on the eighth hole and try not to hit too close in there. 
 If I do that and do what I said I was going to do and just hit, you know, hit nice, good golf shots, I should have a chance.
