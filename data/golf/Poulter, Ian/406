 Q  (How is the course playing compared to yesterday)? 
 IAN POULTER:  Very different.  Obviously it's nice to go and play probably only five-mile-an-hour difference in the wind, maybe ten at times.  But you didn't have to put your rain jacket on and off all day and fight with the umbrella.  So you could get into a nice rhythm out there on the golf course and I think you see a few good scores out there.  If you struck it really well, you could certainly -- you could certainly score low. 

 Q.  24, 25 putts the first two rounds; new greens treating you well? 
 IAN POULTER:  Yeah, greens are fantastic.  They are probably as true as we've putted on all year, so it's nice to get on a surface, especially with Augusta coming up in a couple of weeks, where if you see the line and you hit it on your line, the ball is going to go in the hole, so that they are running really nice out there. 

 Q.  And with the conditions this dry, do you think it's going to be harder -- they will be less receptive as far as hitting shots in? 
 IAN POULTER:  Absolutely.  I hope it does firm up a little bit because you can play the ball down.  There's a few very wet fairways out there still and it's probably the right decision to play ball up right now. 
 But if it carries on like this, it will be nice if it does firm up a touch.  It will make it really tricky.
