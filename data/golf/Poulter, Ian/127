Q.   You had a fantastic week here.   The second half went a lot better for you, what went right, in your words?
IAN POULTER:   What went right?   I hit lots of greens in regulation over the weekend, 32 greens in regulation, which is comfortably better than the field.   Tee to green I put it in position better than anyone, and even over four days as well.   I only missed a few greens the first couple of days.   But those were the greens that were very extensive misses. 
On the first day I was 4 over par‑‑ 6 over par for the four greens that I missed there.   And that was obviously the telling tale for me, not to be right there in contention.
So frustrating with how hard a worked on my short game.   I pride myself on having a great short game, but probably seven attempts this week for missed greens cost me a lot of shots.

Q.   Now you've got the match play coming up, where you've had great results there.   What is it about that event that you enjoy?
IAN POULTER:   Well for one, head‑to‑head.   For me it's about working on the putting, to hole a few more putts and I'll be back in the winner's circle.
Obviously that's obviously a good format which I played well in the past.   I'll look forward to it.

Q.   What do you think of Justin's play?
IAN POULTER:   He's put it in position on 15.   Phil just made eagle from the green club bunker just to the right.   Anywhere on that green or in that trap he has an opportunity.   He's got 16 with pins accessible.   So you've got a chance of a hole‑in‑one or a birdie there.   The pin is in the middle of 17, another good chance there.   Pin as we know is is nine on, five left on 18 and it's in that bowl.   Justin could certainly do what Charl Schwartzel did a couple of years ago and birdie the last few holes.
