 Q.  You got yourself right in the mix today, didn't you? 
 IAN POULTER:  I did, yeah.  It's nice.  I've been playing well the last few days, and I just said to my caddie, let's see if we can roll a few putts in.  I managed to get close enough on quite a few holes today and holed a second shot to get myself in the mix for tomorrow. 

 Q.  I guess you guys are proving that there are scores to be had on this course despite the tough putting conditions? 
 IAN POULTER:  Obviously.  I mean, I think if you're hitting the ball pretty close there is a score to be made out there on the golf course.  Obviously we would have liked them to have been a little bit better, but they play the same for everybody.  So just get your head down there, suck it up and try and hole a few birdie putts.
