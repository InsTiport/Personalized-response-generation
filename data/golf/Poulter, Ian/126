 Q.   Even par today, how did you feel the course played?  
    IAN POULTER:   Well, the course managed to hold up.   First time I've played life, clean and place through the green.   So it was nice that we got finished, just disappointing to not get it done.   
   
 Q.   This tournament at Colonial, your thoughts on that?  
    IAN POULTER:   It's a great tournament.   I'm happy to be playing.   I'm just disappointed that obviously I didn't get the job done and I really should have and I didn't do it.   I didn't play well enough today.  
   
 Q.   What do you think the problem was today?  
    IAN POULTER:   I didn't get it done, simple.
