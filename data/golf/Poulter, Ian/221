  SERGIO GARCIA:   Amazing, what a day.   It was hard but we knew there was a chance, and I mean, we come back from yesterday afternoon, those two matches we won‑‑ to be able to‑‑ (opening a bottle of champagne) we had a chance today, and today obviously everything came right. 

Q.   For you personally with the shadow of Seve guarding you and protecting you, what influence was that for you this week? 
SERGIO GARCIA:   Oh, no, I have no doubt in my mind that he was with me today all day, because there's no chance I would have won my match if he wasn't there.   You know, it was amazing, and it feels so good to be able to win it for him and for our captain, JosÃ©, it's been amazing.   He's an amazing guy, just unbelievable, and very happy. 

Q.Your performance last night‑‑
IAN POULTER:   This was a team performance and you know, what the team have done an unbelievable job today.   There was a buzz in the team room last night that didn't feel like we had a four‑point deficit.   For some reason, everyone was calm.   Everyone was cracking jokes.   We just felt we had that tiny little chance, and do you know what, the boys have proved today, and made history.   It has been unbelievable.

Q.   How satisfying is it to hear the chants of Ole! Ole! Ole!   as opposed to USA. 
IAN POULTER:   You know, Chicago has been incredible.   They have been loud and they have been, you know, supporting their home team, and rightly so, it's been a tough week.   But I just can't actually believe what's happened.   It's just unbelievable.

Q.   What was it like to play a part in one of the greatest, not just golfing, but sporting come backs? 
IAN POULTER:   You know what, my captain picked me to come and play, and you know, I owe it to him, and Seve, to be here today. 
So it's pretty special.
