Q.   Give us an injury‑update, ten per cent chance of you playing yesterday morning and you've done it.   How is it now?
IAN POULTER:   Happy to get around the golf course to be honest.   It wasn't looking good yesterday morning.   Still getting some twinges.   I had 45 minutes with the ball yesterday and it was a little bit better this morning.   So a good hour with the guys in the trailer to loosen myself up, hit some balls for another hour and obviously good enough to compile a half‑decent round. 

Q.   You said your expectations would be low and given the preparation, how do you feel about that 70?
IAN POULTER:   I feel pretty good.   Only one blemish on the card.   I missed a couple of opportunities, so all in all, I did steer it around the course.   I wasn't hitting it max power, but it would have been a shame to have come all this way and not played.

Q.   13 is one of the most formidable and your group all birdied it. 
IAN POULTER:   It's actually a difficult tee shot.   Easy to lose it right is and two traps down the left down the side that can catch you out.   You do want to get it down the right side of the fairway to open up the pin location. 
Pin was tucked kind of front left today over that left‑hand bunker.   I pitched it just on left edge of the green, got a nice little kick to the right and as you say, all of us were within kind of 15 feet. 
So the green does slope back to front.   You do want to keep yourself just below the pin and leave yourself an uphill putt but it's a tricky hole and I think we are all pretty happy to make three and get off.
