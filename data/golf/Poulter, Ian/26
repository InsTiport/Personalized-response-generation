 Q. Great round. Talk about how pleased you are.   
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I'm very happy with today's work and the round. It's a great start to a long week. The weather is going to be something in the next three days with the storms coming in. The course dried out nicely today. A couple of greens may have been a touch slower than what we've previously had in the past on a Thursday. But I'm happy with that and feel pretty good about it.  
   
 Q. The back nine must have felt really nice to make that move. What do you feel was working in your game?  
IAN POULTER: My whole game was together, from the first hole to the 18th hole. I mean I only missed two greens in regulation, I think. One of them was 9. I made bogey there. And the other green I missed was kind of 12 feet from the pin just on the fringe. So really my putting all around today was extremely solid.  
   
 Q. Do you have to bear in mind the conditions?  
IAN POULTER: I don't know really. When you look at the boards, 3‑under par was about where it was before we went out. There's only a couple of guys that have gone a bit better than that this afternoon. So they're great players, you would expect somebody to shoot 6‑ or 7‑under par out there today under these conditions.  
   
 Q. (No microphone.)  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was. I felt we could be relative aggressive, but just needed to be sensible. We did the sensible bit on a couple of the tricky pins and just played slow, steady golf.
