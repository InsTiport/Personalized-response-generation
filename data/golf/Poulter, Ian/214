  IAN POULTER:   7‑under par, you're leaving shots on the golf course, missing birdie putts like I've missed on the last and other holes out there today which I haven't taken advantage of, has me moving forward but doesn't move me any closer to the lead.   I guess there are some special rounds of golf out there, and it's there to be had. 
    7‑under par, don't get me wrong, it's not a bad round of golf, but in the scheme of how Lee has just gone out there and shot 11‑under par, I've just lost four shots to him on the day.   So I've left shots on the golf course.

Q.   Good three‑ball? 
    IAN POULTER:   It was a hell of a three‑ball, 67, 65 and a 61. 

Q.   Looking forward to tomorrow?   Scores to be had? 
    IAN POULTER:   Yeah, there's a low score out there on that golf course, so I need to go shoot it tomorrow, simple.
