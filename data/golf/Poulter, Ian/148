 Q.   What's your verdict on day three?  
IAN POULTER:   Three bogeys, but probably is the only disappointing thing about the day.   I played nicely.   Got out of position a couple of times and with that obviously made a couple mistakes and that's obviously difficult from there.   But I played good golf again.   A couple of putts slid past.   Would have been nice to hole a couple of those and been a couple closer to Gâ€‘Mac.  
   
 Q.   A fair bit of resilience in there, you are nicely in a position, aren't you?   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I'm in decent position.   So I need to go out there and play well tomorrow.   I feel like my game's right there.   I just need the putter to warm up slightly and I think I'll be pretty happy.   
   
 Q.   How much harder was it in these kind of conditions today?   
IAN POULTER:   It was tricky today.   The wind was up again in the afternoon and it was a long day.   I mean, 5 1/2 hours, is 5 1/2 hours.   We should be playing quicker than that.   5 1/2 hours is a long time to play, let alone someone to watch.  
   
 Q.   Could you seen see as you're finishing?   It's pretty dark?  
IAN POULTER:   It's getting dark.   We always battle the light here every year obviously, and there's a lot of players playing in the field.   So it makes it difficult to get everyone around in four hours like we should but no excuses, it was just a long day.   
   
 Q.   Got a score in mind for the final day?  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, low.
