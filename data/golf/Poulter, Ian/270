 Q. Your thoughts on coming through another match that went not only to 18 but the distance and further?
 IAN POULTER: Tough match. Nicolas has certainly played well over the first few days, and it was going to be no different today. I had to try and wear him down and I guess his length definitely helped him on all of those par 5s. He was hitting iron into most. He hit 3-wood onto another, but again, I managed to sneak a halve from laying up, and I've done exactly the same in regulation on 18. I had to do the same again. 
 I could have reached 18 again this time around, but I just decided to lay up. I didn't lay up in the best of spots. But Nicolas had to have a go at the green from his position; he didn't have far to reach the front, he put it in a bad spot and he found it difficult from there.

 Q. Given that you fought back again from 2-down or 3-down at one stage, but he was ragged a tiny bit, regrouped 17 and 18, it was tight, wasn't it?
 IAN POULTER: It was tight. He's a great player. I've played golf with him before and he's not going to let up. He had a bit of a blip on 15 and 16 but a great comeback on 17 with a great putt; great shot, great putt. And he hit two fantastic shots to get in the middle of that green with 6-iron, and I'm laying up with 7-iron. Just goes to show how far he does hit it.
 As we know time and time again, length isn't everything.

 Q. Adrenaline flowing, but a long hard week?
 IAN POULTER: It's been a long hard week but it's my boy's birthday. So I can't care being exhausted Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday next week.

 Q. Your boy is Luke; you have Luke in the final. 
 IAN POULTER: I have, yeah. There's only one Luke winner at the end of today, and I'd like it obviously to be a Poulter.
