  Q. Happy with the finish?  
 IAN POULTER: Happy with the finish, but I was kind of joking with Dustin, neither of us were holing many putts, and then when he made his first birdie, he sort of laughed and joked that he got the lid off it, and I think we kind of all finished there with a few birdies, or certainly Dustin and myself did, which was very nice.   
 It would have been disappointing to finish today over par with the shots that I executed on the golf course today. I couldn't have asked to hit the ball any better. A couple of par saves, but apart from that it was pretty flawless.  
  
  Q. How are you feeling coming off?  
 IAN POULTER: Hungry and needing some lunch.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: Well, it behaved over the last few holes. The greens are tricky. I think where they had the pin locations today there was a few interesting pins. You had to be the right side, and if it wasn't in the perfect spot, it was going to leave you a slightly breaking putt. They're hard to putt when it's blowing 20-mile-an-hour wind. It's eased off a little bit now. It's got easier in the last hour, but they're tricky.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: I mean, it's not my favourite in rotation I think I'd probably say. You can hit a lot of great golf shots certainly off the tee and get some bad bounces. You know, holes they've widened, obviously 1 and 17, it amazes me how you can keep the ball on 17 fairway. But I think they've done a good job this year in setup. I think it's better than 2003. It's a fair test.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: In this wind direction there's certain holes which are very, very tough, and they play a lot more difficult than if the wind was the prevailing wind. If it's coming from the south, southeast or southwesterly, then you don't feel quite so bad. You feel like you've got a lot of chances. When it's this way around, the downwind holes are not that easy. You just can't stop it anywhere near the pin. You actually feel relieved when you get into the wind and you've got a chance to stop a 5-iron, as opposed to not being able to stop a wedge.   
  
  Q. What was the best shot you hit today?  
 IAN POULTER: I don't know. I would say I've hit five of the best iron shots I've hit in a long while today on links golf, one of which would be my 3-iron into 5 -- I can't remember the holes out there. I need my yardage book. 5, the one after the -- no, 4. No, sorry, 5.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: I thought I hit a perfect drive on 17. It did manage to creep off the left edge of that fairway in that bowl with the rough. I hit a perfect drive and it was in the left rough.  
  
  Q. What was the worst bounce?  
 IAN POULTER: The worst bounce, 17. It was in the middle of the fairway and it was a hog's back, so it could go right or left. It goes left and it's in the rough.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: Standing on the first tee, you would have said, no, I don't think it's possible. But I think you could -- I mean, if I would have holed a few putts today, I would have felt pretty happy walking off the golf course 5-under par, to be honest. I think I had my chances to get to that number. So yeah, I mean, I actually felt it was there.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)   
 IAN POULTER: I want to see a replay actually. It looked like it hopped a couple of bounces left and may sort of went in quite quick. I think it would've been six feet left of the pin if it had missed the cup. So it was not quite pin high, hopped past and then was hopping left as it probably went in. It was going in hard, yeah. It looked that way from the shot, but as Dustin said, I don't care. It's four inches under (Laughter.)  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: I thought it was good. No, it was great. Every green they were applauding, which was great. Very nice.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: Similar I would say. All the stands were full, so it was a very decent, full crowd out there. It was good.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: The way I've played today and the shots I've hit and the tough shots I've hit I'm very happy, so yeah, I definitely think I've got a chance. If I play like I did today, then for sure I'm pretty happy with how I've played. I don't feel the need to go to the range to do any work. Back to the house and have a bit of rest.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 IAN POULTER: I was going Seve colours today, navy, white shirt, white shoes, but it was cold so I put my wets on. Sorry to disappoint.
