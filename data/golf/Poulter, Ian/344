 Q. You must be pleased with that effort?
 IAN POULTER: Yes I am but if you had asked me ten minutes before I teed off what I thought I would have probably told you I was heading for an 87. It was horrible on the range and I think I'd have to say it was one of the worst 45 minute practice sessions I have ever had. Everything was wrong, balls going right and left, everywhere. I am working on a few things at the moment but it just got ridiculous. So I was standing on the first tee fearing the worst and then I go and play lovely. It has happened in the past when you've had a poor practice session and then go out and shoot the lights out, don't know why it happens, it just does. I actually birdied the first two holes and I was actually laughing, it was that funny considering what had gone before. I missed a couple of shots, you can't go out and play flawless, but in the end the round was pretty clinical. Bizarre, really bizarre.

 Q. Tournament position now, six back of Harrington?
 IAN POULTER: Well I don't know, apparently there is a couple of really heavy showers coming in and so that might upset them out there a little bit. But if I am six back at the end of the day, who knows? I'm going to go and have to shoot my lowest round out there but if I do, I might have a chance.

 Q. Have conditions changed noticeably out there due to the rain?
 IAN POULTER: Well some greens are firm, some greens seem to be soft, some are taking a good pitch mark and some are taking a tiny one. Because at the moment it hasn't softened the whole course up, because there is a light dew dusting on the greens the balls are skidding so I think you are going to see a few people skipping through the back of some greens.
