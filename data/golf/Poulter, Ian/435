Q. I believe you have been having a rather adventurous time away from the course with some flooding in your new house?
IAN POULTER:  Yes it hasn't been a lot of fun but it is now Wednesday, tomorrow is Thursday and the first day of the tournament and I need to get my head around the tournament and try and concentrate on the golf and nothing else.
Q. Just sum up the problems you did have though?
IAN POULTER:   Well, I had a leak in the roof of my new house and it caused quite a bit of damage. But it is all being looked after now and so I want to look forward to the tournament. I can't do anything more about it right now. It was the two guest bedrooms which suffered the worst of the damage.
Q. Being an Arsenal fan, you will have enjoyed last Saturday as well?
IAN POULTER:   Yes it was great, a great day. Along with most Arsenal fans I admit we were a little fortunate but it was great fun to go along to Soccer AM on Sky Sports in the morning and then fly to Cardiff with the match ball and give it to the referee in his changing room before the game and then watched it from the box where there was a great atmosphere and had a decent party afterwards with the Arsenal players, so it was a really special day.
Q. Turning to the golf, a fantastic last competitive round at the Forest of Arden, is that still in your mind?
IAN POULTER:  Yes very much so and it will be nice to go this afternoon and try and concentrate on some serious practice and get my head right for tomorrow. The game today was okay, there is still a little bit of work to be done but it should be okay for tomorrow. If I can try and birdie every par five then I will have a chance.
Q. And your views on the tournament with the new sponsors involved?
IAN POULTER:   Well just even looking round you can see it is different from before and I think they have done a great job. The course as always is looking good too and I think BMW are a great sponsor. They have supported the Tour very well with the tournaments they have sponsored already and I don't know how many sponsors in the past have sponsored three events in one year on Tour. That in itself is magnificent and hopefully that will continue for a long time because they have shown that together with the Tour, it is a great partnership.
