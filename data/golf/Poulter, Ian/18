 Q.  Closing out the final round in Scotland, how do you assess how you've gone about this week and preparation for next week?  
IAN POULTER: Decent week.  Just a little warm under the collar, bogeying 17 from a position that I shouldn't really make bogey.  It's the easiest pin on the course.  It's easy to look at, right now, five minutes since I signed my card; so I'm looking at the mistakes I've made.   
I took care of the 5s today, and I didn't take care of them the rest of the week.  So I think it's been one of those weeks where it was good; it was good prep for next week but it's going to be a week that's going to be what if I had taken thank of those five yesterday.  But it's a decent week leading into next week.   
 Q.  When you look at your game, and you've been around for a long time now, played a lot of major championships.  
IAN POULTER: Thanks.   
 Q.  Still looking for that first one.  But still looking at how you go about links golf, do you feel next week is your best chance in the majors?  
IAN POULTER: Best chance, not sure it's my best chance.  I think it's a good chance.  It's a golf course I don't really know too much about.  I went around there with Luke two years ago when he played it and I just kind of walked around one of the Irish Open rounds.   
So I'm going to need to get to know it in the first few days next week.  I need to get the right side of the draw, more importantly.  Weather I think will play a part next week.   
I enjoy links golf.  I enjoy shot-making.  I enjoy what links golf gives us.  So yeah, I mean, let's get at it.  Let's get after it.
