 Q.  All told, first looking at this golf course, what did you like and what did you see?  
IAN POULTER: I think it's a pretty tricky course.  If you miss fairways, the rough doesn't look very penal, but the ball sits right down and it's very tricky into the firm greens to get it close.  So you've got to drive it very, very well.  I done it okay today, hit a couple of loose tee shots, so I'm off to the range now just to rectify those, but I putted pretty good, left a couple out on the course.  2-under par I think is okay.  It's acceptable, and I need to go a bit lower over the next three days.   
 Q.  For you, you have to have the feeling that if you start hitting greens, this is a place where with your putter you can really do some damage?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, the greens are pure.  They are very, very grainy, but they're quick and dry.  Provided you leave yourself opportunities uphill, you can have a lot of looks for birdie, so it's about getting it in play.  It's paramount around this golf course, and you've got a lot of opportunities with quite a few wedges in your hand, so you can definitely see a pretty low score out there.
