Q.   An opening round of 69, what's your verdict on that one?   Looked to us like it should have been a lot lower. 
IAN POULTER:   I'm annoyed.   I holed two putts today which were probably outside birdie chances, and I took a couple more, but the rest were just missed putts. 
You know, every time I had a putt, it was a slippery little putt downhill left‑to‑right, right‑to‑left, really awkward and the greens are quick.   So it's really hard to kind of hit it as firm as you really want to, because if it misses, it's going five feet past.
So they are tricky to read, and they are very quick, so, yeah, I'm walking away frustrated from today's round.   But, happy to only be three behind.

Q.   And you come into this tournament knowing you need to finish third and probably need to win it the way Henrik is playing; how are you approaching it technically?
IAN POULTER:   Try to birdie every hole, simple.   Be aggressive.   Keep playing the golf that I'm playing, because I'm playing really, really good, hitting good iron shot after good iron shot and giving myself chances.   I need to continue to be aggressive over the next three days and see if I can nick it at the end.

Q.   You've made 68 birdies and two eagles in the last three tournaments.   Are you close to your best then?
IAN POULTER:   I'm playing as good as I've ever played I think.   I'm feeling as confident as I ever have, and I'm probably swinging it the best I ever have.   So it's a good mix.   Walking away from a round of golf feeling really angry with 3‑under par, three off the lead, is I guess a good position to be in, rather than feeling like I've given it my best and that's all I've got. 
So it's plenty still in there.   I've got plenty left for the next three days and hopefully I can roll a few putts in.
