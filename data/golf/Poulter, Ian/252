 Q.   Pretty solid round.   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, it was solid.   I played lovely on the front nine, got myself in position, and I was always looking at the board to see what the guys in front were doing.   If they got off to a decent start, I think they would have been hard to catch, but they didn't.   They weren't really going anywhere.   So it kind of got a bit interesting around Amen Corner, played nicely, hit some good shots.   
And really just such a shame to threeâ€‘putt the last.   You know, it's left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth from what was a really flawless day.  
   
 Q.   And it's going to leave you a little shy from the looks of things.   What do you take away from this as a learning experience?   
IAN POULTER:   I mean, it's another good week.   Playing well at Bay Hill was very, very nice, and I played well again here, so obviously my form I'm carrying right now is good.   I feel fit, I feel healthy, and it's now getting stronger for the summer.   So it looks like it could be a good summer, as well.
