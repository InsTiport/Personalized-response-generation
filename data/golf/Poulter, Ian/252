  IAN POULTER:   Disappointing obviously.   I come to defend and I've come up shy.   I thought I had a chance today.   I got off to a very good start.   Birdies at 2 and 3, and pretty much a sack full of chances from there on in. 
I got it to 9â€‘under, and I just flushed it on 15.   Pitched two yards short of the pin and it's gone through the back of the green, costly bogey at the wrong time. 
You know, to horseshoe out from 20 feet on 16, and leave it short in the middle on 17, I guess at that stage I guess I knew it was pretty much all over.   So disappointing at the last, but the course, as always, I'm walking away disappointed. 

Q.   But I guess there are positives to take in the same way that there were last week, good finish in the end?
IAN POULTER:   Sure, my game is in shape.   I'm happy.   I'm driving the ball well, I guess I'm going onto a golf course next week where I played really well last year, and so I feel my game's in shape and I'm happy to go there knowing I like the golf course.   I'm putting well and I'm playing well.   So hopefully we can have a big week next week. 

Q.   Chalk and cheese those two golf courses, though, Fanling compared to Dubai. 
IAN POULTER:   Very much, but I hit that purple patch last year and I enjoyed the courses I played at the back end of the year, same thing.   I know it's a completely different golf course and it plays very different and visually very different, but it will be in very good condition, as it always is.   I'm looking forward I guess now to trying to win it and not drop my ball on my coin this year. 

Q.   It owes you one. 
IAN POULTER:   Well, this game never owes you anything to be honest.   So it's just about going there next week, playing well and having fun and seeing what happens.
