 Q.  Fantastic round today, thus far, you really got going with some birdies.  What did you find out there?  
IAN POULTER: I holed a couple of nice putts, which was key to moving up the board.  Quite happy.  I played real solid.  The thumb wasn't an issue today, which is great.  It's healed nicely overnight.  I was able to hit some good shots.  I was able to take advantage and hole a couple of nice putts.  I find myself on the board.   
It's nice to see myself on the board.  It's nice to get off to a good start to 2016 and hopefully I can continue that through tomorrow and have a good finish.   
 Q.  Do you think the EurAsia Cup helped you?  
IAN POULTER: Sure, it's match-play golf, and you go head-to-head, and whenever you go head-to-head, you get the juices going, and that's obviously nice as the first tournament of the year.  So I think it's done me some good, and I think I'm looking forward to what the challenge is for the next 20, 26 holes.   
 Q.  And what did you do to sort out the thumb problem?  
IAN POULTER: It's had a little piece of gauze put underneath and then it's been taped over the top.  So it's all right.  It's healing and it will be fine tomorrow.
