Q. Is this a bit like found money for you just to be able to play this week versus where you thought you were three weeks ago?
IAN POULTER: It's obviously a result, right?  I thought I wasn't in here and obviously Brian managed to realize that the points were being calculated on the wrong year.  So, yes, it's a bonus.
Q. So given your play now, how do you see this possibly jump starting things moving on to the rest of the season?
IAN POULTER: Well I've been playing nicely and obviously now I can plan a schedule.  So from that perspective it's a good thing.  I know where I'm going to be playing golf and obviously it takes a little bit of pressure to go out and enjoy some golf.  I've done that over the last couple of days and took a couple of opportunities with a couple of putts today and I feel that my game's in great shape.  So I can just go out and enjoy my golf.
Q. Any particular aspect of your game sticking out through the first two rounds?
IAN POULTER: Just all-around solid.  I hit a lot of greens in regulation, gave myself a lot of chances.  I had a nice chance on the last to seven feet, closest of the day as I see it flash up on the board and obviously didn't quite finish that off.  So that have would have been nice to have made birdie at the last.  But I'm hitting good golf shots and playing good golf.  It's late, I need dinner, so do you, let's go.
