IAN POULTER: The good, the bad and the ugly, I think.   
 Q.  Tell us about all three, please.  
IAN POULTER: Again, got off to a nice start, hitting a couple nice shots until we get around to the fifth hole and just hit a lovely shank.  It was just pure.  It's a bit frustrating, right in between clubs, trying to hit a very chippy one.   
I've been there in the past, I'll do it again.  It will happen again.  It was one of those shots.  When I'm taking too much off a club, I've got to be very careful because there's a tendency there to go a little quick from a short position at the top and then all of a sudden I'm outside the line.  Have a shank.   
Trying not to miss the putt to limit the damage and then hit a poor shot on the next.  A couple of holes of poor focus were costly.  It took a long time to get all of that back again with an outrageous up-and-down.   
 Q.  13?  
IAN POULTER: Seve would have been proud.  It was one of the best up-and-downs I think I've had ever.  It might go down as the best.  It really was outrageous.   
All in all, held the end of the round together nicely.  In hindsight, it would be nice not to make mistakes out on the golf course.  I made a couple yesterday and made a couple today.  That's why I'm not a little further up that board.   
 Q.  But you are only five back?  
IAN POULTER: I'm on my home course where I know it very well.  Time to press Saturday, Sunday.  I know what I have to do.  There's no nothing else I can do apart from press now.  5-back, but 5 is very achievable on this course.  The way I know the greens.   
 Q.  You said you have had a few shanks.  Does it still rattle you?  
IAN POULTER: You are not expecting it, are you?  It's like someone smashing you around the head with a wet salmon.  I'll be honest you.  Out of the blue you turn around and get one of those slapped in your face.   
It's the last thing on your mind.  So yeah, they are surprising.  But I know what causes them and that's the -- that is the real annoying bit.   
 Q.  Better off trying to hit a different club, just hit it much harder rather than --  
IAN POULTER: No.  Just commit to the shot that I intended to play in first place as opposed to not committing to it.  The choice was I had two clubs that would have got the job done, and I didn't either of those two.  Complete brain fart and that's what happens.   
 Q.  The putt on 12, did you think that was going in and then it wasn't?  
IAN POULTER: That was a little bit cheeky, wasn't it?  I mean, he gave me a lovely line because he just went on the inside of my coin.  I've got the line.  I know it's going to try and go just a touch left.  I started right center, actually took a little bit of a nudge to the right.  I thought no, you can't possibly stay out.  Then it went right and then managed to come around the back and drop in.   
 Q.  You were walking up to them yesterday.  You were standing still on that one?  
IAN POULTER: I wasn't moving anywhere.  My feet were rooted to the ground.
