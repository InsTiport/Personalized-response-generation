  Q.  5 and 4.  Talk me through the match.  What were the keys?   
 IAN POULTER: Got off to a good start.  Birdied the first two holes, was 2-up, and just kept the pressure on, I think, looking at it.  I think he only hit it inside me once, so I pretty much had the hold all day long and he had to roll it in from outside.  He didn't do that.  I took the chances when I had them.  It was a nice match, and I'm really happy to play well.   
  
  Q.  What are the keys to success on this golf course?  Is it birdies?  Is it putting?   
 IAN POULTER:  Keeping it close and rolling them in, I suppose.  You have to be aggressive.  They had some really interesting pins out there today.  They tucked them right near the edges near the runoffs.  But I played well.   
 I hit it on the right side and I hit it close.  I was always going to be difficult when you make six birdies and no bogeys.   
  
  Q.  You like this match play stuff, don't you?   
 IAN POULTER:  A little bit.   
  
  Q.  Looking forward to the next round now?   
 IAN POULTER:  Yeah, looks like I'm going to be playing Dredgy because he's 3 up on Ernie with three to play.  It's good.  The way I played today, six birdies, no bogeys, and hit it really close.  So it's all good.   
  
  Q.  Bradley, a fellow European?   
 IAN POULTER:  I just need to do what I need to do.  I'll just be doing my own stuff tomorrow.  It's good.  It's nice.   
  
  Q.  You're in a determined mood?   
 IAN POULTER:  I'm ready.  I'm ready.
