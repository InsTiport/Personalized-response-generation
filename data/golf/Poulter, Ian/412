Q.  Looks like things are shaping up.
IAN POULTER:  Not really.  I hit a soft 9 iron, bad hop through the back of the green, made bogey.  And then just steady.  I wasn't playing fantastically well, but I was rolling in balls one after another after another.  Yesterday I couldn't seem to buy one.

I had a good birdie on 10, driver, 5 wood to the middle of the green, two putt birdie.

Birdied the next par 5.

Then a great 7 iron on 17 to about 12 feet and rolled it in.

So 4 under.

I played so well yesterday, I just thought, you know, just don't go after it, and I hit 9 iron straight at the pin, pushed it a touch.  Then I tried to keep it on the right, the safe side, and then just rolled a couple in.
Q.  The experience at the U.S. Open a month ago will help you going into this weekend?
IAN POULTER:  Yeah, I hit it on the right side of the pins.  You know, hitting it to 15, 20 feet was close, anything on the green, and you're going to leave yourself a half decent chance.  Especially from 15, 20 feet with how good they're rolling.
