IAN POULTER: Obviously the afternoon wave of guys, as you see, probably had enough time to have breakfast and look at your phone, look at social media, see what's going on. A lot of it was last night with the NBA. So yeah, it was definitely harder to focus on the job at hand.   
 Q.  Are you comfortable playing this championship this weekend?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I'm comfortable. I mean, this is never an easy situation. Having spectators gathering in large groups obviously globally isn't great right now, so I know that the Australian Grand Prix is affected and have pulled out, if you look at obviously the NBA and other sports, and our football back home is going to be affected, other football leagues are affected. Large groups of people -- I mean, it's difficult. We need to contain the issue. We've all got parents -- a lot of us have got parents and a few of us have got grandparents, right, so it's probably more of a family thing than anything else, and if you catch it, we don't want to give it to them because it's going to be more dangerous if they catch it than obviously the slightly younger ones. It's not easy.   
 Q.  Where are you on the level of concern, not necessarily micro with golf but globally and lifestyles?  
IAN POULTER: Well, globally it's an issue, right. We've all listened and we've read what's been going on globally now for the last few weeks, and it's difficult and a difficult situation to be in. I think certain levels of sport can still carry on and do their thing. I mean, I think the lucky thing with us is we -- and we do play outside for the most part. Heat from what I've read is a good thing to keep it away, and obviously if that's done over the next few weeks with most spectators, and I know that's not ideal for the fans that want to come and watch us play golf, but it's probably a necessary thing that had to happen.
