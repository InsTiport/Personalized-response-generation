  Q. Can we get your thoughts on the round?  
 IAN POULTER: Not obviously what I was after today. I put myself out of position a couple times off the tee today, kind of got myself out of trouble with the tee shots, but I was hanging in there.   
 I was just -- I got a poor lie in the bunker on 12, which to me was the only disappointing thing of the day. I really had no shot. There was no sand at the front of the bunker; I'm on the downslope; I had no shot; consequently I made double bogey, and that's obviously a big blow.  
  
  Q. Are you pleased with the way you fought back from that, though, the rest of the round?  
 IAN POULTER: Well, you know, I played how I was playing without that on the scorecard. No, I'm not pleased. I'm a few shots adrift of where I wanted to be. I'm not overly happy right now.  
  
  Q. And what do you think about your position and going into the final day, six behind Lee, five behind Phil? Do you think you can catch them?  
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I've got a chance. You saw what guys were doing on the golf course today. There was roars all around the golf course, eagles are being made, second shots being holed. You know, this golf course can give up eagles quite easily. I'm just going to have to go out there tomorrow and play well.   
  
  Q. And hopefully get some of those roars.   
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, that would be great.  
  
  Q. Can you talk about how Lee played today?  
 IAN POULTER: Lee played very well. He played great. He played lovely.
