  Q. Your match went down to the 19th hole. How satisfying is to produce a quality shot on the 19th hole?  
 IAN POULTER: Very satisfying. I had a chance on 17 to close the match out. And then obviously Justin holed an 18-footer on me to send it to the extra hole. He was having a bit of trouble done the right side, and I hit a good shot.  
  
  Q. The adrenalin flowing right from the first tee, normally it's the back nine on Sunday, but here it is every hole?  
 IAN POULTER: It is kind of every hole. You have to play your way into a round of golf. When you're playing a guy like Justin, you know he's going to hole putts on you. He's steady and he hits a lot of greens. So it was good to hang in there today. I got up early, and there was -- all of a sudden I gave him a hole and all of a sudden I'm 2-down.   
  
  Q. You played well in the championship before. What is it about this format?  
 IAN POULTER: It gets the adrenalin going to me. It's different than stroke play. You are counting holes. You have to make birdies, otherwise you're out. It's a great format.
