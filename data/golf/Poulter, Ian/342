 Q. Ian, what are your thoughts as you walk off the 18th green?
 IAN POULTER: Do you really want to know? I'm disappointed. Two bogeys to finish is not good enough. I had chances in the last five holes as well. 
 So shame walking off level par when a couple putts from inside 10 feet could have easy taken me to 4-under with a couple to place, it's a shame.

 Q. You seem baffled with that putt on 16?
 IAN POULTER: Decided to move right to left. How I practiced the putt goes from right to left. And so decided to move a little left to right of me at the end. It's a shame. I thought it was a good putt and it was a good birdie chance.

 Q. How pleased were you with your iron play today?
 IAN POULTER: I played lovely. I played really, really solid. So very happy. I'm playing, swinging -- my swing feels pretty good and hopefully we can have a good Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
