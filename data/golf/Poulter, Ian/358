 Q. You got off to a fast start today?
 IAN POULTER: I was just trying to focus early. Match play you have to get off to a decent start and put your opponent under as much pressure as you can and try and finish the game off as soon as you can. I got off to a quick start to be three up after four and I kept my foot on the accelerator and hitting good golf shots. If you do that then you should be able to finish your opponent off.

 Q. We saw at the Ryder Cup how much you love match play?
 IAN POULTER: I do enjoy it. You have to make birdies to win holes and occasionally you can play tactical when your opponent is out of position. Especially with the greens here, if he gets out of position you need to get your ball in play. You have to be careful with these greens as you can short side yourself. The wind picked up this afternoon and it was tricky. 

 Q. Everything okay with the eye operation?
 IAN POULTER: All good.

 Q. Looking forward to tomorrow?
 IAN POULTER: Very much so. Either Sergio or Charl so looking forward to it.
