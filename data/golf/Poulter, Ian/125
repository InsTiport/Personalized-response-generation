  IAN POULTER: Really should be able to it on that green with a massive backboard and shot -- not committing to the shot, so that was two shots gone there. The other one was an 8-iron where it leaked out to the right and that's been the story of the week.  Not hitting as many shots as I would have liked to in the three weeks I had off withdrawing from the Texas event, coming in, to be honest, a little rusty.  It's a shame I couldn't get any more work done than I what I did.  I always knew it was going to be tricky coming in having not hit as many balls as I would have liked to.  I've been pain-free the last week, which has been good, so I put some good work in. Missing a lot of drives way right, had a couple of iron shots way right.  Because of that it's been damaging.  When I put it in play, I've been brilliant.  I hit a lot of good shots, used a lot of the slopes, felt really comfy on the golf course.  Got to understand it pretty quickly.  You can use some of the ridges, you can't use all of the ridges. So today was disappointing because I started to get the game where I wanted to, but a couple of shots to the right, the double, which was the 5-iron, I didn't commit to the 8-iron, which I tried to hit a fraction too hard which was pushed out right.  That caused a bogey. Actually hit a pretty good sand wedge into 17, but it came up two yards short of being stiff.  There's a short par-3 way shortened, funky little pin.  Quite a nice hole playing the way it is.  Didn't make par there.  Ifs and buts and all those good things.  Could have been a really good round, could have posted 5-under today and really been right back in this golf tournament. Put myself out of it a little bit the first two days.  Too many loose shots out to the right.  I'm going to go to the range and rectify it and get the swing back on track.
