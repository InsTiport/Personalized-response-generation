Q.   Are the length of the rounds affecting you out there? 
IAN POULTER:   It was a long day. 

Q.   But this is longer than normal.   How does that affect you guys? 
IAN POULTER:   Energy levels. 

Q.   What stands out the most besides the weather affecting everything? 
IAN POULTER:   It's the wind.   It's just obviously very, very difficult.   It's very hard to putt it in play, and you're fighting the course for so long, you're fighting the wind, and it's very tiring.   Six‑hour rounds, in any major, is obviously going to wear you out. 

Q.   Does that annoy you? 
IAN POULTER:   There's nothing you can do about it.   I would like to find anybody that can get around this golf course in under six hours in this wind.   I mean, it is brutal.   I mean, it's absolutely brutal.   The way the wind blows on this golf course, there's so many crosswinds from start to finish, you can't really use the wind at all.   It's not helping any shots. 
So you're always fighting against it, cutting against the right‑to‑lefts and trying to draw it against the left‑to‑rights.   When you do that, you can get out of position and you can double‑cross it and find yourself a long way away from the target and this course is penal. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
IAN POULTER:   It's enjoyable when you're at the top end of the leaderboard, as opposed to being down the bottom end or even fighting to make the cut.   I mean, when you're in contention, then it's fun in a sick way, I guess. 

Q.   What's the sick part? 
IAN POULTER:   Well, it's sick.   I mean, the golf shots this golf course asks you to hit time and time and time and time again, you really have to hit phenomenal golf shots.   The room for error is so tiny, and when you get it wrong, you can be 15 feet below the level of the green in a bad lie in a wasteland bunker with not much shot. 
So it's very penal, slightly off‑target.
