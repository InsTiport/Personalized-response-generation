Q. 3-under par 67, I'm sensing some frustrating.  Talk us through what happened out there.
IAN POULTER:   It's pretty simple.  I should be 11-under through 11, that might have been probably the best golf I've probably played through 11 holes.  And you know, really without taking the proverbial opportunities.  I had 11 great opportunities and I only took five of them at that stage.  I was 5-under at that point.  But 5-under, and really disappointed.  So it's just like plod on, keep making good swings, and I didn't finish it off.
So it's utter I didn't disgusting is what it is, and I've shot 3-under par and I'm fuming, like as you can see, I'm furious.  It's unbelievable.  So it's disappointing.
Q. Seems like there's lots of positives in terms of what you are doing in other parts of your game, yesterday your approach game was tops in terms of rankings.  How will you reset for tomorrow?
IAN POULTER:   Well, I can't play better golf; you can't put it in a position to have 11 to birdie inside 20 feet and most of those were comfortably inside 20 feet.  A few putts are just sliding past.
I can't really do more than I'm doing.  It's just really annoying.  I was in a position to make the cut last week and to shoot 5-under on the back nine and to miss a three-foot putt to make the cut and I shouldn't be in that position, either.  It's annoying.  You catch me right after a round of golf, and I could smash the living daylight of everything right now.
But that's golf.  It's a great game.  I'm trying to push to get back inside the Top-50 in the World Rankings.  I put a lot of pressure on myself to perform well, and I haven't performed well the last two weeks and I put myself in a position to perform great this week and I'm missing some chances.  Just keep doing what I'm doing and maybe tomorrow they will go in.
