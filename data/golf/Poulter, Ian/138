 Q.   How important are these next few holes, however many you're going to get to play?   
IAN POULTER:   Every pole is important.   As far as we get, I don't know how far we're going to get right now.   4:30 tee off, might play nine holes.   So you know, every hole today was crucial and every hole that we're going to go and play right now will be, as well.  
   
 Q.   You got it going nicely with though bogey?  
IAN POULTER:   Played nicely, very happy.
