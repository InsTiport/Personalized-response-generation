IAN POULTER:  Just shanked up a couple of shots right at
the last.  Obviously 16 and 18, had it right there.  Leaves myself
a little work to do tomorrow.  But my game is in shape and need to
roll a few putts in tomorrow, and I can run back up the board.
Q.  How do you compare the challenges from yesterday to
today?
IAN POULTER:  They're still challenging.  The greens were
fractionally slower today than they were yesterday.  They've
obviously put substantial amount of water shot on the greens last
night to try and help us slow the ball down entering the greens,
but it's not easy, it's tricky.
Q.  At the moment you're seven shots behind the leader, is
that too much?
IAN POULTER:  They haven't finished yet.
Q.  So as far as you're concerned tomorrow definitely --
IAN POULTER:  You tell me, you've seen everyone play the
last three days.  You know what can happen.
Q.  How about the wind, how much was that a factor today?
IAN POULTER:  Easterly wind, same as yesterday.  About
the same speed.  Temperature was a bit cooler.  So ball probably
wasn't carrying just as far.  But it was very similar to
yesterday.
Q.  What was the best thing you take from your round today?
IAN POULTER:  That I'm playing well.
Q.  What's the game plan tomorrow?
IAN POULTER:  Play well.
