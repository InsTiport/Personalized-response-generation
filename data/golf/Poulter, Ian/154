  IAN POULTER: The team spirit this week has been amazing.  We knew we was going up against a strong U.S. Team.  Paul had a plan and stuck to his plan and the boys have come through today and executed nicely.   Q.  Yesterday you made a huge shot at 15 in a match you felt like you needed.  Talk us through that shot at 15 yesterday.  IAN POULTER: Well, you know, I got off to a nice start and made a couple of birdies early and not a lot went in for me after that.  Rory kind of took over, which world No. 1's probably should, and then just at the right time.  The match was looking like it was going to go 2-down with three to play. And you know what, when you have that inner belief that anything is possible, wonderful things happen.  And that was one of those moments where you're going to look back and just say, you know, certain shots in the week might have made a difference and that might have been one of them.  ^
