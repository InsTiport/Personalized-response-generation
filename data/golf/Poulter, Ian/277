 Q. Neither of you guys started the way you wanted to. How would you explain the first nine holes of the match?
 IAN POULTER: I would have said they were very steady to be honest. It was cold and it was difficult to hit some of those pins first thing this morning. The ball was releasing quite a lot, so the greens were still pretty firm. So it was pretty cagey, you know, for a while around that front nine. 
 Then all of a sudden, I get my nose in front. You know, I really should have shut the match out, to be honest with you. Every credit to him, holed putts at the right time. That's what you have to do in this format. You have to hole the putts. If you don't hole putts at the right time, then you are going to get beat. 
 I had all my chances today and I feel that I left some out there. He putted me off the golf course today. That's what you have to do in this format. You have to hole putts at the right time. I did it last year and managed to go all the way. This year I missed my chances and therefore I have been punished.
