  Q. Reflect, please, if you would, on a wonderful comeback?  
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was a good comeback. I was pretty frustrated to be 3-down through three. I think two of those holes were obviously the fault of my own and the other hole, you know, Frankie holes a 30-foot putt on a very tough par 3.   
 So 3-down through three is not where you want to be. I knew it was windy and it's on a tough golf course, so I just had to be patient, try to take advantage of good shots. I did that. I made a few birdies on him and he played great golf from there on in. I think he only made one bogey from there on coming in.   
 So I had to do something, and I managed to hole a couple of putts at the right time.  
  
  Q. And I presume your wealth much match-play experience was very much at the fore?  
 IAN POULTER: Sure. The adrenaline, and being in a that position -- I find it enjoyable to be in, but 3-down to Frankie, Top-25 in the world, you're leaving yourself a lot of work to do.   
  
  Q. On Twitter, West Ham were ahead and not kept the lead all season, but there were some saying that Arsenal have not fought back when they have been behind.   
 IAN POULTER: Arsenal have been pants.   
  
  Q. Well, not for your side.   
 IAN POULTER: I can only go away from this happy, 3-down through three, and I've managed to scrape half a point.   
  
  Q. And you'd always be in there in this format, but you have a tough one against Paul Lawrie who is in form.   
 IAN POULTER: Sure, he's in good form. I have not played with Paul for a while, so it's going to be a tough match. I'm going to go out there and focus hard and try to hit the right shots at the right time.
