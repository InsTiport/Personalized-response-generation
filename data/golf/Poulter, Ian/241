 Q.   What's your verdict on that?  
IAN POULTER:   I guess 2‑under par is a pretty decent score.   3‑under through ten, made a little mistake coming in from the middle of the fairway, 5‑iron to the green‑‑  
   
 Q.   The sandy areas does that affect the way you play shots around the greens, you can ground your club.   
IAN POULTER:   I haven't yet but‑‑ inaudible‑‑ as you say you can ground your club.   
   
 Q.   Saw you out there yesterday late in the day‑‑ some people come here and play hundreds of practice rounds.   Is it about conserving energy for you?  
IAN POULTER:   I think so.   I've done it every major this year so far, just played one practice round.   I played nine holes and nine holes‑‑ (Inaudible.) You know, for me‑‑ 90 per cent humidity, a hundred degrees‑‑ inaudible‑‑ for the weekend.   
After last week, a little cracked and massage‑y‑‑ (Inaudible.) I knew when I got to three, I wanted to get to four.   I didn't get to four.   Hit the 5‑iron in one of those bunkers and didn't get it up‑and‑down.   You can't win golf tournaments on a Thursday, you can only lose them.   So once you get to three, you try to get to four and when you get to four, you get to five.   That's the process.   
   
 Q.   Inaudible.   
IAN POULTER:   I'd like to be 18‑under par but it's not going to happen, is it.   Yeah, I mean, 3‑under par, it's 14th right now.   Yeah, it's well positioned.   
   
 Q.   Does the course suit your game?  
IAN POULTER:   Does it suit my game?   Well, it's only the second time I've played it and I've shot 2‑under par, so I feel pretty comfortable on the golf course hitting fairways and hitting greens.   
   
 Q.   And for The Ryder Cup‑‑  
IAN POULTER:   I'm trying to win the Wanamaker Trophy.
