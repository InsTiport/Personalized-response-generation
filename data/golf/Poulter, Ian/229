Q.   You took care of it on the greens on the back nine, huge birdie on 10; the hole out of the bunker and the big par on 16, big smile?   
IAN POULTER:   Smiling highly.   This for me was a tough game; it was a tough go for both of us.   Tiger has had two of my three defeats and I never wanted to have another one.   So it was going to be a tough day.   But as Justin said, I've got his back and he's got mine.   He asks me to hole a putt, I'm going to go and deliver.
