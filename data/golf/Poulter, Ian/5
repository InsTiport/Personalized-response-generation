Q. That was a massive test out there?
IAN POULTER:   It tests everything, that you have.  You've got all shots from archives you haven't hit for a while.  It's miserable.  But we're playing golf.  We're in a lucky position to be here playing this Aberdeen Standard Scottish Open for a lot of money.  So a lot of guys have put a lot of hard work in to get us here.  We're here.  We're wet.  So we just need to dry off and go again tomorrow.
Q. Going back to 12, 13, umbrellas flipping around, tee shot on 12, ball goes right.  Is it out of control?  You need to get through it?  Tell us about those moments.
IAN POULTER:   It's really easy to sit here and just moan and say the golf course got unplayable, right.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to say it was a massive mental challenge, and we needed all of the greenkeepers help to get us here.
So they were squeegeeing hard the last few holes to get us in to close of play today.  It's not easy.  That wasn't an easy test of golf.
Q. Rolex Series Event, you're still very much in it.  Tomorrow could be similar.
IAN POULTER:   My thoughts are not about tomorrow.  You know, sounds stupid, but I really lost count of what I was scoring out there around that back nine.  I had no idea.  I couldn't write numbers on the scoreboard.  I couldn't keep my hands dry.
You know, I'm in contention.  That's a good thing, right.  So I played three rounds.  Rocky has obviously shot an incredible round of golf today, to shoot that in those conditions.  We're in touching distance.  That's all I can ask for.
