 Q. What was the key to eliminating the bogeys today?
 IAN POULTER: Just patience. I kept doing what I did yesterday which was hitting good shots. I drove the ball great today. I put a new driver in the bag today and it is going down the middle of the fairway most of the time which is great and I am giving myself lots of chances. I didn't take too many of them but the ones I should have holed I did and I could have taken a few more. But it was a clean scorecard, no silly bogeys which was good.

 Q. Give us a sense of playing conditions out there?
 IAN POULTER: A little different to yesterday but the golf course is scoreable because even if you hit it a little bit off line, you can advance it to the green and perhaps even get it on the green pretty close sometimes and you can see that guys are taking advantage of that. Hopefully I'm not in the rough too often and I've been in the middle of the fairway so I can control the ball which is key. If the greens dry out over the weekend that is going to make it a little more tricky and here, as we know, they can put some difficult pin positions out here on Saturday and Sunday and I am sure they are going to do that.

 Q. What are your thoughts for the weekend coming in four or five behind?
 IAN POULTER: I need to take the chances when I get them over the weekend and, as we said before, no silly bogeys. If we do that, I am going to make lots of birdies and hopefully I can have a real go.
