IAN POULTER: I'm a little hot under the collar right now.  I'm not disappointed I didn't get the job done today in terms of finishing where I need to finish, but that today could have been a victory and I let it slip.  Three-putt from 25 feet, unacceptable.  Another three-putt up here.  So two three-putts.  I have chances on the two par-5s from eight feet, didn't convert those.  That's four shots.  All of a sudden that's 12-under par.  And putts in the closing stretch.  I could have got it done today and I should have got it done today.  Three-putt is unacceptable, especially from the distances I was.  I pride myself on being a good putter.  But the flat stick didn't do what I needed to do.  I didn't close out any of the putts that I expected to close out.  And subsequently ended up shooting 73.
Q. Do you feel you can take something positive into next week?
IAN POULTER: I feel comfortable with my game of golf.  That's just really disappointing that I actually played well enough -- I played well enough to win the golf tournament today.  I didn't do it with the flat stick.  I missed putt after putt after putt.  I need to continue to work harder on the putting, less on the rest of the game of golf.  If I do that obviously I'm going to win tournaments.  But today was not good enough with the flat stick.
