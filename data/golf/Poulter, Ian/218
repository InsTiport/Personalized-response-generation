Q.   Ian, first of all, congratulations on a great win.   I saw you just look at that scoreboard, USA 10, Europe 10.   What can you possibly be thinking right now? 
IAN POULTER:   An unbelievable week.   I mean, last night we took such a lot from those last two wins.   I mean, it was amazing to see the atmosphere change in that team room.   The spirit, I mean, it just changed.   You know what, guys were pumped up; for the first time this week we'd been beaten quite clearly, and we just felt there was that little glimmer of hope.   You know what, whether it's this good man right on my left sleeve right now that's going to pull us through this or Ollie, I don't know.   It's pretty special. 

Q.   Seve is trying hard, that's for sure. 
IAN POULTER:   Seve is trying hard.   It's incredible.
