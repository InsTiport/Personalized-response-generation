Q.   The shot at 7, terrific bounce back birdie that you really needed.   Tell us about that swing?
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, it was a good swing.   I guess it's been a long day, a long few days and I was just saying to my son, Luke, right there, look what happens when you forget to concentrate.   Silly things happen.   Tiring, and made a couple of really bad swings on 5 and 6.   But that kind of angered me inside enough to spark a little bit of energy there to hit a good shot on 7.

Q.   Were you getting tired on 5? 
IAN POULTER:   I mean, it was a lack of concentration.   I've tried to take too much off an 8‑iron and hit a beautiful shank.   And obviously you're out of position right there.   So it was an easy double‑bogey and poor tee shot on the following hole. 
But I'm pretty pleased with the golf I've played throughout the whole of today.   I haven't really made many mistakes, at all.   I've put it in position an awful lot, which is encouraging right now, and if I do that tomorrow, then I'm going to be in a good position.

Q.   Tied for the lead going into tomorrow, what's the game plan now?   Obviously as you said, you're playing really well. 
IAN POULTER:   I'm playing good.   So I need to be patient, keep making the swings I've made throughout the whole of today and when I do that, I'm obviously going to hit good shots, give myself looks.   If I take a few chances then obviously I'm going to be in with a chance. 

Q.   How big was that hole‑out on 7? 
IAN POULTER:   Massive, massive.   It was a bit of a body blow, shall we say, 5 and 6, come out of nowhere.   It was some pretty good golf today, I've got to be honest, and that just come out of left field. 
I said to Luke on the buggy, you know, lack of concentration; whether it's a little bit of tiredness at the end of the day, silly things line that can creep in.   But it was good to obviously rectify that with a great shot at 7. 

Q.   How much did your experience in Dubai last fall where you had the sort of disjointed rounds and I think you had said then, you wished you had kept it together a little better.   Were you able to carry that over and that accounted for why you were able to hold it together this week? 
IAN POULTER:   Been able to hold it together‑‑

Q.   Stay patient?
IAN POULTER:   Rain delays, there's nothing you can do.   We knew it when we looked at the weather forecast, it was obviously going to be really tricky. 
You know, you can't get on the golf course when the weather is bad, I know that much.   You can only do what the weather is going to allow you to do and be ready for when you are going to be out there on the golf course.   And for the most part I've done that pretty good this week.

Q.   What were you telling yourself walking to the 7th tee?
IAN POULTER:   You don't really want to know because‑‑ (laughter) trust me, you don't.   It's not for newspaper or Internet worthy.   I was pissed.   I was seriously pissed.   Having a three‑shot lead, I didn't even realize that I had a three‑shot lead at that stage but I was in cruise control, shall we say, not making bad swings.   I was in position a lot. 
As I said, you take your foot off the accelerator for one second, all of a sudden, you find yourself completely out of position making an easy double‑bogey. 
So, yeah, I was internally very angry, shall we say.   And when I do that, obviously my heart rate goes up slightly and obviously that sometimes is what needs to kick in to kick in the adrenaline.   So the shot on 7 was fueled with adrenaline, because I was so pissed off. 

Q.   What did you hit in there? 
IAN POULTER:   Hit 6‑iron.
