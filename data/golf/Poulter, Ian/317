  Q. Sum that one up?  
 IAN POULTER: Didn't play very well.   
  
  Q. Anything in particular problematical?   
 IAN POULTER: Didn't play very well. Neck was fine. Just didn't play very well.   
  
  Q. From the start, the second shot into the trees.   
 IAN POULTER: Yeah.   
  
  Q. Tough one. How about yesterday? We didn't speak to you before you played the course?  
 IAN POULTER: It's in good condition.   
  
  Q. Too tough?  
 IAN POULTER: I didn't play very well, so, I mean, I don't know what you want me to say, how much more you want me to elaborate. You can see my scorecard. I didn't play very well. So if you're not going to play well on this golf course, then it's going to punish you. It's a punishment today.  
  
  Q. Was it all aspects of the game?   
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I mean, I didn't hit it good. I miss-hit a few tee shots. I had to chip back out on a couple of fairways. It's hard, you know, it's hard to scramble around this golf course the way they have changed it.   
  
  Q. You weren't a fan of it before the changes. Do you just not like the setup?   
 IAN POULTER: I don't know. My stats are my stats, aren't they. Stats don't lie, do they?   
  
  Q. Were the greens any truer?   
 IAN POULTER: The greens were lovely. I mean, they are in lovely condition.   
  
  Q. Nothing dropped in then?  
 IAN POULTER: No, not really.
