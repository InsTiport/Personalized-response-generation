 Q. 6 under par and a clean scorecard. This golf course got a little tough when you were finishing out there?
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was certainly playable for the first nine holes. I felt as if I could certainly get a score going, I should be 5 under. It started getting tricky toward the end, but managed some good golf shots and played well today.

 Q. I was told you were chipping out of your mind today?
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I've chipped well. I chipped in yesterday. I chipped in today. You know, I feel confident from around the greens. 
 The ball sits nice and tight. I can get a little bit of spin on on it, and when I have short shotted myself, I've been able to do some chip shots.

 Q. That's what I was told is that your short game around this place has been ridiculously good. Any time you've gotten yourself in any kind of maybe sketchy situation, you just stand over and go, Problem? What are you talking about problem? 
 IAN POULTER: When I'm in this mode, I enjoy playing golf, because I can go, if I'm missing shots on my self, I can hopefully get myself out of trouble. That's what I've done the last couple of days. 

 Q. 6 under par, can you talk about your day? 
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was nice. I played solid. I was frustrated yesterday. I made too many bogies. Made a double bogey on 17, which was unlike me. But today the wind was fine over-the-air first nine holes and then started to pick up. I managed to get under par early, birdied the first few holes. And I managed good scoring.

 Q. You got a taste of the wind yesterday afternoon. You got a taste of what the guys played in the morning yesterday. It seems like it evened out. But it seems like you're going to be playing in the wind the rest of the week?
 IAN POULTER: I think so. I think that's what this golf course needs. It's a good golf course. There are some tough par 4's, a couple of very tough par 3s that you have to be careful on. But they're setting the course up very well. 
 There are a couple of tees which are forward. With the pin on the front and as firm as the greens are straight downwind, they're moving the tees forward on the right holes so at least it gives us a chance to get the ball within 15 feet. That's certainly nice.

 Q. European Tour player, runner up at Open Championship. You know how to play wind. Do you like playing in the wind? 
 IAN POULTER: I do. I love it. I said to Terry out on the golf course today, it's been turning linksy. That's how it feels. Tight lies and the greens getting firm. So I'm happy to be out there playing golf. 

 Q. Around the greens, your work is great. You said linksy, a little linksy around the green? 
 IAN POULTER: A little linksy. The lies are getting pretty tight. You know, I said to the guys, I'm enjoying chipping right now because I can put a little bit of spin on the ball. 
 Certainly when you pick up some of the grain and down grain, and play certain chips according to whether the grain is going to be into or downward wherever the ball is going to land. I managed to chip really well.

 Q. You like fun. Tell people about the fun in New Orleans?
 IAN POULTER: It's pretty fun. I've had room service last night.

 Q. Boring. 
 IAN POULTER: Boring. Let me tell you, I am boring right now. I mean, I've got a six-week old. And to be honest, I had 11 hours sleep the first day I got here. I was in bed by 8:00 o'clock last night. 
 I'm not having no fun downtown. I wish I was, because it's Jazz Fest right now, and I could hear some noise out there last night. It would have been nice to go out there and have a couple of drinks. Maybe Sunday night.
