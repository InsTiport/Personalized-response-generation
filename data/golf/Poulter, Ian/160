Q.   Do you feel if you would have had better conditions‑‑
IAN POULTER:   There's nothing about better conditions or not.   It was tricky for everyone.   It was wet. 

Q.   Should we have been playing? 
IAN POULTER:   What should we have been playing?   When it was cooled off?   Or should we have had been playing preferred lies, or what should we really have been doing? 

Q.   It's a wide open question. 
IAN POULTER:   It is a wide open question.   But we've never played preferred lies in a major.   So this is what‑‑ this is what you're going to get.   You're unfortunately going to get guys that are going to miss‑‑ unfortunately miss‑hit a lot of shots and get badly punished, and it might be someone's week to win a major, and unfortunately it isn't because of an awkward lie in a soggy fairway.

Q.   Did they restart too soon, do you think, for the sake of trying to finish, did you get that sense of trying to finish? 
IAN POULTER:   Well of course.   Of course.   They pretty much took relief on every fairway and twice we had to take relief from the fairway into the rough to get a dry spot. 

Q.   How many holes with water‑‑
IAN POULTER:   15 I had to drop it just in the semi‑rough and ThorbjÃ¸rn had to drop it in the semi‑rough on 18.

Q.   What's your plans now in terms of schedule? 
IAN POULTER:   I have next week off.   I'll have a week off before the FedExCup, yeah. 

Q.   Any scope of adding anything in Europe? 
IAN POULTER:   No. 

Q.   Just all FedEx? 
IAN POULTER:   My schedule is my schedule and I'll play next week and if I play well enough then I'll be an automatic in.   If not, talk to somebody else.

Q.   McGinley said that there was no question that the Europeans wore favorites going into Gleneagles.   Your thoughts about that, because it's not often that at least on paper it seems like the European are the favorites. 
IAN POULTER:   My thoughts‑‑ well, I mean, obviously I think there's been a couple of injuries for the American Team at the minute. 
But listen, it's Ryder Cup and a weak team or a strong team, doesn't matter who is it playing, who is not playing, it's going to be a really difficult week.
Whether we are favorites is irrelevant.   It's the Ryder Cup.   And you know, we have seen guys go in there and demolish people that are much higher in the World Rankings.   It doesn't mean anything when it comes to it.   It's Ryder Cup.   Guys are going to play with passion and both teams are going to be fighting really hard.

Q.   They used to say that beating Tiger was worth more than a point.   Do you feel like beating you or Rory is worth more than a point? 
IAN POULTER:   I don't know.   You'll have to ask someone else. 

Q.   Thought I would get a better answer from you. 
IAN POULTER:   I'm giving you a nice answer; not the one you want, anyway.

Q.   Can you understand why they didn't go two tee start and three balls early this morning?
IAN POULTER:   You know what, no idea, it's the PGA.   I haven't got a clue.   No idea.   We was asked to stay in position on the 12th green. 

Q.   Did they take your umbrella away, too?
IAN POULTER:   I had to get a canoe to get in.   I mean, come on. 

Q.   Did they have vans or anything out there for you guys? 
IAN POULTER:   No, the 12th green is just‑‑

Q.   I saw other guys walking in. 
IAN POULTER:   Do you know what, it was just laughable in the end.   Hold position, hold position, hang on a second, we can't even see anything apart from water.   I mean, you're going to make your own judgment at that point.   Get in the clubhouse, where you are actually going to, you know, stage right, most guys have to change outfits. 
There's only too much‑‑ there's only so much rain an umbrella can keep off you.   You're going to get wet.

Q.   What was the very worst position you saw out on the course? 
IAN POULTER:   I don't know, you guys are watching the telly.   I wasn't paying much attention.   I just wanted to get in.
