   IAN POULTER: Lovely first rounds, 2-under par, three greens missed, played lovelily, hit a lot of good golf shots. Didn't hole many putts today. Need a bit of practise.   
  
  Q. Must be more frustrating for you because you're known as a good putter and it seems your good rounds are only slipping away because you're not holing them.   
 IAN POULTER: No, because everybody keeps saying, you know, talk about frustration and stuff -- I'm happy how I'm playing golf, and I'm hitting the lines I'm reading the putts on. The putts, if they are not going to go in, they are not going to go in right now.   
 I have to just keep working on being positive and keep hitting my line and keep hitting good putts. Sometimes I'm not going to hit it exactly on my line. Sometimes I don't quite get the pace right, and f with that being -- if that's how it's going to happen, I'm going to miss a few putts, but I'll keep plugging away. I'm shooting some good scores and I'll keep trying hard.  
  
  Q. Are you looking at leaderboards and thinking maybe the putts are costing you?   
 IAN POULTER: No, not really. I'm just playing golf, trying to enjoy myself.   
  
  Q. Does that sum up your year?   
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, maybe. Had a couple of bad holes -- it's nice to go bogey-free today. That was very nice. You know, just conscious of going out there and playing solid golf and that's exactly what I did today. I haven't quite done that over the start of this year to be honest. I've made some mistakes on the golf course which I don't really need to make. So I'm just going to go out there and play golf and try to enjoy myself and stay as patient as I can, but see how we go.   
  
  Q. How far are you from where you want to be looking ahead to next week, as well?  
 IAN POULTER: I'm three rounds short of next week.   
  
  Q. Three good rounds?  
 IAN POULTER: I'm playing well. I missed three greens in regulation. I'm obviously hitting the golf ball well. I'm happy how I'm playing golf. I've just got to be happy that I'm working on the right stuff and just stay positive. It will happen. It will happen.
