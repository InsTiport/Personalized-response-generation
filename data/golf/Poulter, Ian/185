Q.   Thoughts on a 67 today?
IAN POULTER:   Obviously nice score.   It was apparent that guys were going low fairly early this morning, so you needed to make a couple of birdies.   That's what I did on the front nine and that's exactly what I did on the back nine.   Limited my mistakes today, which I think is what I didn't do yesterday.   Made too many of them. 
But I'm making enough birdies, and I just need to do that over the weekend.

Q.   And your position on that board tidy apart from one player that certainly needs catching?
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, Dustin is out in front.   It's not the first time he's been in that position.   I'm in control of my ball.   I'll do my bit and see what happens on Sunday.

Q.   And do you sense that you can shoot even lower as he as done today; the chances are there?
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, the golf course, the way the greens are allows guys to make birdies, allows guys to hole putts from 20, 30 feet, and there's a few opportunities out there where you can certainly attack the par 5s and obviously a couple of short par 4s. 

Q.   Is there some sense of progress with you as well, eliminating those mistakes and just knowing that the game is pretty close?
IAN POULTER:   Game is good.   Frustrated last week about making mistakes, and as long as I limit those mistakes this week, I'm going to be close.
