IAN POULTER:   67, I'm very pleased with that.  I played absolutely awesome today.  I made plenty of chances.  I knew when not to go for the pins and tried to get myself the easy putts.  The rain had slowed the greens down today.  My only blemish was on the 16th when I hit a 9-iron for my third shot and it went into the back drop and I had a horrific lie.  Overall, thought it was a nice round.  I swung it awesome today.  I feel comfortable here and I'm happy with my swing.  I just hope I keep in that mode for the rest of the week.  That would be quite nice.  I prefer this type of course to last week.  I saw what was happening from Scotland today.  I sat in the locker room and watched TV, so I knew how things are in the Scottish PGA Championship.  Four decent rounds and I will be happy  -- four rounds like the way I played today, and I would have a real chance.
