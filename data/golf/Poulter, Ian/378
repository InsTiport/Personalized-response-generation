 Q. How do you feel you did today? 
 IAN POULTER: Just like my score, could be better. I made a lot of birdies out there today. But I've missed some opportunities. Certainly on the par 5s, I had three eagle putts from holeable range, which I missed. And I've missed a fair share of birdie putts. Shame to bogey the last. That would have been nice. But I'm playing really well. I'm driving the ball great. My irons are superb, and you know, the ball has finally decided to go in the hole. 
 But I can still hole more putts. 

 Q. Bogeyed the 10th but holed a bunker shot at 11. How important was that for momentum? 
 IAN POULTER: It was nice. It was a bad 9-iron into 10. Lack of concentration. The but as you say it was good to bounce back pretty quickly with a bunker shot on the next and made a few birdies from there coming in. 

 Q. And how do you feel about your prospects for the weekend? 
 IAN POULTER: Prospects are great. If I keep playing the way I'm playing, I'm going to have a great chance. I can only keep doing what I'm doing and keep hitting good golf shots and keep hitting what I think are good putts, you know, I read my lines pretty good. I hit a lot of good putts and they just shaved the hole. If I keep doing that, they will go in and we'll be moving up the top of the leaderboard.
