  QQ - Fourth Round 67. Total 258 (-22)

 Q. Ian, you shot a 60 this week, you only made two bogeys, you played fantastic, about as good as it gets?
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, after hitting a poor 4-iron on the third hole and making bogey, I think I pretty much had a birdie putt on every single hole. You know, putts from eight feet which kept looking like they were going to go in but didn't. But to make five at the last, get the job done, it's a good victory.

 Q. People expected the challenge from the McIlroys and McDowells and they didn't; did that surprise you?
 IAN POULTER: It's one of those types of golf course, if you get off to a quick start like Simon Dyson did, of course you're going to put yourself on the board. I would have expected those guys to hole perhaps a couple more putts and come a little early. But I played great all week and it's just nice to be able to have another w. 

 Q. You're now looking at winning major championships; is there something you've identified to maybe cross that hurdle?
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, resting. I had four weeks off after The Ryder Cup, and I've come out -- I'm not saying I should have won the first two weeks I came out, but I'm very disappointed over the last couple of weeks, and this is a little bit bittersweet. 
 So I'll rest up, get fit, practise hard and hopefully come out real strong for 2011. 

 Q. This golf course, it's a fairly easy course, would you want to make changes and toughen it up, or do you enjoy a course where you can make birdies and have lots of fun?
 IAN POULTER: I think it's nice, because there's so many courses we play every single week, 590-yard par 5s and long par 3s, this is a fun golf course. Nothing should be changed. You know, if the rough is a tiny bit thicker and the greens dry out a little bit, it's a much more difficult golf course. 
 But we've had perfect weather all week, two-mile-an-hour wind today, it was absolutely perfect, so I wouldn't touch it. This is an enjoyable week to play golf. 

 Q. Does this makeup for the loss last night? 
 IAN POULTER: No. (Laughter) I was watching that game. That was pretty disappointing. But you know what, I'm still pretty happy.
