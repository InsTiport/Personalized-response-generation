Q.
 You played some pretty good golf today, 3 under par.
IAN POULTER:  Thank you.  It was nice to get out there.  I've done some hard work on the putting green the last couple of days.  I had a tough time the last week with the putter, and things paid off.  A rolled a couple of nice putts in and hit it pretty solid, so that all adds up to a nice score.
Q.  What did you think of the golf course?
IAN POULTER:  I think it's good, especially for a municipal golf course.  It's fantastic.  It's set up good.  The rough is thick, but if you miss the greens, you're going to be left with a really tricky chip shot.
Q.  What would happen back home if somebody showed up at a muni dressed as sharp as you are?  Would he go noticed or unnoticed?
IAN POULTER:  I have no idea (laughing).  I'm sure he'd get noticed.
Q.  You get noticed wherever you go, but you're most noticed for the way you play the game.  Thanks for your time, Ian.
IAN POULTER:  Thank you.
