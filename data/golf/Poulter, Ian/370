 Q. We've been hearing you missed the green by a foot or a yard or something like that, it's tough. 
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I think it's too close to the mark possibly, and coming onto water on the ninth green and having to stand there for 20 minutes while there's three groups on one hole, I think they have kind of made a mistake. I think they realized they didn't put enough water on the greens and the greens dried out too much. 
 It's tough. It's a tough golf course, isn't it? It's the monster it is. It will be tough for the remainder of the week. I can't see it getting any easier.

 Q. Your round, still going right. 
 IAN POULTER: It's fine, but it's just there's a few missed fairways today, and you can't miss these fairways because you're laying up. You're having to try and up-and-down it from 100 yards or whatever number it leaves you, so it's just tricky.

 Q. You mentioned you're missing them on the right a little bit; is that something you'll try and work on, obviously not tonight? 
 IAN POULTER: It's 5 to 9:00 so I'll be doing no practice tonight. Yeah, on the range tomorrow morning, I'll be trying to release a bit more, something you can't do on the golf course, so I can only do it on the range. 
 But it all fine. I'm hitting the ball well but you miss the fairway by a yard, you're penalized badly. The one on the last, I missed the fairway by a foot, got in the bunker and laid up and you make bogey from it. It's just tough. It's a very tough golf course, which is playing tough.
