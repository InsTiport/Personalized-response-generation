IAN POULTER: Louis wasn't going to back off.  I knew he was going to come on pretty strong.  He's got a green jacket in his closet.  I knew I had to hit good golf shots.  I did that today.  I made a lot of birdies.
Q. Louis would not go away.  This was a great match.  You put him away here at 17.  But you played another great round of golf.
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I knew today was going to be a tough match.  I did my bit.  There's a few phases to this week, and I've got through a couple of them.
Q. And the putter continues to be magical?
IAN POULTER: Yeah, the putter is feeling pretty good.  I'm rolling a few putts in.  And you need to do that in this format or you're not going to go through world match play without holing a few putts.  So it's good.
Q. (Inaudible.)
IAN POULTER: Yeah, that's 45 feet just off the green.  It's obviously quite nice.  The putter is warming up.  My game is warming up.  There's a few putts this week that are really key.  I went through the group phases.  Obviously now we're in the position, things change again, I need to be more aggressive, hole more putts, and obviously put my hands back on this trophy.
Q. (Inaudible.)
IAN POULTER: The adrenaline is going, for sure.  And being 4-up in a match.  And obviously Louis coming back and holing a couple nice putts, he extended the match for a couple more holes.  There's obviously anxious nerves and adrenaline going.  So it's now calm back down for a little bit and go back out whenever they give me my time.
