  Q. Ian, how do you feel about a couple under?   
 IAN POULTER: Nearly, it was a nearly day. I mean, birdieing the first three holes was very nice. You know, obviously getting off to a start like that, you want to just keep it going. It's a tough golf course, a couple of pins were tucked away, and we know it's a tricky finish.   
 When I did make a bogey, I sort of bounced back pretty well and made a birdie, and a nice birdie at the last.  
  
  Q. Padraig has been telling us this week that he's feeling a little flat, understandably. What about you, any reaction to the Open?  
 IAN POULTER: No, I'm not flat, I'm buzzing. I was pretty refreshed. It was a long week off the week afterwards, so I'm just trying to get through the next two weeks as good as I possibly can and put myself in the side. I'm still charging.  
  
  Q. You were disappointing in your putting early in the season. You worked very hard at it at the Open. You've had 51 putts in two rounds. Is the hard work paying off?  
 IAN POULTER: It's certainly paying off. The pace was brilliant the first couple of days, and that's something which I have definitely worked on over the last few months. Actually when you do see the pace on the putts, they have a good look at going in the hole, even if they don't go in.  
  
  Q. You're so excited about trying to make this team, are you able to keep it out of your mind while you're playing?  
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, because I'm playing pretty good. When you do that, then literally you can just relax and go out there and enjoy it, and that's what I'm trying to do right now.
