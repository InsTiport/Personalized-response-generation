Q.  Just comment on your overall view of how you're playing.
IAN POULTER:  I played steady, hit lots of fairways, hit quite a few greens, missed a few good opportunities from sort of six, eight feet, which I would have liked to have taken on these greens.  I'm 2 under par.  It's fine, nice place, first round of the U.S. PGA.
Q.  How do you feel the weather could affect the course?  They're talking we might get some rain.
IAN POULTER:  It might help the scoring a little bit.  And then you've got greens that are going to spike up a bit.  If it rains during the day, the greens could get pretty spiked up, so that will make it a lot more difficult for the guys.
Q.  What are you looking for tomorrow?
IAN POULTER:  65.
Q.  Is there any part of your game that you're looking for
IAN POULTER:  No, nothing.  Enjoy myself.
