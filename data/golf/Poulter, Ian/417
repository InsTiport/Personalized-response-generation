Q. Tell us about today then?
IAN POULTER:  Well, I got off to a pretty good start, rolled in a 40-footer on the first but then three putted the next which was a little frustrating and then rolled in a 30-footer on the next which was very nice.

I felt comfortable on the course but then I just hit a couple of loose drives really, I missed the fairway way right on the fifth and then way left on the sixth. I was a little unfortunate on the sixth because I think someone stood on my ball in the left rough. It was in the long wispy stuff but it was semi-plugged. No-one owned up to it but I had to take a penalty drop as it was completely unplayable. I nearly actually made four by holing a 40-footer and then I just hung in there after that.

I ground out a decent round of golf and then I birdied four of the last six holes which was very pleasing indeed.
Q. It shows great resilience as well considering it is such a mucky old day again now?
IAN POULTER:  Well, it did go flat-calm which was probably the godsend out there, if it had been blowing again all the way round it would have been another really tiring round of golf but the wind died off, a little bit of rain, but all in all I am pretty happy to be three under.
Q. And a sense of relief that you have managed to get finished as well?
IAN POULTER:  Yes, it is always nice to finish. They blew the klaxon when we were half way up the 18th fairway so we finished out. It means another night of ten hours kip, a nice lie in and a relax tomorrow morning.
Q. You could barely be in a better position could you?
IAN POULTER: Well eight shots in front might be better but no, it is not easy out there and three under par is good. Anybody under par is playing fantastic golf.
