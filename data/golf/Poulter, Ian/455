 Q. Obviously annoyed with the finish?

IAN POULTER: Oh my God that was frustrating. I played the perfect round of golf, then bogeyed the last two holes. Great shot into the 17th, the wind should have been off the right hand side but it has gone straight down and missed the green by two yards to the right, screwed. Then I hit a poor tee shot on the last. Shoot five under today and get it to four under par for the tournament and I'm right in amongst it for tomorrow and I've just gone and screwed myself into Sunday. Absolute disgrace. It was so perfect too, missed a few chances as well so it could have been even better, miss some putts and then mess it up on the last two holes. I can't really talk, it's doing my head in. Play so well and then hose it up the wall on the last two holes. It is infuriating.
