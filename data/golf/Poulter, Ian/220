 Q.   How do you reflect on this week?   
IAN POULTER:   To be honest it was a week of coulda, shoulda.   I played really, really well.   Didn't miss many greens in regulation this week.   Played very, very solid.   Gave myself a lot of chances and the putter wasn't quite as warm as what I would have liked it to have been.   I mean, 7‑under today was a true reflection of how I've played.   It's a nice finish but it's a finish which I'm obviously looking at and slightly disappointed.   I felt I had a chance to win this week.  
I had my chances.   I felt that if I kept playing the way I was playing I was going to have chances, and if I start holing a few, and a few more are going to go in; that happened today.   Had a little run at the board but obviously Peter is playing some great golf and he's too far ahead.   
   
 Q.   Was there a moment when you looked at it and thought, probably too far?  
IAN POULTER:   I needed to shoot 62.   I think 10‑under was the right score today to have put any pressure to somehow get to 19, and as that happens, that's probably not going to be good enough.   So 10‑under par was achievable out there this week.   Saw it earlier in the week and felt it was possible.   Just didn't quite happen.   
   
 Q.   Nice to see your Ryder Cup teammate doing well?  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, the board is full of Ryder Cup guys which you would expect, I think guys are still on a high, and rightly so.   It was a great week and there are some great players playing good golf.  
Bodes well, I'm going to play HSBC next week, take a week off in Orlando, see the kiddies and wife and for me it will be Australia, Dubai, Tiger's event in L.A. and then play Shark Shootout and then shut it down for probably five or six weeks.
