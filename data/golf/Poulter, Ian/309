 Q. Five shots better than yesterday, what was the difference in your play? 
 IAN POULTER: Well, yesterday felt like a practise round. I didn't hit any balls Tuesday or Wednesday. So I was kind of a little cautious yesterday, and today I felt better and I could go at a few more pins and started rolling a few more putts in. 

 Q. You shot 1-over yesterday, which is on the cut line, do guys like you even think about the cut, or is it all about just narrowing your gap to the leader? 
 IAN POULTER: I think get as close as you can to the leader. I think this is a golf course I play well and I always have quite a bit of confidence around this place. I knew the leaders were way out in front but I knew if I put a decent score in, 4-under par today, I'll be back in a position where if I have two good rounds on Saturday, and Sunday, and I've done it in the past, I can have a big finish.

 Q. Three Top-10s in your last four starts, so do you come in here licking your lips then?
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I'm looking forward to resting up this afternoon, enjoying the late -- you know, getting a bit better by tomorrow lunchtime and go out there and have some fun.
