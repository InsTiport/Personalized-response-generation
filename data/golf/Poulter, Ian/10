Q. We'll get into your round in a moment, but first, give me your emotions after not playing on the PGA TOUR since THE PLAYERS, to be back out here again?
IAN POULTER: It's refreshing. I think it's been a long time. I mean, 12 weeks of -- well, the first six weeks of uncertainty of when we're going to start, how we're going to start, what it's going to look like, and then obviously to prepare the last three weeks the way we've prepared to come back to tournament golf and the way everyone at the PGA TOUR has handled this week with Charles Schwab to kind of get us in that position to play, I think they've done an incredible job. I feel very comfortable with everything that's taken place this week. It's difficult when you haven't seen your friends for three months and you want to kind of catch up in a way, and obviously you're trying to social distance.
I think it's been good. It's great to be back. I know the fans I'm sure are watching on TV and are going to enjoy the strength of field this week. It's strong. And hopefully they're going to get to watch some great golf.
Q. You say you're comfortable with the new protocols and procedures. You seemed pretty comfortable on the golf course today. Are you satisfied with your performance?
IAN POULTER: Yeah, I'm pretty satisfied. I mean, two bogeys on my back nine, the actual front nine, the two probably toughest holes on the course. Shame to make a mistake there. But I'm playing good. It's just nice to get back out and play golf. I've probably only played three rounds of golf in three months. It's no secret I don't play golf, I practice, so I've come in well practiced, well ready, fitter than I've been in a number of years, and I feel good.
