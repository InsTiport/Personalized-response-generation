 Q.   What were your most pleased with?  
IAN POULTER:   The overall state of my game, because it hasn't been there for a little while.   So I think the work that I put in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday was rewarding to go out there to play well.   It's the most balls I've hit in any session.   The body is allowing me to hit more balls at the minute, which is a good thing.   It's coming into the right time of the year.   
I'm happy that I could work as hard as I wanted to work and take the rewards from that today by playing some very solid golf.  
   
 Q.   What was out there in these conditions?   
IAN POULTER:   There was a few tucked pin positions.   As we have seen, I'm sure the scores have reflected.   The par‑5s, you have to take advantage of.   The couple of short par‑4s, which most guys would take advantage of.   
You've got some key holes, key par‑4s, which are playing very long.   So play them smart and therefore you will be on the board in red figures.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible)?  
IAN POULTER:   I'm conscious.   I'm trying to hit the first fairway.   You know, a good start definitely helps the week and eases the mind from all the nonsense that's been in there over the past eight months.   
Just getting on the board, making a few putts, not making silly mistakes, definitely makes lunch taste a bit better.
