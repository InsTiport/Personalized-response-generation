 Q.   How are you feeling?  
IAN POULTER:   I'm all right.   
   
 Q.   Sum up your day for us?   
IAN POULTER:   Made a few mistakes.   Combination of a couple mistakes on the par 5s, 3‑wood in the hazard and handed a hole to Thongchai there.   
Drove it on‑‑ I can't remember the holes.   12 where it's 272 carry over the rocks into the wind, hit it straight down the middle of the fairway, didn't quite carry, stayed in there.   Handed him another hole.   
And then missed the green just right on the following hole; handed him another hole.   
And he made birdie on the last, par 5, 16.   All in all he played well enough to beat me today, which was good enough.   
   
 Q.   Just one of those days for you where you gave him too many holes?   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I've played Thongchai enough, he's a great player.   I gave him holes today and you don't do that in match play, dead simple.   This is the type of golf course where if you hit a couple of errant shots, you're going to be struggling to be back in the hole, simple.   
   
 Q.   How are you feeling for tomorrow?  
IAN POULTER:   I feel great.   
   
 Q.   Did you have a bad stomach?   
IAN POULTER:   I'll be fine.   
   
 Q.   You're over it?   
IAN POULTER:   I'll be fine.   
   
 Q.   Is this round reflective of what's happened the last couple of weeks?   
IAN POULTER:   No.   Three straight birdies, this is the type of course that if you miss a couple of shots, it's very penal.   It's hard sometimes to make par when you're back under pressure and you could be dropping it from all sorts of places.   
I'll be fine.   It's not often you lose in match play and everything's fine, but no drama.
