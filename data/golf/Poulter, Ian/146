Q.   What's the verdict on that? 
IAN POULTER:   Pretty good.   The course is more difficult is this year.   They have added a few more bunkers.   It was a little tricky with the wind today, and the rough's thick. 
So there's only a couple of holes if you miss the fairway you're able to get to the green and if you did miss a fairway on the other holes, you're going to be struggling.   So 2‑under par is a decent score.   I know G‑Mac is 6‑under right now which is a hell of a score.   So, yeah, I'm pretty happy.

Q.   As somebody who has played so superbly well around here, can you still see those low scores? 
IAN POULTER:   Well, G‑Mac is three in front right now.   So I think playing the Pro‑Am yesterday, we was aware that the scores wouldn't be as low as what they have been in previous years. 
So it's kind of‑‑ you have to kind of feel your way around the golf course knowing it's going to be more tricky but how more tricky you don't know until today.   But it's good.   The setup's great.   I think the changes are good and the course played well. 

Q.   It's fitting, isn't it, for a WGC event? 
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, it's not easy.   They are not supposed to be easy, are they.   So I guess it was a fair reflection today.   I think as I said, if G‑Mac finishes 6‑under that's a fantastic score and I'm happy to be in red numbers.

Q.   Feeling pretty good about your own game after one round? 
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I feel good. Drove it nicely, put it in position, took a few chances, left a few putts short, but all in all, with new equipment in the bag, I'm pretty happy to be honest.   It was always going to take a little bit of time to settle in. 
I put a new putter in the bag yesterday, as well.   So I've had decent success but throw in a new wand in there and seemed to be okay today and hopefully the other clubs will work nicely the next few days.

Q.   You can feel the progress?
IAN POULTER:   I'm happy, I'm very happy, yeah.
