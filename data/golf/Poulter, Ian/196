 Q.   Five dropped shots in three holes and back in 33, what was the key to that?   
IAN POULTER:   Just hit a few good shots.   I think obviously that was a tough finish to the front nine, which was a shame.   Hit a poor shot at 16.   Hit a poor tee shot on 17, and bogeyed the last, hit a poor shot on 18.   Easy to drop a few shots there.   
I managed to rally back nicely around that front nine.   I hit some good shots, and holed a couple of putts, so you know, it's really disappointing.   It's a golf course that I play very well.   I just hit a couple of poor shots today.  
   
 Q.   And you can't afford to do that, because that rough is brutal, isn't it; tell us about that?  
IAN POULTER:   You can't afford to do it any week, but let alone this week when they have shrunk the fairways a little bit and the rough is nice and thick.   
It's a difficult golf course for the members, and it's an even more difficult golf course when they shrink everything down.   So everything's penalized when you hit a bad shot and that's exactly what I got punished for today.   I hit bad shots.   
   
 Q.   You say it's a golf course that you've had a lot of success on; do you like the way it's set up this year, or is it too tough?  
IAN POULTER:   We'll see come Sunday.   We've had it absolutely flat calm today, really, five‑mile‑an‑hour wind.   It's as scorable today as we are probably going to see for the entire week and there's not many scores under par.   
It's set up difficult.   Some will say that it's too severe.   Some will say that it's rightly so; it's The French Open.
