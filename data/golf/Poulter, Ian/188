 Q.   Saturday is supposed to be moving day.   
IAN POULTER:   It was good.   It was a nice day.   You know, looking at the board, shooting 6‑under on the front nine, I didn't feel like I wouldn't get any closer to Dustin to be honest with you.   He's played unbelievably well on the front nine and guys have shot low today; benign weather conditions, not much wind, soft greens, perfect greens to putt on, you've got to make birdies.  
   
 Q.   You obviously went out today knowing that you had to go low.   Were you surprised at what was going on around you?   
IAN POULTER:   Well, you know, as well as I played, I felt that other guys were still going to make birdies.   So I felt like I had to keep pressing.   I had to keep going.   Obviously five birdies on the bounce on the front nine, should have birdied the first two, but didn't.   
But you know, I made one slip‑up on 17, birdied the last.   Leaves a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth, knowing I could have taken a couple of chances there in the round of golf but tomorrow is going to be a long day and we'll see what happens.  
   
 Q.   Dustin might be five, six, seven ahead of you at the end of the day, he's had two very low rounds; would you be surprised if he can do it again on the final day?  
IAN POULTER:   This golf course gives up a lot of birdies, and he's a good player, and in this form, he's going to make a lot of birdies.   I just need to do my thing tomorrow and make a lot more than what he does.   I'm going to have to see what happens coming down the stretch.  
   
 Q.   You love the head‑to‑head combat; is it going to be good to be alongside him?   
IAN POULTER:   It will always be great to be in the last group, seeing what's going on.   It fires you up even more.   Yeah, it would be great to be in the last group.  
   
 Q.   You'll be playing before him most of the time, I suspect?  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I would think so.   He's got me by probably 40 off the tee but that's fine, I'll get it in there closer than him.   
   
 Q.   How do you sum up what I presume is a special round of golf?   
IAN POULTER:   Well, 9‑under par on any golf course is a good score, and that was a good 9‑under par.   I guess the only blemish for me which leaves a bit of a sour taste was 3‑putting 17, and actually missing a couple of opportunities.   
As silly as it sounds, when you make ten birdies on a golf course, or eight and an eagle, there was putts on 1 and 2, 8; there was a few.   But it just does sound a bit stupid when you have made eight and an eagle.  
   
 Q.   Presumably you saw that score out from early on and looked like you had the bit between your teeth?  
IAN POULTER:   I could see it.   You just had to play well.   You had to get it inside 15 feet.   The greens are so perfect and if you start it on line, it's going to go in I could see other guys doing exactly the same.   Kaymer shot 10‑under, and I think Dustin had ten birdies and a double and he's still got a couple holes to go.   This golf course is giving up a lot of birdies.  
   
 Q.   Is it galling, when you play your heart out, get the score and you're no closer?   
IAN POULTER:   These things happen.   I have to do my thing tomorrow.   It's only Saturday.   You can't win tournaments on Saturday.   It's all about playing well on Sunday.   I need to do that.   I need to make plenty of birdies, try and make an eagle; if I can, I can get close.  
   
 Q.   You'll relish that won't you, playing alongside him?  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, he's a good person to play with and obviously if I'm in the last group there, which it's looking like I am, there's going to be some firepower.
