   JUSTIN ROSE: That was a tough loss. We were three up at one point which makes you feel like you shouldn't be losing the game but that's the Ryder Cup for you. You never give up, you never quit, we really felt like we were unbeatable out there, we had each other's backs and made some great saves on 16 and 17. Unfortunately 18.....you have to anticipate them holing their eagle putt. It was a great game but we have come out on the wrong side which never makes it nice to handle. But it was a great first taste of the Ryder Cup in terms of the atmosphere. The US have got ahead but the Europeans are excited about going out there and putting one or two things right. We need to rally and that is the great thing about this team in that we can get behind each other and try and get it back to level going into tomorrow.  
 It was nice to find the fairway with the opening shot. I really worked hard on my breathing and visualisation and just tried to trust it. Like Nick said to us, the technique is there and if you can control your tempo and your breathing you will be fine. I felt I did that and holed some nice putts out there and felt comfortable with the putter. I felt good about everything except the result. I will now go out with a fresh mind.  
 IAN POULTER: We were 3-up, played great and it is amazing how it can turn round so quickly. You don't do too much wrong but a bit of luck not going your way and couple of poor shots and we got punished for it. It's a shame. We felt we were in decent control of that match. But we are playing well, feel good and we are hitting good shots and that's all you can do. We played awesome on that front nine. We were a couple under in foursomes and that's all you can do and we just need to continue that and keep going.
