Q.   It was a mixed bag there today.   Very good round today, isn't it? 
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I mean, it's a good score.   To say it was a mixed bag, it was ‑‑ it was very close to being a very, very low round of golf.   A little frustrated with a couple of shots out there.   Left myself slightly out of position, not really from bad shots, it's just the fun and games we get around this golf course.   You can get called out pretty quickly.   I pulled a tee shot.   I made two great birdies, 2 and 3.   Holed 2, kind of 12, 15 foot putt there, which was very nice. 
Then I left myself like an 80 foot putt on 4.   To that back right pin location, that's very tough to get it close. 
I hit what I thought was a perfect 8 iron on 5 and it comes up a yard short of the ridge, comes back and consequently leave myself a horrible 2 putt there, and I 3 putt.   So I have got 3 putt, 3 putt. 
Hit it to a foot on the next, a nice birdie.   Hit a great second shot on 7, cut it around the tree to about 15 feet and rolled that in to kind of get those two birdies back. 
And then I pick up the worst mud ball of the week on 8.   We discussed it.   We knew mud was on the right, so the ball was going to go left.   And I hit 3 iron to make sure I wasn't taking too much club because it was going to move in the air and the thing just went 60 yards straight left in the trees.   And I make 6 there. 
I'm pretty hot as I walk 8 green and I don't shrug it off quite in time and I hit a poor tee shot on 9 which kind of added up to a bogey there.   And then kind of recouped myself, had a chat with myself down 7, pretty much played flawless coming in.   Had plenty of chances, picked up two more shots. 

Q.   In that sort of mood walking off 9, you must be delighted with the back nine then?
IAN POULTER:   Yeah.   There was no real poor ‑‑ there wasn't many poor shots in there.   The poor shot was at 4; that was it really.   And obviously I didn't ‑‑ you know, I didn't shrug off my frustration on the 9th tee.   Apart from that, for the rest of the day it was flawless.

Q.   2 under, you are in a decent position?
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, if one of the guys don't go crazy.   Mickelson just went 6 under on 13, so as long as they don't go crazy over the last five holes, then I've got a decent run at it tomorrow.

Q.   Charl showed last year anything is possible on the back nine?
IAN POULTER:   Absolutely, yeah.
