Q.  How was the course playing today?
IAN POULTER:  Well, it was very difficult with especially with the weather conditions, it blowing 30 miles an hour and not having too much practice this morning after watching the England football.  I was a little bit surprised obviously to go out there and get it that way under par when guys were shooting quite a few over par.  It's always nice to get out there and do a good job.
Q.  Tomorrow what's your mindset going in?
IAN POULTER:  Win the golf tournament.  Obviously I've given myself a great opportunity with shooting 6 under today, and I'll go out there with a lot of confidence tomorrow.
Q.  How aware were you of how you were playing?
IAN POULTER:  You know, it's a tough golf course, especially when it's blowing 30 mile an hour wind.  It's a tough golf course with no wind.  So when you can go out there and roll a few putts in and hang in there on the difficult holes, it's one of those days, it doesn't happen that often.  You can just charge straight up the leaderboard.  But it's nice when it does.
Q.  How do you change your mindset?
IAN POULTER:  You don't.  I'm going to have 20 minutes practice tomorrow.  I'll do the same thing pretty much like a normally do, rest up, go out there with thoughts of winning the golf tournament.
Q.  How much of the game did you see?
IAN POULTER:  I saw about 82, 83 minutes.  I was off at 11:15 and the game    I walked on the practice grounds just after quarter to, so I had 20 minutes to go.  I didn't do a normal practice routine.  I hit a couple of shots with each club, walked on the putting green, hit five putts, walked on the tee, and talking with my manager over the last couple of weeks, if your expectations are too high and you're not achieving, you're too hard on yourself.  Don't have expectations walking out on the golf course and let your golf game do the work, and it's funny what this game will reward you with.
Q.  Are you going to keep the practice routine?
IAN POULTER:  Well, not quite.  Just keep an open mind.
Q.  What about tomorrow?
IAN POULTER:  I'll go out there, and I'm in one of the final groups, go and enjoy myself, don't have any expectations, just go and play golf like I know I can and see what happens.
Q.  What would it mean to you to win?
IAN POULTER:  It would be nice, really, really nice, especially the week before the U.S. Open.  It would mean a lot of exemptions, back in the top    there's all sorts of stuff it would do for me.
