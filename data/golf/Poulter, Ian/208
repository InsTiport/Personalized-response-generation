 Q.   Some thoughts on the match that didn't turn out the way you had hoped?  
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I'm personally disappointed.   I think I would like the outcome to have been slightly different, but Hunter played very solid today.   He chipped it unbelievably well when he had to, and I think there was a key turn around 11 or 12.   I had a putt there to win the hole on 11 from about eight feet and I missed it, and then he hit the wrong club on 12, gone flying through the back of the green.   I put it in position on the back of the green, he chipped in.   Huge turnaround there.   I could have changed that match around at that point there.   
And from that point there was no letup.   He pars the next couple of holes and I miss a short putt on 14.   So it was a shame, really.   I think it was tricky this afternoon with the wind, and it was very tricky to go at some of those pins.   It made it difficult.   But yeah, I'm a little bit disappointed, a couple of chip shots.  
   
 Q.   Any problem getting out to win this third and fourth place playoff, obviously lots of World Ranking points?   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah.   You know, third and fourth, yeah, I'm going to go out there and try and win is what I'm going to try and do.   But I'm a little bit deflated at the minute.   Third or fourth, does it really matter?   Yes, it matters, so I guess I'm playing for a little bit of change, and more importantly some World Ranking points.   So I need to, in the next 50 minutes, get my head square and go out and play some golf.
