 Q.  Thoughts on round three?  
IAN POULTER: Clean day, which I guess is really helpful.  Made a couple great par saves during the round of golf, and gave myself a lot of good chances.   
I needed to shoot a decent round today, because obviously Sergio and the guys in front were a few shots clear.  I've done my job today, so I'm very pleased.   
 Q.  What part of your game pleased you?  
IAN POULTER: My putting.  My putting's really good. I had a stretch of single putts from the back end of round two to the first couple of holes today.  I was nine 1-putts in a row, so to do that, you have to be comfortable with your line doing that.   
I'm feeling good on the greens, and it's been a while.  So it's nice to have an old faithful putter back in the bag and roll a few putts in and started to move up the board.   
 Q.  Are you feeling confident about your game?  
IAN POULTER: I'm quietly confident.  I wouldn't say I feel like I'm on my A Game, but I'm doing my job, and that's all I can do right now is slowly but surely try to get in contention and see what happens tomorrow.   
 Q.  Thoughts ahead of tomorrow?  
IAN POULTER: I have no thoughts.  Obviously Arsenal hopefully try to win the game, but I think they are turning it around.  Hopefully they can finish strong in the last 15 minutes and score three or four goals.
