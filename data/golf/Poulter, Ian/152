Q. Crucial match for Europe, tell us about that chip shot and how much pressure you were feeling and tell us about the shot itself.RORY McILROY: Yeah, Rickie hit a great shot in there out of the -- seen way too many fairway woods out of the rough from him this week to the greens.  He hit a great shot. And I didn't have the best of lies there, but luckily Ian hit a great shot in there before me.  So that took a little bit of the pressure off. But there's only one thing in my mind which is try and hole it.  Felt like it was going to turn a little bit more than it did, but it was good to get the 4 and get the halve.Q. You were first to admit you were not at your best today but you come to the 15th hole, looks like you're going 2-down and out comees the postman --IAN POULTER: Funny things happen, don't they.  Second-class post --RORY McILROY: (Laughing).IAN POULTER: I guess a couple of quick birdies to start the match off with which was great, and fell asleep in the middle. But you know, a time where we needed something to happen, Rickie hit a fantastic shot and obviously looking like that match is going to go 2-,up and then obviously holing that and turning 1-over on the next hole makes a massive difference.Q. The Saturday afternoon at Medinah you must have been remembering when he chipped that in and feeding off those memories.RORY McILROY: Yeah, as soon as he chipped in, I was like, here we go again.  And then he held a putt on 16, too.  But 17 was playing tough, so it was a tough birdie hole today. But we held strong out there, and you know, we're down most of the back nine to get a halve again, with Rickie and Jimmy who have been a very strong pairing this week is a good thing.
