Q. Sum up the afternoon for us.
IAN POULTER:  Well I was doing okay until he went mad, he just had a spell in the middle which was difficult for me, difficult to play against that and I now know exactly how Appleby felt when I played him. He hits an unbelievable shot into the ninth to five feet, holes his second shot on the tenth, makes a gimmie eagle on the next, difficult, really difficult. Then he hits a good shot into the 16th and holes the putt so that is very, very difficult. I am very disappointed, but these things happen.
Q. Is it a little easier to take when someone plays as well as David did?
IAN POULTER:  Well he outplayed me today and there was not really a lot I could do about it. When someone is holing second shots and making threes on fives then it is hard work, but there we are.
Q. Another good week for you Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ you are up playing at a level you want to be?
IAN POULTER:  Yes it is a good week, but it could have been better. But it is a good week. LetÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s go out there tomorrow and try and finish third rather than fourth which will make it a little better.
Q. Some players in the past have found it hard to get up for the third/ fourth place play-off, you wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t be?
IAN POULTER:  No. It is more world ranking points so I am going to go out there and give it one hundred percent. There is no point in going out there and throwing away a game for the sake of it when there is a lot up for grabs. There wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t be a lack of motivation for me, IÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ll be right up for it.
