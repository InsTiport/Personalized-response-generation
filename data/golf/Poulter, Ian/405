  Q.  Is it unfair?   
 IAN POULTER:  No, it is not unfair because we are all playing the same golf course. However they set it up, you have to have it in your head before you go out and play the golf course. it is fair because we are all playing it. What are you going to do. You can't double question yourself and say it is unfair, let's all chuck the towel in a go home. It's been set up the way it has been set up and get on with it. There is no point bitching and moaning that it is a difficult golf course because it is a tough golf course and it is not supposed to be easy.   
  
  Q.  But it hasn't crossed any line - the USGA say they are right about at the line right now?   
 IAN POULTER:  It is hard. I am not going to say it is anything other than really hard. If I have golfed my ball properly today I would have walked off with a golf score. Unfortunately I have hit four bad shots and I have been punished for it. And so I should be. I shouldn't have hit the shots I hit on the course and expect to get away with it. I got punished. It is playable.
