  IAN POULTER:   A shame to be going home.   I think on reflection, I think I made a couple too many mistakes.   I made three bogeys, soft ones being that I would expect to make a few up‑and‑downs.   Obviously Alvaro made a couple of good birdies, and obviously if you're going to be in that situation, you feel giving a few holes away and coming up against a few birdies, it's going to be tough to come back from that.   It's a shame, really.  
   
 Q.   Your competitive spirit, going to keep it going right to the end, you had your chances.   
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, I had chances.   I had plenty of chances.   I didn't take them.   It's simple, not getting up‑and‑down from a couple of green‑side bunkers which I would expect to, they were probably nine out of ten up‑and‑down shots for me.   That was a bit frustrating.  
I just didn't quite play good enough, so that's why the score was the way it was.   I didn't play good enough to win.
