 Q.   No.17 played really tough for the field today.   What makes it stay so challenging even without Ike's tree?   
IAN POULTER:   The pin location just over the bunker; that green's pretty firm, and you know, that's the protection on the hole for the day.   
   
 Q.   Your 10th trip here, how would you rate this one?   
IAN POULTER:   For me personally, disappointing.   I haven't scored on the par 5s like I know I should and if I score on the par 5s, then I've got a chance to put a jacket on.   I didn't do well enough on the par 5s this week.
