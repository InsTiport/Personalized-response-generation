 Q.  2-under, 69 to get things going.  How would you describe four birdie, two bogey performance here on Thursday?  
IAN POULTER: Pretty good.  Played nicely, gave myself a few opportunities.  On 8 getting too aggressive at the pin, landed in the left greenside bunker, and didn't really have a nice lie in there and made bogey.  And then I was a little warm on 9, I have to say.  I choked in the front trap, and there's not much sand in there.  I pulled a driver in the hazard on 10.  Managed to hole a 45-footer to 50-footer to save par.  And from that moment on made a couple of nice birdies.   
 Q.  11 days ago you and I spoke on the 18th green at Houston after breaking through, getting back in the winner's circle on the PGA Tour.  How much time have you had to let it sink in to realize that you finally got back in the winner's circle, went right to Augusta and made the cut there, as well?  
IAN POULTER: I haven't had any time at all, as you could probably have guessed.  As you say, I went home for a day first, repacked, saw the kids, went up to Augusta, played there.  Tired.  I played an RBC outing here on Tuesday, so I didn't really have much rest between Augusta and obviously coming in here.  So I didn't actually play any golf at all.  I withdrew from the Pro Am to try and get some rest this Wednesday.  So today was my first look at the course.  I've got some time off next week.  So enough time to reflect, maybe have a glass of champagne or two and get up some energy.  I've got a busy summer schedule ahead.  I just need to plan my way carefully.
