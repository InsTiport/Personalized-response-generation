  Q. Thoughts on the day?  
 IAN POULTER: Got off to a great start. Played lovely and then I had a couple of chances from 20 feet on five, six and seven, all of which shaved the hole but stayed out so it could have been really low early doors. A shame on the tenth, fairway trap, knocked it short of the green, chipped it to eight feet and three putted from there for double bogey and drove it in the right hand fir on 18 to make bogey.  
  
  Q. A real momentum stopper, the tenth?  
 IAN POULTER: Yes it was, you don't want to make double bogey there especially when you're three under and flying. It is a shame really.  
  
  Q. Looking forward to next week?  
 IAN POULTER: Yes I am. I got here and I was hitting it horrendous to be honest with you so to be in position after three holes on Sunday afternoon to lie fourth at that time was a lot better than what I was expecting because it wasn't looking good at all on Tuesday and Wednesday I can tell. But golf is a funny game when you have had a rest and as soon as you walk onto the first tee, you are suddenly fresh and ready to go.  
  
  Q. What did you find in your swing then?  
 IAN POULTER: I just did a little bit of work on my swing, alignment on the way back, getting the club set in the right position on the way back was not easy in the early part of the week. I struggled a bit with it but come Saturday and Sunday it was fine.  
  
  Q. Have you been to Hazeltine?  
 IAN POULTER: You know, I can't remember if I played in 2002 or not! If I did, I don't remember much about it! I'm sure I did because I remember playing the year before. (NB - He didn't play in 2002). But I hear there are some interesting holes waiting for us, some par fives, so we'll see.   
  
  Q. All over 600 yards?  
 IAN POULTER: It is just getting silly isn't it. What is it like, let's make all the par fives over 600 yards so nobody can get there and it is a yard longer than the longest par five in US PGA history? Well done, give yourself a pat on the back. So we'll see, it'll be fun I'm sure and somebody will have to win at the end of the week.  
  
  Q. How good is 30 for the front nine by the way?  
 IAN POULTER: Pretty damn good. I was three under through three and he was four under through five and if you get off to a start like that then you can definitely shoot 30 on the front nine but to be three back of Paddy at the start of the day, with the wind the way it is today too, that is not too shabby, is it?
