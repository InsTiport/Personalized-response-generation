  Q. Finish with a birdie, 68, your round of the week so far.  How do you reflect on it?
 IAN POULTER:   I reflect like it was pretty good work.  I think it wasn't the start I wanted, bogeying the first after finishing bogey, double-bogey last night, slight contrast to how we finished on Thursday.
 But I think it's an okay round.  I'm hoping Tyrrell doesn't come in with too many birdies to close and kind of stretch that lead too far, but if we can be within a few obviously down the back nine tomorrow, that would be great.
 Q. You have playing really well at the moment, despite a couple of back issues.  How are you feeling within yourself?
 IAN POULTER:   I'm feeling like a newborn gazelle compared to Thursday.  I have to be honest, I really haven't had those back spasms before; that was unusual, and it was kind of unset for the last week, freezing cold and playing golf, trying to hold onto an umbrella for five hours and not taking any practise swings because you don't want the clubface to get wet, is not really the way we ever practise.
 So swinging at it hard in an old 44-year-old chassis is not very good.  So driving home six hours, not good, and I struggled Monday, Tuesday.  So I'm happy now that we've got the spasms gone, and I can happily swing away.
 Q. I think you've in the past described this place as somewhere you have a love hate relationship?
 IAN POULTER:   I've described this place through the years a multitude of things, which is probably not for the camera.
 Q. You put yourself in a really good position.  Would it be more special for you, given what you've had over the years here at Wentworth?
 IAN POULTER:   There is no reason why I should have ever had a dislike to this golf course to be honest.  It's a place where I've through the years come to watch the greats play golf, and I've had the opportunity to play it now 17 times in tournament conditions.
 I haven't played as well as I should have played, and because of that, I guess I have had a dislike for the venue.  That's not really the venue's fault.  It's probably been my fault.  So when Wentworth has always presented itself exceptional, we get -- every time we do come and play, they do a great job.  So it's probably my fault more than anything else.
