IAN POULTER:  It was much the same as yesterday. I've flushed it for two days and hitting it close but can't get the ball in the hole. I should have been 5-under after six today. I missed quite a few putts.

I am happy with my new irons. It's the first set made for me by my new manufacturers and I've had them since January 8 and I am now hitting it as solid as I have for a long time.

I am playing so well but giving back so many shots. When KJ is rolling in 15-footers and getting up-and-down for par, it is very frustrating. I should be leading the tournament but I will have to be patience and maybe my time will come at the weekend. If I do, then I will give someone a run for their money.
