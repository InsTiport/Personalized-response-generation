Q.   Just an up and down round.   Two pars the first 12 holes, but really turned it around there at the beginning of the second nine. 
IAN POULTER:   Yeah, just three threeâ€‘putts, for three bogeys, which is really unusual.   I missed a couple of short putts there, which was really annoying.
But I stayed patient.   I kept doing the good stuff that I was doing.   My stats this week are great.   I played real solid, gave myself a chance.   I obviously give myself a chance tomorrow if I have a low round.
