 Q.  How have your preparations gone for Carnoustie?  
IAN POULTER: I mean preparations have been good.  I think the way the golf course played yesterday, you know, a bit more wind, firm, fast, fiery, you know, didn't drive 440 yards.   
 Q.  Did you enjoy that?  
IAN POULTER: It's different.  Right?  I mean it's links golf.  So when it gets really firm and fast, you know, that's what you get.  So you need to be able to calculate it.  You need to understand how far certain shots are going to go.  Four-irons were going 310 yards downwind, and then you've got shots from 125 with 7-iron.  So yeah, I mean I think preparation is good to come here and play.  It's good to play links golf, and the course was more difficult this weekend than it was the first two days.   
 Q.  Interesting day yesterday.  Can you give us your version of what happened on the first hole yesterday?  
IAN POULTER: Yeah.  Listen, it's a shame if he misunderstood my explanation to him.  You know, I was trying to help him out in the way that he would be able to find the ball.  If he tread on it, it's okay, it's no problem, I can be able to drop it and get it back in a position where I can play it.  If I have to go in there, find it, tread on it, I get penalized, so the simple fact of it is I'm frustrated with myself.  I always wear my heart on my sleeve, and I was angry with myself and I might have said a few expletives at myself up there, but I reiterated to him after I played my shot out of the bush that I wasn't angry at him.  I said you need to understand, I said, if you tread on it, it's no problem, we get to be able to put it back where it was, to help him in case there was another guy in the same similar situation later on in the day.  So I tried to help him out.  I don't think he's taken it that way, obviously, which is a shame.   
 Q.  There's been some pretty strong allegations he thought you were particularly rude to him.  
IAN POULTER: Yeah.  Well, I wasn't.  I don't abuse volunteers.  I might have done it 16, 15, 17 years ago when I was a bit younger.  But these guys are here to help us out.  But he's taken what I said to him the wrong way, which is a shame.  It's disappointing really, when I was actually trying to help him out.   
 Q.  Does it tarnish your relationship with the crowds, do you think?  You have big crowds following you again this week.  
IAN POULTER: No.  A comment from a marshal doesn't tarnish anything.  I've tried to help the guy out.  He obviously misinterpreted what I had to say to him.  And that's fine.  The crowds up here are great.  They love good golf.  They appreciate good golf.  They appreciate what we do up here on links golf courses, and they're always great.   
 Q.  Really appreciate it.  
IAN POULTER: You're very welcome.
