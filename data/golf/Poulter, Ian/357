 Q. 17 was the turning point. 
 IAN POULTER: Well, it was a tight game all day and I pushed my tee shot a little bit. Hadn't played, obviously, 17 yesterday, knew the pin was in that back right corner and 8-iron was on a max limit. I just had to hit it perfect. 
 I did. I just hit it down to a foot. It was a great shot under pressure and obviously I win the hole there. And the last was not easy.

 Q. Yesterday you had a fairly straightforward match, got up early and had a nice lead. How much different was it playing today?
 IAN POULTER: The golf course was playing pretty difficult and I don't think it gave up half as many birdies as it did yesterday. And you had to try to hit some good golf shots and leave yourself some 30-footers with six, eight foot break. And just had to hang in there. 
 He played well today and he holed a big putt on the 12th, which put him up and I just had to rally. 

 Q. Do you have much knowledge of your opponent tomorrow?
 IAN POULTER: Well he's a good golfer. Anybody in the top 64 is going to be a tough game. It's going to be no different tomorrow. So I'll just keep on doing what I've been doing and try to stay positive. 

 Q. 18 hole match comes down to one shot. What a brilliant bunker play from the fairway at the 17th, you're conceded birdie, and take a 1-up lead to the 18th. 
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, it was a tight game the whole day and neither of us held a lead for long. And it was a good game. It come down to a good shot on 17. It was a max 8-iron, I just hit it perfect, it went down to a foot. It put him under pressure. 
 And then obviously taking a one hole lead down at the last. And I just tried to hit the green and put it in a good position.

 Q. 16 players left. You have Sean O'Hair. 
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, looking forward to that. I mean, any time you can play anybody in the top 64 it's going to be a tough match. And no different tomorrow. So I'll just go back home, rest up and come out with guns blazing tomorrow.
