 Q. What does being Volvo World Match Play Champion mean to you? 
 IAN POULTER: It's very special. Just having a quick look at the trophy, seeing the names that are on that trophy, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Seve, it just means an awful lot to go out there, obviously play Luke, who I think is now world No. 1, to beat him in form is pretty special. 
 I hit a lot of poor shots this afternoon. I was pretty tired. I hit some good shots at the right time and that was key to winning this match. 

 Q. And you fought really hard all week, all your matches, apart from the final, go to the 18th, and you beat Lee Westwood the day before. It's been a pretty stunning week. 
 IAN POULTER: It's been incredible. Yeah, I think I've probably played more holes than anybody this week, getting down to 18 every day apart from today. 
 I'm just very happy. I've hung in there very well. When I did look as if I was out, dead and buried, I managed to hole a putt and chip it pretty tight. 
 So I'm very happy that my game's certainly turned around at the right time. It's been a terrible four or five months. I was getting a bit frustrated at myself but a huge win like this turns it around very quickly.

 Q. And Luke Poulter? 
 IAN POULTER: Is at a pool party this afternoon at Lake Nona Golf Club. I just spoke with him, he wants the trophy for his birthday present, and so he's more than welcome. 
 I'm flying back with Luke Donald tonight, and obviously that's it a little awkward, because he's just lost, but we're decent mates and one of us has to loss. Unfortunately today it was Luke, but I'm happy with the result. 

 Q. You're the first man to win the WGC Match Play and this title, as well, in terms of having won both. Again, something to be proud of?
 IAN POULTER: My match play record is pretty good. I'm not sure why that is. It's bizarre really. I can't work it out. I don't know. I just think, I'm not sure. I don't know. I'm happy.

 Q. Could I suggest your personality enjoys the head-to-head maybe; you're a combative chap. 
 IAN POULTER: I do; I hate losing and when I can see my opponent straight in the face, I really hate to lose, so I guess that might be one of the reasons. I'm stubborn, like my dad, and I guess that helps. 

 Q. The final here, sensing Luke Donald was not quite at his best in the turning patches, turning the screw a bit?
 IAN POULTER: I think we are both tired to be honest. It's been a long week. We've played a lot of holes. There's no excuses there really. But, you hit a few poor shots; I think we both did. 
 We both hit a couple of shots that we wouldn't expect to hit and that can only be down to tiredness. But you know, I managed to hit a couple of key shots at the right time and holed a really long putt at the right time to really help me out.

 Q. We had a conversation in Hong Kong about your lucky ball marker. I've got to ask about that today. 
 IAN POULTER: I lost it on that little incident up on 8 while I was up the bank, I hit the shot and obviously slipped and fell. I got on the 9th green to mark my ball and the coin had obviously fell out of my pocket. 
 So thankfully, I sent one of the referees, Mark Litton, to have a look for it and he found it. It's pretty special. It's got my kids names on there, and I'd hate to lose it. 

 Q. Platinum and diamond and with the kids' names engraved, when did you spot it?
 IAN POULTER: Just went in my pocket and was like, where's that gone -- and, in fact (reaching in pocket) where's that gone right now? It's the car I've just sat in. 

 Q. Find it. 
 IAN POULTER: I'll find it. It's in the car.
