Q.   (Inaudible.)
IAN POULTER:   I feel like I had to have a chat with myself.   It's a shame.   It's really disappointing because I played lovely out there today.   I hit‑‑ I hit one poor shot all day; that was that tee shot on 15.   I hit the same club, the second time around hit it in the middle of the fairway, hit it to 12 feet, easy double bogey. 
Hit two shots into the next, got it up and down from a very simple nine out of ten. 
Tee shot on the last fairway, runs in the rough.   And you've got to get it down by the green and you miss your putt.   And all of a sudden there's four shots gone real quickly, when it looked like I was in really nice position.
One poor shot, any one thing that I can be annoyed.   Only one thing that I can be really annoyed about today, the rest of it was really good.

Q.   Sergio hit three balls out of bounds.   Is it the most intimidating here than anywhere in the world?
IAN POULTER:   We play a lot tougher tee shots than that around the world.   It's tricky because you want to put it in position, but anything left is short, short goes out of bounds.   So anything turning over is turning to that marker.   There's three bunkers down the side which aren't fun either.   I hit 5‑wood, a lot of guys hit irons.   It shouldn't have gone out of bounds but it turned over.   The second one was fine.
