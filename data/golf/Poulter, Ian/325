 Q. Well done. You're into the semis, the State of your game?
 IAN POULTER: The state of my game is good. It was difficult out there. The wind started to blow around that back nine and it start to get very, very cold. Obviously it was nice to finish that game off. 

 Q. You've got this afternoon with rain predicted and more cold, plus the vagaries of match play, how do you get mentally prepared?
 IAN POULTER: It will be tough. I was in this position last fall. There will be lots of adrenalin flowing. Hopefully the rain holds off and we can get out there and play some great golf. 

 Q. How much pressure do you feel?
 IAN POULTER: That was a lot of pressure. Obviously Thongchai hit a great shot there into 15 feet. I knew I had to keep it left of the pin. I hit a good bunker shot, and it was about seven feet. I worked pretty hard on that putt to make sure we didn't go into extra holes.

 Q. It seemed like it was a frustrating day?
 IAN POULTER: Frustrating, yeah, it's a tricky day, it was cool. It was hard to get it close to these pins and Thongchai played well today. He kept a very steady game. 

 Q. Do you feel you're better prepared than in '05?
 IAN POULTER: Absolutely. Sergio is going to be a tough match. We played a lot of golf together, and hopefully the rain will stay away so we'll go and have a bit of fun.
