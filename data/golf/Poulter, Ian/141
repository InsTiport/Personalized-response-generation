 Q.   Thoughts on all the starting and stopping?   
IAN POULTER:   I never got reâ€‘going, so for me it was kind of easy I guess.   
After play, I thought we was going to be back out on the golf course with the forecast that I saw on my phone.   But clearly that was very wrong because there's three feet of water in places out on the golf course.   I've never seen rain like it.   It's going to take some serious clean up to be able to get this course playable for tomorrow morning.   
So hopefully they can do something to get it going.   But you know, for some people, it's been a long, wet day.  
   
 Q.   What are you going to do with the extra time, just get ready for tomorrow?   
IAN POULTER:   I mean, just do my thing.   I'll have some physio treatment, go back to the hotel, have a hot bath, relax, dinner and bed.  
   
 Q.   Is there anything harder about all this, being in the position you are on the leaderboard?   
IAN POULTER:   Just be patient.   There's no point getting frustrated.   It's long, tiring days for everybody, so just got to grin and bear it.
