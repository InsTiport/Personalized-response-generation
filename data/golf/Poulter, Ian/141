Q.     5‑under for 14 holes yesterday, 1‑under for four holes today, give us a sense of how the golf course is playing now?
IAN POULTER:   Obviously it's had a lot of rain last night, had a lot of rain this morning, the par 5s are more difficult, the par 4s are tricky and the rough really wet. 
So it's going to be difficult with the rain that we're going to get this afternoon.   I think there's some electricity apparently coming.   So looks like it's going to be another long day.

Q.   It's often difficult to follow a really low round with another one.   What was the secret to you doing so? 
IAN POULTER:   Staying patient, just hitting good shots.   I played exactly the same last week, don't hole my putts.   I'm playing well enough, the same this week, but I'm taking my chances.   So I need to continue to do that even in the tricky conditions, there are still five par 5s, people can still make birdies, so I'm going to need to do exactly the same.

Q.   It's going to be a long day and you up at 10 past 5.00 taking pictures of lightning.   It is going to be a long day, isn't it?
IAN POULTER:   It is going to be a long day.   I was in bed at 7.00 last night, it's all right.   I had enough of my nine hours beauty sleep that I require, so I was up early.   The thunder and lightning woke me up.   I didn't think we were going to get any action this morning but we've managed to do that which is good news.   Hopefully we can get some more play done today before the storm hits. 

Q.   How exciting to be in this position going into the final two rounds? 
IAN POULTER:   It's really exciting.   2014 was looking pretty glum.   Hopefully we can turn it into a good one.
