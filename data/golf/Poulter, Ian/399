 Q.  Will you be cheering on the Europeans as they come in? 
 IAN POULTER: I will be on the aeroplane, and if one of them comes in and wins it will be awesome, but I am going home now. 

 Q.  How tough is it out there? 
 IAN POULTER:  It is unbelievable. It's frightening. I said at the start of the week I would like to sign for eight over par. The scoreboard will tell you. It will probably be the highest U.S. Open winning score. It is that unbelievably hard. It is laughable. 

 Q.  You have played well this week 
but ... 
 IAN POULTER:  Totally demoralized. I played the short holes so bad. That is through trying to play a knock down shot and I have pulled a couple and pushed a couple. That has cost me 11 shots. That's what happens when you miss the fairway. But it is the same for everybody. Don't miss the fairways, don't miss the greens. 
 I am playing so well, it is a matter of time right now. I am playing as well as I have played for a long time. I have enough events left to have a mega-season.
