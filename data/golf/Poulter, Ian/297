  Q. How important is it to put that first point on the board?   
 IAN POULTER: Massive. Looking at the board right now, the middle section is all blue, but obviously they got off to a good start. It was always going to be a tough game against Kuch. He's won all of his matches so far, so I knew I had to come out and play real strong today.   
  
  Q. You certainly delivered. Have you picked a match you might follow to give support to?  
 IAN POULTER: Yeah, I'll be taking the one in the back and giving Fish some support. He needs to give us a point and hopefully McIlroy can turn that match around, that would be huge.
