Q. How happy are you standing here talking after a lovely start here at the Scottish?
IAN POULTER: Pretty happy.  The last couple of days, I don't feel like I've hit it all that well, so I spent a bit of time yesterday on the range with Pete.  I was concerned about a couple of shots with the wind off the left.  My misses have been to the right.  That's never good, and there's lots of trouble out there down the right-hand side.
I got myself in a couple of spots of bother, but pretty much swung it well, put it in position and made a few putts and adds up to a nice score.
Q. How tricky was it out there condition-wise with the wind picking up?
IAN POULTER: It definitely got tricky on our back nine.  I think it was very playable very early on.  As we went through the day, obviously it was getting up into kind of a stiff two-club wind, and at times obviously three.
The guys this afternoon are definitely going to get cooler conditions.  Maybe the odd chance of a spot of rain and obviously windier condition.  It will be tough.
Q. Playing this big stretch of Rolex Series events, how nice is it back playing on The European Tour?
IAN POULTER: It's not nice; it's lovely.
The last few months have been weird, planning a schedule pretty much heavy in the States and then obviously a big finish in The Players changes that instantly.
So from a miserable-looking summer -- not saying it's miserable playing over there, but it was miserable to be away from obviously Katie and the kids, and obviously that turned on its head pretty quickly with one decent finish.
It's been great.  I've had a great time.  The weather has been good, so far, in patches.  But it's just nice to be here playing good tournaments, big purses, big fields, obviously next week in The Open.
Q. How pleasing is it to start here with a 67?
IAN POULTER: It's very pleasing.  It obviously was a lot kinder conditions when we first teed off.  It's a pretty good wind out there right now two-, three-club wind and obviously it's cooled down, as well.  I think the afternoon wave are going to have the worst of the day, but certainly I was pleased with how I performed out there this morning.
Q. Highlight was the eagle on 14 and then a good run of birdies coming home on the front nine, your back nine today?
IAN POULTER: That was nice.  The eagle was set up with a decent 5-iron which was hit into about two-feet, a tap-in eagle, which are always nice.  A couple of blemishes there, 15, 16, two tough holes, which can happen.
But apart from that, I was in play a lot.  Gave myself chances, took a couple of them, rolled a couple of nice 25-footers in and there was no real drama.
Q. Timing it right with The Open next week with you having qualified just over a week ago.
IAN POULTER: It's obviously nice to be in The Open.  I think it was good to get it done on my home course.  Obviously a little bit of extra pressure there with members watching.  But this run of events that we've got right now here, it's a busy summer, but it's a great summer to play some good golf.
Q. Pretty benign when you started this morning?
IAN POULTER: Yeah, wasn't much wind around at all.  Just half-a-club, club-wind, and obviously as the day went on, the forecast predicted obviously for the wind to pick up, like it normally does in links golf, and I'm sure it will do the same tomorrow.
Q. Does this sort of weather does it suit your game?
IAN POULTER: This is glorious.  Have you seen some of the weather we've played in the last couple of weeks?
If you don't hold a brolly, you're in good form on links golf.  If you've got to hold an umbrella, it means the weather is really bad.  I'm happy to play this type of golf without any waterproofs on or an umbrella.
Q. Do you feel you're now getting back to the sort of form that puts you back up the rankings?
IAN POULTER: Not yet.  Still work to do.  Still need to work on the game.  As good as the round was today, I'm still going to hit the range.  I'm still not 100 per cent happy, and it's a work-in-progress.  So I'll keep working towards the ultimate goal.
Q. Would you want the wind to be blowing over the weekend?
IAN POULTER: Of course.
