  Q. (No microphone.)  
 JOHN MORSE: Very pleased. Hit it more solid today, which was nice. It's been a tough game this week.   
  
  Q. Five birdies. You have to feel good about that.   
 JOHN MORSE: I did, I was hoping to get 4 birdies on the par-3s, but I came up short today.   
  
  Q. Any harder than the others?   
 JOHN MORSE: All hard.   
  
  Q. Anything you did better today?   
 JOHN MORSE: Drove it better today and actually my irons were more solid today.   
  
  Q. Hole location?   
 JOHN MORSE: Of the 54 I played I thought 53 had been accessible, and relatively fair. One today that wasn't but overall they've done a nice job.   
  
  Q. What was that hole?   
 JOHN MORSE: To me it was the 14th hole.
