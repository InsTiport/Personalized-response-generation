 Q. How did the round go? It seems like you had a pretty good front nine there in terms of birdies on 3 and 6 and then a touch finish. But how do you think the round went today?
 JOHN MORSE: Well, I'm very pleased. I haven't been all that secure in my game as of lately and I started hitting it more solid today and got control of my game a little bit. I wasn't that comfortable on the greens and nine showed it, but I think I had more of a miss club off the tee and it put me in a bad position.

 Q. The back nine you got a little more consistent, found your way and kind of finished out strong there?
 JOHN MORSE: The back nine was my front nine and the back nine the way they have the rotation of holes this year set up here, it's par on that side's a very good score. And I was just trying to hit fairways and greens and then take advantage of something there on the front. And I was fortunate today and did that.

 Q. What was your best club do you think today, short game, putter? Driver?
 JOHN MORSE: Best club I had today was probably the one between my ears. I finally settled down a little bit and started thinking about just hitting the ball solid and quit tinkering out there and it came together a little bit. Hopefully I can keep on that track and go forward.
