 Q.  How do you feel your round went today shooting even par? 
LARRY NELSON:  I played really well except for one hole.  I got a really bad break on a par 5 and made double there.  Buried it underneath the lip and couldn't get it out and on the green.  Other than that I played pretty good.

If I would have made par there or birdie, I would be 2 under or 3 under instead of even.  But I played pretty good.
Q.  Was the course playing any differently than it was during the practice rounds?
LARRY NELSON:  I only played one practice round.  And the wind today, this afternoon, the scores weren't very low at all because the wind was kind of swirling.  This morning the wind wasn't blowing at all.
Q.  How do you feel about playing with Mr. Palmer in his backyard?
LARRY NELSON:  I played with him quite a bit.  He and I were team members, played, he and I played against, in the team championship two years in a row.  So we played together quite a bit.  I enjoy playing with him.
