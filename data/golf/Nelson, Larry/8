 Q.  Talk a little bit about the conditions, obviously you shot a pair of 76s and a 70 today? 
 LARRY NELSON:  Yeah, conditions this morning were much better, not quite as much wind.  I don't think it's going to be as windy this afternoon.  Fairways were pretty soft.  It looks like they watered them a little bit.  So the golf course played a little longer for us than it did yesterday. 
 I don't know, I hit the ball better, I'm going to go work on it a little bit.  I still might do some things with my irons that I'm not doing well, figure out what that is.  But the conditions were pretty good today. 

 Q.  Do you think other than just the wind do you think having played it a couple of days maybe you might be able to approach it a little differently today? 
 LARRY NELSON:  The golf course has played a little bit different for us each day.  And I think that you do learn a little bit about the golf course, but you really kind of, the conditions dictate how well you do, I think, because today we could actually stop to know the 8th green, which you couldn't do it the last two days.  And that had to do with not as much wind and a little softer. 
 So conditions are a little easier today, being a little bit wetter, and now it may be dry before the leaders get to 17 and 18.  But I thought it played a little softer today.
