Q.  First, tell me about your round today, how did you feel like you played?
LARRY NELSON:  I played better the last 12 holes than I did the first six.

So it ended up being pretty good today.  So I was kind of happy with that.
Q.  What are some of the adjustments that you may feel that you may need to make in order to climb even higher on the leaderboard tomorrow?
LARRY NELSON:  I think I just have to hit the ball the way I did the last 12 holes.  And putt a little better.
Q.  Any challenges out there that kind of surprised you today?
LARRY NELSON:  No, it was pretty much the way I thought it was going to be.  The golf course is very difficult, you have to keep it in play and have to miss it in the right spots to have a chance to get it up and down.  So it played pretty much the way I thought it would.
