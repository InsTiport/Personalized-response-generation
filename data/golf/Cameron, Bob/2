  Q. You had a pretty good round going until the last couple holes. Can you tell us what happened there on the last couple.  
 BOB CAMERON: Tried to hold the ball under the wind on the last two drives, left-to-right dogleg, wind is left-to-right. And it leaked to the right and it fanned through the fairway out, so and didn't get an up-and-down.   
 The last hole I over clubbed. I got it to the back and it left you with a very tough up-and-down.   
  
  Q. How tough is this rough to penalize or even to judge getting out of it?  
 BOB CAMERON: You're very lucky if you get a situation where you can gain significant yardage. There's a few holes there where you probably have to lay up short of the ditch or the water if you hate an errant drive.   
 So, yeah it's quite penalizing. But it's consistent length. So I'm not sure if that is quite right, because if you miss it by a foot, you're penalized the same as the guy who misses it by 60 foot. So that's the only thing I would say. But, no, it's a terrific course to play I really enjoyed it.  
  
  Q. What were you doing the first 16 holes you were 1-under?  
 BOB CAMERON: I had a couple nice birdie on 15 and 16. And I just -- those are two tough holes, the last two holes anyway as you know in history. But I'm pleased with a 72.   
  
  Q. You didn't blow your way out of the tournament.   
 BOB CAMERON: Not at all. Not at all. I'm looking forward to hopefully the next three rounds.
