 Q. That was a whole lot of firing. You sure made it interesting. 
 LEIF OLSON: Yeah. You know, it wasn't an easy chip, but I wanted to give it a run. But after I hit it, I just knew in the air I had a chance. And it's one of those things, you just -- you have to get lucky because it's coming in hot. 
 That's the only way really to pull it off coming out of the fringe. You have to either -- you have to chip it up and it's just going to come in hot anyway, so you just hope it goes in. It almost did. 

 Q. I saw you before the shot. You and your caddie were sharing a joke. You were loose there. Were you loose all day? Was it not a difficult day?
 LEIF OLSON: No. It was -- I was nervous out there. Not so much hitting. I putted -- I putted poor. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't look as bad on my stats, but I just felt I did not putt very well today. I mean I made some putts, granted, but I hit the ball so well on the front and that's just little frustration. But it's a learning thing for me right now, so I won't make those mistakes in the future. I learned to stroke my putts a little bit better being a little tentative, which I was at the beginning of the round today. 

 Q. The computer gets you inside the top 150 with a third place finish here. That gives you a whole lot of momentum going to Vegas. 
 LEIF OLSON: Yeah, it is. I -- yeah, I mean, I'm looking forward to Vegas. I wasn't even thinking about that till now, but yeah, hopefully I can do something good there. I mean I'm playing well, and just try and keep it up and see what happens. 

 Q. Well, again, congratulations. It was a lot of fun watching you today, and especially there at 18 when you almost got into the playoffs. Congratulations. 
 LEIF OLSON: Yeah. Thank you very much.
