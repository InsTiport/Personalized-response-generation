Q. Your first professional round; how was it?
SAIF THABET: It was good.  A bit nervous at the start, but I felt good, to be honest.  My driver worked well today.  My putting was really good, but I just let a few shots get away from me, and I paid the price for that, especially in the rough.  But again, I was feeling really good coming up to the competition, but then golf is like that, on the day it changes.  My score doesn't really reflect how I felt today.  But again, no expectations, so just try to be better tomorrow.
Q. And how did you settle down your nerves?
SAIF THABET: I've just been working maybe on a few little breathing techniques, just try to get -- I shouldn't have to feel nervous.  If anything I should be proud.  But it got better throughout the course.  After a couple of holes I settled in nicely.
Q. Did you feel good support from the crowds?
SAIF THABET: Definitely.  I had really good support, especially on the last.  I sunk a long putt there, so really heard the crowd go and cheer me on.  It's really good to have that here in Abu Dhabi.
Q. And you'll look forward to tomorrow?
SAIF THABET: Definitely look forward to tomorrow and hopefully a better score.
