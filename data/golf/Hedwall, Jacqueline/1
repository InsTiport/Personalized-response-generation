   CAROLINE HEDWALL: I'm so excited. I can't believe it. We're playing so well and it's so much fun.

 Q. How special to have your sister alongside you caddying for you? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course, I was really happy she got a week off from school and could come and help me here.

 Q. I understand you weren't going to caddie and you changed your mind, I bet you're pleased you did?
 JACQUELINE HEDWALL: Oh, yeah, I love to caddie for my sister all the time and especially this week.

 Q. What about all of these fans? They want to make their presence felt. 
 JACQUELINE HEDWALL: Oh, yeah, they're great. It's awesome to see.

 Q. What about Sophie as a partner. She's so fantastic, so much experience, tell us what she brought to your game? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, she's really self-confident, and that really -- I feel confident when I play with her, and she's really calm, so it makes it easy to play with her.

 Q. Well done to both of you. 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Thank you.

 Q. Talk about yesterday's victory and today's victory? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I think it was pretty simple. We played really solid and didn't make a single bogey on the foursome, and that's pretty awesome.

 Q. What about the difference between the foursome and the fourballs? Is there a difference? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Yeah, of course, you can't really be as aggressive when you play foursome. We try to play smart instead and just try to make our pars, and we managed to do that. It was a good day.

 Q. Do you know if you are going to play this afternoon? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: We'll see. I haven't seen the team yet for the afternoon, but of course I want to play.

 Q. You seem to have won so early in the course. Is it something you are thinking? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I don't really think about that. I'm just happy that we got a point for Europe.

 Q. What about now? Are you going to have more rest? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Of course, it's always good to get a little more rest. I'm excited. I want to go out and play again.

 Q. Caroline, congratulations, second big win in a row. You must be thrilled? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Oh, yeah, of course. Sophie and I played great today, too. So we had a lot of fun.

 Q. Your partnership with Sophie seems to be working out really well?
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: For sure. We both played really well, and that of course helps, and I really enjoyed playing with her.

 Q. The fact that they've both been big wins as well, you haven't been under pressure in either of the matches you've played so far? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, there's pressure in the beginning of the match and you need to make those putts. 
 But it's always nice to win and win big.

 Q. What has been the key to success to this point? 
 CAROLINE HEDWALL: Well, I think just hitting a lot of greens (Inaudible). We can't make many mistakes if we want to beat them. I think that's the key. Thank you.
