 Q.   Tell us about the hole‑in‑one.   
ANDREW MARSHALL:   Pure blind luck.   Got the yardage wrong yesterday because the tee is forward and the card is there on the old tee, so after Nico went long, I changed clubs and hit a good shot in the air.   And so again today I went from a different spot to get the yardage right.   It was absolutely howling.   
So I thought, when it said 3‑rescue, I thought would I hit a strong rescue and I actually hit it damn well because it's getting really strong the wind.   So just got it perfect and thought I hit it too well, was going straight through the wind and was going to be lie.   
And then everyone gone bananas.   We went bananas a little bit.   Didn't see it at all; I'm too short.   And into the sun, as well.   But the roar was awesome.   
   
 Q.   You noticed the car?   
ANDREW MARSHALL:   Oh, yeah, I've been looking at new cars.   Not like I can afford it but there's a discount this week, not that I can afford one, might change now.   I don't know, we'll see.   
   
 Q.   This one is obviously a BMW but it's a 6 Series Gran CoupÃ©, around 70,000 grand.   
ANDREW MARSHALL:   Very tidy car.   Very happy with that.   Still can't believe it but there we go.  
   
 Q.   What do you drive at the moment?  
ANDREW MARSHALL:   A BMW, 54 plate, diesel estate.   It's beautiful.   
   
 Q.   How much are you selling it for?   
ANDREW MARSHALL:   I'm not going to sell it, it's a lovely car, that but I might sell that after a time, we'll see.  
   
 Q.   You'll have to drive this for a bit?  
ANDREW MARSHALL:   Do you think?   I can't afford the fuel in it (laughing).  
   
 Q.   How many holes in one have you had in your career?  
ANDREW MARSHALL:   About five or six now.   
   
 Q.   How many on the Tour?  
ANDREW MARSHALL:   One at the grand final last year, which you guys filmed didn't even get a bottle of pop for that.   Getting a 6 Series Gran CoupÃ© is a bit more like it.  
   
 Q.   Have you ever won thing before for one?   
ANDREW MARSHALL:   No, never.   Nearest the pin in a medal?   
   
 Q.   In the wider picture, you're right up there, birdie, birdie, eagle?  
ANDREW MARSHALL:   Yeah, I was worried about making the cut when I was 2‑under and I was hungry and not putting very well because the greens are starting to get slower and I've got six holes to play and the cut has gone‑‑ there's a board on No.9 that says cuts level and it says 9, and I thought I'm okay and then a board on 15 that says the cut is 2‑under so I'm not okay.   
So buckled down, went birdie, birdie and that happens.   The last was just, knock it out of the right, knock it out of the right and chip it on stiff and not that I was caring much, because even a 6 at the last after a 1 is still okay.
