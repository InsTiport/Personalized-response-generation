 Q.  Great week for you; you made a ton of birdies, over 30 that we could count.  Just walk me through a little bit of your feeling this week and the way you played.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I'm definitely proud of myself.  This is my first time reaching the finals of a USGA championship, and I'm just really thankful to have gotten this far.  It was a great match today against my friend, and I played really well in the morning, had her down, but she just played really great in the afternoon.  She dumped one on me on the par-5, it flew in, and I think that might have been the turning point there.  I tried to get back in it, birdied the next hole, but she matched it.  She just made the putts that she needed to, and I didn't.   
 Q.  Was it difficult playing your friend, and talk about being 3-up after going to the break for lunch and what you guys ate for lunch.  
ANDREA LEE: Well, we both had steak, and it was literally the size of our faces, it was so big.  But yeah, I was 3-up after 18, but I was not trying to think about that.  It's a whole new round in the afternoon, the wind picked up, the greens got firmer, and it was a whole different game.  I was trying not to think about having a lead, I was just trying to think about my game and not worrying about what she was doing.   
 Q.  The Women's Amateur is coming up in a couple weeks; how will you build on your success here and the shape of your game going in?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, definitely I built a lot of confidence over this week.  I think this week really helped me prepare for that, so I'm looking forward to it.
