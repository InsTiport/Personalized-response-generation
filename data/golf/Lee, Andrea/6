 Q.  5-under round today; how did it go?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, it went really well.  Had a really solid front 9, had five birdies.  Unfortunately couldn't get it going as much on the back, but still really satisfied with the way I played today overall.   
 Q.  Talk about the course here at Old Waverley.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, it's beautiful.  The course is in really great condition.  The greens are really nice.  They're rolling really well and pretty quick, so definitely the greens are kind of nice and tricky out here, which is what I think protects the course, but overall I love it.  It's beautiful.  Just a little hot, but overall nice.   
 Q.  Your experience here at the U.S. Women's Amateur, what does it take to do a deep run here?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, just getting through stroke play first because once that part of the competition is over it's pretty much anyone's ballgame.  Match play is a whole different type of tournament, so it's going to take a lot, and just got to dig deep and stay really patient throughout the week and hopefully win a few matches.
