 Q.  You really seemed to have the greens figured out today.  What was the difference?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I played really well today.  My shots were really good, and I made the birdie putts that I needed to.  Had a couple mistakes on the front nine, but I came back strong and had a couple of birdies coming in on the front nine and just overall really satisfied with the way I played.   
 Q.  We really didn't see any mistakes.  That was pretty flawless golf out there, but tomorrow essentially will be a rematch from two weeks ago in New Jersey at the U.S. Girls' Junior Championship, you and Eun Jeong Seong together.  We heard that you and Eun Jeong shared a steak; what was this about a couple weeks ago?  
ANDREA LEE: So the USGA said that we could pick a lunch that we wanted in between the two 18s of our final match, and I don't know, I guess we just both wanted steak.  Yeah, it was huge.  It was literally like bigger than my head, so I didn't finish it, but it was good.   
 Q.  Is it more difficult when you're playing against a friend or somebody that you know well?  
ANDREA LEE: It definitely is.  Eun Jeong and I are really good friends.  Actually we played against each other in quarters two years ago in the US Women's Amateur, so we know each other really well, and we know our games pretty well.  It's going to be a fun match tomorrow, but obviously we both want it so much, so we'll see what happens.   
 Q.  You made your karaoke debut on national television.  We showed it all because it was so good.  
ANDREA LEE: Really embarrassed (laughing).  I haven't seen it yet.
