 Q.  Talk us through kind of the emotional ups and downs of this match.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I started off really slow today, was 3-over through eight holes and missed a lot of opportunities, had a lot of putts within 10 feet that just couldn't read them.  I was getting a little frustrated, but my dad told me to stay really patient out there, and it kind of calmed me down a little bit.  From 9 on, I played some of the best golf I think that I've played in a while.  Yeah, I'm just -- I'm exhausted, but I played really solid today, and I'm proud of the way I handled it.   
 Q.  Talk about standing over that putt on 18.  What were you seeing in it and what was your emotional state?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I knew she had only a two- or three-footer left for par and knew that I had to give it a chance for sure.  It was going a little left to right, but I saw it might have broken a little to the left at the end.  I just picked a spot on the green, set it up and hit a good, solid stroke and thankfully it went in.   
 Q.  You're familiar with Lucy's game.  You're going to play against her tomorrow.  What do you expect out of that match?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I expect some tough -- she's a tough competitor for sure, and it's going to be a tough match.  She's a really solid golfer, very consistent, and so I think it's going to take some of what I did today on the back nine in the extra holes to beat her.
