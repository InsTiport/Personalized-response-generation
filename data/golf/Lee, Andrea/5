 Q.  Just talk us through the match a little bit.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, I played really solid.  Kind of got off to a slow start.  Made just a lot of pars and had one bogey.  Then 9 and 10, I had a couple birdies on the par-5s, and I just played really steady and solid golf throughout the whole match.   
 Q.  They put a graphic up on the TV, this is your 16th USGA championship.  What can you pull from past experience?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, just really grinding.  Match play is very different from stroke play, and I've just got to stay really patient out there and try to take it one match at a time and just stick to my game plan and play solid golf.   
 Q.  What is the plan for the rest of the day?  
ANDREA LEE: Probably going to go back and rest for sure, maybe putt just a little bit before getting out of the heat.  But yeah, just getting a lot of rest and preparing hopefully for a 36-hole day tomorrow.
