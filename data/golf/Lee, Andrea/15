 Q.  A 5 & 4 victory for you today.  Very strong out there.  Was it really as easy as you made it look?  
ANDREA LEE: No, not really.  I just played really well overall today, made a lot of birdies.  I think I had about five or six out there.  I was struggling a little bit towards the end of the front nine, had a couple of three-putts coming in, but I came back strong, birdied No. 10 and I think 12, so that got me going.  Really happy with the way I played today.   
 Q.  You mentioned the three-putts.  What is it about these greens that are causing players to struggle?  
ANDREA LEE: They're pretty tricky.  They're very undulating, first of all, but the speed is really important out here, and the greens are really big.  A lot of players tend to have long putts out there.  Two-putting is like really crucial out here.  I just struggled a little bit.   
 Q.  What is your strategy for all the approach shots into these elevated greens?  That's a whole other part of it.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, definitely.  A lot of greens out here are uphill, elevated, so you usually have to add at least 10 yards to get it up there.  It's pretty tricky to judge the distance.   
But trying to get all the help I can from my caddie, and been playing well so far.   
 Q.  You're no stranger so this championship, advanced to the semifinals back in 2014.  What's the key to maintaining your cool in match play?  It's hard to do.  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, definitely.  You know, I just try and think of match play as kind of like a stroke play, just playing my own game and focusing on my shot.  Can't really think of what my opponent is doing.  It's definitely more intense competition just one-on-one, but it's fun, also, so just really like match play, and we'll see how this week goes.
