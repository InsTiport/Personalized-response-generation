 Q.  What were some of the more difficult shots you saw today?  
ANDREA LEE: I would say the tee shot was more difficult because of the nerves I guess, on 1.  It's so cool to see all these people out here cheering us on, and I don't think I've seen crowds like this before at this event.  This is pretty big and big for women's golf.  I'm just glad I got to even play today.   
 Q.  Some ladies were talking about the length of the course and they are not used to hitting hybrids.  I think somebody said they had hybrid as a second shot on 10.  Did you feel some of your approach shots were longer than what you're used to seeing?  
ANDREA LEE: I thought it was a decent length overall.  I thought it was a really good test of golf.  I think they kept it at a pretty good length, in my opinion.   
Yeah, there were some mid-irons and maybe longer clubs into it the greens, but overall, I think it was really great how they set up the course.   
 Q.  Can you remember a couple of the holes that maybe you hit a hybrid or long iron into?  
ANDREA LEE: I had a short hybrid -- sorry, I had a 4-iron into the par 3, No. 4.  Then I had a 5-iron into 10.   
 Q.  And the greens, talk about the challenge of that?  
ANDREA LEE: The greens are really undulating.  TV definitely doesn't do it justice.  You don't see all that stuff and it's pretty hilly.  The course is pretty hilly.  Yeah, it was tough out there, some of the pins.  I think they used like Sunday pins on a lot of the greens today.   
It was really fun.  I just really enjoyed playing out there today.  It's a really special experience.
