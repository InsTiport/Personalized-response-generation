 Q.  Big win; you won the first five holes in a row?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah.   
 Q.  How was that going for you?  
ANDREA LEE: It was definitely a momentum booster.  She was kind of struggling a little bit, and I was just making my pars, getting on the green and two-putt out of there.  Just really satisfied with the way I played overall.  Didn't make many mistakes today.  Had just one three-point, I think, on No. 12 or 13.  But I played really well and minimized my mistakes, so hopefully I can continue that.   
 Q.  And you're going to have Robynn Ree the next round.  You grew up in the same area, so I'm guessing you know each other fairly well.  What's it like, especially as you get farther into this championship, playing friends?  
ANDREA LEE: Yeah, it's definitely hard.  I mean, I know most of the girls out here, but I mean, Robynn and I grew up pretty much playing golf together, played junior tournaments since we were eight years old and had the same coach for a while.  It's definitely difficult playing close friends out here, but at the end of the day, it's who wants it more.
