 Q.   Your overall thoughts on today's round?   You finished 1‑under for the day.   
CRAIG THOMAS:   My best round of the week scoring‑wise for sure and ball striking‑wise without a doubt.   
I hit the ball better today, had more looks at birdie than I had all week.   
I had one unfortunate hole on 11.   I just came up a little bit short and that was just miscommunication with my caddie and I.   I was thinking one thing, he was thinking another, and neither one of us voiced our opinions.   And I was wrong and he was right.   So we'll get it right tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   You're looking good for tomorrow.   Your viewpoint on course condition?  
CRAIG THOMAS:   I think it's good.   I mean, it's really good.   It's tough.   The tee to green it's phenomenal, the bunkers are good.   You get on those greens, you really have to control your irons into the greens to have decent looks at it.   
Hitting greens is not necessarily a good thing all the time.   You hit in the wrong spot on the greens, you're having a tough time 2‑putting.
