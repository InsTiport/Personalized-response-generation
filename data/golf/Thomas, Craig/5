 Q. How does this experience compare to some of the experiences you've had in the PGA in the past? 
 CRAIG THOMAS: Just disappointing. I hit the ball well. I was hitting the ball well all year. I hit the ball fairly well, one or two errant shots. Short game is really not up to PGA Championship standards. So that's pretty much it.
 It was a lot of fun and it was nice being with Keith and just being in his first major championship; it was nice to be able to experience that with him. It was very enjoyable.

 Q. And finishing with the one-shot advantage over him; will you take that back? 
 CRAIG THOMAS: I didn't play well. He played real well yesterday. I wish he had played better. I'm sorry to see that happen today on his back nine.
