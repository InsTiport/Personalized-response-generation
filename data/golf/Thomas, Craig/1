Q.   First off, take us through the birdie on 18. 
CRAIG THOMAS:   I hit a good drive, for a change.   I hit the right club on 18, for a change.   I listened to Dale this time.   I finally got the speed on a putt.   I mean, I hit three good shots in a row.   So it was nice to see that one fall in the side there.

Q.   How did the entire round go?   I know you were saying, "for a change," so it seemed like you weren't hitting the ball great. 
CRAIG THOMAS:   Yesterday it seemed like everything was the right yardage, all the drives were good, I just barely missed two fairways, hit a lot of greens. 
Today, nothing seemed to be going in the right direction.   I would aim left trying to cut it and I would pull it or I would hook it.   It just seeing one thing and hitting a different thing.   So it was up‑and‑down all day.   It was an emotional roller coaster out there.

Q.   Talk about the entire experience here, being here, making the cut and being here right at the end. 
CRAIG THOMAS:   Yeah, being here, it's very, very rewarding and very exciting for a club pro like myself.   Mark and I were fortunate enough, we rented a house together, so it was fun to hang out, I had a bunch of friends over.   And that in itself is a great experience. 
Then to be able to make the cut was really exciting.   And then to play well on the weekend, just made it even better.
