CRAIG THOMAS:  I've been working with Keith, my assistant, on some swing changes for the past month, and it felt good.  Unfortunately my putting didn't get started until the back nine really.  I had a couple of early three putts, one or two bad shots, but overall hit it pretty good.
Q.  It wasn't bad out there, was it?
CRAIG THOMAS:  Yeah.  I mean, the course is in good shape.  Everybody has been saying the same thing.  It's 7,500 or 7,600 yards or whatever it is and you don't hit a lot of drivers.  But it's fair.
Q.  How many did you hit?
CRAIG THOMAS:  One more than I was planning to because I hit it on 9.  I probably hit nine.
Q.  What do you gain out of today, take out of today?
CRAIG THOMAS:  Everything that we've been working on is working, I just have to stick with it, go putt for a while, chip for a while, and then 67, 68, if we can get something like that going tomorrow, then I have a chance.
