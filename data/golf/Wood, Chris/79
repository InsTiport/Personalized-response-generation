   CHRIS WOOD: I've never hit a 9-iron 210 yards in my life, so probably a little bit of adrenalin, a bit of a flier and, you know, couldn't do anything about it. I hit a good shot, it landed on the line exactly how I wanted. It just absolutely went miles.  
  
  Q. (Question regarding memories from last year.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Yes, you know, last year I think helped me an awful lot today. Yeah, it's weird to say I'm only 21 and I've contended in two majors already. The experiences I've got out of the Open have just -- they're going to be amazing for my career. I'm just going to move on and move on every year.  
  
  Q. (Question regarding condition of the golf course.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: I think the weather is probably slightly better this year, but, I mean, the golf course this year was just absolutely class. I mean Birkdale was great, but to play golf in this scenery and for the sun to come out today, as well, it's just capped off a great tournament.  
  
  Q. Were you nervous coming down the stretch?   
 CHRIS WOOD: No, not really. I've got a great caddie on the bag and he just kept saying really positive things to me. And I felt like I sort of related to last year, the experiences I've had, and played each shot as it came. And really felt like I controlled my nerves really well and I was really pleased with myself.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: No, I didn't, no. My caddie wouldn't let me look at the leaderboard, but I got a couple of sneaky looks in. But, no, I didn't know. I mean I had a couple of bogeys, 13 and 14 -- I mean I had a similar run last year but only made two this year and then birdied 15 and 17 so I made up for those.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Yes, yes, it was one of my goals -- going out personally today was getting out into that top 10 and securing a place for next year and finish as high up as I can. And obviously I've given myself a good chance to get in the Race to Dubai now, as well, which is the thing you want to play in on the European Tour.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, as soon as I actually got to my shot behind the green on the last, I sort of thought, well, I've hit this shot so many times I actually fancied it to hole it. It's difficult to play a shot out of the thick rough when you're nervous.   
 I hit as good a shot as I can and hit a great putt, it just didn't go in for me.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I think it always does, but I can't think about anything like that. I tried my hardest on every shot, and it just wasn't meant to be.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: No, because I've got about a six-hour drive home tonight so I won't be watching any telly.  
  
  Q. How would you compare your game now to last year?   
 CHRIS WOOD: I think it's better. To follow it up as a professional is about as good as I could have hoped for, I think. To finish 5th as an amateur on a links course, people might have said, well, let's see what he does in the future. But, you know, I've had great experience the last year on the European Tour, having got my card, and to finish 5th or wherever I finished, top-5 hopefully, again, as a pro, will be great.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Well, yes. I mean, playing with him today was a bit ironic, I thought, really. We both won a Silver Medal and both sort of made our names in The Open, really. To play with him on the last day when we both had a chance was pretty good.  
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: No, I didn't think of it at all. I just felt so proud of myself to stay in every shot, and I knew exactly where I wanted to hit every shot and I felt like I did that, and I didn't really let myself think about anything like that, really.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 CHRIS WOOD: Well, yeah, I've just got a new flat so I need to pay the rent for that, so I should be all right.
