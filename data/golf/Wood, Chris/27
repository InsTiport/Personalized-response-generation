 Q.  Thoughts on the round?  
CHRIS WOOD: My target today was to break par.  It was probably a little bit windier today than it was yesterday, as well.  A few of the tees were up, so the course played probably about the same as it did yesterday with the wind and the tees up.  Anything under par is pretty good.   
 Q.  Highlights of the round today?  
CHRIS WOOD: There's never really many highlights with me.  Sort of very steady.  Every shot is really demanding, so I hit quite a lot of good shots really but none that really stood out.   
 Q.  It's going to put you in great position for moving day tomorrow.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, probably Top-20, Top-15 would be a good sort of result this week, experience on the golf course, experience in America, all that sort of thing, yeah.  A bit of rust on the greens.  So far, I'm on track.
