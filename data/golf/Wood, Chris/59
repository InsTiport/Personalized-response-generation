 Q.   What does it mean to eventually win on The European Tour?   
    CHRIS WOOD:   Dream come true.   Absolutely amazing.   Yeah, I knew that putt on the last, that was the first time I saw the leaderboard before that putt, so I knew that was my chance, and two putts for a playoff, and you don't get many chances at a playoff, and that was my chance and I took it.  
   
 Q.   An eagle to finish and to win is an astonishing performance?  
    CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, I finished the year, actually, at The Race to Dubai with an eagle on the last.   It was a nice way to end the year.   Yeah, after hitting that drive, I had a great yardage with a 6‑iron to the hole and fortunately they moved the tee up today, so I could reach the 6‑iron, so I didn't think I could hit it that close with a 3‑wood.  
    You've even the likes of Tiger do it before, he wins ugly, and I didn't play as well as I have done, certainly yesterday, but in the back of my mind, though, that's what I was trying to do.  
   
 Q.   When you consider the players you've beaten does that make it all the more special?  
    CHRIS WOOD:   Well, obviously grow up watching Garcia, and to beat him by a shot on the last is pretty satisfying.   Obviously the field we get in these desert events are great, so there's a lot of World Ranking points there for me.
