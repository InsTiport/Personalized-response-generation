CHRIS WOOD: You're going to have to grind over the week.  I think I heard Fitzpatrick say this morning there's not any hole where you feel like you get a stretch of where you can relax, but feel like there's a few chances.  Next week you feel like, okay, going to have some wedge holes coming up ahead.  Every shot you have to be on it.  It's brilliant, though.  It's a great test.  I've always loved the golf course, but never really been able to produce a score.  So it's nice to put a score in today.  3-under is pretty good out there, I think?   
 Q.  Seems the course is a lot tougher this year.  The rough seems a lot more brittle than it has been over the past.  Looks like they're really testing you guys this week.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah.  I think Thomas is looking to have it setup similar to what you want in September.  I'm surprised, actually, more Americans did not come over.  If they did, I'd like to have seen them just go wide on the fairways, you know, and then in September go like this and then really narrow it up.  I know with Justin Thomas here, it favors us a bit.  Probably half the team that will be on the team in September are playing this week.  So it's a good advantage to Europe.   
 Q.  On a personal note, is there a feeling your game is getting better?  Is it near where you'd like it to be now?  
CHRIS WOOD: Slowly, yeah.  It's pretty hard for a while now, but just gotta keep going.  (Indiscernible) just never give up really.  Just keep working and eventually you'll see a glimmer of light.   
 Q.  Well played today.  Good luck for the weekend.
