 Q.  I take it there's huge satisfaction getting things done so swiftly and in such style?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, good to get another good win under my belt two, 5 & 4s which is great.  Conserve the energy for hopefully a potentially long weekend.  So, yeah, it's nice to get through again.   
 Q.  And what a blistering start, five successive birdies.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I started off really nicely.  And you know, when you get a nice lead like that early on, it's quite hard to come back, although got back to two the back nine holes, it gives them hope.  But thankfully I managed to win 10 and 12 and got a great halve on 13 and won 14.   
 Q.  And presumably you feel comfortable and controlled when that's happening with that kind of start.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I think as every hole passes, you feel like, if you win one more hole, it's almost one more hole won, but two holes out of the way sort of thing.  It's nice to be in a position where you're feeling in control.   
 Q.  Pace of play is lovely, as well?  
CHRIS WOOD: 2 1/2 hours this morning, and a lie in, as well, this morning.  Don't know what to do with myself this afternoon.  I might go back to bed.  Maybe thinking of wandering down the road and having a look at Mr. Trump's place for half an hour, just have a look at that.  Heard so many things about it.  Nice to see it for myself.
