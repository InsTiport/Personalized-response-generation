 Q.  Thoughts on the week overall?  
CHRIS WOOD: Solid week.  Disappointing day yesterday.  Wasn't quite firing and it was a long day, and when the putts aren't dropping, it's frustrating.  So I knew I was playing all right.  But I scored much better today.   
 Q.  Presumably when you stepped into the day, you still fancied the chances, the opportunity?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, depending on obviously my start and their start.  I think it was a bit of a wait on the fourth or fifth tee today.  I saw that the guys got to 18-under early on, and I was only 1-under at that stage.  I think I had fallen four or five behind at that point and it was always going to be difficult.  Yeah, events like this, if you're not going to win, sort of gain a few Ryder Cup points as you go along, it always helps.   
 Q.  Do you fancy The Final Series, playing so very nicely at the moment?  It's a good start, isn't it, with events to come.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yes, it is.  Obviously we are all going to Shanghai tonight.  Next week is a slightly different golf course.  Try and adapt to the time change and be ready to go again on Thursday.   
 Q.  A golf course that you like; one that you favour?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, only been there once.  A couple years ago I played.  But we were saying on the way around, Rory was very complimentary, one of the best of the year.  Should be nice there.
