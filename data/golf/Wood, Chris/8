 Q.  An opening round 72, last year when you went on to win the tournament, what are your thoughts on starting with the same score today?  
CHRIS WOOD: Pretty disappointed.  Played lovely for 11 holes.  Couldn't hit the hole from three feet today.  From 15 feet away, I made a couple but probably three or five shots from inside five feet today.  Not in the best frame of mind now as we finish.   
 Q.  Obviously that's something you'll work on.  They replaced all the greens here.  Was it anything down to that or just a bad day on the putting green?  
CHRIS WOOD: Well, wish I could take them up and put the old ones back.  Yeah, one of those days obviously.  Didn't have any confidence from inside four or five feet.  But can't blame the greens.  The greens are perfect.  Suppose it's just a case of me getting used to them.   
 Q.  Overall how has it been coming back here this week and defending a title you won in such great fashion last year?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, it's been really good.  I love playing here, yeah.  The crowds are amazing.  The weather always seems to work out, as well, these weeks.  The whole sort of tournament has grown and the atmosphere is amazing down there.  Everything that BMW do on the course but around the event, as well, makes it such a special event.  So yeah, to drive in and see my face sort of on a programme, defending champion, is pretty cool.
