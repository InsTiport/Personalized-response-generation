 Q.  Pleased with your round?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, some progress.  I felt like I deserved a bit better than 68.  A bit frustrated on the 17th.  I hit a ball obviously ten yards left of what I'm trying to do.  But if the ball is plugged into the ground, you can get free relief on every other day of the year.  But I couldn't believe it when the referee said, you don't get from that this week.  It's one tournament of the year that we don't get relief, and it was bad enough that I couldn't move the ball.  I made 6 and it really killed my round.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, it's coming.  But, yes, it's nice to put 18 holes together.  Yeah, not really having any destructive shots, which has been my problem really for the last few months.  It's definitely some good progress.  I spent a few hours with Paul Mitchell over the weekend, my old coach, and that's really been a big help for me.  Sometimes you lose a few sort of basics that when you're out here, you sort of lose track of.  So, yeah, it was a big help.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: It was.  That's why it's disappointing to shoot 68.  Because I thought if I birdied 17, I would probably give myself a chance on 18.  So I felt 66 would've been a fair score today, and obviously to move under par was my target, really.  I'm sure Jordan will get to 10-under, and there's going to be loads of guys on 6, 7, 8-under.  So 1-over par is just a bit too far back now.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: I don't say.  Yeah, I don't get how every week of the year we play to one set of rules and then one week out of the 52 is a different set of rules.  We're trying to make golf simple, and to have one set of rules for the game.  Either you get relief all year or you don't get relief all year, but to have two sets of rules seems a bit bizarre.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, definitely.  4-under is about right, I felt today for me.  So when you come off feeling like you're two shots down on where you feel you should be, and I wanted to finish under par.  Even though 68 still nudges me up slightly, it's not enough.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: 63, 64 was definitely on there today.  But Grace, when he gets going, he's as good as anybody, really.  He's not afraid of a low round.  But, yeah, those sort of scores -- I watched a little bit this morning with my breakfast and they said could be a record day in majors or The Open.  Where you see a score like that, I'm not sure if that's broken it or not.  It is a record, is it?  Yeah, I'm not surprised really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: I'm sure it will take breaking 60, which I'm sure won't be done.  I'll try and finish as high up as I can now.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: It's slightly different in the professional game because we've got a slightly different course setup.  Golf is complicated enough.  Most times you have a bad -- you need a referee's opinion.  You've just got to do it yourself, because there's so many different rules you don't know what you're doing, and that slows the game up and that sort of thing.  If it was simple rules across the board it would probably help the pace of play, as well.
