 Q.  Give us your thoughts on the final round?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, didn't play anywhere near my best today.  Yeah, gutted, really.  Again, not quite at your best -- I've putted so well for six weeks now, just my long game's not been there.  I needed to hole putts today.  The greens were a little bit bumpy this afternoon.  Didn't quite well enough probably to deserve to win, but nothing wrong with trying to steal one.   
 Q.  Overall, getting back in contention for these big tournaments is sort of where you want to be and it's been a tough time of late, so nice to be back in that situation now?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, it is.  That's exactly right.  I want to be feeling a little bit more comfortable with my game and being in positions like today, and I've not quite felt on my game for a while.  And when you're trying to win this tournament around this course, you need to be.  If you're not quite on it, probably just comes through at the end -- still there or thereabouts.   
 Q.  Hoping to carry this form through in the next few Rolex Series Events and The Open?  
CHRIS WOOD: I feel like a need a couple days of sleep after this.  It's a tough course.  Yeah, a massive boost, but when you get a chance to win, you always want to take it.
