 Q.  Still, good day out there?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, boring day actually.  Feels like I was taking a day to play, so I'm quite happy to just finish and regroup, and I'm, what, three behind, so still got a chance tomorrow.   
 Q.  When the pace of play isn't to your liking, does that affect your rhythm and your game, as well?  
CHRIS WOOD: I don't know if it affects my rhythm.  I don't know.  It just felt like we were out there forever.  It's just one of those days where you're just ready to finish.  It's 28 degrees or whatever it is, and it's taken over five hours to play 18 holes, it's ridiculous.  So nice to be finished.   
 Q.  And essentially, there wasn't an awful lot going on with your scorecard, was there.  There was opportunities not quite taken and good saves.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, it was boring golf, wasn't it.  Only made two birdies and then parred every hole on the back nine which isn't what I was after.  So hopefully make a few more birdies tomorrow.   
 Q.  You've hinted at this; you're in a nice position still.  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, definitely.  After three rounds, you'll be happy -- if you're not leading, you'll be happy to be within three.  Obviously someone like Rory made his little move today, so, yeah, it's all to play for tomorrow.
