  CHRIS WOOD:   Didn't really play my best golf but got a nice score.  
   
 Q.   And you're in a nice position again.   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, had a nice putt on the last but had a spike mark‑‑ but nice to back up with the last two days.   
   
 Q.   Not knowing what's going to happen after a victory‑‑  
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, you know, I'm pretty tired and didn't have a lot of energy at the start of the week but have done the right things to get energy and try to get going again for Thursday.  
   
 Q.   Do those energy levels automatically pick up when you're in contention, just lurking again?   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, definitely, as soon as I got to the first tee yesterday, I started to get energy back again and all of a sudden feeling a lot better about yourself.  
   
 Q.   Playing alongside Lee Westwood worked out nicely?  
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, loved every minute.   One of the benefits of winning the tournament; the week after, you get a good draw.   I enjoyed it.
