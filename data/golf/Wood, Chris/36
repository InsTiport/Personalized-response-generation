CHRIS WOOD: I didn't play great but Andy, he played absolutely superb.  So congratulations to him.
Q. When were you thinking a second as opposed to trying to chase?
CHRIS WOOD: Probably after five or six holes.  He wasn't missing a shot.  The greens were tough the last couple days because they were so slow, so the chances out there, you had to make.
