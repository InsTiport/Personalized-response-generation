 Q.   Tell us about that start to the tournament, please?  
CHRIS WOOD:   This is obviously a good first round.   Didn't play probably quite as well as I could have.   Got the ball rolling all right today.   Surprised myself.   Hit a few pretty close.   Made a nice eagle on 15.  
But yeah, it was‑‑ apart from not feeling great with my swing, I played reasonably solid.  
   
 Q.   And certainly this is a continuation of some other fine form you've shown around Celtic Manor in the past.   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, I real will I like it here, probably because I can stay at home and I feel really comfortable.   It's half an hour over the bridge for me, and I like just‑‑ I think the golf course sets up really nicely for me, as well.   I can hit a few drivers and I feel comfortable on the greens, as well.  
   
 Q.   A nice treat for your caddie the other night?   
CHRIS WOOD:   Well, I would call it a treat.   Bristol City beating Crystal Palace is all right for me.   That will do.   You're not going to have Premiership sides Tuesday night‑‑ probably he got lucky.   Probably as good as I've seen them play for a couple of years.  
   
 Q.   Puts you in the right mood as well, doesn't it?  
CHRIS WOOD:   Oh, I was buzzing after it, and Brendan, my caddie, he's probably a bit of a closet fan now.   So I'm sure it won't be the last time he's down there.
