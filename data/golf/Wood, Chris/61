  CHRIS WOOD:   Very solid today, perfect conditions out there.   Greens are as good as you'll get them this week and lots of sunshine.   So it was really nice to be out there. 

Q.   Are you in total control of your game? 
    CHRIS WOOD:   I was quite rusty last week and in Abu Dhabi I played four rounds but struggled on the weekend, so I know my game is there.   It's nice to putt a good number in this morning. 

Q.   Everybody's a bit rusty at the start of the year but you just want to get out of the blocks flying at these tournaments, don't you? 
    CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, great start to the season.   It's important for the Tour to this these events at the start of the year, and they always get strong fields.   So it's a good chance for all of us really to get some World Ranking points and start the season well.

Q.   How well have you done here?   It seems the kind of track that you should thrive on?
    CHRIS WOOD:   I've had two or three Topâ€‘20s, solid weeks here, I write a blog every week and I've said that I performed solid, nothing special, but solid on this course over the last few years, and I feel like I'm quite comfortable on the grainy greens, I feel quite happy around this course. 
    Three more rounds playing like that, I don't think I'll be too disappointed with, so that's the aim, just keep plodding away and see what happens.
