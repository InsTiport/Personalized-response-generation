 Q.   Bring it into the house 4â€‘under in your last nine holes.   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, I walked across onto the first tee, started on the 10th this morning and I think I was under par after nine holes, and I thought solid nine here might be a decent round.   Birdied the first three of my back nine, and yeah, I was on a bit of a roll from there.  
   
 Q.   Also did some nice scrambling.   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yes, especially on the front nine, as well.   Yeah, I missed a few greens early on, and those momentum putts are massive for keeping your round going.   That was a real good thing for me today.   
   
 Q.   Looks like the greens are receptive, you can be aggressive with your approaches?   
CHRIS WOOD:   Yeah, it caught me out a couple of times actually around the greens.   You're in the thick rough around the greens and I played quite a nice shot and it lands quite dead, didn't release as far as I thought, and it took a few holes to get used to that.   But the greens are probably as good as I've ever putted on.   They're a real pleasure to play on.
