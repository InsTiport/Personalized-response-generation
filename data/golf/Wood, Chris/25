 Q.  A 5-5 finish in that round of 68, I sense a little bit of frustration with that finish there, would that be right?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I played lovely today, and I didn't birdie one par 5.  So the par 5s here are very scorable.  I had a 5-iron into 18 there and I mean, I couldn't have hit a better shot and it caught the bunker by a yard and go a yard further left and it's maybe five feet away.   
Yeah, it's frustrating when you feel like you leave quite a few out there.   
 Q.  Still, you're well in the mix for tomorrow, as we speak, and I know this is a course that's treated you very well over the years, a fourth place finish, a tied six on your debut.  I just wonder how valuable this week is to you and those who are really battling to get into Darren Clarke's Ryder Cup side this year.  
CHRIS WOOD: Weeks like this are obviously vital for high finishes to sort of try and work your way up the rankings there or thereabouts with the need of a couple of really good finishes.   
As long as I can show him that I've got the form and I'm there or thereabouts, that's all I can do, really.  But it would certainly help another good finish tomorrow.
