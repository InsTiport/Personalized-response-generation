Q. Largely one-sided and then he came back at you.
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I think I was 4-up with five to go, middle of the fairway on 14, and worst shot of the week, 6-iron into the hazard.  Obviously made bogey there.
He made a great three on 15.
Short-sided myself on 16.
Two pars on 17, and all of the sudden, playing the last.  Maybe one or two bad shots all day, 4-up, and you're playing the last hole.  I think it showed that I haven't played the last four holes since Wednesday, as well.
Q. It is unfamiliar territory.  Does it make you edgy when you're coming down the wire like that?
CHRIS WOOD: I think you would be lying if you didn't have a new nerves.  When you're 4-up, you want to finish the job, don't you; 3, 2, 1, it's getting a bit too close for my liking, but glad to get through.
Q. Looking at positives, how is the competitive edge and spirit ready for a quarterfinal against David Howell?
CHRIS WOOD: Well, I've had two 5 & 4 wins, and to be honest, it's probably a little bit of a luxury to be winning 5 & 4 out here.  You're always going to get one or two games that go down to the last probably two or three holes.  Yeah, hopefully that was my tight match and I can give Howeller a good go and a good run this afternoon.
Q. That will be good fun, as well.  You know each other well.
CHRIS WOOD: We do.  Both west country boys.  Both part of the same management company.  Mr. Experience, Howeller, he's obviously played a couple of Ryder Cups and I've played none.  He's got that on his side.
