CHRIS WOOD: Didn't feel like I quite played as well today, but obviously the conditions this morning were perfect.  Hopefully it will blow this afternoon like it did for us yesterday.   
 Q.  Certainly you got in amongst the birdies early on, and playing alongside Danny Willett; did the two of you egg each other on a little bit out there?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, the back nine yesterday, we were chatting about, 7-under through seven holes on the back nine yesterday and something similar today, probably a little bit better.  So, yeah, it's always good to play with Dan.   
 Q.  Is it the nature of golf that sometimes it click when is you've been on a poorer run, beaten yourself up a little bit and you turn the corner?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I think it is.  It's never really far away, golf.  For me, probably a little bit of confidence, hitting a good shot at right time, and a little bit of momentum gathers.  Yeah, it was never really far off.   
 Q.  Presumably the excitement gathers when you see your name up on the board?  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, playing with Dan, obviously he was going nicely, so we pushed each other along really well.  So that always helps.
