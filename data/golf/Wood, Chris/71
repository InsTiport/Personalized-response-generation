 Q. How would you sum that one up? 
 CHRIS WOOD: It was -- I don't know, really. Actually I felt like I hit quite a lot of good shots, especially the front nine that were just one, two yards slightly off perfection, really. I was hitting shots sort of right over the flags, and ending up sort of 15 feet away on the fringe, just not quite really going. Nothing really sort of seemed to go at all. After a few hours of that, demoralising. 

 Q. It's a fraction of an inch that can make the difference between a great shot and a difficult?
 CHRIS WOOD: I didn't hit that many really bad shots. I don't really know, really, how it sort of -- I said to my caddie, Dave, I said, I don't know what I actually can learn from today because I didn't hit that many bad shots. 

 Q. Just lady luck on the green?
 CHRIS WOOD: It's obviously more than that, but I really don't know. It's a bit hard. 

 Q. It's a well-known thing that if you're in the last group on the last day, it has got to be a learning experience and has to find you in good stead; that would be the positive that you would take from it, I presume. 
 CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, sort of first time I've led going into the last round. That's a new experience. But I just don't really know what to say at the moment.
