CHRIS WOOD: The front nine was probably a case of same old, really.  It's been a struggle this year for me, really.  I had a 6-iron from 150 yards; that's the beauty of links golf, being able to hit shots like that.  I hit a lovely shot in there and holed a par, and that sort of got me going.  The tough thing about this course is you can start -- you've got to play well on the front nine because there's no respite, really.  The par-5s -- so I always felt like I might try to get back to 2-over.  I was able to pick one more up, so I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Well, the first six or seven holes are pretty tough.  The wind has definitely dropped.  The sun is coming out.  I wish I had started an hour later, really, for a bit more sleep, really.  But the conditions -- I mean, when you're 4-over par after however many, seven holes I think I was, facing a 20-footer for par on the 8th, things aren't looking good.  So I'll always fight away.  But to come back to 4-under par for the last 10 or 11 holes was good.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, they had a couple of tickets for today and I'll go and have dinner with them tonight to raise money for the Children's Hospital.  I'll try and raise as much money as I can for them.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I'm a bit ruddy after my early start.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, tough.  Because it's going to be a talking point.  I mean, it doesn't deserve to be brought to light like that.  It's a tough tee shot at the best of times.  But wind off the left, raining, half past six in the morning.  The thing is, it was a great atmosphere.  And I hit driver when I was an amateur.  It's a tough shot.  I hit 1-iron.  It's a tough opening tee shot, but the wind off the left makes it even harder.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: He's one of the nicest blokes I've ever met.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: I was waking up every hour, looking at my phone and checking the time, and it was a pretty unsettling time to sleep, really.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I played the practice round with Poulter on Tuesday, and we played the last day 2008.  And my dad was caddying, and those sort of things come back.  Playing with him on Sunday was daunting and a massive experience for me.  So I will have a chat with him now.  And yes, it's pretty cool.   
 Q.  (Inaudible.)  
CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I played with him last week in Scotland actually for the first couple of days, and he was threatening the leader, but he was playing lovely.  He's coming back, really.
