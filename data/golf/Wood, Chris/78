  Q. Another good victory for you today.   
 CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, I played a lot better today than I did it yesterday. We had a tough game against two very solid players today. But Wally, we both played pretty solid today.  
  
  Q. The partnership seems to be working out so far. Are you keen to keep that going?   
 CHRIS WOOD: Yes, whatever the captain does, really. We have gelled quite well and it's the first time we have obviously played as a team together and it's gone really well.   
  
  Q. How are you enjoying the challenge of match play?   
 CHRIS WOOD: I love match play. It's a totally different game. It's nice to be winning games, anyway.   
 It's totally different, and I love the team side of it.   
  
  Q. A 100 per cent record so far for yourself.   
 CHRIS WOOD: Yeah, it's nice. It's always nice to win, and I've played two pretty tough games and four great players for my first all-time in a team as a professional, it's been going really well.
