PHIL WEIDINGER: Leader in the clubhouse, Billy Joe, why don't you take us through your round, 27 points, nice start.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Wasn't too bad today. Putted really well. I had six birdies, three bogeys, one of them with a penalty.

I actually played pretty well. Hit a couple of errant tee balls on 8 and 9, but other than that hit the ball pretty solid today, especially the irons, putted decent. Just like everybody, you come in, doesn't matter what you shoot, you always think, well, there's two that I missed. You know there's a couple I had good runs at that burnt the edge.

All in all, I'm satisfied. Shoot 69, that ain't bad.
Q. Are you going to play 18 any different tomorrow because of the water level the way it is?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: No. I figured out my problem on 18. My caddie finally told me yesterday. I'm aimed right. I think I'm aimed over here at left side of the clubhouse, I'm aimed in the trees. I make a good swing that feels good, I look up, it's going right. Now I fixed it, hit it down the middle, 9 iron right through.
Q. What did you hit in today?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: 9. Just by the hair. If it's one foot shorter, it's wet. I live on the edge. It's hard being this good looking and not live on the edge. Perfect face for radio.
Q. Did you hear about the guy who hit the boat, broke the boat windshield today?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: I didn't hear about that. That's the kind of word that doesn't travel fast, you know. It's not like a hole in one. (Laughter).

Hey, were there some hotties on there? Did he have to go out there and give them mouth to mouth or anything? It's important, look after your fellow man.
Q. So you're playing well, you like your chances then at this point, I would assume?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: You know, I came in playing pretty well. There's still 36 holes left to play. We'll see how it works out. But you know, I keep hitting like I hit it today, I'll be there on Sunday. I'll have a chance.
Q. How is it playing with a couple of guys that are pretty quiet and grinders like Lemieux and Dilfer today?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: You know I had a good pairing today. I drew a good group; two of my better friends, guys I really enjoy being around and we had a good time out there. Mario struggled a little bit with the putter, as Trent struggled a little bit with the putter. But they will get it back and they will be in the hunt I'm sure on come Sunday on the back nine.
Q. When you look at the leaderboard right now, do you see any surprises?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: No. I mean, you know, I don't know what it's at let me look at it over here. I'm a little surprised that Pierre at 17, I figured, you know, Pierre has been hitting the ball really well. 17, it's not a bad round, don't get me wrong, but would expect him to be in the 20s. You know, Coach Jauron played well I guess.

But, you know, all in all, the only one that surprised me is Dick Anderson. He had the rally on the back nine through 18 points in there but certainly expect him to be a little higher on the board. You know, apparently he had a rough front nine where the putter must not have worked for him.

CHRIS CHANDLER: Four 3 putts.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: See, I know my boy.

CHRIS CHANDLER: Hit driver every hole. What did Dicky J shoot?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: I don't know what he finished with, 17, 18? What did Jauron finish with?
Q. 14 after 15.

CHRIS CHANDLER: Only good news, I was the first 23 in our group. There's Milthorpe? Somebody radio Milthorpe. I've got to talk to him.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: But, you know, it's a good day out there. The golf course is in great condition. The weather is outstanding. You know, other than our what do you call it, 13, 13 up the hill.

CHRIS CHANDLER: What's wrong with that?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Other than our little group's debacle on 13, we had a pretty good day today. Trent pulled a tc chin. My caddie kicked my ball.

CHRIS CHANDLER: No way.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Walking after he just kicked it. I said, "Hey, man, what are you doing?"
Q. Chris, I don't even see your name up there, can you tell us what you did today?

CHRIS CHANDLER: Well, I had five on the front and then 18 on the back.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Solid.

CHRIS CHANDLER: I putted poorly on the front nine and considerably better on the back.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: The good Lord didn't give it all to one.

CHRIS CHANDLER: I hit it good. This is the first time I hit driver on every hole. I've never hit driver on 9, never hit driver on 10 and I did and it worked out just fine.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: You might want to back off driver on those 3 pars.

CHRIS CHANDLER: But you know, it was hard. It was a tough day. I got the red line about five different times today. I about went cross eyed and packed it in. But Brodie was following me the first five holes, and after that, I didn't see him anymore.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Snakes.

CHRIS CHANDLER: I could hear him like "no, no." I'd hit a bad putt and I'd hear him yelling. He left me until my wife and kids came back out on the back side. I was trying to make him, you know, somewhat proud. I also know he bet on me, too, so I'd better try to
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Hey, so did I.

CHRIS CHANDLER: But no, it was a great day. I mean, it was this is as good of weather I think we've had in a long time. I mean, the wind laid down. Compared to the to the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the winds we had out here, it was completely different. I feel real lucky to be where I'm at with the way I played on the front. It will be a fun last 36 holes.
Q. Can you describe the chip in on No. 18?

CHRIS CHANDLER: On the 18th hole, yeah, the thing stayed up because there in a big clump of grass. I was telling my caddie, Kos
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Kos!

CHRIS CHANDLER: I go, "It's either going to go two feet for 20." It just came out good and went in the hole. That was a lifesaver and grabbed onto it.
Q. Speaking of Brodie, I understand, I don't know if you heard this, but he's apparently given his blessing to Dilfer to wear his number.

CHRIS CHANDLER: Absolutely.
Q. Your thoughts on that?

CHRIS CHANDLER: It's wonderful. Trent and Billy and there's a handful of guys out here that are extremely close to J.B. and he thinks a lot of these guys. For Trent to and talking with Trent, it's Don or John. I think it's great. If I can be in the same situation, I would do it. I know Trent is doing it for Brodes and John is on board and he's excited about it.

All we've got to do now is get John in that Hall of Fame. For some reason, he's not in, but that's the next step.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: I've been pushing hard, my man.

CHRIS CHANDLER: It's funny, you ask almost anybody, and everybody assumes he's in. But there's some pressure on a couple media people, or one in particular, that we have to get to nominate him, and hopefully this will happen.
Q. Who is that?
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: Don't name names.

CHRIS CHANDLER: If you can imagine the biggest, oldest guy in the Bay Area, you might think of the guy.
Q. Isn't he retiring right now, though?

CHRIS CHANDLER: I don't know, but he still has to nominate him. If he's out of the picture, we have a chance. You know who I'm talking about, don't you?
Q. Yeah. Big guy?

CHRIS CHANDLER: Uh huh. I think Brodie probably addressed him weekly. So that's where that's at. If I can do anything in the next handful of years
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: How come retired players can't

CHRIS CHANDLER: Because retired place don't vote.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: How come guys in the Hall of Fame, how come they can't nominate? I thought they had a nomination each year.

CHRIS CHANDLER: I don't know. Maybe that's one way in.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: I thought they had one where they get to nominate somebody in each year.

CHRIS CHANDLER: John was one of the finest players in the game for a dozen years and even a better guy.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: A lot of years.

CHRIS CHANDLER: And even a better teammate. He taught me a lot about that stuff.
BILLY JOE TOLLIVER: And he still knows more football than a lot of people.

CHRIS CHANDLER: Absolutely. Hopefully we can get that ball just steamrolling down the hill.
