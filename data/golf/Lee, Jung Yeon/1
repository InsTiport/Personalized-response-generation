PAUL ROVNAK:  We'll go ahead and get started.  Jee Young, thanks for coming in.  You're at 15 under for the tournament, two strokes behind Lorena Ochoa.  So you should have a good chance to win this tournament tomorrow.  Go ahead and talk about that and then we'll take some questions.
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Does it also help playing with Soo Yun?  Does she learn anything from her still, and do they play a lot together?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Did she watch the leaderboard today and see Lorena get far ahead and realize    I think at one point she might have been five or six shots behind.  She finished strongly.  Was that one of the things that influenced her strong finish was seeing how far Lorena was ahead of her?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Soo Yun had the same thing, did she not?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes.
Q.  Were you guys miserable out there?  Was it more comfortable playing with someone from Korea in your group?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Very much so.  (No microphone.)
Q.  How many holes did she play with each putting grip today?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  The one she played the last 12 holes with yesterday?
JEE YOUNG LEE: Yes.
Q.  So the first six holes were partially overlapping or not overlapping?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  How difficult is it to play when you're not playing well, because some players I know it helps them concentrate and they actually play better when they're not feeling well.  What's her take on it?  Was she struggling out there?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Why did the illness affect her vision?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Headache?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  Yes.
Q.  Is it something she can get rid of by tomorrow?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  She's not sure.  (No microphone.)
Q.  How often has this happened to her?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
Q.  Too much air conditioning?  How does she think she got it?
JEE YOUNG LEE:  (No microphone.)
