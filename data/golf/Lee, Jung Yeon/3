 LAURA NEAL:  Thank you for coming in.  Your first time.  We're going to attach this microphone, and they're going to ask questions.  And if you guys can speak a little slowly, we'll do well.
Q.  Yes.  Tell me about your eagle on No. 5.
JUNG YEON LEE:  My driver went a little bit right into the loft.  And I thought it was a layer shot -- because I hit under the tree.  So I'm up to -- chipped under the tree too.  So maybe three putt shots that works.  And then maybe -- I don't know feet.  Like seven yards?  Seven yards?  I don't know feet.
LAURA NEAL:  21 feet.
JUNG YEON LEE:  21 feet.  And maybe straight to hit it.
LAURA NEAL:  Straight up.
JUNG YEON LEE:  Yeah.

Q.  How did you feel playing today, out there?
JUNG YEON LEE:  I just try to make sure every hole make a par, every hole.  But the 16 and 18, I hit the tree, so it made me bogey.  But pretty comfortable, I think today.

Q.  Can you talk a little about those bogeys. 
JUNG YEON LEE:  Yeah, my tee shot hit the right side fairway, and then -- but it's a big tree, from my... that maybe 30 at front, the tree.  I just trying to hit over the tree to my pitching range, but is not enough club.  So I hit the tree and then to down-hole, and make a bogey.

Q.  And on 18?
JUNG YEON LEE:  Yeah, that is also, I hit it right, right fairway, right side fairway.  It is also fairway, but is a big tree.  And then I hit the tree again, and maybe 60 yards up front.  But I didn't make the putt.

Q.  And let's go to the rest of your birdies.  What club you hit it and how close was your 10.  On No. 6?
JUNG YEON LEE:  No. 6, my tee shot, I hit a 4-iron, but it rolled all the way back into the loft, right side loft.  And it hit also a tree.  Many tree.  But I hit a 8-iron straight down, and hit to knockdown shot.  I try a knockdown shot, like one -- maybe one --
LAURA NEAL:  10 yards.
JUNG YEON LEE:  And maybe left to right, about five yards -- 15; yeah, 15 feet.
LAURA NEAL:  And No. 9?
JUNG YEON LEE:  I hit it through, aim for the right side of tree, and it works.  Finally, through the tree.  And then 125 yard left and I hit a pitch-wedge and -- six yard, I think 15, 18 feet, it's a little right to left.  I just made it.
LAURA NEAL:  And twelve?
JUNG YEON LEE:  Twelve, I hit a drive.  And then 7-wood layup, make a 65-yard.  And then I hit a 58-degree, and I... yeah.
LAURA NEAL:  Good.  Any other questions?
Q.  The weather, how was the weather?  Did the rain affect you at all?
JUNG YEON LEE:  Yeah, in the morning, I saw The Weather Channel, and supposed to rain.  So I had rain gear, but not embarrass.
LAURA NEAL:  Embarrassed?
JUNG YEON LEE:  No, I mean I don't care about rain, because --
LAURA NEAL:  It doesn't affect you.
JUNG YEON LEE:  Right.

Q.  I want to know how used you are to being in this position with second place, tied for second place.  Does that have any effect on you mentally, going into the third round, being in the position where you're, right now, near the top of the leaderboard?
JUNG YEON LEE:  I never saw the leaderboard.  I just hit the ball.
LAURA NEAL:  How do you feel, going into tomorrow?
JUNG YEON LEE:  Tomorrow also is another day.  So I just try to make sure to make a par every hole, and maybe birdies are good for me, like that.
LAURA NEAL:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.
