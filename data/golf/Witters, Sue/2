 Q.  What's going on today and what's the plan for tomorrow?  
SUE WITTERS: We were hoping we could get out and play some more golf.  All four of us went out and looked, and there is just too much of a mess out there to be able to go and play today.   
It'll take them a long time to restore the bunkers and pump the water out.  We're not going to play anymore today, and we'll resume play at 7:00 tomorrow to finish round two.   
In the perfect world we'll restart round three at 10:30, with the last time going at 12:42, and we won't re-pair for round three so we don't lose any time.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
SUE WITTERS: Yes.  If we get no delays tomorrow, we can finish round three tomorrow night, which would get us back on track to re-pair for round four.   
Even if we got a delay tomorrow, we would still have some time in the morning to finish round three, re-pair, and have the best show possible for Sunday.   
 Q.  (Indiscernible.)  
SUE WITTERS: The lead groups, the first groups finish round two, are on 9 and 18, so going to be a long day tomorrow.  36 holes and you'll have people playing 27 holes.  The least amount they have to play tomorrow is 27; the most is 36.  Going to be a long day for everybody.
