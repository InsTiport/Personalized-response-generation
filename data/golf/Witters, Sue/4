   SUE WITTERS: We suspended at 10:07 today, as you're all aware, due to lightning in the area. We've basically been plagued with what's coming up from the gulf and everything is starting to form and circle around us.
 A lot of factors always go into this decision. Basically, it was getting to the point where we weren't gonna be able to finish. Unfortunately, tomorrow's scenario is not that great either. We have a window in the morning, and then we could have identical of what we had today.
 That's how we got to the 72 to 54. You know, we're hoping to get the playoff in, because there's still rain out there. The lightning has moved out, but it's still coming down. 
 And you all know we took on a lot of rain last night, more than four inches, and this course can't take a lot more rain. For all the stuff it took and the new renovations, it's fared quite well.
 So we are gonna have some casual water out there. The crew is out there now doing their prep work. We will play 18 repeatedly. We're very fortunate that the tee is elevated and the green is elevated. With the three players in there probably gonna be hitting it further, they should be hitting into one of the drier parts of that fairway. 
 All right. Thank you.
