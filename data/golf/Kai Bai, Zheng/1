 Q.  You had a hole-in-one at No. 7 at Pebble Beach.  Tell us about that.  
ZHENG KAI BAI: It was fun to have that hole-in-one on the most beautiful par-3 here.  Travis played great today, and I played probably better, and I'm happy to win the match.   
 Q.  Details on the shot; what club did you use?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: I hit 56 on No. 7 and just a chip shot, and it went straight at the pin and rolled in.   
 Q.  Could you believe it?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: This is my eighth hole-in-one, so kind of used to it.   
 Q.  At that point, you had just lost a hole.  You had won three holes and then you had lost a hole, so that was a good momentum shift for you.  Did you feel like that was when you really got into control of the match?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: I think I still had holes to play, and I just kept playing -- kept the ball in play and tried to make some birdies and win as much as I can.   
 Q.  Do you like the match play format?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: Yeah, I love it.  Usually I make a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  Are you an aggressive player?  Do you like to go flag hunting, that kind of thing?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: Yeah, I love hitting the ball at the pin.   
 Q.  The hole-in-one was a good part of the game; what was the strongest piece of your game today?  Was it your driver, your irons, your putting?  What do you think it was?  
ZHENG KAI BAI: I think my irons were very good today.  I pretty much hit all drivers on the fairway and probably just one or two shots in the rough, but that's okay.
