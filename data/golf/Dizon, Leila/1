 Q.  Obviously you ran into a pretty strong team there.  I think they were 6-under today?  
IRENE KIM: They had a lot of birdies.   
 Q.  I think they were 6-under through the match.  What did you think of their performance?  
LEILA DIZON: They were so amazing.  Every second shot would be like within 10 feet.   
IRENE KIM: They would stick it, and then they would make the putt because it was like second nature.   
 Q.  How were you guys this morning?  Obviously you played late in the day yesterday, got to get up early again this morning.  Did you feel it on the range?  
IRENE KIM: I might have yawned at least 20 times on the first hole.   
 Q.  Just took you a while to get into it?  
IRENE KIM: Yeah, but we started out 1-up with a birdie, and then we were 1-up through like 6, and then we were all square through 7, and then kind of went downhill from there.  Yeah, we started out pretty well.   
 Q.  Couldn't maintain the mojo you had from yesterday?  
LEILA DIZON: I couldn't make any putts today.  In the back of my -- my second shots were pretty good, but I couldn't make any putts.   
 Q.  How about your performance today?  
IRENE KIM: Yeah, I started out pretty well.   
LEILA DIZON: She started out strong.   
IRENE KIM: Like I was halving with birdies.  But they just played so much better.   
 Q.  So you guys are going back to school now, right?  
IRENE KIM: Yeah, probably going to go back to school right now.   
LEILA DIZON: You are?  I'm going back tomorrow.   
 Q.  How many more weeks of school do you have left, about a month?  
IRENE KIM: I graduate on the 31st.   
LEILA DIZON: I finish on May 25th.   
 Q.  So you missed a few days of school this week?  
LEILA DIZON: Yep.   
 Q.  Were you doing homework in between?  
IRENE KIM: I was.  After the round I was doing homework.   
LEILA DIZON: I just fell asleep.  When I went to bed, I was like, I can't do this homework.  I can't focus.   
 Q.  How would you rate the experience this week?  
IRENE KIM: 10 out of 10, 100 out of 100.   
LEILA DIZON: Yeah, it was amazing.  I had some lucky shots --   
IRENE KIM: Yeah, I learned so much.   
LEILA DIZON: Yeah.   
IRENE KIM: Truly unforgettable.
