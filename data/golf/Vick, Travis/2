(Recording in progress.)   
TRAVIS VICK: Yeah, whole nine was kind of a turning point.  Actually goes back to 7.  I had about a 5-footer for par to win the hole, and that got that back up to all square.   
The drive on 9 I hit to about six feet, and that really kept the momentum, got me to 1-up.   
Then Cole is such a great player.  He's super consistent.  Always hitting fairways and greens.  I knew I had to go out there and make birdies, and the whole nine propelled that for sure.   
 Q.  Then coming into this, did you play a lot on your past experience of match play to help you out?  
TRAVIS VICK: Yeah, no, absolutely.  It's a different mindset.  Different from stroke play.  You're playing the competitor instead of like in stroke play when you're playing the golf course.   
So I kind of set a number, and that's what I want to achieve.  Match play is completely different; the strategy changes, but I enjoy it as well.   
 Q.  Going into tomorrow anything you want to work on or stay the same?  
TRAVIS VICK: Yeah, iron shots need to be a little bit better; driver was a little off.  Just consistency all around.  Wedge game needs to be better as well.  Just everything needs to be a little bit better, because these players are really good.
