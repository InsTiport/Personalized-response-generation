 Q.  How do you feel today?  How was your round?  
NATALIE SRINIVASAN: It was a little stressful on my back nine, which was the front nine.  I kind of made a little mistakes with some putts, but I birdied the last, and I think I should be good now.   
 Q.  How you are feeling?  
NATALIE SRINIVASAN: I'm good.  I'm happy.  Hopefully everything stayed the same.  I don't think I'll drop position unless somebody goes crazy.   
 Q.  What are you thinking about for tomorrow?  
NATALIE SRINIVASAN: Hopefully the weather is good tomorrow so we can kind of see it, but I feel like I know the course so well just from seeing it on TV and everything.  But I'll still looking forward to that.   
 Q.  And how about for Saturday?  
NATALIE SRINIVASAN: Hopefully I'll be there Saturday.  It's just going to be something to enjoy with my dad.
