Q.   Thoughts on the day?
MARK FOSTER:   Solid golf.   I was just hitting it in the middle of the greens.   They are so small, went for the flag the whole time and managed to knock a few in.

Q.   Give us a sense of how the course is playing?
MARK FOSTER:   The start of the day was the worst bit and got better as the day went on.   The wind is there, but, yeah, if you hit good shots, there's a chance of making birdie chances. 

Q.   Mixed results for you so far this year; how do you feel coming into this week? 
MARK FOSTER:   My expectations‑‑ it's not been good.   I've never hidden away from that.   Obviously been doing a lot of work and been looking for rounds like this. 

Q.   You had a great run this time last year; can you feed off that and get going? 
MARK FOSTER:   I played nicely in Germany and at this time last year, so, yeah, I think so.
