 Q.   I take it that's a very satisfying start to the Qatar Masters, isn't it?   
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, it was.   Didn't know what to expect this morning.   Felt like a Tuesday start.   Just out there, good conditions.   
   
 Q.   It was a little bit cold and breezy to start but I suppose that is good for here?  
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, the ball wasn't going as far first thing but an hour and a half in, it was back to normal.   Good conditions.  
   
 Q.   How is it to start a year, I guess there's a little bit of rust in the system and you have to iron that out.   
MARK FOSTER:   Last Thursday there was a lot of rust in my game but Friday, started to get some good feelings.   I came here feeling all right, but like you say, not got many rounds under your belt so you don't know what to expect.   
   
 Q.   Just finding a rhythm I guess.   
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, you're over here, 40‑miles‑an‑hour winds, two practise days‑‑ just short game, try to prepare, great start.  
   
 Q.   How is it out there on the course?   Quite a challenging track, isn't it?   
MARK FOSTER:   It gets better every year I think this place.   The greens this year are as good as I've seen them and it's still the same test from tee‑to‑green, which I think it's a great course.   
   
 Q.   What did you do particularly well to get a score like this this time?  
MARK FOSTER:   The short game was good early on and then I started‑‑ hit a good shot into 9 which was believe it or not probably the good first good shot I hit and I played really well after that.   Sat on my long game and my short game was good all day.  
   
 Q.   Have to ask you about the nick.   
MARK FOSTER:   I arrived with a cyst on my neck and last week got infected and had it removed.   Keeping it out of the sun.   It looks worse than it is.   It's fine.
