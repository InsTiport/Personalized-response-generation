Q.   What are your thoughts after your round today? 
MARK FOSTER:   I'm sure everybody is the same, but as I said earlier in the week, this course, it's got teeth and it showed it today.   Today you just had to battle out, and you can see on the score boards, everybody was battling and to be honest, after my start, I thought I did pretty well.

Q.   Hardly any birdies for many players, so not anything to be concerned about heading into the final day. 
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, it's easy to say that, I managed one all day, and it's frustrating, thinking I need birdies, I need birdies, as always, but they felt like eagles out there.   It was a really tough day. 

Q.   Will you look back tonight and look at the overall position you're in at 10â€‘under, going into the final day of the Irish Open, you really should take confidence for that tomorrow?
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, you're in with a chance.   I would have liked to be in a slightly better position, but going into tomorrow, it's right where you want to be, two shots in the game.   That's why we play in great tournaments like this.
