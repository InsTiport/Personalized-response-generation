Q.   Two excellent rounds of golf, any particular aspect responsible for the good scoring? 
MARK FOSTER:   Consistency, hit the ball well and kept the ball in play.   Holed a few putts, not as many as I would like. 

Q.   Doing well again here, and you've said this course doesn't suit you and it's been a long‑hitter's course and you're not a long hitter; how do you explain your success? 
MARK FOSTER:   I'm aggressive off the tee‑‑ it is a long hitter's course, you can see, that 16, I have to lay up and you can see people driving.   9 I can't get to; there are certain holes, but yeah, I stick to my own strategy and try to be a bit more aggressive on the other holes and try to make up for it there.

Q.   You were disappointed with your play in the Scottish Open and took a five‑week break.   Tell us about that decision?
MARK FOSTER:   As simple as you put it there.   I just thought you don't get much chance to take a break like that, so I thought I needed to regroup and that's the decision I needed to do it. 

Q.   What did you do on those five weeks? 
MARK FOSTER:   I took a four‑week holiday and practised really hard for one week.   Just spent some time at home, sort the house out. 

Q.   Is it a case of you had just had enough?
MARK FOSTER:   Scottish Open, yeah.   Because I could have gone to Austria and if I was playing well, I would have gone to Austria, but I knew I wasn't in the right place to go there, that's why I took the five weeks, normally I play Austria, but I needed to break so I took it. 

Q.   What was your best single moment at the Olympics? 
MARK FOSTER:   Super Saturday.   Jessica Ennis, hers was amazing, but it was more of a celebration.
