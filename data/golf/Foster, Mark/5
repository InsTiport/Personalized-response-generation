Q.   That was a very good day. 
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, obviously played with Eddie probably helped, as well, good group.   Both played nice.   Said to my caddie this morning it was perfect conditions.   Goes without saying, links golf, good conditions, there's always good chances. 
But yeah, to actually give it a whirl and exactly what we're after.

Q.   You mentioned playing with Eddie, as well, do you feed off each other, making birdies?
MARK FOSTER:   We seemed to do that.   He made a couple of birdies, made an eagle and got going.   Good momentum and it was a good group to be in. 

Q.   Your Pro‑Am partner, did he contribute? 
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, we shot 10‑under‑‑ I didn't see a board but he was pretty good.   Yeah, he enjoyed and it was good.

Q.   Do you enjoy the format this week?   Tend to be one that pros look forward to. 
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, you've got to be quite relaxed about it and see what happens.   I think even the pros, we were always walking off‑‑ you just stay relaxed and just try and enjoy it.

Q.   And away from the course, St. Andrews is a great place to stay, as well. 
MARK FOSTER:   Fantastic.   I would say it's probably the only place where I come, a Tour golf place, and come and stay and not play golf.   I could come here most weekends and enjoy myself.

Q.   Looking forward to the next couple of days, St. Andrews?
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, St. Andrews and then across to Carnoustie.   Can't wait. 

Q.   Hopefully nice day like this for Carnoustie, because if it's blowing there, it can be a bit of a brute?
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, exactly.   The weather changes, people always say, Saturday is the worst day but I've seen the forecast change very quick so we'll come across that when we get there.   Yeah, you would like it calm.   If you had your choice, you'd probably play it today.
