  Q. Eagle chance on the last?   
 MARK FOSTER: Yeah, about ten feet, great putt, I can't believe I missed it. Thought it snuck in under the radar but missed left so, good week.   
  
  Q. Well don't go anywhere, because don't know what's going to happen, but an impressive charge for the field today.   
 MARK FOSTER: Yeah, it was a pleasing day for myself, and not just the result, just the way I handled myself really. Not under pressure, just mentally. I kept it the same all the time, probably maybe one or two putts, but a lot to draw on.   
  
  Q. Were you aware of the situation coming into 17?  
 MARK FOSTER: No. Obviously I was pushing, pushing anyway. I got on a run of five birdies yesterday and you feel like if you can get on a run here, you can do it. So I was trying all the way, as everyone is.   
 And so I had a glance at 17 and saw my position there, coming down the last and I was thinking eagle all the way and I'm pretty close again.  
  
  Q. What did you hit in?   
 MARK FOSTER: 4-iron, straight down to ten feet, and I thought just maybe a fraction off and I still got it and just caught the left edge.  
  
  Q. Did you think an eagle is what you needed?  
 MARK FOSTER: I thought an eagle to play any more golf, at least, but a good chance 15 will win to be honest.   
 Yeah, 14, would have been good. But pleased with the week overall.
