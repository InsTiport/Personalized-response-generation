 Q.   So what's your verdict after today's fine round?   
MARK FOSTER:   A game of two halves really.   Conditions were benign for a lot of holes, a lot of chances; or I was giving myself a lot of chances.   And then a swirling wind came from nowhere, and it was a little bit batten down the hatches on the back nine really.   
   
 Q.   You had a little rain to contend with which we didn't see in the forecast.   
MARK FOSTER:   About 30 seconds as we were teeing off on is a 15, as it is, I needed a bit of downwind to reach that hole instead of rain to lengthen it.  
   
 Q.   When you do get the wind up, certainly defends it like it does with most courses.   
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, it was totally different.   I mean, the finish is brutal now, so the last three holes, it's going to be tough.  
   
 Q.   Clearly you're in a nice position on the leaderboard, and you would have seen Espen Kofstad has the lead and he managed to finish in benign conditions, so just shows the difference.   
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, but that's golf, though.   We were sort of joking, that 7.30 time would have been nice this morning.   We were 8.55.   
   
 Q.   Continuation of form from last week?   
MARK FOSTER:   Yeah, that was the plan.   It was a frustrating weekend.   A few things I did well, as well, and tried to practise around that and keep it going really, and so far so good.
