  Q. Overall, how are you feeling about your performance, any thoughts you'd like to share?   
 MIKAEL HOGBERG: The performance was the same that it has been. Just made a few putts and got a couple of lucky breaks out there. I holed a bunker shot and eagled. So I feel good, I feel good. I'm playing well.  
  
  Q. As far as your game, physical, mental, a little bit of both today?   
 MIKAEL HOGBERG: Mentally it was wonderful. Physically, I feel great, just staying patient and just enjoying the moment.  
  
  Q. How are you liking the course out here today?   
 MIKAEL HOGBERG: It's good. It's a good test of golf, and it punishes you if you make mistakes and hit it in the wrong place.   
 Other than that, it's wonderful.  
  
  Q. As far as tomorrow, do you have any plans?   
 MIKAEL HOGBERG: Just the same thing, stay patient and hopefully get some good breaks and make some putts. Just going to enjoy the moment.
