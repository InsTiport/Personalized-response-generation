Q. You played pretty steady today it looks like.  What was the key to that?JENNIFER HAHN: Basically just staying patient was a big factor to that.  Ball-striking wasn't as good as yesterday.  I was kind of crooked off the tee, found myself in the rough a lot hitting punch shots, but I gave myself the best chances to save or get up-and-down for par, so I executed those pretty good today.Q. Would you say your putter kind of saved you today?JENNIFER HAHN: Actually it kind of let me down.  I didn't make as many birdies, and I gave myself a couple of good opportunities, especially on the back nine.  But when I needed to make the par putts, I did.Q. Right now you're projected to be one of the top seeds.  How important is that?JENNIFER HAHN: I think it's important, but anything can happen.  We've seen in the years past that it doesn't guarantee you to win the match.  You've just got to play it as a brand-new round.Q. How do you approach match play differently than stroke play?JENNIFER HAHN: I guess match play I'm just going to still play my game, but match play you're definitely conscious of what the opponent is doing, and I'll play a little more aggressive during match play.Q. Mechanically are you going to change anything up?JENNIFER HAHN: Mechanically, no, nothing.Q. Were you happy with your approach shots these last two days?JENNIFER HAHN: Yeah, really, really happy with the way I've been hitting it.  My irons have been really good, putting has been really good, so I might work on a few tee shots, but other than that, pretty happy.Q. What part of this golf course is best for your game do you think?JENNIFER HAHN: I really think the greens are very true to what we see is what we get, so I'm hitting my lines and they're falling.  I think the greens are very, very good for my game.
