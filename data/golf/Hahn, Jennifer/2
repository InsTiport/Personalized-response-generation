 Q.  So the first nine, even par?  JENNIFER HAHN: Right.   Q.  And then the second nine you turned up the heat.  What happened?  JENNIFER HAHN: Yeah, well, the first nine I got off to a pretty slow start.  I birdied the first hole followed by three bogeys afterwards, so I was 2-over real quick.  And then I started making some birdies around -- I don't even know, like 6 or 7 or something, I made two in a row, so I got it back to even after the turn.  And then I just thought of it as a brand-new opportunity, a brand-new nine, so just stuck to my game plan, hit some good shots, hit it a lot better on the second nine.  My approach shots were better and the putts were dropping.   Q.  You mentioned approach shots and putting.  What part of your game were you most pleased with?  JENNIFER HAHN: Putting, especially on this nine, which was my 18th hole.  I had to punch out from the trees and hit an approach from 107, hit it to about 10 feet and saved that.  That was a big par putt for me to finish my round.   Q.  What did you think of the golf course?  JENNIFER HAHN: Beautiful.  It is absolutely beautiful.  It's in perfect shape.  A lot of credit to the greenskeepers for keeping it in really good shape for us.   Q.  What mindset do you take into tomorrow?  JENNIFER HAHN: Tomorrow, basically like I started the back nine, it's just another round, another opportunity to play on this beautiful course.
