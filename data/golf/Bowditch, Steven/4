Q. First round of 2016, Steven.  Talk about your round a little bit.
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it was good.  I didn't finish off 2015 very well.  Yeah, I had a bit of a break and played nicely.  Just nice off season, I guess, and fresh and ready to go.
Q. Is it hard to -- I know you didn't have a long break since you were down in South Africa, but was it hard to kick the competitive rust off a little bit?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: I guess it is a little bit.  But once you get here and the pro-am comes around, it all falls back into place, I guess.  Yeah, it's something that we obviously do every year, so you sort of get used to it.  You just hope it's okay.  You don't want to come out and be average straight out of the gate.  And it looks like a lot of the guys have still got a lot of form from last year.
Q. Not a bad place though to kick the rust off.  Always good to start here, since it means you had a win the year before.
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah.  This is my second time here and hopefully, I can play a few more before I'm done.  It's a great spot and the weather's perfect and it's just a great spot for family and everyone just to hang out.
