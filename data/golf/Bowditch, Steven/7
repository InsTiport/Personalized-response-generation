 Q.  It was your goal to make the team and you just earned your first-ever point for the Internationals in The Presidents Cup.  What was it like and how would you describe the pressure out there today?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it's something I've never quite experienced before.  It's unreal to be out here with all the teammates and these guys, it's just a great bunch of guys.  To be able to get a point out there and play nicely; it was an unbelievable experience.  But we've got a long way to go.  We've got to go out there and cheer the rest of the guys home, and we're right in this.  It's going to be close.   
 Q.  Were you nervous or did you feel comfortable?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: I was pretty nervous, absolutely.  This is a big deal and we've come out here, we've got to play well today, absolutely.  We're doing that right now, and we just have a couple guys out here that we need to kick home.  This is getting real close.   
I feel like actually 18 has hurt us these last couple of days, and obviously you never want to play the 18th, but hopefully a few guys are going to start come down, so hopefully we can keep this on.   
 Q.  How has the experience been?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Unbelievable.  I will never forget the feelings I just had down the last hole.  It was quite a feeling.
