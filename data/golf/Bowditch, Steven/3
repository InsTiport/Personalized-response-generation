Q. You're even par coming to the 8th hole and then something seemed to click.  You birdied five straight holes there.  Did anything change during the round?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: No, not really.  I was playing -- I knew I was playing okay, hitting it sort of where I wanted to hit it.  And a few putts dropped in.  And there was definitely some scoring holes out here and you can sort of use the contours a little bit and sort of get away with a few as well and just made a couple putts.  Didn't finish the way I wanted to.  But all in all it was a good day.
Q. Do you feel like this course, you've been here a couple times now, do you feel like this course is set up for somebody coming from behind after 36 holes, five or six back?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Well, the couple years I've played, last year there was Kirk shot 11-under or 10-under, Jason shot 10 or 11-under the last day and just the scores that everyone's shooting around here, you can definitely get it going and if you get off to a good start, there's a few to be holed early and if you come out of the gates like that you can shoot a really good score.
Q. Your mentality heading into the next 36?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: I don't know.  I don't even -- Jordan is world No. 1 and obviously playing great again, so obviously to go out there and attack him, see what happens.  Just hopefully catch fire a little bit like I did today and then again I'll have to do that for another stretch off of 13 or 14 holes on the weekend.
