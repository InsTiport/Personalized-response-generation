Q. 2-under round of 68 for you today.  Four birdies, two bogeys.  Before we talk about the round, congratulations on being here.  It was a big box to tick for you, wasn't it?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it was.  It's a great feeling to be able to get here.  It was one of the big goals this year and nice to be able to do it.  There was a few nerve-wracking times last week but great to be here.
Q. It means all four Majors next year for the first time in your career?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: That will be great.  I only played a couple.  So to be able to set the schedule a little bit.  And I guess aim for trying to play well in those ones would be great.
Q. And roll the Presidents Cup into it that, big double?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it is.  It's going to be a privilege and an honor to be able to play for the international team and obviously, to be led by Jason the way he's playing.  It's a great opportunity, not an opportunity, but it's -- I can't wait to get out there and really see if we can give the U.S. a good run this year.
Q. Let's talk about your round today.  2-under.  It's a tough course, isn't it.
STEVEN BOWDITCH: It's tough.  Yeah.  There's not much room for error.  I guess that's what you get when you get to the last round of the playoffs.  Some of the guys out there are playing really well, but par's actually a pretty good score out here, not being many par-5s, there's not a lot of opportunities, so when you get them, you got to take them.
Q. And the greens?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Fast.  They're real fast right now.  You get some down grain, down breeze putts, and they're as fast as you can handle.
