 Q.   What a great finish.   Take me through the eagle to begin with.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   I hit a pretty good drive down the left side and hit a nice 4‑iron up there to 35 feet, and all weekend I've been putting pretty good, and I saw the line on that one and it went in, so that was nice.  
   
 Q.   That was at the 16th hole.   Then at the 18th hole your drive wasn't more than a yard or two after the fairway, just got a bird's nest lie, and you had to lay up, and then a nice approach and you canned the birdie.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it was nice.   I really wanted that drive on the fairway and wanted to have a shot for eagle, but it still ended up good and left myself a nice 10‑footer, and lucky enough to make it.  
   
 Q.   You've been a little quiet since winning the Valero Texas Open, but this is a great start to the year.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it's nice.   It doesn't feel like the year has ended quite, but it's nice to get off to a good start for the FedExCup for 2015.  
   
 Q.   Did the course firm up at all?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it started to today, it definitely did.   The ball was going a long way, and the air got a little thinner.   It was really traveling out there, and you had to make some adjustments today.   
   
 Q.   What was the key to your round today?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   I putted good all week.   That was really about it.  
   
 Q.   You had to withdraw last year from the Frys.   Much better result here this week, get the season off to a great start.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it does.   It's round 1, and it's nice to come out of the gates and just makes Christmas a bit easier straight away.
