 Q.   Nice round today.   Kind of got started early, and rolled through the front nine nicely?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, I got off to a reasonable start, I guess.   Easy twoâ€‘putt on 2, and then made a pretty soft bogey on number 3, but then I started to play well.   I had three or four holes there where I hardly even had to line up a putt.   I hit it close there.   Hit a great shot into 10, so that really sort of kick started it all.  
   
 Q.   What does that stretch do for you now?   Is there a lot of confidence going through the back nine then?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, a little bit.   It's one of those things that it's golf.   You want to try to roll with the good and stop the bad as quick as you can.   I was sort of rolling with it, and whatever came about, came about.  
   
 Q.   You're right there for the lead.   Is that important on day one?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, I mean, you can't win it on the first there, but you can definitely lose it.   It's a long, long, long way to go.   Especially being in Zach's playground, basically it's been for quite some time, so we just go out there and keep trying to hit it on the fairway and on the greens.  
   
 Q.   What was worst today out there, the bugs and swatting those or the rough?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   I think they're both pretty similar.   Yeah, the rough's up a bit, and it's in great shape though.   It's the best I've seen it since I've been here.
