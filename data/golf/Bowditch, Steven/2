STEVEN BOWDITCH: It's a little different golf course, but the scores are obviously still out there, with the boys still going low, so, all in all it was a good finish.  I'll take it.
Q. You'll probably be well back of Jordan going into Sunday but what do you focus on tomorrow in the final round?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, obviously he's playing unbelievable and he's too far ahead, you just got to go out and play your own game.  You try and get aggressive, and try and finish up the leaderboard as much as you can.
