  STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it was all right.  Yeah, I played pretty good.  I actually played just like I've been playing the last few days, and yeah, just didn't make any putts again.  I hit it a little closer today earlier and made a few I felt like I should have nearly birdied every hole there for a lot of the front nine.  And then from there, I just -- I don't know.  It was good.  It was fine.  Happy with it.   Q.  The bogey was really unfortunate given it was so close to going in.  It stunted your momentum a little bit, didn't it?  STEVEN BOWDITCH: Not really, no.  I mean, it is what it is.  It's golf.  It's out of mind.  Lapse in concentration there, and should have backed away and didn't.  I hit two fat 3-woods today out of nowhere, so it is what it is.   Q.  With all that said, you're in contention at a major going into the final round.  You must be obviously excited for tomorrow?  STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah.  It's great to be here.  Any other golf tournament, it's nice to have a shot on Sunday.  It's a great spot to be able to maybe go out and shoot a real low one.  Obviously I'm going to need a real low one.  I haven't seen the weather, but yeah, excited.   Q.  It feels like it's in you, that low one?  STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, I mean, I don't -- I feel like this is about the worst spot I could be right now for my week.   Q.  That's what I mean.  But saying that, you legitimately have a shot.  What would that mean to you if you could get it done?  STEVEN BOWDITCH: Oh, I don't know.  I haven't even thought about that.  I'm just trying to go out and play Sunday golf on Monday and see what happens.
