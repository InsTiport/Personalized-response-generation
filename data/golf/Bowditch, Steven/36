  Q. Just kind of talk about what went well out there today.  
 STEVEN BOWDITCH: I don't know whether much went well. It just didn't go bad. I just hit it in -- missed a few fairways early and just scrambled around.   
 My short game is pretty good at the minute, and putting, I'm not putting great, but I'm not putting bad either. So making a couple here and there and putting well inside six feet.  
  
  Q. What's your thoughts on the greens? I heard you tell Golf Channel you thought they were about the fastest this year.  
 STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah. I thought they were unbelievable. Especially this time of year, they're as quick as they get, I think. I don't know that they can make them that much quicker without being unplayable if this wind gets up. But they're perfect.  
  
  Q. And you know where you're at on the Money List. What's your thoughts going into tomorrow?  
 STEVEN BOWDITCH: Nothing. I just gotta go out and play golf. That's all I can do. Just try and make putts, hit greens and make putts and whatever happens happens.   
  
  Q. Thanks.
