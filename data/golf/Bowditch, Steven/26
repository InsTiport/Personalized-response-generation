 Q.   If you could just talk a little bit about your round today, what was working the best for you.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   I didn't drive it so good today.   Yesterday I drove it good.   Today was a little bit scrappy early on, but fought through it and made a few putts here and there and just all in all it was a pretty good round.  
   
 Q.   Did you feel the course played pretty similar Thursday to Friday?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, the wind started to really get up there today, so it made for a‑‑ it started to get really difficult out there at times, but a few of the pins were in generous spots, so you could still get at them even though the wind was out.  
   
 Q.   Any particular club or part of your game that worked really well today?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   No, not really.   It was all‑‑ made some putts, missed some putts, yeah.   It's just golf, so hopefully I can just go out there and hit some more fairways and make some more putts.  
   
 Q.   Your thoughts going into the weekend, a little rain forecast for Saturday but two more rounds to go?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, obviously the weather coming in is going to change the golf course a little bit.   The rough will be wet, so it'll put a lot more emphasis on hitting fairways.   But the greens will be softer, so you can sort of start attacking a few more pins.
