 Q.  They got out of the gate early --  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, a little bit.  Marc played great.  I was on and off.  You know, we gave it a good shot.  They just plain and simple played better than us.  Just it's golf.  To be honest, the par 5s are really what got us.  We birdied one of the par 5s between us.  In fourball, it's not acceptable.  You just can't do it.  You're behind the 8-ball by doing that.   
When it all comes down to it, it's the par 5s, which is really -- that's on me.  The par 5s is where I should do well and I just didn't do it today and that's on me.   
 Q.  All in all, a better-looking score?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We all did great today.  The team all pulled together and had an awesome day.  We're definitely back in the mix now, and big day tomorrow with some bad weather and yeah, 36 holes, be exciting to get out there and try and get some more points on the board.   
 Q.  Do you know what you're going to be doing tomorrow?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH: No, we didn't spoke about it yet.
