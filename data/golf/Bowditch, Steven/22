 Q.   Steve, seemed like things kicked in gear.   How did you feel as things progressed?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah.   I didn't putt anywhere near as well as I did yesterday.   I missed a lot of putts today.   Made a lot of soft bogies.   But started to make a few, few -- last few holes there, so it was nice I finished like that.  
   
 Q.   It's a great finish.   How do you feel going into tomorrow?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, I mean actually hit the ball a little bit better today and just didn't putt near as well.   Actually the weekend, they can both come together.  
   
 Q.   You glad to get finished with play today?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, with storms everything tonight, apparently.   Looks like it's going to be a nice, warm one tomorrow afternoon.
