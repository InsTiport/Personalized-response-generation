Q. Just assess your week if you can.
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it ended up being a lot harder than what I thought it was going to be.  Yesterday I shot 4-over, and sort of out of nowhere, just got me in a bad position, and today there was a little more pressure on me.  I'm not sure if it's going to be enough.  Hopefully it will be.  Yeah, all in all, it's been a great year, either way.  Hopefully I get one more week, but we'll see.
Q. Assuming you do make it, what would that mean to you to make it to the season finale?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: Yeah, it would be -- it's a big goal of I think everyone's.  It just verifies that you've had a good year and you've played well consistently.  You know, to go there for the first time and experience the TOUR Championship, hopefully will be a great feeling.
Q. Do you know much about East Lake or how it may suit your game?
STEVEN BOWDITCH: No, I've never seen it.  Never really watched it.
