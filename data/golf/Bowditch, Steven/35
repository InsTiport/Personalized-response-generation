 Q.   Looking at your scorecard, I look at a lot of marks down there, lot of birdies, and a few bogeys thrown in?  
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it's sort of typically the way I play at the moment.   It's been getting better.   It's just still inconsistent.   I didn't hit the ball all that great today, but just managed to miss it in the right places a lot of time and get it up‑and‑down.   I'm happy in the end with 69.  
   
 Q.   I thought your putting stroke looked beautiful.   You knew several putts ere in as soon as they left the blade.   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Yeah, it's a nice feeling.   These greens are perfect.   There are no excuses out there.   Just read them good and hoping they'll go in.  
   
 Q.   Your year has been a little up‑and‑down; how do you approach the weekend?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   Just go out and keep playing golf.   I've never really been in this position, being in the lead by the end of the day.   
The course is perfect, and the wind doesn't look like it's going to get up too much.   Just go out there and play golf, and whatever happens, happens.  
   
 Q.   Just talk about your round today and being on top of the board right now?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   It wasn't too bad.   It was a bit scratchy and a bit up‑and‑down, but that's the way the year has been going at the moment.   Hopefully, I can just go there and keep making some putts and see what happens on the weekend.  
   
 Q.   How is the course looking right now?   
STEVEN BOWDITCH:   The course is great.   The best I've seen it.   They've made a few changes to the greens.   The course is awesome.   The greens are great, yeah.
