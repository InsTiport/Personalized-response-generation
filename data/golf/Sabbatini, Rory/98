  Q.  You beat David Howell.  Great match.  Just talk about what you did.   
 RORY SABBATINI:  You know, it really was.  It was a great match.  It was just a tough round for both of us.  He wasn't particularly hitting the ball very well, and I put myself in the wrong positions early.  So I gave him a nice start through eight holes.   
 You know, just managed to battle it back and put a little bit of pressure on him coming down the end there and just had to try and do that to try and make him struggle with his ball-striking a little bit more.   
  
  Q.  Did you have a turning point that you got back in the game and kind of --   
 RORY SABBATINI:  I was 3 down through 5 and I had to kind of readjust my thinking out there and play more conservatively.  We halved the rest of the holes through 8, and then No. 9 was where I won my first hole.   
 I won 9 and 10.  That's the thing on this course, if you can keep within one or two on this course, you're fine.  If you get too far down, with these pins it's just too hard to make birdies.
