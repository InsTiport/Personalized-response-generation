Q.  How do you assess the situation, at 21 and 24 leading?

TREVOR IMMELMAN:  Yeah, we are right in there, and foursomes will be interesting.  A guy shot low yesterday.  You know, nothing else really played different, but the wind changed.  Maybe that will happen tomorrow.  We are right there in it.  I think Rory is playing good. I feel like I just have to find my form and we'll have a good chance.
Q.  Slightly different from last year in that you had such a substantial lead.

RORY SABBATINI:  Obviously, you know, it's a new year and a new situation.  You know, Sergio and JimÃ ©nez are playing great.  They played solid and they put themselves in a good position.  I think where we are is suitable to us.

I think tomorrow might be a good day for us to come out and come behind.  It's been proven in.
Q.  How do you feel you have to approach tomorrow, do you have to be more aggressive?

TREVOR IMMELMAN:  I think we have to just go out there and play our game, because we know if we play our game like yesterday, we've got a low one in us.  And if we shoot another 64 tomorrow or whatever we shot, 65, you know, I think we'll have a really good chance of winning.  We've just got to really play and see how it's going.  And if we're behind down the stretch, then we've just got to push.  We've got to go out there and try to win.
