Q.   Rory Sabbatini, 3‑under 67 for 9‑under.   Good Saturday, I guess?
RORY SABBATINI:   Yeah.   You know, all things considered, went out there and gave myself a few opportunities, and that's what you want to do.

Q.   I hate to bring it up, but it seemed like it was a frustrating one on the FedEx on the back side there. 
RORY SABBATINI:   You know, it is what it is.   I had some bad shots and I made some good par saves.   But I had some good shots in there and I didn't get rewarded, but that's going to happen. 
It's golf, and just gotta go out there tomorrow and hopefully tomorrow it will work its way out early.

Q.   You put the ball in position the whole Back nine.   Anywhere I saw you you were giving yourself fantastic opportunities.   You must feel good with your ball swing right now. 
RORY SABBATINI:   Actually my swing probably feels as good as it ever has.   We've done a lot of work this year and I'm trying to make that more consistent, and it's been getting better each week and been more and more consistent each week.   And that's what's fun about it, you're kind of getting where you want to.
Again, go out tomorrow, it's a new day, going to go out there and obviously going to have to go out and put a nice score up there to have an opportunity and hopefully things will work out.
