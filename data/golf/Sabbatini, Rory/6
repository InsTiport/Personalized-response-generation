Q. Rory, a beautiful 67 capped off by that great birdie on the 18th hole.  Tell me about your day.
RORY SABBATINI: Little tale of two 9s.  Never really got off to the start I wanted.  Felt like I was kind of grinding, kind of struggling through and I hit a -- give my caddie the range and tell me what to do out there.  Just kind of break the cycle of where I stood.
Q. You could have had 5 birdies in a row, that birdie putt at 17, just a little bit --
RORY SABBATINI: Yeah.  I'll take what I got.  You know what, the way the round started to come back on the back-9 and get nice back in position that was key and I got a long day tomorrow.  Got to grind it out.
Q. Absolutely.  You need to be back in the Tour Championship.  It's been a few years.
Been a few years since you've been healthy.  But you played beautiful golf all year long.  What's your thoughts because you need another solid round to get to Atlanta?
RORY SABBATINI: Exactly.  I kind of had a target in mind and I'm a couple shots shy of getting there and so tomorrow I got to go grind it out and really put my foot down and play well tomorrow.
