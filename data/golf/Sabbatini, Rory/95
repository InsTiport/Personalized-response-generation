 Q.  Just talk about strange it was not to see Mr. Nelson sitting at the 18th today. 
 RORY SABBATINI:  Obviously very strange.  You know, it's sad, he was a great man.  Not enough can be said about him.  Obviously he's dearly missed. 
 But luckily we got to see his wife Peggy this morning on the first tee.  It kind of gave us a little bit of the old feelings of seeing Byron there. 

 Q.  You talked about yesterday how you needed to post a low score to give yourself a chance.  Seemed like you pretty much did your part. 
 RORY SABBATINI:  Yeah, I wasn't figuring I needed to shoot 50-something, but I guess that was the situation.  I wasn't quite prepared to come in this morning and go shoot 55 or something like that.  But I played solid.  I've got no complaints. 

 Q.  Did you feel like you left a few out there on the front nine? 
 RORY SABBATINI:  Yeah, you can always look at that.  I very easily could have shot in the 50s today.  But it didn't happen, and that's the way it is.
