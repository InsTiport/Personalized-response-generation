 Q.  You really lit it up coming home; 5-under par on your inward nine.  
RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, it was a nice way to finish the round; nice positive trend there.  Yeah, played good all day.  Just didn't quite get anything going the front nine.   
Hit a lot of good shots, a lot of good opportunities, just couldn't take advantage of them.   
It was a tough day today.  Knew we had to be patient.   
 Q.  And patient, you hit 16 of 18 greens.  Outstanding two-for-two in scrambling.  
RORY SABBATINI: Well thank you.  No, it's always good to get off to a bogey-free round to start the season.  Any time you can have a bogey-free round it's a good thing out here.   
 Q.  Tell me the truth:  When you got up this morning, when you came to the golf course, were you expecting to play golf?  
RORY SABBATINI: Well, actually, I woke up and I got a text from the PGA TOUR saying, We're going as scheduled.  I was like, Uh, okay.  No, you know what?  All things considered, we actually had very reasonable conditions.  It was pretty mild so wasn't too bad.   
As I said, just one of those days.  A little frustrating with the rain on and off and just had to be patient.
