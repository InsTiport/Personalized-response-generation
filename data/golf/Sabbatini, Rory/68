   MIKE GREEN: Rory Sabbatini, 66, 6‑under par, must feel good to go through your round the way you did today. 
 RORY SABBATINI: The wind, it was out early and died off. All things considered, it's a great day out there. The course is in great condition and really prepared nicely and set up nicely. There are some low scores out there if you can control the golf ball.
 MIKE GREEN: And three birdies on each of the nines, take us through them. 
 RORY SABBATINI: 11th, driver in the fairway, and then a sand wedge from about 95 yards to about eight feet and made the putt. 
 14, driver outside of the fairway, short of the bunker, hit a 9‑iron 38 yards to about three feet. 
 18, driver, left side of the fairway, 3‑wood up just in front of the green‑side bunker and chipped it to about three feet there. 
 No. 3, the par 5, drove it left side of the fairway on No. 3, hit a 3‑wood up just short of the green and chipped to about ten feet short of the hole and made the putt. 
 5, then hit just left of the tree and hit a 4‑iron about 20 feet behind the hole and 2‑putted. 
 6, 3‑wood off the tee, right side of the fairway, hit a 60‑degree wedge from about 54 yards to the hole and I hit it to about six feet. Made that putt. 

 Q. Was your putter working? 
 RORY SABBATINI: It's not that it hasn't been working. It seems like I've been putting great. It's just been a situation where it has not quite resulted in the ball going in the hole. 
 With my wife being on the bag this week, and me being a little more patient, I know she'll give me a harder time than my caddie, so I think just maybe that's the key, just kind of taking a step back and kind of letting the putts go in instead of trying to force them in. 

 Q. Are you trying to make life easy for her on the course ‑‑
RORY SABBATINI: I'm trying to make it easier for her, because I know if I don't make life easy for her on the golf course, she's not going to make it easy for me off the golf course; and the golf course is a short period of time (laughter). 

 Q. You've been in the country three weeks, your longest run for a while. 
 RORY SABBATINI: Actually it's been five weeks in a row for me because I played two weeks in a row in China before the Nedbank. 
 I'm feeling good. Nedbank was a relaxing week and Leopard Creek, it's hard not to feel relaxed with that scenery. Yeah, I'm feeling good. I'm looking forward to having a little time off after this, and get ready for some cold weather back at home.

 Q. You're not going to go to KwaZulu Natal ‑‑
 RORY SABBATINI: No, unfortunately. I'm going back to Texas. I've got six days home and then I won't see my house until March, so I need to visit it sometime. 

 Q. With The European Tour events at the end of the season, will you be joining the Tour for The Race to Dubai?
 RORY SABBATINI: Yes, I have. I have joined The European Tour. 
 MIKE GREEN: Thank you very much.
