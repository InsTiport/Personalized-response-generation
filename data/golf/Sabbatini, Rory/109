Q.  Conditions, and what did you do best?
RORY SABBATINI:  You know, the conditions of the course are obviously getting tougher.  The greens are getting a little faster and a little firmer.  You know, it's definitely going to get tougher as the week goes on.  You know, it's the same thing, put the ball in the fairways, put them on the greens and make some putts.  That's the ultimate challenge, make being some putts out there.
Q.  You talked about a lack of expectations coming in yesterday.  Now you've reached the weekend, you're right in the thick of it.  Has that changed?
RORY SABBATINI:  No, it doesn't change.  I went out there and tried to have some fun and I'll try and remain relaxed out there.  You know, I managed to do that.  Obviously today I hit a lot more bad golf shots than I did yesterday.  It's a lot easier to play well when you've kind of got a bit of a head start in a sense with your scoring.  That was definitely easier for me to maintain my composure out there.
Q.  It's still early obviously, but Phil has a pretty big cushion at four shots.  How formidable is that kind of lead with the course in the shape the way it's playing?
RORY SABBATINI:  Well, on this golf course I think that's only one hole (laughter).  It just takes one hole to bite you back and you can easily give up three or four shots in a hurry.  I think he eagled 18 and then double bogeyed 1.  That's the thing, the course can give and receive as quickly as the blink of an eye, so you've just got to go out there and continue doing what you're doing and try and remain steady out there.  If you don't make any big numbers you're going to keep yourself in position.
Q.  How would you assess your play in your previous 16 majors you've played in?
RORY SABBATINI:  Poor.  Yeah, there's not much more to say, poor.
