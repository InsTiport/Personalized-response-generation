 Q.  Rory, what a nice round of golf; 2 under par, 5 of 6 scrambling out there. You were able to control the golf ball enough to get it up and down.  
RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, you know, pars out there are a premium today. This could be one of the worst wind I've ever played on the PGA TOUR, so it's something.   
Like I said, thank goodness the greens are receptive, because outside it would really be a wild day out there.   
 Q.  Are you just mentally exhausted when you walk off the golf course on a day like this? There is just so much concentration and calculation that go into every shot.  
RORY SABBATINI: Exactly. You know, there are in gimmes out there. Even the one-footer. You got to grind them out, because the wind is gusting and it's shifting directions ever so slightly and it makes it tough.   
 Q.  Tell me about that drive you hit on 18.  
RORY SABBATINI: That was a good one. You know, very rare that you get to hit that fairway, so I was pretty happy to see it in the fairway and put myself in good position. No, swing the club well and making good solid contact out there, and that's key in the wind.   
 Q.  You came into this tournament with a little bit of momentum from your victory. Did that momentum carry over? Did you have good thought process this week?  
RORY SABBATINI: Oh, for sure. You know, unfortunately for me I did what I do every off-season: I finished the Shootout and put the clubs away and didn't bring them out until I got here.   
Mentally and physically I try to give myself a little bit of time off.
