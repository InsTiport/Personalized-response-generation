  Q. Excellent round of golf today, 6-under par. Talk to us about it, please.   
 RORY SABBATINI: Well, the putter got hot early today. Obviously as good as these greens are, if you're putting well, it makes it awfully easy with the conditions of the golf course.  
  
  Q. For the groups that are going out this afternoon, could you give us some insight into what they're going to be facing as the day progresses? Greens you said are pretty good now?  
 RORY SABBATINI: You know, we were actually fortunate this morning. The wind stayed fairly calm, it was very light, and it was a little changing in directions, but other than that it was great. But it looks like the wind is picking up, so the course will probably dry out a little bit. But the course is in fantastic shape. They've set it up very fairly today, and if you hit the shots in the right positions out there, you can definitely be aggressive.  
  
  Q. Of course the news of Seve Ballesteros passing away, golf certainly is a sport that embraces its heroes; it's a sad day for golf all over the world.   
 RORY SABBATINI: Definitely. You know, obviously one of the most charismatic and entertaining golfers to watch, and you know, it's obviously very sad. Obviously our hearts go out to his family and to his friends. But you know what, he represented Spain in a fantastic fashion, and look at the wealth of superstars that he's brought forth after him.
