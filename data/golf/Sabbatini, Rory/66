   RORY SABBATINI: I played nicely. You know, got my work cut out for me tomorrow, but the way Phil played today was amazing. Can't expect him to fall, so you have to go out there and be prepared to play well. 
 This is one of those courses that it sets up for me. This course, you know where you can hit and where you can't and you just have to go from there. 

 Q. Your thoughts on chasing Phil? It looks like he's distancing himself. 
 RORY SABBATINI: Phil did all of the right things today. He hit a lot of good drivers when he needed to, and hit a lot of good iron shots and gave himself a lot of great looks at birdies. We know what a great putter he is and capitalizing on the birdie opportunities.
 The scary things is he could have gone even more lower out there. The situation being, he's playing great, and you know, we just have to keep trying to put some pressure on him. This golf course has been known to make people do some silly things out there, and we'll just see what happens.
