Q.   All right.   Obviously in tough conditions you found something that worked this morning.
RORY SABBATINI:   Yeah.   You know, it was not pretty, that's for sure but, you know, on days like today, you know, good golf doesn't always get rewarded. 
You got to find a way to get the ball in the hole.   I managed to do that.   It was a tough day but, you know, I managed to just scrap it around and get the ball in the hole.

Q.   You say "scrap it around", but what was going well that was working for you today?
RORY SABBATINI:   You know, for the most part, I just kept myself in the ballgame with my short game.   I didn't strike the ball particularly well today and in these conditions you have to accept that you're going to make a lost of mistakes out there and I did and I was very fortunate that I managed to get myself around the greens and get from there in the hole with success.

Q.   As you're finishing here, just in the last ten minutes, it seems like the wind has died down a lot.   Just what are your thoughts in the afternoon, the luck of the draw?
RORY SABBATINI:   It's the luck of the draw.   The thing is, you know, the wind is going to be doing that all day.   They said it's going to be gusting. 
That's what makes it tough out there, you never know when the gust is going to come up and they are changing directions slightly so it's definitely making it play tough.
