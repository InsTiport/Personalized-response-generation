  Q. Rory, nicely played, 4-under in this opening round, and you're playing with the leader, Paul Casey. You guys had a nice little game on a perfect day.   
 RORY SABBATINI: We had a lot of fun. We had a good time out there. It was hard to keep my concentration playing with Paul. He's a distraction. But other than that, it was pretty good. I think he probably cost me three or four shots (laughter).  
  
  Q. 10th week in a row; have you ever done that?   
 RORY SABBATINI: No, this is definitely the first time in my career on TOUR that I've done that. I think my rookie year, if I had the opportunity, I probably would have done it. But this is the first time I've ever done that, so all in all, the body is holding up; the brain is holding up. That was the bigger question; how would my nerves be ten weeks on the road.  
  
  Q. Everyone talks about the golf course here. If you were to rank the golf course, where would you put it?   
 RORY SABBATINI: You know, I'd say right now it's a fantastic golf course. I think if they made some small changes to it, maybe made the greens a little smaller, did a little different bunkering around the greens, it could be one of the best of all time.   
 But right now it's a fantastic golf course. I'd say it's definitely in the top quarter.
