  Q. Big support these two tournaments for you?   
 RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, it's great. It's great to have two events in Dallas/Ft. Worth here and obviously two great events, and it's definitely fun out there and have a bunch of support.   
  
  Q. Where is your game at this point?   
 RORY SABBATINI: I've been playing well, honestly, unfortunately the last week the rounds have been strange. I just really never got anything going today, didn't get anything good going out there, so I have some work to do. If it's any constellation, my short game baled me out a few times and helped me pick up a few shots, that's the good part.   
  
  Q. Birdies at 7 and 8, talk about those holes.   
 RORY SABBATINI: Drove in the fairway on 7 and hit an awful 3-wood short of the green and had to have a good chip there to get it to about 3 feet and made birdie.   
 Then I had a good drive in the middle of the fairway and hit a pitching wedge to about 10 feet from the hole and made my longest putt of the day there.   
  
  Q. Is there a comfort level for you with this course?   
 RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, you know, I know my way around the course really well. I've figured out the most effective way to get around it. It's just a matter of executing the shots. I'm -- I definitely know where you can't hit it on this golf course.   
  
  Q. Thank you, Rory.   
 RORY SABBATINI: Sure.
