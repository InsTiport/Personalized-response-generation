  Q.  Tough conditions today.  How did you do that?   
 RORY SABBATINI:  I made a lot of putts.  You know, I hit every fairway but one.  When you put the ball in the fairway, put it on the green, make putts, good things happen sometimes.   
  
  Q.  How different did the course play today than you saw the rest of the week?   
 RORY SABBATINI:  Obviously they played a couple tees up because of the expectation of some weather coming in.  The course played tough.  There's some holes on the back nine that are playing pretty difficult even though they're downwind.  It's soft and it makes it tough to get to the pins.   
  
  Q.  Tiger, come on, how?   
 RORY SABBATINI:  He's playing well, you know?  He came in here prepared and he's played consistently every day, and obviously he's kind of been on cruise control today, and when he's on cruise control it's almost impossible to get him.   
  
  Q.  You had a great day today.  Have a great rest of the year.   
 RORY SABBATINI:  Appreciate it.
