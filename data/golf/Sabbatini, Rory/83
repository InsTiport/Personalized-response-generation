  Q.  You guys looked like you should have been in the playoff for the real tournament.  That was kind of a strange thing to watch today.   
 RORY SABBATINI:  Obviously Tiger played exceptional golf out there.  Every time he got in trouble, he made some miraculous shots.  I was not very happy with the way I played out there today.  I made a lot of mental errors, and I just put myself in some bad positions.   
  
  Q.  You're not afraid to say what you think.  You've put yourself in this position before and finished tied for second.  It's a lot of FedExCup points, a lot of money, but obviously you wanted to win.   
 RORY SABBATINI:  You know, it's been a good year for me, but still, the situation is I put myself in good position a couple times, and it's been frustrating the fact that I haven't got it done with all the chances I've had.   
  
  Q.  Well, you'll be in the PGA Championship next week.  Best of luck.   
 RORY SABBATINI:  Looking forward to it.
