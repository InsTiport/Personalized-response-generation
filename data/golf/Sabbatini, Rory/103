Q.  Talk a little bit about your round today, Rory.
RORY SABBATINI:  I mean, patchy, didn't drive the ball that well today, struggled a little bit with my driving, but hit more greens today than I did yesterday.  It's just one of those days where I couldn't buy a putt.

You know, all things considered, the way I drove the ball, not being able to make the putt, I didn't handle myself too badly out there.
Q.  That little rain that we got, did that change the course at all for you, affect the greens at all?
RORY SABBATINI:  It kind of slowed the greens down just for a period out there, but obviously that wore off.  The greens never really seemed to pick up the pace again.
Q.  Do you think that's the reason for the putting?
RORY SABBATINI:  I putted nice today, just for some reason I wasn't seeing the lines as well as I was yesterday.  I hit a lot of good putts and was burning the edge all day long, just unfortunately couldn't get any to go in.
Q.  Going into the weekend you have to be pleased?
RORY SABBATINI:  Yeah, as I said, I didn't handle myself too badly out there today.  I'm still in it going into the weekend.  Hopefully I got my bad round out of the way and I'll put two good ones together on the weekend and see what happens.
