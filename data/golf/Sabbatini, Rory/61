 Q. Yesterday we talked about hitting fairways. You missed about eight of those. You had three putts lip out. You had a spike mark bother you. You had all things go wrong, and you shot 1-under par. 
 RORY SABBATINI: I was actually striking the ball nicely when I made the turn. It was a tale of three greens, two nines. The greens on my back nine, there were a few people out there that didn't lift their feet, so they were doing a pretty good job marking them up, and it makes it hard to play golf when conditions are increasingly difficult.

 Q. One of the difficulties on this course that you had to deal with at 7 was the grass faces on the bunkers. They're catching a lot of balls which normally roll into the bunker and give you a decent shot. Your shot at 7 was amazing. 
 RORY SABBATINI: Thank you. It is. They've obviously made the bunkers a lot more of a penalty, so being around there makes it even worse. 
 You know, a lot of golf left, and I need to get back to where I was doing yesterday, put the ball in the fairways, put it on the greens, make some putts.

 Q. A little bit of scrambling today, but you feel like you're in good shape for the weekend?
 RORY SABBATINI: Obviously I'm still in contention. I'm still hitting the ball well, just lost some brain cells out there today. The brain was a little haywire for a few holes and I needed to recorrect things and just get myself back, and I managed to do that coming down the final stretch there. Just unfortunately not able to capitalize on some good birdie opportunities today.
