   RORY SABBATINI:  Had two closing birdies but the start to the back nine was a letdown.  I made too many mistakes and basically played myself too far back.   
  
  Q.  It became very difficult to hole any putts over 14, 15 feet?   
 RORY SABBATINI:  Yeah, they are difficult, faster today than they have been all week.  That's how tournament golf is on the weekends.  I tee off late, you get to play behind everyone that's in front of you.   
 You know what to expect.  You know the situation.  Just put the ball close to the hole.
