 Q.  Rory, good day today.  Obviously I know you're a little disappointed about 18.  But, overall, you know, got a shot.  
RORY SABBATINI: You know, I'm not that disappointed about 18.  18 is not an easy hole today but, you know, you obviously -- I would have liked to have made a birdie to give myself an opportunity but at the end of the day, you know, I don't think you're ever going to really turn your nose up at a par on that hole.   
 Q.  Talk about your week in general here at the Wyndham Championship.  I guess before the start of the day you knew you had to shoot 6, 7-under to kind of get in the conversation.  
RORY SABBATINI: Exactly.  Obviously I figured that at the end of the week, around 20-under was going to be the score that you needed to really be a certainty to make it into next week.   
So, that was kind of my goal all week trying to push towards the 20-under number.  No, I played good.  I've been playing good the last couple weeks, last couple months.  Just threw fortune at the wind and changed my putting grip going into Thursday's round.   
 Q.  Are you happy with it?  
RORY SABBATINI: Went from a traditional grip to a pencil grip.  Putted all week.  Very happy.  It's been better than my performance has been over the last year or so.   
 Q.  (Inaudible)?  
RORY SABBATINI: I put a lot of work in.  It's been a tough year.  Coming out of the Web category you never know if you're going to be in an event, not be in an event.  You can't really make your schedule.  Makes it difficult to really get comfortable.   
So, the last two months have been a grind.  I've worked hard, improved my ball-striking significantly and this week obviously I knew I was going to have to improve my putting and was very happy about that.
