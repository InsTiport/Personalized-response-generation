 Q.  How was the course playing today in comparison to yesterday?  
RORY SABBATINI: Obviously with the cooler temperatures and the mist this morning, might have played longer, but then obviously it's starting to warm up a little bit.  So winds also started to pick up.   
But it's playing tough.  You definitely have to hit in the fairways, you definitely have to hit greens; otherwise, you're going to have a long day out there.   
 Q.  And I heard you're a little surprised that the cut is where it is now.  Can you talk about kind of where you think that will end up.  And I know you finished strong as well with a couple of birdies over your last five or six holes.  
RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, well, you know, it's just -- you know, with yesterday's conditions, there was no wind, there was perfect score conditions out there.  And this morning we didn't quite have the same benefit.  So there's been a little bit of difference.  But obviously this afternoon the course is going to get tougher.  The wind is going to pick up a little bit.  And that's traditionally what it does here.   
But it's tough out there.  You've got to hit quality golf shots and you've got to hit good putts.  It's a matter of being patient out there.   
 Q.  Can you describe those last two birdies, what happened?  
RORY SABBATINI: Oh, No. 4 I hit driver off the tee and put it right up about five yards off the front edge of the green right in the middle there and chipped it up to about three feet and made the putt for birdie.   
And then on 6 I hit driver off the tee in the fairway, hit a 4-iron from about 230, front of the green and two-putted that one.
