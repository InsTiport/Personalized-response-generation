  Q.  Can you talk about the course conditions?   

 RORY SABBATINI:  They were really good.  I thought the course played fair, considering all the factors.   

 I played well.  I made a couple of mistakes and I wasn't feeling too well.  I woke up with a kink in my neck, but all things considered, I'm happy.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the course.   

 RORY SABBATINI:  You have to be very creative because that is what this course requires.   
  
  Q.  Regarding the first hole-in-one of his professional career in yesterday's program.   

 RORY SABBATINI:  It was pretty amazing.  No way to describe it.  It was a long time waiting.   

 I think it will be a great three days to come.
