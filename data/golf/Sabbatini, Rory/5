Q. You must be pleased with your start here?
RORY SABBATINI: Oh, very. The golf course is very receptive out there. I think all things considered, I was a little surprised to see us playing ball-in-hand. We get that opportunity, why not take advantage.
I played nicely. I kept the ball in play and gave myself opportunities.
Q. Piecing together a few events now on The European Tour. How are you enjoying it over here?
RORY SABBATINI: It's great. Obviously it's nice to be here playing in Italy. Obviously I've got some roots here in Italy. It's good to be here, and it's always a nice change of venue, and see some new courses.
Q. What's pleased you most so far?
RORY SABBATINI: I think just got to continue to try and do what I did today. Keep the ball in play. Obviously this is a golf course that I think accuracy is of prime importance out here. You know, putting it in play, and then continue to hit greens and I think if you get it on the greens in regulation, minimize the stress, and we'll see what happens.
Q. Enjoying the crowds?
RORY SABBATINI: Yeah, they are fantastic. Obviously over the weekend it will get a little busy and it will be great to see them out here. Local favourite, Molinari, so as long as I can somehow managed to get paired with him at some point, I'm sure we'll have some good spectators.
