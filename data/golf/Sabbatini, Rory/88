 Q.  Second to last yesterday and now equal low round of the week to make the cut? 
 RORY SABBATINI:  I wasn't happy with the way I played yesterday. Didn't hit the ball well and didn't make any putts and I wasn't happy. I came out here a little earlier today and redo the swing a little bit and get it back on track and it worked. 

 Q.  What was the difference? 
 RORY SABBATINI:  The swing was breaking down yesterday and I was getting in the wrong positions. Today we just shortened it up and cleaned it up and things worked out there. 

 Q.  And you still left a couple out there? 
 RORY SABBATINI:  I only birdied one of the par fives and that is normally one of my strong points. I played nicely and gave myself a lot of opportunities. Suppose I just gave everyone a bit of a hedstart.
