Q.   Talk about the first two days.  Leader is at 8 but you're just three out of the lead.
RORY SABBATINI:  You know, just really playing solid and dealing with the conditions and managing to keep the ball in the fairway and get on the green.  I think as long as you can do that, and in the situation that we have out here, you're going to put yourself in a position where you can make some birdies.
Q.   How many holes did you play this morning for your first round?
RORY SABBATINI:  This morning I played four holes, and I got through 14 this afternoon.  I just got a whole round completed today.
Q.   Any other thoughts on the golf course?  Obviously it's going to play a lot longer but it'll also play softer?
RORY SABBATINI:  Yeah, it's definitely going to play longer so it's definitely going to put a premium on putting the ball in the fairway.  It makes a lot of the flags a lot more accessible, so going into some of the greens is going to be a lot easier, and yet some of the greens with the slope in them is going to be a lot more difficult, and you're going to have to take a lot of spin off the golf ball.  I think all things considered, the golf course will be fairly accepting of a lot of golf shots, very accepting of shots out of the rough especially, but it's going to play long and going to get the guys to hit solid golf shots out there.
