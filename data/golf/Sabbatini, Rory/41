 Q.   What went well for you out there today?  
RORY SABBATINI:   It was interesting, two very different nines.   I hit the ball pretty awfully on my front nine, which was the back nine, and I had to kind of scramble around and try and stay in it.   Kind of got things figured out on the back nine and hit the ball better and gave myself some opportunities and was able to capitalize on them.  
   
 Q.   Guys are talking about how firm it is out there and it's playing like Jack wanted it to.   Do you like it like this?  
RORY SABBATINI:   It definitely is playing firm and fast right now.   We're not quite accustomed to that here.   Obviously some of the flags that are tucked on some of the key holes out there, you're having to play very conservatively.   It's something that's a different look for this golf course, so it's definitely playing‑‑ it's playing tough.  
   
 Q.   Have you figured it out?   You're at the top of the leaderboard right now.   You can't win on Thursday but you can certainly get yourself in position.   
RORY SABBATINI:   Well, exactly.   I've been definitely struggling of late, but things started to kind of appear a little better last week, and I've been feeling like it's been close for a while, and it's just been frustrating.   But to get out there and have a good round like this today definitely is‑‑ it's huge for me in the fact that it definitely pushes up my confidence in my game out there.
