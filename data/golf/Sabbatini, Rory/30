 Q.   Everything been going good for you?   
RORY SABBATINI:   Well not much went good for me today, other than I made a lot of birdies.   But I also made an extreme amount of bogeys.   It's just tough conditions out there and just trying to be patient and give myself opportunities and that is all you can do.   
And then Blake has just been fantastic, kicking in just at the right moments.   
So we have been dovetailing really well and just manage to keep the ball rolling.  
   
 Q.   You got to be happy with your position, I mean through the conditions, you're still right there and in striking distance.   
RORY SABBATINI:   Well, considering how much I struggled out there today and really didn't see any really any putts go in, you know, to get in at 1â€‘over on this course is still a decent thing, considering the conditions.   
But I got my work cut out for me tomorrow and I need to go put up a low number and put myself into position going into Sunday.  
   
 Q.   How have you historically agreed with the course tomorrow?  
RORY SABBATINI:   Actually, I really like Pebble.   Pebble is a great course.
