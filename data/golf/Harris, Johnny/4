 Q. (No microphone.)
 JOHN HARRIS: (No microphone.)

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JOHN HARRIS: He's a good player. Anytime you're a good player and you get on a roll, you know, he drives the ball into virtually ever fairway, he fought his way around well and that's what the game is about. The whole level has increased so much. It's another indication that amateur golf is in good shape, and if he does what he has been doing he will be competitive over the weekend. 

 Q. You had an amateur career and made the move and transitioned nicely. Is he a guy who could do that? 
 JOHN HARRIS: Well, I think so. The times are different. His kids are younger, and he has a business going, and it's different than it was seven or eight years ago when I did it, but there are guys doing it and he's got the talent if he's got the motivation, if that's what he wants to do. 

 Q. Seems like the last couple of days he's been calm --
 JOHN HARRIS: He's been beautiful. He's handled every situation. He's been aggressive off the tee and fairly conservative into the greens because he's been putting so well and taking advantage of the opportunities when he's got the ball close to the hole. 

 Q. (No microphone.)
 JOHN HARRIS: Oh, it's been fun for me to watch him do that. 
 We're at different places in our career but it was fun playing with him in Washington and watching him do the things he did today. 

 Q. Looking back, was it -- (No microphone.)
 JOHN HARRIS: The amateur was great for me, it was the pinnacle of my career, and one of the goals I had when I came out here was to win. 
 And it took three or four years to do that, but I did, and that was satisfying in a little different way.
