  Q. Talk about your day. You were rolling along there at 6-under and then hit a bad stretch of holes coupled with the rain.   
 JOHN HARRIS:  You know everybody's going to play in bad weather and I got to the hard holes in the bad weather and hit some not very good shots and got penalized for it.  I drove the ball in the rough and you just can't drive it in the rough here.  But I played great and I'm happy with the way I played. I didn't get much out of the last five holes obviously, but it was fun and I'll try to come back tomorrow and do a little better.   
  
  Q. How were the conditions out there? We touched on it a little bit.   
 JOHN HARRIS:  It's just exactly what you'd expect when you come over here. I played with a guy that played even par through the bad holes. So you know it wasn't that hard.   
  
  Q. Any particular part of your game that got away from you?   
 JOHN HARRIS:  Well, I hit two poor drives and made a bogey and a double. I just need to drive the ball in the fairway. It didn't have to go very far when its wet, but I just need to hit it in the fairway.
