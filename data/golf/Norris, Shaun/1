Q. Shaun Norris, 1-under 69.  Shaun, can you take us through your round.
SHAUN NORRIS:   Starting off the round, gave myself a tough par save on the first hole, but I made a good putt.  Since then, I really actually hit the ball really nicely.  Couldn't complain about it.  Gave myself some good opportunities and converted them.
Q. Nice birdie on 4 and 9.  Can you talk us through those?
SHAUN NORRIS:   I've got to think of the 4th hole.  Yeah, the 4th hole was a good one.  I hit a really good tee shot down in the middle of the fairway, gave myself a 9 iron.  With these greens being so slopey and all that, got to give yourself good chances.  I left myself a 15, 20-footer pretty much straight down the slope, really had a good putt.
Then 9 is just one of those holes you're happy just to hit it on the green for two because I think it's easier to try and hit a two-putt than to try and wage one in close to where the pin was located.  So gave myself a good chance, and I walked away with birdie.
Q. How did the course play compared to your expectations?
SHAUN NORRIS:   It's tough.  You've got to hit fairways.  You've got to hit greens.  That's the basic thing about this course.  Like I said, I really hit the ball nicely.  I was happy with it, gave myself a lot of opportunities.  So I can't complain.
Q. Any adjustments going into tomorrow?  What's your mindset?
SHAUN NORRIS:   No, I don't think so.  I think the same thing.  Just commit to the tee shots, try to pick your targets, commit to them.  And same with the greens -- commit to the target, leaving yourself good opportunities, normally uphill putts for birdie.  You walk away with par, you're never going to complain about it.
