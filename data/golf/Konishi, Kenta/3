 Q.  We've got Kenta Konishi from Japan, a 1-up winner over Kyle Mueller, who was the 64 seed who beat the No. 1 seed, and you are a quarterfinalist in the United States Amateur.  What does that mean to you?  
KENTA KONISHI: I'm so proud of how I played today.  I'm just very happy right now.   
 Q.  Was this part of your expectations for the week, to be advanced this far?  
KENTA KONISHI: This tournament, I just wanted to try how I can play against the best amateurs in the world, and I'm pretty surprised how I've played so far.   
 Q.  Were the conditions in your favor, or were you fighting the conditions all day given the wind?  
KENTA KONISHI: The wind, it's pretty similar from Japan, so I was prepared for the wind.  But the last, it's pretty tough on the second shot.  But it's pretty easy for me.   
 Q.  You had a big lead and then you dropped down to just a one-hole advantage.  What happened, and what did you do to get yourself back focused?  
KENTA KONISHI: I just hung in there every hole and trusted my swing every time.   
 Q.  Is this your first time playing in the United States?  
KENTA KONISHI: In the U.S. Amateur?   
 Q.  In the United States in general.  
KENTA KONISHI: I played a World Junior before.   
 Q.  In San Diego?  
KENTA KONISHI: Yes.  Then the qualifier.   
 Q.  Matt said you guys played the first two days together.  What did you see from his game that you're looking forward to tomorrow?  
KENTA KONISHI: He's not the longest hitter, but he has a nice short game.  If he plays average, I think we can beat him tomorrow.   
 Q.  I know you played with Hideki in Japan a number of years ago.  How well do you know Hideki and how much has he influenced you?  
KENTA KONISHI: He's pretty good, but I beat him one time in a Japan tournament.  He never played after that tournament and he came to the PGA, so I want to play with him again.   
 Q.  Like a rematch?  
KENTA KONISHI: Yeah.   
 Q.  Do you remember what tournament it was that you beat Hideki in?  
KENTA KONISHI: Some Japan tournament.   
 Q.  Has Hideki influenced your swing, as well?  
KENTA KONISHI: He has a pretty good swing tempo, so I learned some things from him like that.
