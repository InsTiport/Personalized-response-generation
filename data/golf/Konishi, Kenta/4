Q. We've got Kenta Konishi and his interpreter Justin on his score, which is a 66 at the North Course.  Did you see the good score coming in your preparation?
KENTA KONISHI: Not much.
Q. Do you like the North Course more than the South?
KENTA KONISHI: Maybe 50/50.  I like both courses.
Q. What was the best part of your game today, driving the ball, putting?
KENTA KONISHI: Everything, everything.  But the putting, I can do better stroke, better lead, make some putts.
Q. How does it feel to come to the United States and play so well in one of golf's biggest events for amateurs?
KENTA KONISHI: It's really a good experience for me.  I hope I can keep going, play well tomorrow.
Q. The South Course, how do you like that?  Do you think you can shoot a better score on the South Course than the North?
KENTA KONISHI: I don't know, but I'm going to try every shot, focus more, and try my best.
Q. Recently the U.S. Amateur has been won quite often by non-American players, whereas previously it was usually an American who won.  You got in through the World Amateur Golf Rankings exemption.  Was this something you really wanted to play in because it's such a big event?
KENTA KONISHI: What was the question again?
Q. Because it's such a big event and it's been won by non-American players, was it something that you were interested in playing because it's such an international field now?
KENTA KONISHI: There's a lot of good Korean players, so I think I can do it.  It doesn't matter if it's Asian or -- these guys hit it far, but I trust I can do it.
