   JULIEN GUERRIER:  I am very happy to have an invitation on such a great course. I was upset about my finish but it's great experience for me. When I won the Amateur Championship I knew it would open doors for me but I need to play well to progress.   
 It was great to measure my game with the top professionals. They are better on the short game, which is where it is decided if you win or not. My future? Well, I hope to play in some other events and maybe I will get some other invitations.   
 I am looking forward to playing the Masters. It is a big target, but I am enjoying this moment. I have already practised at Augusta in November. I played four rounds. They allowed me to play. It was a lovely place. I will stay amateur until the Masters but then I will see what happens.   
My handicap now is plus four. I had nobody in my family playing golf. After primary school I had the chances to try three sports - tennis, rugby and golf and I already played tennis so I tried golf, met a good teacher and it is my passion now. I come from La Rochelle from close to Bordeaux. Age 21. I will be 22 on July 1.
