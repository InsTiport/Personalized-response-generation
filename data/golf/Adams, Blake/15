  Q. 5-under par. Nice start to the tournament. Just get comments on your round?  
 BLAKE ADAMS: It was a good day; I hit it well. You know, left -- in my mind, had two or three putts -- two of 'em were extremely, very long, long putts.   
 But, you know, I made some putts throughout the day so it all equalled out. But the most important thing is my body felt good. Last Monday I actually got a shot of Cortisone in my hip. My hip is a disaster.   
 So last week I was a little bit scared on it. I mean, feel good. Hopefully I'll just keep on rolling.  
  
  Q. How frustrating is it battling injuries?  
 BLAKE ADAMS: It is really, really frustrating for me. Like in Canada, I hit every fairway on Thursday, and I showed up on Friday and could hardly swing at it. I ended up missing the cut, and it was just my last straw.   
 So I ended up getting a shot on Monday. Actually played the course (indiscernible) last week, which made the cut, like I said, which was a good thing.   
 But I feel good this week, you know, so hopefully see how it goes.  
  
  Q. Which birdies stand out? You had a couple good ones.   
 BLAKE ADAMS: Yeah, you know, I played solid. I mean, I had a nice putt on 17. That's definitely not an easy hole. I mean, it's probably a, you know, 15-, 16-footer, which is nice.   
 So some of those were, you know, fairly close, so I actually made the putts I was supposed to make. I left one there on 18, probably about a five-footer for birdie.   
 But all in all it was a good day.
