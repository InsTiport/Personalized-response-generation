  Q. Tied for third. All in all got to be a solid week for you, right?  
 BLAKE ADAMS: Yeah, it was a good week. I mean, the whole week in general. I mean, (indiscernible) on Monday, but I had some opportunities coming down the stretch and didn't really capitalize on the par-5s.   
 I actually hit some really, really good shots, just didn't finish it off. So all in all good day and just move on to next week.  
  
  Q. First appearance here. Anything stand out about the golf course that suits your game?  
 BLAKE ADAMS: Ah, the ball goes far. (Laughter.) No, it's a great, great venue. (Indiscernible.)  
  
  Q. Been playing pretty well the last couple months. Good finish up in Travelers. Kind of got things going at the right time. Now this finish obviously helps you in the FedExCup points. Maybe continue to move up that and kind of set you up for the rest of year a little bit?  
 BLAKE ADAMS: Absolutely. My goal is -- I haven't quite reached 'em, but playing (indiscernible) hopefully better my spot in the first week of the FedEx.   
 (Indiscernible) You know, just keep on trucking along and see what happens.
