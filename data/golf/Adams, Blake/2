Q.   Overall sum up what you're going to take away from this weekend. 
BLAKE ADAMS:   It was a good week all in all.   Obviously been on a medical, I'm a little rusty. 
I had a good week.   I hit it really, really well.   Didn't actually putt very well today.   I don't know what my proximity or my greens hit were today, but I think it was pretty darn good.   It's a good day.   Somewhere in the top 10, a little bit outside.   But all in all a lot of positives going to New Orleans.

Q.   I was about to say, for somebody that's rusty, you put up some good numbers. 
BLAKE ADAMS:   It was a good week.   It was a good week.   I've been working really, really hard and I played pretty well in San Antonio and Houston, and I didn't get a whole lot out of those rounds.   And I knew I had some good play coming.   And it was nice to see some lower numbers, finally.

Q.   Talk about what a topâ€‘10 finish means for you moving forward and how you're feeling. 
BLAKE ADAMS:   It's a special feeling, obviously being this close to home, and I've got a lot of friends and family here, which makes it even more special.   It's a big week obviously for my medical; I have to make enough money to keep my job, so it was a good week as far as that goes.   And just a lot of positives, very, very good.
