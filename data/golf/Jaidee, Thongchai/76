 Q.   Back to the OlazÃ¡bal Course, I think you played a practise round yesterday, how is the golf course and has it changed?   
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The course is good condition.   I think a couple of the holes, they make it longer.   Like back nine, a couple holes, they make it longer.   Nice, nice course now.   They cut the trees down.   You can see the course very well.   The condition is no complaint.  
    The greens, they get a little bit firm because the new grass.   It's okay.   I think it's very nice here.   I think the course is most difficult than last time because the greens is a bit firm.   I think the score not easy to make.   You know, you have to hit the ball like perfect direction.   You have to be in good position, also, to get good score.  
   
 Q.   I think there are five par 5s, does that give you a chance?   
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, and the par3s, also.   The par3 is more difficult, you know, and par 5, I don't mind par 5, make good score on par 5 but par 3, better be careful, because I think the par3 is very, very challenging, like a couple holes they play very much downhill like No.2, No. 8, you have to have the correct distance, otherwise the green is very tricky also on the par3.   
    I think the course is very challenging.   
   
 Q.   I think you had a Top‑10 in the World Cup here with Prayad and played good in Shanghai last week, do you feel confident to come back to this tournament?  
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, I'm going to try my best anyway.   Playing Dunhill and then Macou and then last week and this week and then continue onto Dubai.   
    I get my confidence now, putting is great, and driver very good.   Irons a couple times good, a couple times no good.   Anyway, depends the feeling, if feeling well, you can make it very good performance.   I don't care, I try to get my best, the thing is my feeling is I'm very confident right now.   
   
 Q.   You've played for many years now, and you've played many WGC tournaments, as well, and the majors.   When you come here now with all of these star players, you feel confident, don't you?  
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, I try to get my‑‑ anyway, I need to play well.   Like World Golf Championships, I need to play well because we need to be like every week a major tournament, World Ranking points very high, need to play well, get my World Ranking back.   I try very hard after this.   You know, I have a few more events, another world golf tournament is going to be next year, so also I'm going to play every strong player, also.   I try to get my best anyway.  
   
 Q.   How important is it for Asia to have a World Golf Championships here in this part of the world?  
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   It's good, because it's very, very good for Asia, as well, because they had the world golf tournament in Asia, anyway.   Now like last week, also, they have like a PGA tournament in Asia.   Good to see more big events in Asia, not in China, like Singapore I'm not sure they have it already but I want to see more, bringing more strong players coming to play that event.   I would like to see big event coming soon if possible or future.   
   
 Q.   We're coming towards the end of our season now, November, tomorrow; with many big tournaments coming up, have you set yourself any goals to try to achieve?   
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Exactly, you know, I try to get my win before I get end of the year, I think most important this week and next week.   Next week is my birthday, 43 this year, getting old.   But anyway, if you don't get any injury, you can survive and you can enjoy your life.   Play golf, it's my life and I do it myself and thinking about‑‑ you know, age is very important.   If you maintain your body stronger, you're going to be healthy your whole life.   Sometimes you get injury, it's difficult.   Anyway, golf, we get‑‑ I didn't get very easy this year to get injury.   Many times I get injured.   
   
 Q.   Thaworn is 46 this year‑‑  
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, it's good for Thaworn.   He played very well this year but his performance is very, very strong.   I played with him yesterday, he hits the ball very good.   You know, the driver, iron, irons are very good.   He hits iron very good this time.  
    But I think it's going to be everywhere, short game is going to be the best.   I look hit the ball longer and his irons very, very good for him.   You know, the age, if you maintain for yourself, you do for yourself, you getting stronger, you can play all your life.   I'm going to enjoy my life and enjoy to play golf.   I try to get a win every week if I can, but you know, golf is not easy.   I tried to get a win is my target every week, and if not possible, try for next week.
