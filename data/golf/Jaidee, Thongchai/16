 Q.  Tell us about the round.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I played not good, not like my normal.  Missed a lot of putts.  But Europe going to be a very strong anyway.  That's what I told you.  Andy, very solid, he didn't make any mistakes today.  He made very good up-and-downs and good putt.  For me, I miss a couple putts, that's why we lose.  This time, you have to be in the fairway and play on the green.  But we are not in form anyway, not my normal putting, and driver is not in the fairway.  That's why the golf course, if you find any fairway, they are going to be good.  Miss a lot of fairways, and that's why we lose for them.  It's okay.  It's a good try.
