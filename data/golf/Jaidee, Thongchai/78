Q.   Before teeing off, would you have taken that score? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, the same every week, I try to hit fairways and greens.   I hit 15 greens today, hit good putts.   I started today like last week, played solid.   Made some good putts.   Generally bogey is bad, but went to 17, thick rough, into chance.   Had a very good lie and I think the main thing today, we had to be fairways, hit the ball in the fairway and then green, hole putts, because the fairways, very narrow.   Solid now, game.   I think it looks good for the next few days, yeah. 

Q.   You were so thrilled last week to have started as well as you did in some horrible weather, and this week you have good weather, there's not a lot of wind, but you would expect to shoot low, but it's a difficult course, isn't it. 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think this week, it's quite hard, like the back nine, 15, 16, 17, 18 will be tough holes, last four.   I prefer this when it's tough‑‑ last week with it being a bit softer, I think if the greens are firm, it's going to be very hard for this week.   The thing it's a tough course last week. 
We play in weather, it's good weather for the next few moments but I don't know about next few days.

Q.   Still thrilled about the win in Wales and keeping the form going?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, trying to get my best all the time. I know what I can do in our.   I work with my coach and work on myself what I can do, and work about what is the thing that is my problem. 
My game is solid now and I think it's going to be good challenge, anyway.
