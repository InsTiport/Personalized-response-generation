  Second Round 64. 10-Under Total. 130

 Q. Tell us about your day?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Putting very good today. I had a lot of long putts. We had long putts more than 20 feet. You see on TV. My feeling is confident now with putting. This week, I think if I'm putting well like this, irons is no problem. Driver not very good today. Very good up-and-down, very good putts everywhere. Make 2-putts -- we have no 3-putts today. That's why the course conditions is good this afternoon, no wind. We have very good on last hole. 

 Q. When is the last time you had four long birdie putts?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Sometimes you have good confidence. I tried to get better, feeling my back, and then that's why -- sometimes we have bad feeling about putting, I cannot make -- I cannot hole anything. That's the problem. When you need to putt the ball close to the pin, sometimes you make mistakes. Very confident for today and yesterday one 3-putt and today come back now. 

 Q. Not very far from the leaders, what do you need to do tomorrow to catch up? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think same game plan, make a lot of fairways, make a lot of greens. If you have good putts, if you are feeling well, you are going to have a good chance. 

 Q. Do you feel you've been good enough to really have another low two rounds the next two rounds?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: This course, you never know, you can make a low score because the course is very short. If you have good tee shot, you can hold the ball close to the pin and if you have confidence about putting, you can be in good shape.
