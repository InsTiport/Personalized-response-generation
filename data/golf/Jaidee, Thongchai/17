Q. Take us through your round today.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We don't have any bogey.  Europe plays good on the back nine.  It's okay, this format, you have to keep the ball in the fairway.  We had a lot of trouble today.  We missed a lot of fairway.  The back nine, coming back a little bit.  We start birdie 11, 12, 13, and make a good par every hole.  16 we lost 3 & 2, not bad.  They played so well, it doesn't matter.  This format, you never know.  Try my best.  I think anything, we look forward to see tomorrow what's going on.  I think a few more groups going to continue, try to tell them something to get some points back.
