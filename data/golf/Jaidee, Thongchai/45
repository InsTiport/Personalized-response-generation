 Q.   67, 4‑under today, tell us about your round?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I played solid round again.   I think a couple trouble, 3‑putt.   I hit very solid both round, yesterday and today, a lot of birdies and couple bogey with 3‑putt.   Condition is very good today but pins very soft.   I played very, very well.   Putting well and everything, no complaints.   Yeah, 4‑under today, yesterday, 3‑under, a couple double‑bogey, a couple bogey by 3‑putt but a solid round.  
I love to come here.   The course, it's nice to play, really challenging.  
   
 Q.   You love this golf course and are very comfortable on the greens.   How much did the conditions overnight affect the golf course?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   A couple early, a rain‑‑ after a couple holes, the rain stops and the course is fantastic.   The greens is very soft and difficult to control.   You have to have good iron and hit good putt from the‑‑ you have to know about where the greens are better to putt.   I hit very good iron today.   Otherwise make a very low score today, and I don't mind to play tomorrow.   
Look forward for tomorrow.   The most important, you have to keep the ball in the fairway, that's the first thing.   And the second thing, you have to think where the pin position, where you have to miss.   You don't have to miss anywhere‑‑ but for me played very well.
