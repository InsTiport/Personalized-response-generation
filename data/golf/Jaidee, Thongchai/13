THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I started very well, played well, first three holes, we had three under in the first three holes.  We holed a long putt on No. 2 and then holed from the bunker.  We had an eagle on No. 3 that started very well.  That's what make the confidence very good.   
I tried to get -- this golf course I know is very hard.  It's going to be wind and rain a couple times.  I concentrate on my game, try to get tee shot through the fairway, the most important.   
And second thing, if you find the fairway this year -- the greens will be soft.  That's why if you hit the ball on the fairway, it can be okay.  If you miss it, I mean, the tee shot, if you miss it, it's going to be hard work.   
I'm very happy to be 4-under par today.  I think it's very good.  Good to be 4-under.  It's a very good round.  Even the conditions like this, the golf course like this, setup, I really enjoyed this golf course.  I've been here, came second about three years ago, and then, yeah, I like to play this golf course.   
 Q.  Does it help when you've had such a prominent finish; does it help with your confidence and the experience of playing the course?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think this course, the changes, some of the fairways, a lot of the fairway, they change every fairway.  They make fairway, new turf.  The green is okay.  A couple holes they changed like 11 and a couple holes like 16.  All the par 3s, I think very challenging.   
I think I remember the golf course, that's why you know the golf course well.  You know you have to have a game plan.  The game plan very important on this golf course.  Sometimes you don't need driver, you need 3-wood a lot of times.  That's why I think about the golf course game plan, really important.
