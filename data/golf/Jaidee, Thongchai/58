Q.   Thoughts on 68 today? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I hit ball good today.   I hit a lot of fairways, except 9.   Thinking about 9, tried to hit cut, went to the bunker, I think only one bad hole today.   We make one 3‑putt on 13.   Hit solid and I hit a lot of greens.   Hit 14 or 15 greens today.   I think a lot of birdies, good chance and 4‑under is good.   Catch up tomorrow anyway.   I know the score is very far away from the leader but take my chance to do it.   Better day tomorrow.
