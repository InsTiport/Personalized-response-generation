  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, very good week again this week.   Fantastic week, putting well, irons good, everything, no complaints at all.   I would like to play well this week and before The Race to Dubai, the finish, I think that's a very good performance, and I think the key to this week, I think putting better, and you know, golf course is very good today because it's quite easier than yesterday, because the weather is good, I think not very windy.   The wind changed directions today.   The key is I think I hit the irons perfect today. 

Q.   And a lovely low round to finish. 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Birdie on 17, that's the key to come to 10‑under.   Come to the last one, I know tough.   17 and 18, very tough holes.   Make it good, 1‑under for the last two holes, going to be very good for me.   I hope keep my performance for next few weeks, going to be happy with my golf game yeah.
