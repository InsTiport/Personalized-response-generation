Q. Your thoughts on a round of 68?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I played solid the last two days.  We hit 17 greens, miss on the last hole.  Last one was on top on 18, made bogey on the last hole, and one 3-putt today.  It's good.  Pretty solid round for me.  I hit very good iron, good tee shot and putting is solid on the back nine to be 4-under anyway.  I know 18 is going to be very tough on 18 today.
Very happy with my score today.  4-under again, yesterday 5, today, total 9, it's very good anyway.
Q. Was that really annoying at the last considering that you had moved so sweetly up the board with all those birdies on the back nine?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yes, because I'm putting well on the back nine.  I think the game plan, the wind effect is a lot different than yesterday.  Today, the afternoon, the wind direction, I think very tough today.  You can see the score is not really very low.  Completely different than yesterday.  I think today I hit perfect, no complaint anyway.  Hit 17 greens, miss only one green on 18.  You have to lay up and you can't reach the pin anyway on the last.
Anyway still pretty good.  It's 9-under and have two more rounds.  Look forward to see the next two rounds anyway.
Q. It's a lovely foundation for the weekend, isn't it, because you're bound to be up there in the mix.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I try to.  On the weekend, I think it's very important for me.  If I play well, then a good chance to win this tournament and it would be great for me.
