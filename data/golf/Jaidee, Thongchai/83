 Q.   1‑under today, especially such a strong wind, you must be quite pleased?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, played okay, but just putting could be coming back.   Everything today, I missed a lot of greens, and then a good up‑and‑down.   We had one chip and putt off the green, three holes.   Maybe this course going to be tough today.   It play very long today, like 10, hit a very bad tee shot on the right side and made a good bogey.   Very good come back on the back nine.   
On the back nine, yeah, I have two bogeys in a row, 9, 10,11 and very good come back on that, birdie on the last and then some good putts.   
I think the course here, the wind is quite strong in the afternoon.   It's good for me.   I miss a lot of greens.   Driver is going to be okay, not great, but a couple of holes, I missed a lot of fairways, and very good lie.   This course, you have to know the pin positions, where the pin position and you can know which way, they are very good for put.   
The pin positions are quite tough also today.   Very good score for me.   
   
 Q.   You know you can play very well; so you're in strong position?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, especially today it's quite cold.   After one o'clock, it's good.   After that the wind is shutting down a little bit.   I think the weather becomes very cool after five o'clock.   But very good finish.   I think the weather is good for me.   I can try for next few days tomorrow, early.   I think the group today will not finish probably because they are very long, it takes about five hours and 40 minutes.
