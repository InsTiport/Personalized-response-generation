Q.   Your thoughts on shooting such a lovely round to get right up there?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The key is putting so well today.   Yesterday and today, I'm putting so well.   Eastbound yesterday, we have two holes for 3‑putts.   Today is solid.   Now I make good putt anyway.   Anyway we putting well.   You can see the score is quite low today.   I enjoy to play.   I play just only one mistake today on 11 holes.   We end up in the bush and have to drop an unplayable.   Hit very good putt to make par and next hole, also, missed on the right side and then third shot we hit over the green, chipped 12 feet, we make a good putt from there and we make par. 
I think anyway, not complain about the round.   Feel very well putting today, you can see the score, never putt well like this in a long time, especially this week putting so well.   That's why we have 66 today.

Q.   Are you excited, given that this is such a big event on The European Tour? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I've played here many years.   The crowd is very good support.   Sometimes players get pressure anyway.   I like someone to watching, so that's why I don't mind to play with so many people.   I enjoy to come to Wentworth. 

Q.   You've had a good result here in the past, haven't you, you've had a Top‑10. 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Are especially yesterday and today, the good condition, because not very cold.   We have very good weather yesterday.   We start with very good draw but yesterday we have early morning it's no wind and we come to today, it's wind less in the afternoon.   That's why a very good draw and I think lucky draw, also.   You have to have the good side to be in position.   Today, the wind is less you see in the afternoon.   Morning it will be chilly a little bit.
