Q. No. 18 seems to be a not-so-good hole for you?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I feel that's why I'm not confident with putting.  The whole week we've putting so bad.  We had two 3-putts the last two rounds on 18.  We're in bad position when putt out there.  Left-hand side -- from the fairway, and then hit it strong.  Under par is fine.  It's okay.  Enjoy the course but so difficult.  The pins was very difficult today on the back nine.
Q. It seems like this bogey could cost you a chance to get into the Top-50 in the world, because I think they were talking about you finishing 12 or better this week to get in, yeah?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We have one more week, Boonchu tournament. (Boonchu Ruangkit Championship in Thailand on the Asian Development Tour, which will be played from December 22-25.)
Q. Are you guaranteed to play the Boonchu tournament to try to get your points for the Masters there?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah.
Q. So you have a couple of weeks before the Boonchu tournament.  So what are you going to do the next few weeks?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Going to go back home and stay with my family and maybe some holiday and do a lot of work, sometime start to do like gym, for start of next week.  Do a lot for my body stronger.
I know my iron play very well this week.  Unfortunately my putting not well.  My putting, so many lost shots.  It's going to be a Top-10 easy if we are putting well this week.  That's why we don't miss any fairways much.  We hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways.  That's the only thing, putting is not confident.
Q. You must be excited with the new irons.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I'm okay.  You know with my game, I hit the ball very well this week.  I'm not complain about it, new ball, new iron.  Doesn't matter, only thing is you have to find the greens and you have to putt them well.
