  Q. Another pretty good win for you today?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, a good day. He didn't play well on the front nine. He came back on the back nine a bit.   
 Match play is tough to tell, you know. You have to look shot by shot. How is playing my partner.   
 I played well today. I think some hole we missed about birdies. Very good match and very enjoy. And look forward for tomorrow.   
  
  Q. (Inaudible.)  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, yesterday lost, this year didn't play well today. Not a good form for him. I think Robert also. And back nine, also, he missed a lot of short putt. Very important. Putting on the green is difficult to read the line.   
 Very good game plan today. Good drive and then very good iron, very good putter. Today everything okay, perfect. It's just very good match and enjoy, and look forward again to tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Tomorrow looks like Ryo Ishikawa at the moment or McGowan, either would be tough.  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I don't know who. Any player, I enjoy playing with them.   
  
  Q. The further you go in this event, is there interest backat home, a lot of people watching you?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think different time back home, 14 hour.   
  
  Q. Highlights?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Some get highlights in the morning about 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, then maybe they get a highlight somewhere.   
 I speak to my wife this morning, she is still watching in the highlight. Very good for me. Very enjoy. And a lot of Thai people watch the TV. I like to play well. If I miss, it's no problem, just try for next year.
