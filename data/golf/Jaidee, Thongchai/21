 Q.  Talk about being so close?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Played good all day.  Only struggling with putting on the front nine.  Back nine, I hit a lot of short putts today.  Playing quite bumpy today, like the last putt, just a bit short for playoff.  I don't mind, pretty good week for me and very good round today.  Because the wind changed directions today, that's why makes it quite tough.  Some played very low and some played over.   
For me, I think very good week anyway.  My week is fantastic week this week.  If not win, that's why, you know, a lot of guys played well.  For me, I think top five, top ten, it's very good, yeah.   
 Q.  Were you proud of the way you stayed patient, as well, because you slipped down is that board but it was so congested and one birdie and you're back amongst it.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, anyway, I tried to get my chance, second to last hole, even birdie, good birdie on 17, and hit perfect driver on 18.  Second shot, perfect iron.  And then putting, you know, sometimes we think about the pin, that one is going to be tough.  You have to have more speed that one going to be in the playoff, but if not, not possible.  Pretty good week for me.  I mean, 16-under is very good score.   
 Q.  The way you're playing at the moment, does that add to the excitement going into Dubai?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yes, we are going to Dubai.  We have to go back home for tomorrow, stay a couple hours at home and then fly over at midnight from Bangkok to Dubai, probably land Tuesday morning.  I think we have to spend a couple time with family.  That's a good plan to make.  I don't mind.  It's good.  This year is going to be a fantastic year for me I think.  I think I have a pretty good year anyway.  Pretty good year for me.
