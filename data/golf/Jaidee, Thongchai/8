THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Not in form like yesterday.  Today really struggling with driver.  Few irons still not consistent.  You have very bad, poor tee shot and a lot of iron not in form.  Couldn't find a lot of fairways today, that's why.
The pin was difficult today.  That's why you can see the score, not very low score today.  3-under be good enough today.  Sort of pins today, it's going to be tough.  It's a good finish, 1-under par.  My game today, 1-under par is good.  Okay, tomorrow, try another day tomorrow.
Q. When you have to chase somebody and you bogey the first hole, what does that do to your thinking?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I didn't think it was a bad bogey.  It's a pretty easy up-and-down from the right side.  We think we took the right putter.  Just not enough distance, but okay, forget the first one.  First three or four holes, struggling a little bit.  Had a good shot but bogey on 7, bad third shot anyway.  We had 187 yards and it flew over the green.  That's a bad thing.
Come back on the par 3.  Hole the putt on the par 3 and then good iron on 16, come back to 1-under par.  It's okay.  It's the pins was tough today.  That's why struggling a bit.
Q. Are you chasing second spot now or is there a chance of catching that man?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, we try to get my best anyway.  Make me a challenge anyway and finish top five, Top-10, whatever, have to play well tomorrow, that's why we're thinking tomorrow, play a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens, and feeling putting confident now.  It's okay, if you hit a lot of greens, make me a chance for come.
