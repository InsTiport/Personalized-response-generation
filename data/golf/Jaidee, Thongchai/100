  Q. How do you feel right at this minute?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: It's tough today but I putted so bad. I tried to hit easy, if I putt firm it will be okay.  
  
  Q. You knew you could have caught JimÃ©nez there.   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, today, okay, tough conditions today. It's very difficult to control the ball. Sometimes you need to correct driver on the fairway. The back nine is quite good, I played very, very consistent on the back nine.  
  
  Q. Did you think at the start of today's play that even par would be a good score?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I hope that one, because the pin positions was very tough today. Yeah, the wind is blowing some ways but very happy.  
  
  Q. Next tournament?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Maybe if I get in the Match Play, that's where I'll be there.
