Q.   Overall how are you finding the two rounds?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I'm playing okay but we had three holes I made 3‑putts today.   I hit very good, and to have three holes, 3‑putts today, otherwise we are 4‑under today.   Today there is no wind.   Quite easy.   Especially cold a little bit this morning, but after five, six holes, very warm. 
I enjoyed it.   Okay, very good, made the cut and the thing is look forward for the next two rounds.   I think going on, my game has to be better a little bit and my putting needs work, but this course, you have long, difficult putts.   You have three putts on the long side. 
It's okay, I'll enjoy, and try to get better for the next two rounds.
