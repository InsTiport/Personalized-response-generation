Q.   Despite the bogey at the last, 69 is a very good score.   How well do you feel you played today? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Driver not too good today, especially putting very well today.   Otherwise we have very long putt and roll the ball 15 yards.   My golf game anyway, not a lot of fairways today.   I know that the wind is picking up and is quite strong.   The course is tough. 
Good bogey on 18.   The thing about it, 5‑wood, pulled left, probably straight into the water and make bogey in the last.   Anyway, maybe a chance‑‑ but still my golf game is really very consistent right now.   I'm not complain with my golf game right now.

Q.   Good feeling for tomorrow?   Can you catch these leaders? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   You never know.   The course is tough.   Sometimes you get trouble and the best thing you make, you have to have the place in your game anyway‑‑ drive tee to fairway.   Anyway, give me a chance tomorrow.   Try my best anyway tomorrow. 

Q.   What are your thoughts on the way this week has progressed to see you up there in third position at the moment?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The key chance I think this week, the putting give me a lot of chance.   Putting very well.   The driver is not many fairways today.   I hit a couple, about four or five fairway today.   Putting, have a lot of short game and make a lot of good short game today.   Otherwise make a good score but 2‑under was very good, accept last one, make bogey last one, very bad tee shot on the last one. 
Tomorrow, I don't know the leader how many under he's going to finish.   Going to be very hard the last three.   Anyway tomorrow, good challenge anyway tomorrow.   The course is tough.   You have to have perfect game for tomorrow and putting well, driver well and your iron well tomorrow to have a chance tomorrow. 

Q.   You say the course is tough.   I think the way the wind is blowing over in the afternoon and today, it's even more tough, isn't it?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think today was, first thing today, because wind picked up and sometimes gusting and sometimes it's a lot of rain coming otherwise game is sometimes different.   Sometimes wind blows a different side and sometimes not the same direction.   Otherwise you have to have‑‑ that's why I try to get my best golf game today but the putting helped a lot today.   I holed two very long putts and 16, also, very long putt. 

Q.   Do you feel in control of your game, because after the win in Sweden and you contested last week, as well. 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, Germany, I played couple days before I go to play DÃ¼sseldorf‑‑ give me more comfortable for my swing.   Otherwise couldn't lose trying, try to keep feeling well.
