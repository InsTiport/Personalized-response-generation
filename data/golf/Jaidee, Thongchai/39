 Q.   What was the key to the early, hot start?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   First thing, I feel putting all well.   Had a long putt at the first, start birdie, birdie and that's a key chance.   We had birdie on 7.   Everything putting today, not comparing anything.   It's something that if you're feeling well, for me, I'm feeling putts very well this week.   That's why I can make up and down everywhere.   That's why.   I don't get scared about greens; if you make a good putt, sometimes you're missing a green and you can make up‑and‑down.   For me, the key is today a good start for I think first four holes, I think 4‑under, got me quite relaxed when I start like this.   
Going to be tough on the back nine because the wind change directions today.   Going to be hard on 14, 15.   I think 13, 14, 15, I think it's going to be very, very hard on back nine.
