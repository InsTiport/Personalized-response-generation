Q.   Four matches, four wins; what's pleased you most about your play to far this week?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I played solid today again, both in the morning, I played very well, 21 holes.   Yeah, I'm playing very well all week.   I'm very confident with this format.   More important this week, I'm hitting the ball well and the putting getting better. 
Just miss a couple holes but in match play, you have to know to play‑‑ I'm confident in my golf game this week, we won all the matches and we look forward to tomorrow.   Starting off‑‑ inaudible‑‑ after that, make double‑bogey but after that we played very solid.   Got a little bit mistake, a little bit tired.   Everyone I think tired, we have 36 holes today and a little bit tired. 

Q.   How exciting to have a chance to win this Volvo World Match Play tomorrow? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   We don't think about that, I play my own game anyway.   This week very good for me already and really enjoy my golf game and also enjoy the course, most important, fully relax this week and look forward to tomorrow.
