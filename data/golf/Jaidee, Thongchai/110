  Q.  Nice way to finish the round with an eagle?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE:  I'm very happy. I hit it very good today and my irons have been good for two rounds. Had some problem with the putting, had one three putt today on the seventh and yesterday I had also one three putt. The greens are tricky with the grains over here.   
  
  Q. Tell us about the eagle?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Had a good one, from eight feet. Hit a three iron in from 210 yards into the wind. Hit a nice cut in. Good way to finish.   
  
  Q.  Feeling fresh after your week's break last week?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE:  Very good. Sleeping well. Don't feel tired, I'm good now. I've got another two rounds to go. Keep trying hard. I'm striking the ball well, just a couple of shots that I pulled but generally good.   
  
  Q.  Is it harder for you to play on home soil?   
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: It's a tough course and it's not an easy week. If you miss your driver, you'll be in trouble. But so far so good. I'm happy.
