Q. You started out very, very strong.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I start very good on the front nine.  Back nine, struggling a little bit because the wind is very strong on the back nine that we played.  I played solid.  Holed some putts today and one bad putt, one or two shots.  The course conditions today, windy today and tough to play today.  I think the back nine is going to be tougher than the front nine.
Q. Tell us what happened on the final hole.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: My final hole, we had two on.  We had very good tee shot and iron shot but 3-putt on the last.  Slopey and have to putt, I think we are downhill, up and down, but we just miss about three feet for birdie.  But it's okay, we try tomorrow.
Q. Yesterday was such scorable conditions but you finished with even par.  Today 4-under.  Did you feel better today?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Today better.  Yesterday we struggle with everything.  We hit in the water.  We hit everywhere and more fairway yesterday but even the putting is not good.  Today I hit more greens today.  That's why -- yesterday we had less greens, about 11 or 10 greens.  That's why we had even par yesterday.
Q. Now you're still quite a fair few shots back from the leader.  What will your strategy be going out tomorrow?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think this golf course, you have to keep shots on the fairway, because the greens are soft right now.  The greens is very good speed, not very quick but good for play.  You can see a low score.  Depends on the weather.  If you have bad weather tomorrow, it's going to be tough.
Q. Back to the driving range for you tomorrow?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think we rest today.  We spend about five weeks in a row, play a lot of golf.  Take some time off and rest for tomorrow.
