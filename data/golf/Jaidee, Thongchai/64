  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I played very well today.   I'm starting well, I start on the back nine, very consistent.   I think this week, it's going to be‑‑ I think the course is fantastic, the setup, the weather and the greens is fantastic.   I'm not complaining about anything. 
My game plan today, hit irons very well, putting is getting better, 6‑under now, hopefully tomorrow good weather again I think.   I know the score is quite low, low score today, because the condition is perfect and the green is good, other people is a lot under par.   I think leader get to maybe 10‑under today. 

Q.   And this weather is just like at home, isn't it? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think it's not very humid, it's good for play golf.   Warm, but it's okay.   Some guys a bit hot, but for me, I use it, it's better, like my country.   It's good for playing golf today.
