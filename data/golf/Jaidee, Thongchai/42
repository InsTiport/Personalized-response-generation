 Q.   Are you relatively happy with that?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, it's okay but it was tough today, tough conditions.   You don't want to miss the fairway.   You have to be careful, very difficult from the rough.   Pins were tough, as well.   You have to be‑‑ this course, you have to be fairway and greens and you're okay.   The setup is quite tough.   I think it's fair.   
You had to have good driver and good iron play and you don't get any wrong.   But the problem is if you miss it, driving‑‑ it's good for me.   Under par is awesome, some long putts like the last hole, very good putt.   Only have one bogey, two birdie, very happy with my round.   
You know, first day, under par is very good for me this golf course, very tough.  
   
 Q.   1‑under for the tournament after round one, you're in contention.   You must be very confident moving into round two.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Tomorrow, I look forward.   Tomorrow I hope is more better than today.   I hit driver not very good today, a lot of rough and some holes, it's quite good putt, and two long putts, like No. 11 and 18.   If not hole that one, even par on the last one.   Try and look forwards to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   What were the greens like today?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think it's good.   For everyone, it's a fair course.   I don't think it's going to be‑‑ the greens, it's okay.   It's good, everything good.   Everyone can continue.   It's tough, the setup is very tough.
