 Q.  Very, very close game today.  You must be very proud to get out with a halved.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, we stuck in the front nine not in my game.  (Indiscernible) really steep.  I told you about three days ago about very not get up very hundred percent.  I hit a bad mistake today.   
You know, Bubba not inform me.  I think he a bit tired.  For me good comeback on the back nine.  I think definitely we had a bad drive and then we make a good putt, good par, you know.   
I thought that we maybe lose, but doesn't matter.  We halve point.  He can be happy with me.   
I think today I had a lot of pressure put on my own, you know.  That's why.   
 Q.  Yes, a lot of pressure.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, a lot of pressure.  And I think we make it halve point it's going to be good.   
 Q.  How has this experience been for you on the international team?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: For me, I think we learn a lot.  I think the pressure can be a lot.  We had a good drive.  The wind blow so hard from left to right, otherwise here is very easy.   
For him, I think if he think he attack the pin he going to be very --   
 Q.  Very brave.  Go?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, very brave.  He going to be not lose -- not definitely lose, but no lose.  Gonna be doesn't matter.   
It's good fun and then good to help for the international team.
