  Q. How was it?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: It was good today, I played really well. The pins were tough on the front nine where I was even par and on the back nine, I missed some holes but came back nicely with birdies on 16 and 17 and then missed a birdie on the last hole. Good round, two under today.  
  
  Q. Winds didn't make it any easier obviously?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: It was windy today which made it tougher. Back nine is normally okay but the winds were strong. The par three 12 was tough as it was playing downhill and downhill to a tough pin.   
  
  Q. Highlights?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Made a long birdie on 16 from 20 feet. The rest of the birdies were from close range.  
  
  Q. Thoughts for tomorrow?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I'll need to keep playing the tee shots well. It's important as the greens are firming up. The course has become harder and harder. The pins have been tough the last two rounds and it'll certainly be tougher tomorrow.  
I'm trying my best. Will try to attack the pins when I have a chance tomorrow. But making pars is also okay on this course.  
  
  Q. Good to see Jyoti Randhawa and Lin Wen-tang up on the leaderboard too?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: This week is a strong field with all the good players which good for Asian golf. It's a big event and nice to see a few of us on the leaderboard.
