 Q.   Your thoughts on winning through to the final of this tournament?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, very happy with that.   I played solid game today.   Had a lot of good shots today.   Started very well on the first couple holes, and then stuck in a couple holes and then to come back on the back nine‑‑ playing well, we needed to hole on the back nine.   Very enjoyed my golf game and also played my own game.   Very nice guy and enjoy to play with him.  
In golf with match play, you never know, I keep trying to play my own game and look something about‑‑ it's all what he plays.   I think really enjoyed that, enjoyed the course, most important, and enjoyed the weather.  
   
 Q.   Looked like you were in control of your game; you say solid, you did look like you had the measure of most shots out there.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, you have to relax, like this week, I m really relaxed.   I really like my golfing right now, really consistent and also putting getting better, the most important.   The green is very tricky, a lot of long reads this course, and definitely I win the match today, I think come to the final, look forward for the final in the afternoon.   Will be very tired in the afternoon.  
   
 Q.   When you say relaxed, it seems like a relaxed week after maybe some pressures in the group stage but you came through those so easily?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Some guys do it and sometimes they get pressure.   In golf everyone has‑‑ hard to relax before the tournament.   I know my performing right now, try to get better but then last time, I hit irons very well, driver very well.   It's just putting a little bit stuck.   I'm trying in the afternoon, what's going on this afternoon, playing with McDowell, I think it will be fun for this afternoon, yeah.   
   
 Q.   It does look like it's going to be Graeme in the final, so what are your thoughts on tackling the top seed here?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I really enjoy to play everyone.   McDowell he's a nice guy.   I played with him a couple times.   I know what he does very well.   He do very well at The Ryder Cup and I know he's a star player for The Ryder Cup.   I watch him play many times.   He played so well in The Ryder Cup.   He likes to play with McIlroy, he came second last year.   Really very strong pair.   
   
 Q.   You're strong yourself.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I try my best anyway.
