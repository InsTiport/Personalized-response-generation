 Q.  Thoughts on the start?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Start very good on the front nine.  Back nine, after 12 holes, we had 7-under.  Struggling on 6, bogey on 6 -- bogey on 5 and bogey on 8.  That's why I make these two bogeys in the round.   
We still enjoy, and then pretty good round for me.  I think the key thing is the front nine, we are putting very well but then I started struggling with the putting a little bit because the pin positions quite tough on the back nine.   
Still, 5-under, I don't mind.  Pretty good for me.  Good start for the front nine.   
 Q.  It's a very long course, isn't it, and it's playing long in the rain, as well, I guess.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, but luckily we have not very much wind today.  That's why you can hit iron second shot.  For me it's okay today.  Not too bad for the weather.  Just slightly rain and not very windy.  That's good for you can see the score quite low today because the wind is not strong today.   
That's why a little bit quiet today, just a couple rain, but still okay.  The pins, the greens are soft enough, and the fairways wide.  If you can hit the ball in the fairway, you can have a chance on second shot.
