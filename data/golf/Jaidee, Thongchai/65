  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Very good week, I lost to him by 2 & 1, only one mistake on 14, only mistake, one bogey we had.   I think is solid week for me and congratulations to McDowell, he played solid and very good play.   Anyway, he won the tournament.   
For me, it's not lose, come second, that's good for me.   That's big enough for me this week.   If no win, I don't care, come to second anyway is big, very good tournament.   
Good to be here, and then thank you to Volvo for invite to come here.   I think it's more important the tournament is so great tournament here, yeah.   
   
 Q.   And you were superb on the front nine moving 2‑up and could even have been 4‑up had he not holed those critical putts.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, exactly.   He holed a lot of critical putts anyway.   He never missed a putt every hole.   He hole all the putts, even save par like No. 4 and No. 5, and another hole, 9, 10.   That's where the game changed a little bit.   
I don't care, I don't mind; if we win, we win, if not win, I don't mind.   Keep try and then try and come second, I'm very happy with that, yeah.  
   
 Q.   And lovely form to take into Wentworth.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, exactly.   I'm keep performing like right now, good chance, and I don't know what's going on for next week, the weather, most important the weather out there different I think.   I hope, cross my fingers for good weather for next week, yeah.
