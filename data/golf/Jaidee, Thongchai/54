  CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   You must be a little bit happier than yesterday.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, exactly, our team played very well today, catch up at some point.   Really happy with three points today.   I think catch up a little bit tomorrow, we try tomorrow and another ten points tomorrow.   I hope it's very top match tomorrow and Europe they have very good players and also very strong team.   
We are playing tomorrow and‑‑ it's out of my hands for singles tomorrow.   I think first of all, we would like to thank our team they played very well today, and yesterday, today a little bit different coming back.   Hopefully tomorrow make some‑‑ I think tomorrow, everything, I can't expect tomorrow‑‑ I will try my team work and hopefully we do a good job tomorrow.   
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   A lot of red scores on the leaderboard, I'm sure you must be really pleased to see that.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Foursomes is very difficult, you can maybe up‑and‑down very easy.   Sometimes it's difficult to make up‑and‑down because you play‑‑ it's very tough to play foursome.   In four‑ball, it's very, very easy, you play with your partner, you team work together, four‑ball.   And also, I think it's more difficulty I think alternate than foursome.   
The Japanese players, they did a good job today, I think they 1‑up after 16 and all‑square 17 and 18 have a half point from that match.   I think it's good team work today, good pairing, and also we put all the right players all together.   That's why we need to have three points today.   
   
 Q.   You and Kiradech I think played foursomes in 7‑under, and I think your opposition went out in 5‑under.   Is there a slight tinge of frustration that you were not able to get the full point?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, I think Miguel, anyway, yesterday and today, he had four eagles for two rounds and that's why I lose yesterday.   Today we are even because they played so well, they putted like amazing.   Told all the players yesterday‑‑ get something to make for them, I think that's why Miguel‑‑ I play with him all this week.  
Yesterday we have 8‑under par, eight birdies, and today we have five, six birdies today, so it's a half point today.   I think it's a really good match, really good, very good team work all together.   Miguel is a great player and also he played with Pablo LarrazÃ¡bal, I think he's like team work matching.   
Foursomes, I recommend foursomes for difficult.   Miguel maybe put very good player and they have some point.   Might be tomorrow I think different game tomorrow.   I think ten points tomorrow, and we make‑‑ each for other team, I try my best tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Your team needs more than seven points to win the trophy.   As captain, is there anything that you want to say to your team tomorrow morning?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, seven and a half points to win.   The golf, you never know tomorrow.   We somehow tomorrow single, the plan‑‑ I cannot expect who win tomorrow.   I try my best.   Our team I think that‑‑ I know it's not easy to make something for talk tomorrow and any talk tomorrow, any game plan tomorrow, I told my team work together, this evening we get together and we have some points to make things tomorrow about playing tomorrow.   I think we plan it tomorrow very important.   
Put the ball in the fairway, make chance and get on the green and putting well, and we win.   Anything that can happen tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Is there a bit of disappointment in yourself when you see that finish, they have a chance to get four points?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   You know, Europe they play all together for a long time.   They have a lot of team work like this.   They have so many tournaments like this.   
I recommend they have more opportunities to have some point.   But they try to make some point, that's why the key for Europe, they have very strong mental.   Our team, I think some players have no experience.   That's the key point.   But you know, this event, the first time EurAsia Cup, I think we need more experience to make some players to make a future.   
Otherwise the players, I think it's very good for our team and also have some points.   I played very well today and our team played very well.   Maybe we get four points or something but Europe they have very good players.   
   
 Q.   Are you going to be leading from the front again tomorrow?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Difficult question.   I think tomorrow will be another ten points.   The plan, our players be in form tomorrow, play solid, hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens, make a lot of good putts.   
Tomorrow the game plan will be very solid.   You have to hit the ball in the fairway and then make a chance to hit a shot, even you hit a lot of fairways, you can't miss anything, because the course is not very long.   But most important tomorrow, I told my players, no need to go long.   If you hit a lot of fairways, you can make some chance to make some points tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Would you like to have a rematch with Graeme McDowell from the Volvo World Match Play tomorrow?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I play with Miguel, he's a very good ball, he can control the ball.   You can see the replay on the TV‑‑ if I play normal, I think I'm going to be not good.   He's just so tough and he's unbelievable when he played four eagle for two rounds.   I lose by two points‑‑  
   
 Q.   Are you going to go against‑‑  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I change my plan tomorrow.   Tough for me tomorrow.   I don't want to lose.   I want to change my plan because Miguel‑‑ no one can beat him.   I can tell that no one can beat him.   You can see he played today and yesterday so amazing.   He can make up‑and‑down and putting everywhere.   He's so, so, so tough.   Maybe something happen tomorrow but I try my best tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You've always said win or lose it doesn't matter; will it be the same tomorrow?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, exactly, that's why I said to my players, win or lose, I think we‑‑ don't lose because win or lose, just win one or two.   Now the thing is about win, win or lose, doesn't matter.   Win is more important.   
Still a good chance tomorrow, another ten points.   We have another day tomorrow.   I understand what we need tomorrow and I don't put any pressure for them and left them to play and enjoy the tournament and if not possible.   
   
 Q.   Six points is basically your first‑‑ the team from Japan playing well, do you feel, the not so strong players‑‑ like they want to match up?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Tomorrow, different.   Tomorrow, singles, we have different format.   Yesterday and today‑‑ today and yesterday, tomorrow is single, going to be different planning, because you play all your own game and also you have to, I think concentrate your game, you play yourself and you play with the course.   
Somehow you look, I think all my players, enjoy the game tomorrow, play your own game, that's the game plan, and also game have to, and you can play very well and anything can happen tomorrow.   Our team, I think it's strong enough but except tomorrow‑‑ yesterday, we put players together and we lose match and today we have three points.   You never know tomorrow, I try my best.   I told my players to make something happen tomorrow.   
CHUAH CHOO CHIANG:   Thanks very much and good luck tomorrow.
