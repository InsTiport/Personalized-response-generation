 Q.   Tell me about how it's been not only today but over three days here at Sun City?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I played well last two rounds, except today I couldn't hole any driver on the fairway.   That's why big par 5, maybe put the ball‑‑ tee shot into the bunker and that's why no chance to get birdie.  
I think game plan has been ‑‑ putting been getting better.   I holed a long putt on 4, maybe a hundred feet, something like that.   I played quite well.   Played nicely.   But the course is very tricky.   The wind changes direction all the time.   That's why everyone is struggling a little bit.   You can see everyone play the front nine pretty good but back nine drop it off.   Today, the course you have to know about the wind direction exactly.  
Me I play quite nicely this week, 1‑under par, 2‑under par, 1‑under par.   Still I got I think one more day to go, what happens tomorrow, I think going to keep in mind feeling like this, I think good chance to be like Top‑5, Top‑10.   For me, last two events, one more tournament next week, and hopefully play well tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Tell me about the putt.   Did you think it was in all the way, because it was huge?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The thing is I haven't holed a long putt like this in my life, first time in about four or five years.   You never know, your feeling is very bad and putting is not too good.  
This week I think especially I change a little bit for working like a backswing have to be square and that help me a little bit.   Putting, otherwise very confident with putting.   Anyway we put the ball on the green and we try to hole the putt, even miss some short putts, long putt, whatever, still under par is good.
