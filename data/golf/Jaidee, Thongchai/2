 Q.  It was a tough day out there today.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, I played good today anyway, only one double bogey on the last hole.  I played solid today.  I played great today.   
 Q.  It was important to win today because didn't you pick up a point yesterday.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yesterday we played hard.  Good performing the play.  You hole a lot of good putt.  In match play, you never know.  You try to get no upset, try to get my thing, my performing back.  Like today I played great, you know.  There's no complaint at all.  Really enjoy playing match play.
