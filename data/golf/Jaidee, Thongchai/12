THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I'm very happy with 1-under par again today.  Yesterday had 4-under, today 1-under.  The conditions was tough.  Even the front nine, the front nine, the pin position was tough.   
The course setup, it's very tough this year.  Luckily the green are softer than normal.  That's okay.  But the wind condition, the course, it effected a lot.  A couple holes is going to be difficult to control.  Even the fairways very difficult, that's why we're very happy to be 1-under par today.  I hit irons well but not many greens.  A lot of chip up-and-down.  One chip on 18 that made they think confidence back.   
But still good challenge anyway.  5-under par, for Saturday and Sunday, going to be try my work tomorrow again.   
 Q.  I know most weeks are the same, but it's almost a week when you really need the right attitude, don't you, when you're playing at this course?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, exactly.  You have to be -- this golf course, especially, you have to have a game plan and also you have to hit straight, like good tee shot.  That's the most important.  You miss the fairway, that's going to be the killing.  We miss about two and three fairways today.  Still lay-up, like 17 -- 13, 17 and No. 1, we chip out.   
Still anyway, don't make any double.  Make bogey, that's okay.  A couple holes, the par 5, you can make birdie on the par 5.  It's very, very hard to play today also.  Anyway, it's going to make me confident back for Saturday and Sunday.
