 Q. Talk about your round today. 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I played very well. The front nine, I hit so good and I missed so many holes. I missed birdie and bogey 9, I missed on the right side, hit in the water and made a bogey, very good bogey from there. Then I made bogey, wrong club over the green. Very good come back on the back nine. Started with birdie 10, birdie 11, and that's a very good come back on the back nine and chip-in on No. 15. Played well today. I'm enjoying it.
 The green is tricky to me sometimes. It's bumpy. I'm very happy with my score today.

 Q. What do you have to do tomorrow?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: If you hit tee shots very well, second shot very easy on the green. My plan every day is hit a lot of fairway and then hit all of the greens, and putting is I think -- the green is quite difficult. 
 Sometimes you have a long line and you have a long position and it's difficult to putt. That's always the same, hitting the fairway and hit the green and good putt and then putt well and it's going to be a low score.

 Q. With the greens the way they are, do you think you might go work on a little putting today? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: On the back nine, quite good on the back nine, putting very good on the back nine. I'm feeling I'll practice a little bit after this, practice a little bit the putting and it will be better tomorrow.
