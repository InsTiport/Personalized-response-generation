 Q.   You had such a tough day yesterday, happier today?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, exactly, three points today, myself, play well.   So our team is playing our game, and a halve today is good for me, playing with Miguel, I really enjoyed that and my team played well, as well.   We have three points and tomorrow another day.   Tomorrow we are singles and ten points tomorrow.   Have to plan this afternoon, hopefully very good for tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   At one stage it looked as though you might lose all five matches; it was quite tight.   Are you happy with the end of the day?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   At the end of the day I'm happy.   It's good to halve a couple of matches and another one, make two points today,7‑3, it's a tough day, here until the heat and they played very well and we also played very well.   You know, this is match play, and foursomes, it's tough.   Tough matches and as you say, at one point, it looks like they are going to be lopsided like yesterday but we managed to get the points and that's good.   
   
 Q.   How much was the weather a factor for you today because it really was hot.   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Yeah, it's very hot.   It's very humid.   Every single hole, you need to hydrate yourself, it's very important and these conditions, very tough for us.   
   
 Q.   Your plans for tomorrow?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   We plan, planning for tomorrow, the draw‑‑ inaudible‑‑ 3 1/2 points, even though it's hard but tomorrow very hard work.   I try my best.   I hope we play well again tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   You'd have led from the front; is that the plan again tomorrow?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   You never know what's going to happen.   Both teams are playing well as you can see and it's going to be an interesting day tomorrow.   We see what happens.   The clubs have to talk tomorrow and it's going to be a tough day.   We are not used to this weather, and they have good teams and just try to keep focus and get the points as soon as possible.   
We both try to do our best with putting the players there, and we'll see.   We'll have to play tomorrow and it's ten more points to play for tomorrow, and you never know what's going to happen.   
   
 Q.   Your thoughts on 7‑3?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It's very nice at the end, no, because at some point on the golf course, it looks like we are going to be on the other side of the coin, like yesterday we are on the other side.   But then we managed to find two points today and 7‑3 for tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   I guess it's what you expected, you expected them to have a good five back?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Of course.   They are good players and they are used to this kind of weather.   At the end, we managed to get two points.   They managed to get three points today and keep the competition alive.  
   
 Q.   From your perspective, that was a high‑quality match, wasn't it?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   It was a very high‑quality match.   We managed to have half a point, the whole day, both teams playing very well today.   
   
 Q.   What are your thoughts into singles?   
MIGUEL ANGEL JIMÃNEZ:   Well, we try to see for tomorrow.   It's ten more points on the singles tomorrow, and trying to do your best.
