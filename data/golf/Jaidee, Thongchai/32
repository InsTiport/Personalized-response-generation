Q. That was a huge putt at the end to seal it off.  Just talk us through the match?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It was tight all the way but fortunate for us, we combined well.  So we kept ourselves in the holes the whole way, and you know, they had chances, we had chances, but I think I made two big putts just to get ahead.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: We had a good putter and he played so good today.  Our team is very good, he putting so well today, that's why make me more confident.  Just good team.  My team here, Charl is great player.  You can see he holed a putt.  His mind is too strong, that's why can make putt to win the match.  That's good.
Q. Were you looking at the scoreboard, a lot of blue up on the day did that encourage you being the last match out here?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: It's hard, you see all the blue up on the board but it's hard to focus on what they are doing.  We had a tough match, Chris and Bill is very good players.  We had to get our point.  I think at the end that's the only thing you can really control.
Q. You sat out yesterday, first game today.  How are you feeling this morning in?
CHARL SCHWARTZEL: I felt a lot better this morning.  I wasn't feeling 100 percent yesterday.  I got a bad flu and body was aching.  So I think it was a good thing I sat out.  Made me more ready to play today.
Q. With this win now, 4-all, a lot to look forward to over the next two sessions.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: That's what I think about, we had a meeting yesterday with your team, it's the right players to put together, that's why more confident today.  For me game is not 100 percent, I'm struggling a little bit with my shoulder this morning, because last night very bad sleep.
But anyway, we had a very good putter.  Charl is the best, play so well, more confident with him.  I know his game and he knows my game.  That's the most important for our team today.
