Q.   Thoughts on the day? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Front nine, played quite well.   Putting challenge for me.   The driver, it worked today.   Irons a little bit‑‑ but still it's very tight.   I'm 4‑under today, even 4‑under today, going to be a good chance for tomorrow.   It's a position right now, I don't know, going to be three or four, five behind tomorrow. 

My game today, I think the key is putting.   We hit short putts nice, 11 and 12.   I think we had good up‑and‑down on 13.   We make good par.   We went into the hazard on the left for third shot and chipping now from off the green, and very tough and we come back from that hole. 
I think the key is I think putting helps me a lot.   I don't mind, the course is so good.   Worry about the weather today, but anyway, 13‑under, 4‑under today, very good round for me. 

Q.   Was it slightly harder out there today?   Certainly other players have struggled a little.   Pin positions tricky?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think the pin positions tricky today because all the pin sometimes have to adjust the pins a little bit.   The pin is sometimes very dangerous.   You can't miss anywhere.   You miss long‑‑ some players stuck with the pin positions.   You have to be in the right place. 

Q.   You said you are still feeling weak, so how do you maintain any strength and positivity when you're feeling bad? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Try to get easy.   That's the first thing I have to do.   I can't hit the ball very hard like normal.   I hit a lot behind the ball today, not the correct distance, sometimes by five or ten yards today.   The first one we had a long putt anyway from the left side, about 20 yards.   That's why make me confident, very good.   I don't mind miss anywhere, left, right, you can chip‑and‑putt.   Anyway, you never know.   I try tomorrow anyway.   Today, yes, 4‑under is very good for me.
