Q.   What is your verdict on the week? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Very good.   Nice to be back on the back nine.   I start struggling on first hole, we have 5‑over on first four holes.   I think we come back‑‑ the weather is so challenging for everyone.   The wind changed direction, as well, and gusting, and played so difficult.   We start on the back, it's going to be a little bit better, the weather.   Otherwise we come back very good after that. 
Anyway, I try my best, anyway, give me a good chance.   Anyway.   I know the course play soft anyway, and it's a challenge where I know the course it's going to be very soft today.   You couldn't hole anything because the weather is rain and wind and course played very long today. 

Q.   Have you ever had a round like that, 5‑over for four holes and chipped in and birdie after birdie and you had a victory chance. 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, when we hit the ball on 10, two behind‑‑ I think Graeme, he played very well today anyway.   I'm very happy with my second game this week.   It's a big tournament anyway.   I'm happy with my game, and I thank all the sponsors.

Q.   Good for World Rankings? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I don't know how far you can do.   That's the most important, play well, anyway, we try to move up a little bit for my ranking.   That's why we need to be in top position.
