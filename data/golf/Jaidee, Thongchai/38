  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Very good to come in second, pretty good for me for the course here.   I know I play a Top‑10 before.   I'm not complain about my golf game this week.   Fantastic game, putting, everything coming back.   Driving something is a little bit shaky but maybe come back with that putter.   Anyway, golf, you never know.   I think the best week for me this week.

Q.   The way you started with the birdies in succession, anything could have happened. 
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I played solid for the front nine.   I never miss anything, only one, get up‑and‑down anyway.   I think my game, this final, only one bad hole, miss a short putt, miss a short putt on 14 again.   Miss a birdie on the last hole.   Golf, it's okay, I put pressure on a couple holes, very tough on the back nine anyway. 
    It's good for me to come back second.   I don't complain about my game. 

Q.   Is there anything you can say about the first Asian winner of this event?
    THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, nice to see an Asian boy win the tournament anyway.   This is a big tournament in Europe.   This guy, I saw he played a lot of times, he played very well.   You can see many weeks.   This one, you see he played today, I think he played really solid today.   Even eagle on 12, it's very good to see.   He's very young.   Yeah, I think he has more confidence now.   He can be the star player of the future.
