Q. How do you think you played today?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I did okay today but I missed quite a few putts, I think if I had taken a few more of the chances that I had I could have been a couple more under par because I only made one bogey all day. It was a little funny where I dropped that shot though because it was at the seventh hole where yesterday I bounced out of the water - today I hit a sprinkler head and bounced over the back of the green! I suppose the luck has evened itself out on that hole at least. On the back nine I hit every one of the nine greens but I couldn't get the ball in the hole, I even three putted the tenth for par after having been on the green in two, it was that type of day.
