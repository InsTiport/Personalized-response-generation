Q. Comment on your round?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I am pretty happy because I got a bit lucky towards the end of my round on the seventh hole, I hit my shot right into the water but it hit a stone and bounced back out and I  made par so that was a really lucky break. I can't ever remember that happening to me before.  There is a lot of water out there even though it is a desert course but I try not to look for that, I try to concentrate on the middle of the fairway. It was quite windy out there which made things quite difficult and every hole if you are not on the fairway you can have a problem. There are a lot of holes that are very hard indeed into the wind, like No. 5 where I had to hit a five wood for my second shot.
Q. How good a round was that in the conditions?

THONGCHAI  JAIDEE: Pretty good. Obviously I was not happy to three putt the final green but I only had one bogey in total today so overall I am pretty happy with that. We have three more rounds to go so I will see how we go with those, but I will be trying my best.
