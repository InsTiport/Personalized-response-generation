  Third Round 68. 12-Under Total. 198

 Q. Tell us about your day?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I played okay. First, start bad, bogeyed the first hole, bogeyed the last hole. I hit bad on the last hole, very big bounce and went to the left side, then we have lay up. Putting is good. 
 But you know, just a couple of -- it's okay. Played okay. Front nine, very quiet. Every hole, 2-putt, 2-putt, 2-putt. Back nine is good, back nine is quite easy and I played well on the back nine. 
 I'm enjoying it. One more day tomorrow. 

 Q. Are you disappointed that you didn't move high enough? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: You know, golf, you never say that. Keep my game -- it's okay. You know, sometimes you need a good putt. You have some good putts and bad putts anyway. It's okay, 2-under par today, is great but not great, it's okay.

 Q. Was this all down to putting? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: No, I hit the shot, iron shot is not too good, still on the green but not close. It's okay. Sometimes you need to hit the ball very well. I need to hit a little on the driving range practise.

 Q. A few shots behind the leader, what will you try to do tomorrow?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: If I play okay, Top-10 is going to be okay, and if not, no problem, you keep trying. Tomorrow, maybe low score tomorrow.

 Q. What do you think of Poulter's 60 yesterday?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yesterday you know it depends. Today you're feeling very well, everything can happen, everything you can putt in, everything you can make it very good. Yeah, you know, this course, I tell you what, if you hit the ball very well from the tee, tee shot very good, second shot, no problem.
