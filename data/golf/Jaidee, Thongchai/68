 Q.   Tell us how good it is to register two victories and to already be through to the next round?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   First win, very happy with that.   My performing right now is getting a lot better.   The Match Play I think is not easy.   You have to watch out there.   I play very well.   I went 1‑up‑‑ 17, made birdie at 17, otherwise didn't lose anymore on the last hole, par is very good.   
Very solid round today again, same as yesterday, five birdies and yesterday, I think ‑‑ my opponent now for tomorrow, don't know.   It's lucky today we had the forecast is going to be very windy in the afternoon, we finish before the windy coming.   That's lucky.   
   
 Q.   You said it's not easy and to go the distance like that, does it get more and more nervous, more edgy?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   No, the thing is, you know about the game like this before, we've played it a lot of times, match play.   Sometimes it's going to give you pressure and you're going to be not in form, sometimes get pressure.   For me, I don't care, a loss is a loss and a win is happy, loss is not so dramatic I think.
