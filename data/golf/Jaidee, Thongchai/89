 Q. A 68, how pleased are you with that?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Good. I think the start, I had very put today. We just change my belly putter last week, so second week and I'm very confident and good start because I had my game plan very good today. I hit a lot of shots very well, very good. Irons still are so-so. Just putting is going to be work this week. Putting today it really work and very good game plan, because the course is tough the last four holes, 15, 16, 17, 18, quite tough. It's very good course, and I play very solid today. 

 Q. So is it a case of make your score first 14 holes and then hold on?
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, 14 holes, I think it's tough hole, long par five. I hit tee shot in, not very good, went into the right rough and it's quite thick on that and we use a 6-iron there, we had another 7-iron. I think very good putt from that. We had about 20 feet putt, very good putt from that. Okay, birdie and then bogey on 17, it's not good that one. It's okay, but, you know, good start and then you need good feeling back, miss the cut three weeks in a row. 
 I hope my game, looking forward for tomorrow. Exactly the same game plan, the wind, chances on some holes but that's okay. Very happy with 3-under. 

 Q. Is this a course you have liked to come to in the past? 
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: You know, the course, this year I think they make the fairways wider, a little bit wider, and some holes like longer, like the 7th hole, a tough hole. If you make birdie on 7, that's a good shot, good tee shot and good second shot. It's about two feet from second shot we hit that. And okay, I hope -- I had one bogey today, very good start. I hope -- I mean, my feeling, my game is going to be good chance for next few rounds.
