 Q.  Six birdies, a flawless round.  You must be very happy with yourself?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, very happy with my result today.  I played great today.  But you know, obviously made a lot of putts but hit a lot of greens.  We hit a lot of fairways today and that's why we make some good putts.  Hit irons very good.  That's why we took 6-under today.   
Very, very solid round today and missed only two or three greens today.  Hit 15 greens.  That's why we make very good round.   
 Q.  How much did it help that conditions were slightly calmer than they were yesterday?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, the thing is the wind is dropping down.  Last few holes it's a bit stronger but still better than yesterday.  The greens are softer and the conditions are not very windy.  That's why you can see a low score today.  Jordan Spieth shoot 9-under today.   
I'm very happy with my round, 6-under for 10-under going into the final round tomorrow.  10-under is a pretty good score anyway.  I'm happy with that.   
 Q.  Do you feel like you're within striking distance, though?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: You know, this week is going to be a strong field anyway.  We try to play low, under par, anyway, we're very happy with that.  The plan is the same thing, hit a lot of fairways, hit a lot of greens.  That's what you need to do tomorrow and hole some putts for tomorrow.   
 Q.  You played a lot of golf, five weeks straight and could be six next week and onwards and onwards.  How are you feeling?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I think a bit tired.  This week going to be tired.  But the other week, we catch up a little bit.  We had good sleep and good family this week, so very happy to come see my family all together and enjoy my golf game right now, anyway, enjoy it in Shanghai.
