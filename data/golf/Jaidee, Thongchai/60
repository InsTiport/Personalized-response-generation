  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I played well.   I hit a lot of fairways and made some good putts this week.   I think the most important, I think the game plan, very good today.   I think both putting better than last few weeks.   Keeping up, I think the key is to have the position to hit on the green.   Otherwise, the greens are very tricky.   
Even like 17 is a tough hole.   Lucky we had forward tee today, hit not very long.   It's okay, I had one bad hole on 9.   I hit a bad second shot today and made doubleâ€‘bogey on 9.   
Comfortable, I enjoy to play the course.   The greens roll very well I think.   Good for challenging.   The score is not very high.   If someone have a good putt and have some good irons, going to be a good chance.   
We are not far, anyway now, the leader maybe 9.   Two more rounds, so I really enjoy to play and I think if my performing with driving is good and iron is better, putting is getting better also.
