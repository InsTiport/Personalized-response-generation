 Q.   How good for you is 3‑under par when you had it really going?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I front nine we played very good and back nine, stumbled a little bit on 14.   Very bad drive on 14.   Hit left, good bogey on that hole.   Otherwise, no complaints about anything.   Very good round for me today.   Even the wind like this that's hard to play in.   Performance is very good.   I had 68 today, 3‑under.   I really enjoyed that.   I keep my thing‑‑ last few weeks I had a hand injury and tried to recover.   Still hurts but we tried to play like relaxed and solid, otherwise hit very easy.   Hit the ball not hard and try to control it in the fairway.   Still hurts.   I really enjoyed it.   I like the course.   Nice to be back here again.  
   
 Q.   What did you do to your hand?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Indiscernible ‑‑ leaning forward, my hand is hurt‑‑ takes about three weeks to get recover.   Still hurts but I think try to get recover for the future, anyway.   
   
 Q.   You said you always enjoy coming here.   I presume there's always wonderful memories when you've won a tournament like this.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, always great memories in here.   It can happen here and you never know.   Try to get‑‑ you have to think a lot because it's quite a hard course.   14 is a very tough hole.   The course is very challenging.   Here you can't say anything is bad.   You have to have a perfect like tee shot, iron and putting.   You have to be all together perfect.   
   
 Q.   What do you think of The Ryder Cup, seeing as you've been playing alongside Thomas BjÃ¶rn and Stephen Gallacher who are going up to Gleneagles this week?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Totally different format.   You play in match play, and you never think slow play, playing with a partner, you have to play together.   I played with Thomas and Gallacher today.   He's just struggling a little bit.   I don't mind watching, playing different match, format, anyway.   I think it's nice to watch for The Ryder Cup.   For me I enjoy to play with them, Ryder Cup players, both of them.   Really enjoy to play with them and very nice guys, and very enjoy to play with them.  
   
 Q.   Do you watch?   As a player from Thailand, but you know everybody on The European Tour and plenty on the United States side.   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I love to watch anything golf.   If I'm back home, I'm still home, I'm still watching The European Tour anyway.   We watch every tournament at home.   I enjoy to watch.   I love golf.   I love the sport.   It's the second one we're watching is football.   That's a good thing for me.
