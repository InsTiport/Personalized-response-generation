Q. Tremendous win.  We know Paul Casey's ability in this format, and you have taken him down 2-1.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I'm enjoying playing with him.  He's a good guy and also the game is a very close one on the front nine.  He has some miss there on 9.  We lose one on front nine.  Come back on the back nine, I hit a bad second shot on 10.  Hit it in the bunker.  Make a good bogey, so you're 1-up.
Hit a pretty good shot on the par-3, 11 hole, 2-up from there.  Then he missed on 14, he miss it.  I make a long putt for birdie, so I was like 3-up.
He played good.  Some putting challenge.  It's the golf course, very tricky.  Even the pin position is also very tough.  It's good to be 2-1.  Birdie 16, we have a good chance to up-and-down on 16, he make birdie and I miss a putt from there.  17 ending.
Q. Just quickly, you've got Jason Day next up.  He's just won his match, but he's got a very bad back.  He's just left the course with a very bad back.  He played Graeme McDowell.  Jason Day, obviously the World No. 2.  This is very challenging group.  How do you react to that news?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I'm okay.  I like to play anybody.  I enjoy to play golf.  In match play, you never know.  I enjoy to play anyway.  You don't make any -- sometimes you make luck, you have lucky.  Sometimes you're performing very well, putting very well.  Match play, for me, I like to play.  Jason is a good guy.  He plays so well.  For me match play, I enjoy play that.
Q. Excellent win.
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Thank you very much.
