 Q.  How do you feel about your round today?  THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Started very good on the front nine.  The back nine, the wind was very strong.  The thing is the course is getting very difficult on the back nine in the afternoon, but the wind is blowing around.  It's really very difficult on the back nine.  The front nine you'll be okay, playing downwind, cross wind.  I think the back nine is going to be hard.  Yeah, it's very tough on back nine today. Even par is okay.  I missed a putt, I think, and the course is fair, fair enough.  The fairways and greens, it's very good conditions.  I definitely think that the wind is blowing up in the afternoon, yeah.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  THONGCHAI JAIDEE: No, I think sometimes you have to have -- you have to know where you want to miss.  I played great today.  The front nine I played good, and on the back nine I had one three-putt today.  Making birdie on the last hole -- last four holes are going to be tough, 15, 16, 17 and 18.  And 14.  Back nine is going to be very tough.  11, 12, 14 until 18.  18 is a short par-4 anyway, it's going to be tough.  Starting with the par-3, downwind, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 all tough today.  You can see with the scores on the back nine, it's going to be very tough today.   Q.  How much do you enjoy playing here?  THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I've been here many years.  I've played Dunhill almost every year.  The thing is the pin positions are different.  We play like today a major.  This week the major the pin is very tough.  You have to be on the right part of the green and you need to be a very good putter for this week.
