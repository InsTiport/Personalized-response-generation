   THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Played very well. I made a lot of putts today, like 13, the par 3, I hit a very long putt for par. And then yeah, started very well, birdied 2, 3, 4, 5, four in a row, and then 3-putted No. 6. Very good comeback.
My plan is to play well today, and nice to play with the weather. It's not very windy. Very good, yeah, happy with that.
