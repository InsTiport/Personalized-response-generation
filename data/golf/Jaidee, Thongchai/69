  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The putting, you have to know where to, played very well couple holes.   My first putt, first three holes, have 2‑down, but then after that, we come back.   You never know at the beginning, I try my best.   My performance right now, perfect is driver, just missing‑‑ putting this, course, you just have to know, it's really tricky.   Anyway, I hit a lot of greens.   
   
 Q.   Birdieing the first three holes, seemed like you had to dig deep‑‑  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Three holes, 2‑down, I play not bad, you have 1‑under par and you have three birdies in a row.   I think it's just‑‑ hit a lot of fairways, otherwise you have to lay up and you have to change your idea, just different format.   This format can be quite easy.   You have to look at who can concentrate on your own game.   
   
 Q.   When you say different format, do you like it?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yes, this one I think normally, when I play before, I play with my coach, my team a lot of time, I played a lot of tournaments as well kind of same as match play, and a lot of tournaments I know that have to play format like this.   
Very, very different from normal format and I really enjoyed it.   
   
 Q.   Were you conscious Ian Poulter wasn't feeling very well today?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   He started very well.   I think he putt well and after that he putting couple holes‑‑ the thing this course, you miss a lot of fairways and a lot of tee shots.   The thing is it's very tricky.   I hit a lot of driver today.   Difficult hole, I think 8, is quite difficult today.   There's a little wind like this.   Very happy with my game.   
   
 Q.   Did you know that he was feeling ill; that he had stomach problems?   
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I had no idea.
