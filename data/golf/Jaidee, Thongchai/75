Q.   Can you share about your week this Hong Kong so far?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I hit the irons fantastic this week, just the putting because the greens are difficult to read and also really tricky. 
This course, the greens are sloped and a lot are grainy.   I think I don't complain about driver and iron, I play so good this week.   Every day, we hit about 14 greens, 15 greens.   But hit a lot of good irons, but difficult to read the greens.   I have bad reads.   I don't complain at all, just putting on the greens, you have to read it and you have to hole some good putts and it's going to be a low score. 
Even the greens are getting firm, it's difficult to hold the pin positions.   So I'm enjoying my golf game right now.   They are very solid.

Q.   How would you describe your season?   It's coming to an end; how would you describe your year this year? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Very good year for me this year.   Better than other years.   After injury, I recover and the thing is‑‑ the most important thing is, we need to win a lot of tournaments, anyway, try to get next week or a week later, I try my best, anyway. 

Q.   How many more events left are you plan to go play on the Tour? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Four I think, at least four. 

Q.   And the Thailand Golf Championship, you've done well there before?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I'm not good last year because last year I got injury last year.   I think this year, very important.   I need to play well, and it's my home country.   I think that's a good week.   I think that World Rankings are very high, also, very important.   Every week are very important, try to win a tournament, and if not possible, try the next one.   I think I look forward for Thailand Golf Championship, and also next week big event in Dubai.
