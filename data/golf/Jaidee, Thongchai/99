  Q. You made a big trip over here, and now you're flying back after this week. I guess it makes it sweeter to extend your week at least another day?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, you know, we planned it very well to be here. We flew from Bangkok.   
 We get here, we have jet lag on the first day. After that, we have very good sleep every day.   
 Then we start today. I have two birdie and one eagle and two bogey. I finish on 14. Largely, we have no trouble and very good game plan today. I came here to win today.  
  
  Q. How does this golf course match your golf game and how good are you playing currently?  
 THONGCHAI JAIDEE: The match play really doesn't make a difference, you know. You have to just play fairway and green. This course, the greens play tough. It's not easy to make a two putt. Sometimes you make a three putt very easy. Sometimes you're on the fairway and it's not easy to hit at the pin. It depends on the pin placement. Sometimes it's very tough. You hit the ball, and then sometimes you're ten meter, you know. And I'm very happy today.  
  
  Q. Thank you.
