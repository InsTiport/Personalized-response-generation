 Q.  Just talk about your match with Bubba.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: I stuck in the front nine, couldn't play well on the front nine.  My back was tight.  Do a lot of physio -- not physio, but tried to do stretching, but not improve my back.  Cold weather, getting something very tight in my body, but not my in form, just something happened.  But good come back on the back nine.  The kind of format today, the conditions, it's very tough.  Wind and rain, very difficult today.  But you have the point, it's okay, but last one, supposed to be, but we lost.   
 Q.  What do you think of your first experience in The Presidents Cup?  How has it been for you?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Good to be on the team.  The team is very good.  This year, very close.  It's something you need to learn, more experience to be on a team.  Sometimes you put your best show on and you're not in form.  I have a lot of pressure on the front nine and also my body not 100 percent.  And also for me, I try to play, anyway, first time in my life, play The Presidents Cup.  Lose only one point, it doesn't matter.  Good try.
