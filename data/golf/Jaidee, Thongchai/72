  THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   The short putts, it's hard to read, different things, the putting is most important.   You miss, I had a lot of good chance at birdie, we miss a couple five, six holes today and it happened on 16, missed short putts and make a bogey.   But back nine going to be tough, 16, 17, 18, with the wind, heavy rain on 16 and 17, hard hole. 
Anyway, it's okay, one more day.

Q.   What are your thoughts about tomorrow? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   I think probably for me, four or five shots at the moment, we never know tomorrow.   6‑, 7‑under is going to be good chance.   Top‑5 would be good for me tomorrow.
