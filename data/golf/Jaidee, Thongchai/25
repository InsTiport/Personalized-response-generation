 Q.  You gave yourself a very good birthday present today, 4-under today.  Wonderful.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Yeah, very good round today.  I played solid, started the front nine, 4-under on the front nine.  Back nine is going to be tough because the wind direction is very tough.  We have one bogey on 15, anyway, very good score, and then good round and then also good tournament.   
 Q.  You must be very happy with your tournament?  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Exactly this, one, World Golf Championships, all the players, Top-50 would be great for me but I don't know if we finish probably Top-10 probably.  Very much enjoy my tournament anyway.  14-under is very good for me this week.   
 Q.  Looking at your season, you've had a wonderful year.  Seems like the older you get, the better you play.  
THONGCHAI JAIDEE: Try to get better, but my training, working with my coach on my golf swing and also next year, going to be try to get my body stronger than this year because it's tough to do something because I have an injury for last year and this year not improve but getting a lot better, 80 per cent and we try to improve for next year.  That's why I think next year, going to try to make my body stronger for next year.
