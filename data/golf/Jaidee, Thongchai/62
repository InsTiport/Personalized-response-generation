Q.   Your thoughts on position over two days, two good days? 
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I play well again today.   Putting is really very good today.   I hit not that good and yesterday I think the key is today, putting, so confident.   That's why I make 3‑under today.   I hit a lot of greens, I hit the 14th green and make a lot of good putts. 
Otherwise, you know, 3‑under is a good score today.   I think top of the leaderboard, we have five shots fine, I think try to make it up tomorrow. 
I think anything is okay for me.   I enjoy to play the course.   The course is fantastic.   It's good weather and the green is good.   The green is good for read.   I think there's no complaint at all. 

Q.   And that putt at the last, that was superb, as well, and certainly boosts the score?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I'm feeling confident, otherwise, we can read the green and we make a good score, and then we made it with a good feeling, otherwise, putting is very well, feeling very well otherwise.   Make me good confidence. 

Q.   And you have been here a few times, so are these greens playing as well as they ever have here?
THONGCHAI JAIDEE:   Yeah, I think this year the green is better.   Looks better than other years we came.   I think they do a lot to make it drain and a lot of the things they did right‑‑ if the rain is coming, it dries up.   That's the most important thing.   I enjoy the course, love the course.
