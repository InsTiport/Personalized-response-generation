Q. Thoughts on finishing in style and shooting a low score again?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, it was pretty tough today compared to the first two days.  I think this wind on this golf course makes it a little tougher.  I think they tucked the flags in a couple unexpected places.  You've got to really take it on if you want to hit it close but there's a lot of trouble around, so I'm pretty happy with 67.
Q. Still racking the birdies up there?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I putted nicely from long range but missed a couple from fairly close.  But you know, at the end of the day, I putted pretty solid and just going to go work on a couple of the short ones but I can't really complain.
Q. Is there confidence as a result of last week?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, definitely.  It always helps to come off a good finish, and I'm playing solid golf.  I'm hitting it good off the tee which is keeping me out of trouble.  If I can just get the irons a little closer, it would help.  But I'm hitting the greens with a lot of 30-footers.  If I can get that to within 15 foot, then hopefully put a bit of pressure on Alex.  I see he's running away with it again.
Q. Well, he's not that far off, is he, because there's low scores around here.
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, there is.  It just depends on the weather and depends on how they set the course up.  Apparently it's supposed to rain tomorrow, so let's see how they set up it up and see what the wind is doing.  He could be four ahead if he birdies 18, but that's still reachable.  You're going to have to putt in a good one now.
Q. You're durable, aren't you, whatever the weather?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, hopefully.  Some days I can play well in the tough conditions.  You've got to hit it pretty good.  So at the moment, I feel pretty good and looking forward to tomorrow.
