RICHARD STERNE:  It's been a good week for me. Always nice to have a good week with all the big players here. Got a bit of experience playing with them and I think I handled myself pretty well and I'm happy with the way I finished.

Had a bit of a sore back on Friday and Saturday but the physios did some good work. I think I handled myself pretty well under pressure. I felt very relaxed out there and it felt quite nice.

I had a look at the leaderboard and I saw a lot of guys were on 12-under and I didn't want to finish on 12. To come in on the last three holes which are not easy holes, to make pars was nice. My putting was good.  It was a big improvement. It's affected my game in recent times, so it was good.
