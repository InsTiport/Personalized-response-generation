 Q.  Coming up a little bit short, but you made it a fantastic start and it was a great battle in the end between you and Shane?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I got off to a hell of a start to be honest, a little unexpected.  I enjoyed the start.  Front nine was really good, I made a few crucial putts and the back nine, I don't know, a couple things didn't go my way and Shane made a couple good putts theory and there.   
17 was a great putt and the shot he hit into 18 was world-class.  It was just out of reach with my 5-wood.  I was thinking about taking driver off the deck.   
 Q.  One of those, just such a tricky hole and a long par 5 to finish and as you say, sometimes the longer hitters do have that little bit of an extra edge.  
RICHARD STERNE: We're pretty much the same yardage.  He's just got a 3-wood and I had 5-wood.  I didn't have a 3-wood in this week, and 284 is a little stretch for a 5-wood.  I tried it and it didn't come off.  He hit a great shot and all credit to him.   
I'm just glad that I gave a good performance this week with a strong field.  It's been a while since I've had a decent tournament, so I'm pretty happy with the way I performed.  Thanks to Abu Dhabi and HSBC for putting on a magnificent event, and Rolex, as well.  Appreciate it.   
 Q.  What are the main positives you take forward from this week?  
RICHARD STERNE: A lot of things I hit the ball really well.  I was up there most of the week and stayed up there the whole tournament basically, and I had a chance right down to the last.  You know, I'm looking forward to the next few weeks now.  I'm feeling good and obviously a little bit sore with not pulling it off here but you know, carries on.
