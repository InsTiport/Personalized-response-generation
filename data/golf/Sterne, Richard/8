 Q.  A 63 to start, ten birdies and a fantastic closing stretch?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, it was lovely.  The course is playing nice, giving a lot of opportunities, so you've got to take them.  I saw a lot of guys shoot quite low this morning.  The greens were a bit bumpy this afternoon but it was probably one of the best putting days I've had in many a year, so it was nice.   
 Q.  Nice to be more aggressive on the softer greens, bearing in mind the weather conditions?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, it makes the course a bit more accessible.  The greens could be pretty quick here if it was firm, but as I said they are pretty soft, so you can get close, and the par 5s are reachable.  So it takes the long hitters out of play and everybody can attack this week.   
 Q.  Tough week last week at Wentworth missing the cut.  What's been the difference this week and what did you perhaps work on after Friday?  
RICHARD STERNE: Last week was unfortunate.  This week, I've just putted a lot better.  It's a strange game, you make a couple of putts here and there, and you have a good day like today and last week hopefully is all forgotten.   
 Q.  Big events, the Rolex Series, exciting times and looking forward to another good round tomorrow?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I'd like to, I haven't done well in any of the Rolex Series to be honest.  It would be nice to put in a couple solid rounds.  It's a long way to go, only day one.  Hopefully put some solid rounds together.   
 Q.  The hour-long break didn't seem to affect the concentration too much.  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, fortunately when I went out, I made bogey but I left myself in a difficult position there.  As I made nine or ten birdies today, that countered that.
