 Q.   Upsets are certainly a possibility, 16 seed in yourself, taking down Zach, No. 1 seed.   How satisfied are you with taking down one of the best here in the field?  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, pretty satisfied.   I mean, I've played with Zach quite a few times in stroke play events.   I know he's a strong player and he's had a good start to the year.   I knew it was going to be a tough game, but I played really well.   I hit it pretty good, so I put the pressure on him.   Made a few good putts, as well, from inside ten feet, which is key.  
   
 Q.   How important is that in match play to try to start putting the pressure on your opponent and letting him have to beat you?  
RICHARD STERNE:   I mean, that's probably the main goal.   I was one down after a couple and then made a few good birdie on the front nine, which is not the easiest nine to make birdies.   I hit it pretty good and put a lot of pressure on him and fortunately I came out on top.  
   
 Q.   What can this do for you confidenceâ€‘wise moving through the rest of this championship?  
RICHARD STERNE:   Looks like I'm going to play Hunter again.   I've played him twice and lost to him twice.   Hopefully the third time it'll be lucky around there.   He's a tough match player, so it's going to be (inaudible).   If I get through there, we'll take it from there.  
   
 Q.   What do you do differently knowing that you've got a history with Hunter in this championship?  
RICHARD STERNE:   Eventually it's got to come my way.   That's how I look at it.
