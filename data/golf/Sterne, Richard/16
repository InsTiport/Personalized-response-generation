 Q.   Richard Sterne, 5-under, 65 in the first round.   How did you like it out there today?  
RICHARD STERNE:   It was good.   I played nicely for a change, and I got to play the back-9 as a practice round.   It was too hot for me, so I played the front-9 blind.   It was a tough 9, actually.   Hit some good shots, fortunately.  
   
 Q.   You had 26 putts and made 99 feet and 11 inches worth of putts.   So obviously your putter was working.  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, made a few in the beginning, which was nice, and hit some good shots coming in, but unfortunately didn't make any of those.   But I hit the ball pretty well and the greens are rolling well.   I've been working hard, and nice that something has paid off.  
   
 Q.   Was the heat just so oppressive out there, it really took away from your game?  
RICHARD STERNE:   Not really.   Just I tried to reserve my energy on Tuesday, played 9 to get a feel for the course.   When it is as hot as this, you need to rest as much as possible.  
   
 Q.   The course playing firm and fast?  
RICHARD STERNE:   It's getting firm.   A lot firmer than it was on Tuesday.   I would expect if it stays like this to dry out a lot and be a lot bouncier.  
   
 Q.   Enjoy your morning round tomorrow.  
RICHARD STERNE:   Thank you.
