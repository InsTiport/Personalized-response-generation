Q.   Yesterday's match was an up‑and‑down affair, today was all one‑way traffic; how well did you play?
RICHARD STERNE:   I played pretty solid.   I'm hitting the ball pretty well, and Geoff gave me a couple of holes out there, which obviously helped in this format.   And you know, I didn't give too many things away but I played pretty well.

Q.   How much does this course test the different aspects of the game?
RICHARD STERNE:   It tests ‑‑ the tee shots are quite tight.   There are certain holes where it just doesn't fit the eye quite well for my eye, so definitely testing off the tee.   But if you get it in position, you generally have short irons in and you can attack the flags from there with benign conditions such as this.   But if the wind blows, things will change quite dramatically.

Q.   With three points, you may have to come back later today for a playoff with Bo Van Pelt if he wins; how awkward is that?
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, it is a bit strange.   I think they should have come up with some format if you win by more than 3 & 2 or something, you get an extra point or something like that but it's not the end of the world.   At least I'm through, and I must try and work out and see who I'm playing next in the playoff to see who is next; either way, I'm through.
