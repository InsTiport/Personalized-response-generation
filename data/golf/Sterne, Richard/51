RICHARD STERNE:  It was a good day. IÃ ¹ve been playing better the last few weeks and my putting has improved and I have just been waiting for that. This is a very important tournament for me because I could just about secure my card and hopefully it will go all right for me. I have only played Carnoustie twice before, even though I have played quite a lot of links golf as an amateur but I have had no practice round there this week, and I am a bit worried.
