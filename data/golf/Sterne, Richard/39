   MIKE GREEN: Richard Sterne, 2008 South African Open Champion, we couldn't help but see you waiting for the final match in the playersÃ­ lounge, and curious minds want to know: the newspaper, can you tell us what you were reading?
 RICHARD STERNE: No idea. Obviously was quite tense coming down the stretch, a lot of guys, so just waiting and watching.
 MIKE GREEN: This means you've won back‑to‑back tournaments and you're top of the Order of Merit, after your victory last week, and a really big win this time around.
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, this tournament is so prestigious, and the names on this trophy, it's unbelievable. It's a dream and a goal to be honest. I don't think I can top next year's Order of Merit, but weÃ­ll have to see.
 MIKE GREEN: Coming down that 18th, the second shot from the trap, I've never seen anyone play a bunker shot quicker than you ‑‑
 RICHARD STERNE: I don't even remember hitting that bunker shot. I was trying to hit it front right to the green and to be honest, I took a chance there and just came out perfect and came out two or three feet better than would I have liked.
 MIKE GREEN: Gareth's final putt, what were you thinking there?
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, it's a tough situation. You want the guy to make a putt. I was happy with whatever happened to be honest. Obviously missing gave me a chance to win, and when you get an opportunity, you have to take the ones you do.

 Q. After three rounds, was there a score you thought you needed to shoot?
 RICHARD STERNE: I played with Lee Westwood the first two days and he was playing so solid, I really thought he was going to run away with it. I thought maybe if I could get to 16‑ or 17‑under somehow. And I made a good save on the first hole from about 15 feet for par and I think that kept me in the tournament to be honest.
 I was quite surprised to see that no one was running away with it and obviously Ernie made a big move and going into the back nine, if I could just get to 14‑ or 15‑under and you never know what can happen coming down the stretch. 

 Q. The last two holes, can you just tell us a little about that?
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I knew that I need to get to 14‑under at least to have a chance. I've played pretty good golf the back nine. I stayed patient and there comes a time when you've got to go for it.
 My second to 17 came out perfect, hit a sand wedge from 124 yards and as it was coming back toward the hole I was quite happy to see that.
 18 was probably one of the best bunker shots IÃ­ve ever played. I didn't actually think could I get it within three feet. The way it came up off the club head, I knew it had a chance.

 Q. Were you really goijg for your shots as you say you always do when you played that approach in the playoff hole?
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, 222 yards front edge, and my goal was ‑‑ so thought I would hit 7‑iron. And if anything, rather be right than left. Fortunately hit a good shot and put it in the right place.

 Q. The last couple of weeks, some great shots, where have you've found them ‑‑
 RICHARD STERNE: I have no idea. (Laughter) You know, this game, sometimes it happens, it goes your way. I've been fortunate to always sort of do that throughout my career. It's something that I know that I can pull it off and maybe that's why IÃ­m lucky.

 Q. At 13‑under ‑‑
 RICHARD STERNE: No, not really. I was focused and the last couple of weeks, I've had a lot of confidence.

 Q. Have you thought much about the year coming up?
 RICHARD STERNE: You know, to be honest, I haven't even thought about it much. It's just ended that quickly.
 Obviously now I'm in a good position. I was in a good position last year after the first few weeks even though I didn't really have a great year. Hopefully this year I can come and win a few other big ones and compete in some really big events.

 Q. You're in good shape for getting into the Dubai World Championship with these two wins.
 RICHARD STERNE: Probably make a couple hundred thousand Euros to get into that event, so there's a long way to go. It's a big opportunity for everybody and I think you'll see a few Americans coming over and trying to play.
 It's a great thing for us and I'm very thankful for that.

 Q. You had these two big wins, so what has changed for you?
 RICHARD STERNE: Honestly I would like some time off. It's such a busy year. I travelled a lot, the most travelling I've done in my career to be honest. It's 11 weeks that I've played now so I've really only had 12 days off.
 I like the Dubai stretch, which is nice, and then after that, I'm going to try to take a little bit of time off in February and March and then get ready for the Masters.

 Q. You're playing in the full Desert Swing?
 RICHARD STERNE: At the moment, yes.

 Q. Stern rhymes with ErnieÃ do you think youÃ­re following in his footsteps?
 RICHARD STERNE: Big shoes to fill there. IÃ­ve won five European Tour events, and I canÃ­t even begin to count how many heÃ­s won. You know, I'm just thankful that heÃ­s a friend and obviously Ernie is someone I can talk to.

 Q. Could you talk about the course and how it's changed in the last year.
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I think obviously they have set a few tees forward. I think 4 made a big difference. Last year we were hitting 4‑irons in there and that's really not a hole that you want to hit 4‑iron into.
 So they have set it up as if the wind was going to blow. Yeah, they have set it up fair and the course is great. It's the best condition I've seen a golf course in a very long time.

 Q. You said they have made great strides with the tournament?
 RICHARD STERNE: It's just the way that it was run, it was so professional. They did a great job. It's small things like fetching the caddies from Stellenbosch. No tournament does that. It's great that they do that, it's just the small things that make such a big difference. The players' lounge is great. It was a pleasure to be here.

 Q. So what was it you were reading?
 RICHARD STERNE: I read something but I don't quite remember. My girlfriend actually asked me what I was reading, and I couldnÃ­t tell her. (Laughter).

 Q. You mentioned reading newspapersÃ but why didnÃ­t you take a few practice swings ahead of the playoff?
 RICHARD STERNE: No, I'm not like that. To be honest, I didn't think 14‑under was going to win it. It was hot and I had already hit enough shots. Maybe I should have hit one less.

 Q. DonÃ­t you feel you should be riding your luck now that youÃ­ve won back-to-back like this?
 RICHARD STERNE: Golf is strange, you win a tournament and you to back it up with another one. I'll enjoy it more as the week goes on to be honest, what I've done in the last few weeks.
 I'm struggling with some back problems ‑‑ and then the physios did a great job this week and kept me going.

 Q. What's wrong with it?
 RICHARD STERNE: I have no idea ‑‑ all over. How much time you got? (Laughter) from the top of my head all the way to my toes.

 Q. Which Major would you most like to win?
 RICHARD STERNE: I just need to ‑‑ the Masters was the most fun tournament I've ever played in my life so I'm looking forward to getting back there.
 I was ranked 109 two weeks ago in the world and I had no chance. I knew I had to win two in a row, and it's happened so I'm just looking forward to being back there.

 Q. Did you even think about that you were 109 and that you wanted to be in the Top‑50 in the world at the end of the year?
 RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I mean, it was my goal to be Top‑50 at the end of the year. I had a horrible summer. I struggled with a few things and now I've come back strong from that and you know, some of the South African guys jumped ahead of me on the World Rankings and I didn't enjoy that much and now I'm ahead of them now and now I'm in the Masters and theyÃ­re not. So I like that. (Laughter).

 Q. Were you inspired by the South African win over Australia in the cricket?
 RICHARD STERNE: I actually was. I really don't like the Australians beating us. I actually sent A.B. de Villiers a message congratulating them and he sent one back to me. I wonder if he knew what was going on here. But IÃ­m sure weÃ­ll find out.
