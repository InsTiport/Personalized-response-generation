 Q.  It's been a fairly mixed start to the new season for you, so how pleasing is it to get off to such a solid start here?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, very pleased.  I don't normally come to this tournament, but obviously the last couple years it's been on my schedule, and the course is obviously fitting my eye at the moment, and nice start to the year.   
 Q.  What's pleased you most about the game today?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, just overall, I kept it in play most of the day, and I putted really nice.  I made a few 20-footers, which really helps the scoring.   
 Q.  What sort of challenges does this golf course tend to throw at you?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, there's quite a few.  You've got to be quite straight off the tee.  The rough is quite thick in some places, and with the flag placements today, you couldn't get close to them if you were in the rough.  Finding the fairway is quite vital, and from there you do have opportunities.  The greens are rolling really well, so if you can get it within 15, 20 foot, you've got a good opportunity, yeah.   
 Q.  Shane Lowry shot a 62 this morning, fantastic round of golf, but you're only three shots off that now heading into Day 2.  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, that's a great round anywhere, especially around here.  A few years ago I would never have thought 62 was possible around here.  But I see the scoring is lower, and that's been happening the last couple years here.  Obviously with the ball going a bit further, it's made things a bit easier.  But the course is always in great condition, so there's no excuses if the weather is perfect like it's been today.
