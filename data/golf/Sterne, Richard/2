 Q.  Happy with that for a start?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I'm happy with my golf. I played pretty nicely and kept it together. Nothing too fancy.   
 Q.  As far as the round is concerned, it's been a while for you for some good form. You've been cashing in on that. You've had a good win. Are you happy that you've continued that form?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, I was a little worried last week when I started playing rubbish again, but I did feel quite tired and knackered. It's a long stretch of events and I took it easy coming into this event. I'm feeling fresh again.   
 Q.  Nice to get back here, as well, to a course you guys seemed to love and enjoy playing. What makes this course so special for South Africans?  
RICHARD STERNE: I think it's a love/hate relationship. Some days it loves and you other days it gets you. But I don't know, we grew up watching this event. I don't know if any national tees have watched this event as much as South Africans have. One of my first memories is getting a ball from Nick Price signed after his first time he beat Tiger in a playoff. I have great memories just watching this event.   
 Q.  As far as comfort levels around this course, getting used to it?  
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, took me many years to figure out my game plan, but I feel like I've got my plan and I'm just going to stick to that.   
 Q.  Are you happy things went your way or anything you could do differently?  
RICHARD STERNE: It's golf. There's always something, but it's only if you want it.
