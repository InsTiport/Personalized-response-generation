 Q.   Your round today?  
RICHARD STERNE:   That was a fairly, what's the word, conservative.   I played a lot of middle‑of‑the‑green shots, not really going for the flags.   But I‑‑ my swing really‑‑ it feels okay, but I haven't got the confidence to shoot at the flags on all the shots.  
But where I had confidence I did, and didn't make too many birdies.   I think three birdies and two bogeys.   I'm pretty happy with that start.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, it's a good start.   If you'd told me I'd shoot 69, I'd be pretty happy.   The course is tough.   It's not a walk in the park, that's for sure.   The rough is really penal.   The course is set up well so you can shoot a good score, it's just when you do go off line it really is severe.   That's something you've got to try to avoid.   
There's a lot of shots out there you can't‑‑ you've got to take them on, unfortunately.   The bunkers are in places where you just have to play aggressive at times, and as I said, conservative at times, as well.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   I mean, the wind picked up very slight in the afternoon, so I don't think it was much of a difference.   Perhaps the guys in the morning had less wind.   I didn't see the wind in the morning very early.   
But I suppose the scoring was better by maybe one shot.   But nothing as severe as we can get at the Open.   I think the guys are pretty happy with that.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, I see a couple of the guys are doing pretty well.   And we've got, I think, a record number of South Africans this year, so that's always nice.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, Europe I play quite solid now in Europe.   The last six events have been pretty decent.   It's my last one before I go home for a month, so it would be nice to have a good event here and take some time off.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   No, generally I've been all right.   Nothing is stopping me from playing.   A lot of physio and a lot of exercises and been all right.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   No, it's just, you know, swing.   It comes and goes.   One day you feel good, one day you don't.   You've just got to play with what you have that day.   I got around today in 69, which I was quite happy with.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   I'm just scoring pretty well.   Just not making silly mistakes.   After not playing for so long, I just kind of lost the art of scoring and making bogeys from the middle of the fairways with sand wedges and stuff like that that I was doing at the beginning of the year.   So that's improved.   I drove the ball pretty well today.   And generally I think I hit quite a lot of greens, which is key around here.  
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, pretty much, from Natal.
