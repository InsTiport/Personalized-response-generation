Q.   2â€‘under par for 13 holes today, going into that difficult final stretch, are you pleased with 71? 
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, very pleased with 71 at the end.   This course can bite you in a lot of places and obviously the finish here is probably the toughest finish on the Tour.   So especially with the wind today, as well, into us, a couple of the tough holes.   Pretty happy with that.

Q.   Can you describe just how difficult it is out there? 
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, this golf course tends to do that to you.   I got off to a good start today.   Just had two or three bad swings at the wrong time and unfortunately that's the game. 

Q.   Going out with Graeme McDowell tomorrow, Major Champion, and he's in mixed form at the minute, missed cuts and wins; your thoughts on that? 
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, he's won in the States.   Graeme is still solid, and as you said he's a Major winner.   It will be fun to play with him.   I haven't played with him in a long time, and I look forward to that.

Q.   Got a good feeling?
RICHARD STERNE:   There's a lot of guys bunched up there, and someone can come from further back, I suppose.   Depends how they set up the course, but hopefully I get off to a good start and keep it going this time.
