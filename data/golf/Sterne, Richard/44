  Q.  Great effort, but just a bit short at the end?   
 RICHARD STERNE:  It was close, what can I do. I played my best but it didn't go the way I wanted to go. It's great for Anton. I'm disappointed but I did my best   
  
  Q.  You seemed in control on the back nine but 17 seemed to have got you there?   
 RICHARD STERNE:  17 is a tough hole. Hit a good putt there and hit a good putt on 18 in regulation play and again in the play-off. But nothing went in. What can I do?   
  
  Q.  What can you take out from this week?   
 RICHARD STERNE:  It's been a good week, it shows that anything can happen in golf. I'm just going home and rest now.   
  
  Q.  I guess it was the first round 75 which made it tough?   
 RICHARD STERNE:  Obviously not the best first round but I came back with two 64s which was great golf. Gave myself a chance and that's how it goes.
