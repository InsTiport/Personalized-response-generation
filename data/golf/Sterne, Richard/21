 Q.   Pretty good start for the tournament?   
RICHARD STERNE:   Yeah, pretty happy.   Always nice to get off to a good start.   Played nicely.   
Obviously last week wasn't the best of weeks so looking forward to finding some form going into this week and next week.   I need a couple good tournaments to get back into the Topâ€‘50 in the world and get back into the Masters which is a goal of mine.   
   
 Q.   There's so many low scores today.   Does that surprise you?   
RICHARD STERNE:   No, the weather is good today and the course is in perfect condition.   Good weather, good greens, guys are going to score pretty good.  
   
 Q.   Anything that you would like to adjust for tomorrow?   
RICHARD STERNE:   Just keep on playing and hopefully make a few putts at the right time and keep putting good numbers on the board.
