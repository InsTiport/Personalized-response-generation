Q. 68 today; how much different were conditions out there for you?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, pretty similar, a little windy perhaps today, but today I hit the ball pretty good again, just didn't make the putts that I made yesterday.
Q. What's pleased you most about the opening two rounds of this tournament?
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, just hitting the ball in the right places and driving the ball pretty well.  So you can score if you find the fairways.  But I've been putting decently, but as I said, yesterday I made a lot of 20-footers, where today not so much.
Q. Nice to keep yourself at the top end of the leaderboard in a big tournament with a lots of big names in there going into the weekend.  You must be excited now at the prospect.
RICHARD STERNE: Yeah, it's what we try and do.  It's been a while since I've been at the top.  Listen, there's a long way to go, 36 holes, obviously, and some really tough players up there and top players.  I'm looking forward to it, and hopefully get off to a good start tomorrow and a decent weekend.
