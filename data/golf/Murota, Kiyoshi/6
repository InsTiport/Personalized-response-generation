 Q.   You played today with the head club professional, Dave Zink.   Just overall impressions on his golf game and what it was like to play with him.   
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   So he give me the line, take care friend.   Him, his friend.   So he can play.   So nothing, you know.   I think he has pressure, he says, but he stay playing.   He's kind, nice player, nice guy.   
   
 Q.   Is it better to play with a marker like that rather than playing alone and maybe being stuck behind a group?   
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   By himself not good.   Marker better for pace, time.  
   
 Q.   Any overall thoughts on his golf game or what kind of player he is?   
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   He's a good player.   Yes, he is.   He said Dave's got the body, so he needs his body sometimes so he can make more scores.  
   
 Q.   Thank you so much.
