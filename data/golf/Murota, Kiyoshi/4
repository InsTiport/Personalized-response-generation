 Q.   Can you take us through ‑‑ you were in the lead when you walked off of 5 and then you got backed up on 6 and put it in the water.   Can you take us through your round from there?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   On No. 6 I didn't want to make the same mistake, but I did.   
   
 Q.   There was a back up, you had to wait awhile, did that cause, was that something that caused you to chunk the ball?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   No.   
(Laughter.)  
   
 Q.   And on number 8, can you take us through the tee shot that went left there.   What were you trying ‑‑ were you trying to go over a tree?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   Yeah.   I tried to go by the tree, but it was the same thing, a mishit.   
   
 Q.   After you hit the tree, what are you thinking at that point?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   Well, golf is like that.   
   
 Q.   So overall three birdies, one bogey, a pretty consistent round today?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   Yeah, I would like to make an under par round, so I like it.   
   
 Q.   How do you feel heading into this weekend?  
KIYOSHI MUROTA:   Like yesterday I told you guys, I feel like the shot is not that good, but I'm changing my swing now, so the shot is going better.   
But I need to just keep playing safe and making a game.
