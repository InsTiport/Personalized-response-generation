THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us in Tahoe.  In commemoration of the Angora Fire ten years ago, the most devastating fire in the Lake Tahoe Basin in over a century, Sir Charles Barkley is joined by local firefighters from the fire on the 10th tee to acknowledge the tenth anniversary of that devastating wildfire.  In sports, there's a saying, "Game on."  But Charles Barkley knew it was no game on that day, but it was definitely on.
He couldn't sit by the sidelines and just watch.  Barkley became a beacon of hope in support of the firefighters and recovery efforts to follow for the community.
Charles, we're here to support you and cheer you on in your game today.  We want people to care and be aware and prepare for wildfire.  On behalf of the fire chiefs of Lake Tahoe, Sir Charles, thank you for caring.
[Applause]
CHARLES BARKLEY: Appreciate that.
