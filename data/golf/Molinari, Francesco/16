FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, same as the other days, to be honest.  The greens are getting a little bit firmer.  But it's still holding.  If you hit good shots, you can still make birdies (indiscernible), keeping the ball on the fairway all the time.  And if you miss the fairways, you're in big trouble.   
 Q.  And your own round today?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Just too many mistakes.  Started poorly with two bogeys, 1 and 2, two of the few birdie holes out there.  So it's going to be uphill if you start like that.  But, yeah, some ups and downs.  Some good shots.  Some not so good shots.  And I just need to clean this quarter up for tomorrow.   
 Q.  How good did it feel to finish the way you did?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Not very good just because the day hasn't been what I was hoping for.  It's nice to finish with a birdie at the last, but like I said, just too many shots left out there today.   
 Q.  You played with a fellow Ryder Cup player.  The community, the togetherness that you guys had last year, do you still feed off from that?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, it's still there.  I think it's never going to leave us.  We will always have the memories together and the -- I think that there was a special bond between the players in the Ryder Cup, and Thomas obviously in front.  So it was nice to play or just hang with any guy that was part of the team.
