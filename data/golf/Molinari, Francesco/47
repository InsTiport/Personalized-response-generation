Q. How much do you feel you two boys have been gelling together in your practise sessions?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: We've been doing our best.  Obviously we enjoy each other's company and we've been friends for awhile now, and yeah, we can't wait to get started.  It's nearly time.  I'm sure that the first tee tomorrow is going to be something else.  So I can't wait to be there.
Q. How much are you excited about the first tee?  How much are you excited about taking on that final pairing, Patrick Reed and Tiger Woods for your first Ryder Cup match?
TOMMY FLEETWOOD: It doesn't get any better.  If you said my first Ryder Cup match, I couldn't pick a better person to play with.  We get on great.  I love this guy, and he's pretty good at golf, too.
You know, it's a massive match, of course it is, but they are all going to be big, and of course everybody is looking at Tiger's return.  But, you know, for us, when we get to that golf course and when we get on the first tee, it's down to what we do, and you know, we've practiced our whole lives for this and we are just going to play our game and hopefully that will be good enough at the end of it.
