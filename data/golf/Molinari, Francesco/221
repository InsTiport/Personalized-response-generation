  Q. That was very unlucky, there was some incredible shots played in that playoff just then and your putt just slipped by, I guess.   
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, I hit a pretty good shot with the second shot, and just didn't make the putt. I think that the pity is just the putt on the 72nd hole that went really, really close to going in, but it's all right.   
  
  Q. Some of those shots just now played in the playoff, Lin's shot in the trees, Rory knocking it in close, I suppose that's what it takes at the end of the day.   
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, you need to do the right shot at the right moment, and I'm pretty happy with the way I played the playoff, anyway. Just was a pretty good putt as well, but just didn't break.   
  
  Q. You're saying just after you finished, you were aiming for 16-under, and that one was just nipped in the drawers I suppose on the 18th, could have been the one, I suppose.   
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, when I was on the course in the afternoon, I thought that 16-under was the goal to win, but I'm happy with the way I played. And next time, I'll be more lucky.   
  
  Q. Next time: You're on to Mission Hills, playing with your brother; looking forward to that now on the back of a very good performance here?  
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'm happy and it's a good start to The Race to Dubai, and I'm looking forward to next week to play well again.
