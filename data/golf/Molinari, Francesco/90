Q. You picked up where you finished yesterday, so that must have been nice.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I started where I left off yesterday.  It was a really good start, make something really good putts at the first and at the third.  Then the birdies stopped there and couldn't really follow anymore.  But I had a pretty good finish, fewer mistakes than yesterday which is good.  Maybe a few more birdies would have been nice but hopefully tomorrow.
Q. Nice solidity with that birdie at the last.  It could be vital.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yes, obviously Hideki is stretching his lead a little bit.  It was good to get a birdie to finish.  He's going to start probably with a four- or five-shot lead tomorrow, to me, anyway.  So it's going to be hard to catch him but it's a decent position going into Sunday.  I'm playing well, so I just need to keep it going one more day.
Q. Do you change attitude or approach when you do have to chase?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, I don't think you can do that on this golf course.  You still need to respect it and to hit fairways, hit greens.  With the greens being soft like that this week, you can be a little more aggressive with the shots to the greens but the premium is hitting fairways.  That's going to be the main priority tomorrow and hopefully some good shots into the green with some nice putts.
Q. I presume that's a positivity because you're playing well.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'm hitting the ball well.  Yesterday was maybe a little bit off, but today again felt good.  So yeah, I like the course.  I like where I am in the leaderboard.  So it's looking good for tomorrow.
