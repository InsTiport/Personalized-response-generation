 Q.  How tough was that this morning for you?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, just didn't quite play my best.  We played quite well on the front nine and then just dropped too many easy shots on the back nine, unfortunately.  It is what it is.  Still a positive week.   
 Q.  You walk onto 16th tee 2-down, you still showed great resolve, great power, great strength of mind to get to 18, didn't you?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, well, obviously I was doing my best, even when things weren't going my way.  But, yeah, some days, you know, just like this, I mean I bogeyed 12, 14, 18 from decent spots in the middle of the fairway.  So it's not something really you're allowed to do.   
 Q.  And Kevin as an opponent is a tough guy to get away from, isn't he?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, like I said, we played well.  It was tough with the cold and the wind this morning.  And we both played well on the front nine.  And then he just played a little bit better on the back.
