   FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Not bad as a start. Played well on the front nine but struggled a bit on the back nine. Three putted twice from the fringe. If you hit fairways and greens it is not playing that tough and you can be quite aggressive with the irons. I'm quite happy though. It is soft but not that easy. You still hit a lot of long irons and flags are close to the run offs. But the conditions are perfect.  
 Couple of big weeks for you?  
 It's the first time I have been here and I have been looking forward to playing this course. I had heard great things about it and they were right. I am looking forward to this week and next week and its the last few shots to try and make the Ryder Cup team. It is not easy but I would love to be in Wales. There are some great players outside the team trying to do their best to make the team in these last few weeks. I just have to go out and try and play well tournament by tournament. It is hard to say any number as there is so much to play for. Maybe after the PGA it will be clearer to what I need to do to make the team.   
 Your brother is one of four players in the World's top 20 not it the team at the moment?  
 It is not easy for him coming from the Challenge Tour as he had less tournaments than other but he is quite close on the World Ranking points and can still make the team. If not he is still a top 20 player in the world.   
 There are some great players not in the team?  
Monty said he could pick two teams of the same strength and he is right. I was not in contention two years ago but this looks like one of the toughest teams to make as there are some many players in contention.
