Q. Obviously not the day you'd like it to have been. Your reflections on closing out The Italian Open?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, disappointing today but obviously still a very good week.  I think I should be proud of what I did all week long.  There was a lot of pressure and expectation, so I'm happy the way I performed in those circumstances.
Yeah, today I just didn't get the start I was hoping for in the first six, seven, eight holes.  And then from there, it was an uphill battle and you know, I did what I could.  Obviously it's a tiring week for me, and I think once the adrenaline goes down, it's pretty hard to play your best golf.
Q. With the scoring being so low, and the slow start you got off to, did that kill any momentum going forward?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I think the first few holes, it was okay, but between the fifth and the ninth hole, ideally I should have made a couple of birdies to feel like I was right in the heat of the battle.  I didn't do that.  I didn't birdie 11 and 12, and I had two other decent chances, and that was kind of it.
Anyway, a positive week and I'll be back next year.
Q. How nice to sign off the way you did on 17 and 18 in front of these crowds?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was great.  Obviously at that point, the trophy is gone, but it was nice to give something to cheer about to the crowds and they were obviously very happy with the two closing birdies.
Yeah, like I said all week, it's been a really exciting week and I'm happy to be part of it.
