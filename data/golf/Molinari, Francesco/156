  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I just played it as if it was another golf course and didn't probably overanalyze it.   Last year I got caught a bit more in all the breaks and all the different stuff, so this year I just tried to be relaxed and play simple golf, hit as many fairways as possible, as many greens as possible, and then try to hole the putts.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the state of your game.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it's feeling good.   The beginning of the season has been very solid.   I finished a lot of times in the top 15, top 20, so I think I just need to be patient, as I said, and expect the putts to drop at the right time and hopefully be in contention on Sunday afternoon.   
   
 Q.   Do you feel you are ready to win a major championship?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I think so.   If my game is in good shape, as it is at the moment, as it was today, I think I showed at the WGC in China that I can play with the top guys if I'm playing well, and obviously majors it's a different pressure, but I'm here to try and do that, and hopefully if not this time in the next few years some day it will happen for me.
