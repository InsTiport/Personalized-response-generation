FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Itâs great to be back here in Monza, lots of good memories from last year and the course is in great condition, the weather looks like it is going to be great, so everything is in place for a great week.
Itâs one of the great new things this year with a bigger purse we are playing for and the prestige for the tournament of being part of the Rolex Series, which started earlier this year, I think itâs great for this part of the world with The Ryder Cup in Rome in 2022, itâs going to benefit the whole of Italian golf.
With players like Sergio Garcia, Jon Rahm and Martin Kaymer itâs great. It is the strongest field ever for the Italian Open and this can only be good news for Italian golf, and hopefully like last year the crowds will be big, and they will support the great players who are here this week.
