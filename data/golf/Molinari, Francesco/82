 Q.  (No microphone.)  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I didn't wear a wool hat because I didn't bring one with me this week because I wasn't expecting Orlando to be like this.  But, no, it was, the ball was going probably nearly 15, 20 percent less this morning because it was freezing.   
 Q.  70 seems a good score.  Let's look at your stats.  This season in particular there seems to be a trend that you're moving towards something pretty big.  Is that right?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I hope so, yeah.  It's been a good time since my win last year, a lot of good weeks, really consistent.  Obviously you want to eliminate the mistakes as much as possible, if you want to be in contention on Sunday.  So today's a good start, anything under par today I would take it and if I can just keep going the way I've been playing the next few days, I'll have a chance at something.   
 Q.  Couple of top-10s in your times here at Bay Hill.  What is it you like so much about this course?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I don't know, I love the course, I think it's always special to play, obviously, at Mr. Palmer's place it, this year even more, but even in the past it was great to be here and to shake hands with him and have a chat.  And this is, I think this tournament and Memorial, obviously, because of Jack Nicklaus, is special.
