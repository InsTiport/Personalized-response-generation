Q. An up-and-down round that ended in level par 71, what's your verdict on that one?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was a bit different than yesterday.  I think my misses off the tee were a bit further off line, so obviously you don't want to do that here.  I didn't miss too many.  I only missed I think four or five fairways, but other than -- I was struggling to chip it out on the fairway.  I need to hit the ball better off the tee.
I hit lots of good shots, but the misses need to be better to shoot under par here.
Q. One of your best shots of the day we liked in particular was the long putt at 17.  Just describe that one for a par.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, I was kind of moaning at my caddie.  I hit the tee shot left and it bounced off the slope into the thick stuff.  I had a shocking lie.  Us golfers, I was moaning about the luck.
And then I just rolled a beautiful putt in.  Obviously it's a bonus.  It felt like a birdie or even something more, because at that point I was just trying to get it close and get away with a five and not a six.
Q. You obviously just missed out on a spot in The Open at Quicken Loans last week, just missed by a shot but then got in through the World Rankings.  How big a weight is that to be listed knowing that you're now in The Open?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's good, because especially at Congressional, I missed a 10-footer at the last.  Hit a good one put but didn't go in.  I told my caddie, as soon as I finished, I think that might have been the putt to get in The Open.  Yeah, I was a little bit disappointed on Sunday but great news to get in a couple of days later.
