Q.   Nice round today, good start to this golf tournament, five birdies, one bogey, tell us about how you thought things went out there today. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was all pretty good.   I had a good start and you know, I like the way the golf course is playing.   I'm pretty good usually at keeping the ball in position and made a few nice putts.   So, you know, very good start to the tournament.

Q.   11 of 14 fairways, that's always good on this golf course. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, yeah, I have to say that this year, I haven't seen it previously obviously but the rough is not too punitive but it's a good advantage being on the green and I hit a lot of good iron shots, as well, so I'm really pleased with the way I've played.

Q.   Tell us about your season so far, you haven't played in the States for a while. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I haven't played much in Europe either.   Dubai was my first event a few weeks ago, so I had a nice break, seven weeks off.   It's nice, I feel refreshed now and looking forward to play some good golf. 

Q.   What did you do for seven weeks?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Rest mainly, the first three or four weeks and then started working a bit on the game.   I had one week of holiday with the family.   So I really just wanted to get the energies back.   I had two very long seasons the last two years, so I think I needed a longer break through the winter.
