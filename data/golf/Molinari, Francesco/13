Q. Can you talk about your round today.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: That was not the first round I was looking for.  But, yeah, I started well and then just between 8 and 12 lost four shots too easily.  Especially on 8, after a good tee shot in the middle of the fairway with a wedge in my hands, I wasn't obviously expecting a double bogey.
It was costly today, but I'll try to learn from today and do better tomorrow.
