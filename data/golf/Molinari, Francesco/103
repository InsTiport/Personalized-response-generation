Q.   5‑under, 67, Round 2.   Obviously things have been going pretty well out there for you?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, absolutely.   It's my first time here at Memorial and I'm loving the course so far, loving the week.   I'm playing on an invite, so I have to thank Mr. Nicklaus and the guys here to give me this chance.   And I'm trying to make the most of it. 
The game is in good shape.   As I said, the course is in perfect condition.   So I'm looking forward to the weekend. 

Q.   You realize you're playing under some of the best scoring conditions ever for this tournament?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I know.   I watched on TV the last few years, so I know that the scoring is not usually this low.   I guess the course is probably a little bit softer than usual, but it's great.   The greens are as pure as they get.   It's really a pleasure to play out there.

Q.   Since this is your first time out here, do you have any favorite stretches of holes?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I think it's a great course, from the start to the finish.   It's hard to pick some holes.   The finish can be really strong, 16, 17, 18.   With yesterday's wind, playing into the wind, it's a tough stretch to finish.

Q.   4‑under yesterday, 5‑under today.   Can you get any lower?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I hope so.   I'm going to try to.   My game plan is going to be the same tomorrow and Sunday:   hit fairways, hit greens.   The putting has been good so far, so hopefully keep going that way and just have fun.
