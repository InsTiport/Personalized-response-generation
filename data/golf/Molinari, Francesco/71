 Q.  Your thoughts on the day?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, pretty good.  I think the back nine, my back nine, the front nine, were a little bit loose.  The tee shots, not exactly in the middle of the fairway.  But I fought hard, and yes, some good par saves and a couple of birdies when I hit the fairways.  Obviously I'm happy; 7-under is a very good start.  You about yeah, there's room for improvement.   
 Q.  PÃ¡draig Harrington told us a long time ago that it took him awhile to get used to playing his own national open.  Are you now in a position that you can enjoy it?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: For me, it's always been -- I won it my second year as a professional, so I've always enjoyed the attention.  I don't know, it just seems to have a good effect on my game.  I think I probably focus more.  Obviously there's a little more expectations around.   
I can see, it's not easy obviously.  It's a bit like playing in a major or something like that.  But yeah, I did well last year, so hopefully I'll do it again.   
 Q.  Do you get time to practice and rest?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, there's a couple of things this afternoon, and maybe hit some balls.  I think the time that I don't have to spend with the media, I'll probably rest and try to recover as much as possible.  But it's nice to be part of such an exciting Italian Open and to do my part in that, as well.
