Q. Another boring round of golf today?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It wasn't boring at all.  I think I probably shouldn't have made that comment yesterday.  It was more up-and-down today.  It was tougher I think, because with the wind, I didn't hit as many fairways.  Like I said yesterday, it is massive to hit fairways otherwise you're going to struggle.
Yeah, I managed to hole some good putts.  Played well the last few holes, which was great.
Q. Elaborate on some of those good putts, because what was it, 17, 35 foot or so?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: 16 I hit two good shots to probably four or five feet and then 17 is playing tough today because it's into the wind, so I had to hit a hybrid into the green and probably 30 feet at last downhill right-to-left and that was a nice bonus.  And then 18, three good shots, again, to maybe eight, nine feet and a nice putt to finish with.  So obviously when you finish with three birdies in a row, it's always a nice taste in your mouth.
Q. It probably wouldn't have been a bad day even if you had not finished like that but presumably you feel so much more alive and involved in the tournament when this does happen?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, especially because I still feel like I'm playing well, so probably could have avoided a few of the bogeys today.  So you know, yeah, level par would have still been a decent round given the conditions.  But yeah, finishing like this is always a great bonus, and a little bit of a boost of confidence going into tomorrow, as well.
