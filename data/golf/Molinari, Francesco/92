Q. What was working for you today?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I hit most fairways and most greens, so boring round of golf in a nice way.  Yeah, I'm really happy.  Obviously it was a bit tricky with the rain.  It was raining for awhile and then stopping and then raining again.
Yeah, I'm glad with the start and hope to play like this for the remainder of the week.
Q. There's nothing boring, because that's paramount, isn't it, in these conditions to find the fairways, because that rough is going to be so tangled.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, the rough is thick this week, pretty much in every spot.  Obviously with it being wet, it's even worse.  So yeah, that was the plan, hitting fairways and hitting greens, and I managed to make some nice putts, as well, especially on the front nine.  Really happy with the round.
Q. How does Sheshan compare to when you won here?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's playing different.  Obviously conditions are different.  They had quite a lot of rainy think last week and the course is showing it.  But you know, it's still the same track.  Still suits my eye, and I like playing here no matter if it's firm or soft.  It's a good course and you need to hit good shots, and I enjoy it.  I enjoy playing here.
Q. Are you excited about your form now that the victory is under your belt?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's good.  I'm happy with the game.  That is the main thing.  Hopefully I can keep it going for the next few weeks for the end of the season and see what I can do.
