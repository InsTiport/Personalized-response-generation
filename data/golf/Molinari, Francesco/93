Q. You started the day six shots behind, and you birdied four in a row in the middle of the front nine to get within two.  Were you thinking maybe, just maybe?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, yeah, obviously it was a great start.  I was just trying to keep it going, to hit good shots.  Unfortunately I hit two really bad ones on 9 and 10 off the tee.  So I managed to get away with two bogeys, which was a success, really, with those two shots.  Then started playing better again.
So yeah, I mean, I always seem to fall a bit short here.  We'll see what happens in the end but obviously I'm glad with today.  I think yesterday, I got it to 5-under after 11, and then made three soft bogeys really coming in without hitting really bad shots.  So I think that's probably going to be costly.
Q. I don't often get a chance to ask this question, but what does it feel like to finish 3-3 here?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, it's great.  I think both times I finished second, I finished three at the last.  I don't think I birdied 17 anyway, so it's an improvement.  Next time I need to birdie 16, too.
Q. Lots of World Ranking points and Ryder Cup points and lots of positives to take away from the week if it didn't work out your way.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yes, of course, I was coming in off a really good Sunday at Congressional making a Top-10, and then I got in The Open just a couple of days later, which is obviously great news.
So it's been a good couple of weeks.  The game is moving in the right direction.  I think I've done a lot of work on the short game and on the putting, and I think it showed today.  I holed so many putts, so I'm proud of that.
