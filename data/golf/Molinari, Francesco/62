Q. How would you describe the quality of your golf at Wentworth?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was great, especially today.  Obviously conditions were very different.  It was a tough challenge today with the breeze.  It was gusting and it wasn't easy.  So it was nice to keep a clean scorecard, hit the ball great.  I even missed a few short putts on the first nine or ten holes, but yeah, I'm in a great position, so really pleased with today.
Q. Some players never figure out the West Course.  You have five Top-10s and a runner-up finish here.  Why is this golf course such a good fit for your game?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I don't know.  I just love playing here.  Clearly it suits my eyes and I just enjoy the atmosphere.  The crowds are always great.  It is a challenging course but I think if you hit good shots, you can make a few birdies here and there.  I love it, and hopefully it will be another good day tomorrow.
Q. A year ago, you finished co-runner-up at the PGA Championship, another big opportunity for you tomorrow.  How much do you feel you're at the height of your power and ready for whatever tomorrow brings?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I am going to be ready.  I am going to do my best, obviously whatever is in my control.
There are a lot of really, really good players up there, so it won't be easy, but I need to do what I did today, just keep in the moment and hit shot by shot and see if that will be enough.
Q. Kiradech said you played some fantastic golf today, and a 66 on a day like this backs that up.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was very solid tee-to-green and I'm really pleased having no bogeys today, a challenging day with the wind gusting.
There's one more day and I need to try to do the same tomorrow and see if that will be enough.
Q. You've only dropped one shot since your opening hole on Thursday.  How pleasing is that around this golf course?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's very pleasing.  Obviously the first two days, the conditions were a lot more benign.  I think as I said, it's very impressive to have a clean scorecard.  It was nice to make that up-and-down on the last and to not drop a shot there.  Yeah, I'm playing well.  I need to stay patient.  Obviously there's many, many good players up there, like every year, and hopefully a little bit of luck at the right time and I'll manage to get to the finish line.
Q. Almost dÃ©jÃ  vu.  We stood here this time last year and you were leading going into the final day and of course Alex Noren with an excellent round.  Weather conditions could change tomorrow, so it's just focusing on your game and not worry about what else is happening, I suppose?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's such a challenging course that you need to keep your efforts focused on the course itself.  I'll try not to look what other people are doing and just do my best.
Q. First of the Rolex Series this year, what would it mean to win this event?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It would be amazing.  It would be amazing to win a Rolex Series Event, to win here with such tradition, and it's a course that is in the heart of Italian golfers, as well, with Constantino and Matteo winning here in the past.  I'll see what I can do tomorrow.
