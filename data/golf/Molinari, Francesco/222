  Q. Lovely round on Sunday. Do you think you've done enough?  
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: I think my goal was to finish on 16 out there, so I think I might just finish short. You never know.   
 On 18, you can shoot birdie, but you can also shoot easily bogey or everything. So just wait here and see what happens.   
  
  Q. And it's strange because you don't know how to feel, you should be pleased you've played well today and maybe disappointment, but it's a strange feeling, isn't it?   
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, the putt on the 18th was so close that I am a little bit disappointed. But it's a good week, anyway, so I'm really happy with myself.  
  
  Q. And at the end of what's been a very good year for you; they always say the second win is harder to get than the first, and having won, you're ready now to win again, aren't you?  
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Yeah, but I think it's true that the second win is a bit tougher to get. I'm playing well right now, and I played well almost all of the season. So I'm happy and hopefully we can see what happens.  
  
  Q. Head to the range to stay warmed up?   
 FRANCESO MOLINARI: Maybe just a couple of putts but I'm already quite warm.
