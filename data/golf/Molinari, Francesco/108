 Q.   Best score of the afternoon, how good did it feel to you?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it was obviously very good, steady.   I think I missed only one green and got it up‑and‑down and managed to hole a few putts.   I managed to stay positive on the round and just play shot by shot and everything went well.  
   
 Q.   When you are between clubs, how do you take a few yards off?   What do you do?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I usually grip down a little bit and shorten the backswing a little bit.   Depends how much you want to take off.   
   
 Q.   Another cracking shot at the 14th.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was a 6‑iron, good strike, straight at the hole.   This was a good distance.   
   
 Q.   Has something clicked in the game?   What's the difference?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I don't know, I'm back in Europe and I'm not in the States anymore.   I think it's been a good start of the year.   It's a new tour for me, new courses, so it's challenging, but I think it's helping my game, as you can see, and hopefully do the same for the rest of the week.  
   
 Q.   You're currently 66th in the world and the next few weeks we decide who gets in the U.S. Open and Open Championship; how much is that on your mind?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It is, but there's nothing you can do apart from doing your job.   I can't control what others are doing up there.   I just have to do my best and see if that's enough.  
   
 Q.   A round of 65, 7‑under par.   Did everything go according to plan today?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, pretty much.   I think I missed only one green on the third and hit a nice chip to a couple of feet.   So it was as stress‑free as it can be around here.   Yeah, I love this place.   I've played well in the last few years and it's very good to be back.   
   
 Q.   What exactly do you like about it?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I don't know, I just like the course obviously.   I think it rewards accuracy more than others, so it suits my game.   But just in general, I come here every year and just enjoy the week and have fun.   I managed to do that again today.   
   
 Q.   How are you finding it dividing time between here and the states?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It's tough.   Dropping out of the Top‑50 didn't help because it means I need to play more events.   It's a in you challenge for my game to play more over there, and that's the main reason why I did it.   I think it's helping my game to improve.   Hopefully I'll get the reward soon.   
   
 Q.   I know you want to get into The Open Championship, and you're 66th at the moment.   Is that on your mind a lot?   Are you thinking about it?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I know it's there.   I know it will be great to have a great week and qualify for the U.S. Open and The Open.   I missed the Masters this year after I don't know how many, but a few majors in a row.   So it wasn't a nice feeling, and I hope to be back very soon.   
   
 Q.   Is this exciting, shooting a flawless round of 65 to start?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It is, yeah.   Around here, it's a great place.   It's obviously our Flagship Event, so it's a great start but unfortunately nothing more than that.   We don't get the trophy on the first day, so I need to keep my head down and do the same tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday and see if there's going to be enough.   
   
 Q.   Clearly you finished Top‑10 on the last three occasions, so there's something about the place.   How does this round compare to others?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I think it's probably one of the best.   Last year I think on Saturday, I had another 66 or 65, and the wind was up a bit more.   So that was probably even better.   But 65 around here in any conditions, it's a great course.  
   
 Q.   Has it helped, the fact that you were back in Europe for The Open de EspaÃ±a last week and played so well there to hone the game and get ready for this week?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I felt like I was playing quite well at the Match Play but didn't do too well there.   It was nice last week to get in contention again after awhile and I'm just, yeah, continuing what I did last week and it seems to still be working.   So let's see what happens in the next few days.   
   
 Q.   Presumably the upshot of this if it continues is all the bonuses with World Rankings and positions in other tournaments?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I know that the deadline for the U.S. Open and The Open are closed and it would mean a lot to have a good week here.   All season, I've been pretty much just outside the Top‑50, knowing that a good week would get me in again.   So it's not too different from how I was feeling the rest of the season.   
   
 Q.   Why is your game so well suited to Wentworth?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I think you need to be in control of the ball flight as much as you can all the time with the wind swirling around in the trees and obviously the deep bunkers have got more emphasis on accuracy off the tee.   I just enjoy playing around here, I always have, and hopefully I always will.
