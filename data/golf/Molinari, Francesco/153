  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it's really tricky.   The wind is picking up nicely.   Really happy with the round.   I played well.   Hit the ball well the off the tees, which is key here.   And you know, just holed a couple of putts.   I'm still‑‑ I mean, I can still do a lot better on the greens I think.   But, you know, really happy with today's round.   
   
 Q.   It did look like a nice solidity about your game; you weren't going to do much wrong.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, as I said, I hit the ball yesterday and today well off the tees, which is the key here with the rough being so thick and with so much water on the greens.   
You know, I feel good about the game.   Last week in Ireland was good.   Just making the Top‑10 but playing nicely.   So you know, looking forward to the weekend.  
   
 Q.   This your kind of course?   A lovely test, isn't it.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I love it.   I think it's one of the best we play, if not the best.   Obviously there's more pleasant days than today because of the wind.   With the breeze, it's really tricky and you need to be spot on off the tees, and with the iron play, as well.   
So I think it's quite good for my game.   But you know, anyone is going to have a few shots that aren't right here because it not easy.   There's nothing easy about it.  
   
 Q.   I know you can't second guess the weather but it's not likely to get any better than this, is it, today.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, the wind is supposed to keep blowing and maybe pick up a bit, as well.   So you know, it's good to be in the clubhouse under par.   
You know, 3‑under today, I think it was playing tougher than yesterday.   So 3‑under today is a lot better than level par yesterday.
