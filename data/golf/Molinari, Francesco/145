  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was a good, solid week.   It's always good to be back here in Gleneagles.   I don't know why but I always tend to play well. 
A shame about the missed chances in the two rounds, second and third round, but today was good.   So it's good for the confidence going into holidays, if you can call them like that, on a good note.   I'll practise the next two weeks to get even better, and try to win The Italian Open before The Ryder Cup. 

Q.   Essentially, you started well, finished well, but you held it together nicely in the middle, didn't you? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, some holes I didn't play that well in the middle of the tournament, so I did well to scramble well. 
Yesterday is only really the day I didn't take advantage, but it's good, every part of the game is in pretty good shape.   There's still a few weeks to go but hopefully it will only get better from now on.

Q.   What are your thoughts on the man who is controlling this, one of your teammates from Medinah? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Well, we played together the first two rounds, and he was playing really well and putted quite well.   So you know, it's good to see him in good form, and I'm sure if he wins, as he looks at the moment, it's going to be a big boost for him winning at home.   It's good to see lots of players on the team are showing good signs. 

Q.   I take it these are nice signs for you, as well?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it's good.   Like I said it's nice to have a nice tournament before the break, and you know, it means that the work at home practising is paying off, and I just need to do more of the same.   Try to get 100 per cent fit for The Italian Open and The Ryder Cup, and then just enjoy the experience.
