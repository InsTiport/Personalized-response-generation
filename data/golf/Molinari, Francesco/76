Q. What are your thoughts on coming in second in the BMW PGA Championship?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, well, bittersweet obviously.  I'm happy with my performance today.  Obviously Alex did something quite special today, so it was hard to beat, really.
I think all week, unfortunately, I didn't play the front nine, and especially the first few holes, well enough to really give myself a chance to go low under par.  I did an amazing job of the back nine every day, and today was no different.
Q. You say dropping shots early on never really helps but you managed to get things back on track and it was fairly steady golf all the way through, really?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I mean, a couple of putts maybe could have dropped, but I did well.  I took the chances that I had, and I didn't do the that yesterday.  So I'm glad with that.  Obviously that shot, hitting the flag on 11 yesterday, proved to be really expensive.
Q. How did the rain change things out there?  Seemed to come at a bad time, Alex had just come in and the rain started.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, it just made things tougher.  Today was playing obviously easier with no wind on the front nine, but with the rain, you just lose a bit of control and it just makes it a bit harder.  It is what it is.  I did well to manage the situation, and I'm happy with that.
Q. What's the main positive you take from this week?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Just the whole week, really.  I've been leading again, it seems that I'm leading almost every year after one or two rounds here.  I'm getting closer and closer.  Obviously second is my best finish here, so hopefully I go one better next year.
