 Q. Played well again today. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was another good day. I didn't putt so well. I lost a bit of touch today so I need to do some work now to get it back, but still, one shot back, it's not going to be easy with Goosen in front, but I'll do my best and I'll try to make something tomorrow. 

 Q. And you can't really do anything about someone shooting 64, can you, but it's disappointing not to be leading for the final day?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, I mean, it's not really about leading. It's just you know, I left a few chances on the course and I struggled a bit with the pace of the greens today. It's all right. I mean, we are still quite open because there are a few guys with a chance to win tomorrow. So I'm happy to be in there.

 Q. Do you feel less pressure not being in front? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, I have to say -- obviously, there's a little bit more pressure when you lead, but I wasn't too nervous today. So I think -- I don't know, we'll see tomorrow. Maybe it can be a good thing to come from behind, and who wins tomorrow will definitely have to play a really good round and shoot like 66 or 65 or something like that. 
 So I have the chance to do it and I'll try tomorrow.
