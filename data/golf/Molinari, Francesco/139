 Q.   Talk to me about today, unreal.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   You know, I'm really speechless.   Everybody says the same, in these conditions, that this time was really unthinkable up until yesterday at lunch time, we were just getting beaten every match we were going out.   I think, you know, a huge credit, those two points gave us a lift to go out believing, obviously there was a small chance but we had a chance to do it.  
   
 Q.   What did JosÃ© Maria OlazÃ¡bal say last night?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Just what he said yesterday.   You know, it's easy to speak well when things go well, but even when we were losing, every speech he was making, everyone in the team was in tears.   We couldn't have been more motivated than what we were.   Sometimes it just goes the other way but we were great to hang onto the points that we needed to.   
   
 Q.   How amazing to get a halve there with Tiger Woods.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, three years ago, I went out, I played good golf and I just got crushed.   So the plan was to go out, do the same, play your golf, I played well, and I had a couple of chances the last three holes to go 1‑up.   But then, you know, to get the halve, obviously seeing Martin holing the putt on the 18th was a huge relief, and getting the win was even better.
