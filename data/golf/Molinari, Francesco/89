Q. Good week?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Good week to start the season in the States and almost finish the season in Europe.  I played really well today.  Of all the days, I hit the ball the best.  Golf is funny sometimes things just don't go your way, and I missed a couple of shots and had a couple of awful lies.  Didn't make a lot of putts, but you know, I hung in there.  Finished with two birdies in the last four, which is nice.  Yeah, as you said, maybe I wanted a little bit more but it's still a pretty good week.
It's good.  Obviously now, leaves a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, but it is a good week.
Q. You mentioned the situations for Europe and the United States.  So what's the planning from here?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: The planning from here is go to play one more in the States next week in Vegas, and then come back to play Dubai and then Australia.  So a lot of miles to look forward to.  But I've been at home the last five weeks, so I'm looking forward to playing some good golf, and hopefully keep the good form up.
Q. That sounds pretty punishing, but at the same time, with that good golf, presumably you go into those with confidence and good energy?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to all of those events.  They are all good events, and it's going to be nice finishing the year with Dubai and the World Cup.  Yeah, I'm playing well.  I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully more good stuff will happen.
