 Q.   A very tight match, in the end, you had to birdie the last to get something out of it.   How do you feel about the birdie you made?   It was a good one?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was a good one.   It was a good match, lots of birdies on both sides.   Very hard fought match, but it's nice to come out with the halve when you're 1‑down playing the last.  
   
 Q.   You were level with four to play, what are you saying between you at that stage?   What are the tactics when it's a tight match like that?   
MATTEO MANASSERO:   We knew from the beginning it was going to be a tough match.   Both Simon and Paul are really solid players, and we knew it was going to come down to the end.   I thought in the middle of the back nine, we played a really good game, really good golf.   
Simon made a really clutch putt to stay 1‑down on 14, and that was a big moment for them.   Then on 15, we've been a little unlucky, the tee shot, pulled it a little and stopped in the trees.  
.   We were just thinking of having two birdie chances every time.   I think that's really important in four‑ball to have two balls on the green like we did on 18, so you give yourself two chances and you can make it.   
   
 Q.   Three Seve Trophies for you, two Ryder Cups, how much do you enjoy these team environments, not just the golf but what goes on elsewhere, as well?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   For me it's a lot of fun.   Guys like Matteo, Gonzalo, Nicolas, we played The Ryder Cup together.   We are friends, and it's nice once a year when you get to support each other and have a bit of fun, as well as jokes together.   
So there's a nice atmosphere in our team room, and obviously the main goal is to get on the first tee and focus as possible to win the trophy back.
