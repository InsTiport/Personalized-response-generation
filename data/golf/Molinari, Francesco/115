  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: We were here Sunday together practicing already.  So I think probably we did a good job watching the first.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, depends, you know.  We used to see each other pretty much every week, because we were playing nearly the same schedule.  The last couple of years not so much.  This year I've seen, I don't know, probably every other week, when I'm on Tour he's there, so it's good to see him back.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: 3-wood, 3-wood to probably 15, 20 feet and holed a putt.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I guess there is, yeah.  We don't like to lose to each other.  We don't like to lose to anyone else.  I think it was a big thing when we were growing up in Italy.  Our age, there weren't many golfers playing well.  So to have someone you're competing against every day, even just training alongside, and it was good to get the best out of our games.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, and Matteo, ideally.  But I think there are a few other guys that might ruin that plan.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Honestly, I don't know.  I think obviously we are three talented guys that work hard, so we're bound to get the results.  I don't know if there's a national thing going on at all.  But it's good to see three Italians up there.  I'm sure it's going to be good for the kids watching us at home. So we do our best to involve new golfers and young golfers.  But we see how long that's going to take to work out.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: You know, it does at majors.  But I think in Italy at the moment it's more about team sports and football in particular.  But, yeah, I'm sure tonight they'll be talking about us.  And if we play well we can only help.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, but I think the football fans will still be upset for a few years, no matter if we finish first, second and third.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, it was Edoardo.  I bogeyed the first.  I didn't get off to a fast start but I birdied the par 5, the 5th to get level.  Then made a couple of good saves.  Birdied the 8th.  Got in trouble on the 10th, the par 5, and kept the momentum going.  It was a good finish with birdieing 16 and 18.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: 20 feet.   Q.  You had a 20-footer to keep it going?  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, for par.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah.  Finished fourth last week.  So he's obviously in good form now.  I think he's still very young, so he's bound to have a few ups and downs in his career. But I think he's handling it very well.  And hopefully this is the this isn't the end of it.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I guess it's nice to get a little cushion.  I don't think we'll see these conditions tomorrow and maybe for the rest of the week.  It's a golf course that I think won't play as easy as it did today, and I think on a day like today you just want to make some birdies and you want to be as close to the top as possible.  It's nice to finish 4-under.   Q.  (Inaudible.)  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Probably in 2010 in Gleneagles.
