 Q.   You've beaten an in‑form Henrik Stenson; what was the secret?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Well, I just had quite a poor start really because conceded the first after hitting my first shot into the water, so it wasn't a fantastic start.   But then I birdied three holes in a row and I played very solid after that, so I'm happy.   
He's playing well; he played well today, missing very few shots, and it was a tough match, probably tighter than the score at the end, but a good start for me.  
   
 Q.   Is it refreshing knowing all you have to do is beat the guy in front of you?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I mean, it's different.   For me this year so far, it's been a bit of a struggle really.   I've been making more mistakes than usual on the golf course, more double‑bogeys.   I guess it's kind of better playing match play if you're playing that way.   
But today was good.   One mistake at the first and then good playing, good putting, some solid putts, as well, on the back nine.   So, a good start.   
   
 Q.   First competitive round on this new venue; tell us how it played.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Very different from yesterday.   The wind was a bit different, and it switched after we were at the 10th and 11th, it was really, really firm.   I was hitting 3‑woods 330 yards which is really not normally the case.   It's not easy to judge the yardages.   It's good fun.   It's a great scenery obviously but it's fun to play, as well.
