 Q. Talk about this week and how it's unfolded and being in Hawai'i?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, you know, for me it's a great bonus to be here. I was very happy when I knew I got in here for the win in China. 
 You know, I came in here without expecting too much, obviously because it's the first week after a long break. It's great fun. The weather, it's perfect. The course, it's not too stressful, so I think it's a good golf course for the first week of the year.

 Q. Are you able to mix in a little bit of fun or are you strictly golf this week?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I went whale watching the other day and I went around with the car to see some of the views, and it's obviously a great place. It's a perfect place to start the year.

 Q. Obviously you didn't know this, but how much are you going to play in the Middle East? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I'm going to play probably three out of four. So I'm going to take a break next week and then fly Abu Dhabi to start there. It's obviously a tough schedule in January but I'm going to take a break because my wife is pregnant, so I figured that it was a good idea to play maybe a bit more it and travel a bit more in January. 

 Q. So you won't be back to the U.S., if everything goes well, until the Match Play?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Probably Doral. I'll probably skip the Match Play because the baby is due just the week before. So unless the baby comes early, a few weeks, I'll probably skip the Match Play and start again in Doral. 

 Q. Talk about your round today?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was not a great start. I 3-putted the first and the second, and I think that made me play probably a bit more aggressive after that. I missed a couple of putts but then the putts started dropping very quickly and that was the key to make birdies. It was obviously a very good round after that.
