 Q.  Beautiful round of golf out there.  What was the key to your round?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I played very well.  Obviously I played well yesterday, too.  I think it's a course where you need some luck at certain times.  I think today I got the right breaks at the right time.  Obviously, the start was really good with two birdies.  I just played well.  Made some important par putts when I missed the green.  Managed to give myself a chance to save par.  So obviously very happy with the way I played.   
 Q.  Did the course change after the rain?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: The fairways were a little bit softer.  The greens maybe a little bit softer, too, but still releasing quite a bit.  Still fast.  I was surprised; I thought it was going to be more different after the rain.   
 Q.  What do you have to do now for the weekend?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Just try to hit good golf shots.  Yesterday I played nicely and I shot 2-over, so it's a course that you can play well and shoot over par.  You have to be patient and just try to hit good shots and give myself chances where possible and make pars when you get in trouble.   
 Q.  Looking ahead to tomorrow, how important was it to get your round completed today and not have to come early tomorrow?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's nice.  Hopefully to get more rest, sleep in tomorrow morning.  I feel tired now.  When you get the rain delays, it becomes a long day and mentally it's not easy to stay switched on for such a long time.  I'm definitely looking forward to some rest.
