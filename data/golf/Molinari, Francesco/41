 Q.  What does this moment mean right now?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: So much, so much more than majors, more than anything.  You know, it's hard not to get emotional when you think about the other players, the vice captains, Thomas, the wives.  It's been an incredible week.  Obviously they had probably the strongest team ever and were just so good.   
 Q.  How do you stay so calm?  How have you stayed so calm to produce what has been an unbelievable performance personally going five for five in this Ryder Cup?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I just try to do things, be professional and obviously I had an amazing partner in Tommy.  Never felt like I had a rookie playing alongside me.  It's been amazing, and today, it was just hard to get the energy.  It's been a long week, playing five matches, but you know, again, I stepped it up when I had to and you know, that putt on 14 was great.  Just amazing.   
 Q.  How magical has this European side been this year?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's been the best I've been a part of.  You know, I said it at the beginning of the week, we gelled as well as ever and just incredible, every single one of the players is doing the right
