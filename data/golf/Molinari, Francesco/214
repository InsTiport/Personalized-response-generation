 Q. Disappointed? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah. A lot. 

 Q. What happened today? You still played pretty well. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I played all right, but just the two short putts on 16 and 17 made the difference in the end. 
 I struggled a bit again with the putter today. So, it's all right. Right now I'm disappointed but probably tomorrow will feel better. 

 Q. Still a very, very good performance in a very strong field this week, so do you take some comfort from that?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'd like to take some trophies after taking so much confidence week after week, but I just have to wait and I'm sure it will happen.
