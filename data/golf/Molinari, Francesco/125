  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I haven't played really well on the back nine this week.   It seems I always got off to a good start and then was kind of stalling on the back nine.   So it was a pretty good start again today.   
I 3‑putted the 9th and thought, you know, maybe I'll get everything back on the back nine.   
Made a good birdie on 11; 3‑putt again on 12 from far away.   
And then hit a great shot on 13 to make eagle and from then on, it seemed that everything was going in and all the shots were going on the right lines.   
You know, it just a great feeling, when you get to play nine holes like that, it's an amazing feeling.  
   
 Q.   From then on, did you, therefore, think about victory and the chances?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Well, you know, I was just trying to make as many putts as I could, as many birdies as I could.   I thought I was a bit too far back to be honest with you; with this wind, the back nine, especially the last four or five holes are playing a bit easier.   
So, you know, we'll see if I can be just really happy with my round today.   I've been playing well for a while now.   I've been putting better, but, you know, you need a bit of luck at the right time and I got it today.   And I made the most of it I think.   
   
 Q.   I sense you don't feel it's quite enough.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I don't know.   We'll see.   You never know in golf.   But Gonzo, he's a tough guy, and he knows how to win.   We were at dinner together last night.   I didn't think he was expecting a charge from me, probably from someone else, but we'll see what happens.
