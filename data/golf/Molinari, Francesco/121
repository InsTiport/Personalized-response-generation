 Q.   Talk about your start.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I'm very happy with the start.   I hit the ball very good yesterday and this morning, as well, it was really, really tough this morning coming in.   But I guess we got really lucky playing 18 downwind.   Obviously it was a lot easier than yesterday.  
   
 Q.   What are the parts of your game that suit this golf course in these kind of conditions?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I like playing in the wind usually, and I think it's a golf course where you need to drive the ball very well.   There's a lot of water around obviously and a lot of bunkers, so if you can hit a lot of fairways, you're going to have a big advantage.   
   
 Q.   Generally speaking, where are you with your game at the moment coming into this really big run of tournaments?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I'm happy where I am.   I felt like I was playing good in the Match Play, obviously lost to Thomas BjÃ¶rn in the first round; but we had a good match and I was still happy the way I played.   I'm looking forward to the next few tournaments.   I'm hitting the ball well.
