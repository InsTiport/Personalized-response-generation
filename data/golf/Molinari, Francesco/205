  Q. Just some general comments on the round as you head into Sunday.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was a bit of a struggle today, but I'm really happy the way I finished, and I'm really happy the way I fought on the course. It wasn't easy. The course was playing much, much harder, and the wind was stronger. So it wasn't definitely as easy as yesterday.   
 As I said, my game is still in good shape, maybe a bit too many bogeys today, but I'm happy to be still in contention, and I'll do my best tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Did you talk to your brother at all last night?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, he sent me a text, but we didn't speak on the phone, and obviously he told me he was very happy the way I was playing and just to keep the good stuff going.   
  
  Q. Is that what the text said?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah.  
  
  Q. Is there another course anything like this in Italy?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Not that I remember. I mean, the course we used to play the Italian Open on, the 18th is a similar hole because there's a lake from the tee to the green on the left, but that's as close as it gets.
