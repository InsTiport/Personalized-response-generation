 Q.   Talk about today.   All in all really solid on your part.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yes, I played well.   I could have holed a few more putts, but it wasn't easy out there.   
I'm happy with the way I played.   The way I thought.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Tell me about 15, the rough, that second shot.   That almost went in?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I know.   I couldn't really see that well, because it was into the sun.   But it was in between a 6 and a 7.   And I took a 6, thinking it was going to jump and it didn't jump, it came out perfect, probably a bit more aggressively than what I was trying to do but great shot.   
   
 Q.   It handed soft.   It almost went in.   I was up at the green.   What about tomorrow, how confident do you feel‑‑ you've got to feel good, because you're playing well.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, yeah, exactly.   I'm hitting the ball well.   Maybe missed a few too many tee shots today.   But I'm rolling the ball well with the putter so everything is in good shape.   I just need to go out there tomorrow and try to make as many birdies as possible.
