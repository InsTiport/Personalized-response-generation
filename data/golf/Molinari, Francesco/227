Q.  Good round to get you up in the hunt?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's nice to be up there. I had a slow start on the first day but yesterday and today, I have played solidly. I started to roll the putts in and my confidence is getting better and I'm hitting the ball a lot better. I'm just going out to do my best.
Q.  A bit of excitement on 18?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:  A bit of luck on 18. I was 15 centimeters to the water after my drive, and had to take off my shoes and socks off to get into the water and hit the ball back to the fairway. Then hit a good nine iron to 12 feet and made the putt. It was nice.
Q.  Thoughts for tomorrow?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I'm not going to think about anything tomorrow. I just want to get out there and play my best golf and see what happens. I'm hitting the ball quite well, hitting a good number of fairways and greens. If you do that, you will have some birdie chances.
