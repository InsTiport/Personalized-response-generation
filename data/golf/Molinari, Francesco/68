Q. How pleased are you with a round of 66 today?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, very pleased.  I played very well.  I think the game has been improving throughout the week, which is important.  I didn't make too many putts -- missed by inches, but I'm happy.  Obviously I know it's going to be tough tomorrow but I'm in good position.
I'm sure there's many other guys playing well and feeling happy about their game, so I think it's going to be kind of a shootout.  Everyone is very close.  Matt Wallace is a talented player and he's won loads of times last year on the Alps Tour, so he knows how to win tournaments.  It won't be easy for anyone, but I'm happy to be in the mix.
Q. How much are you looking forward to that challenge?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'm just looking forward to the last day of such a great event, great crowds.  Again, great weather.  We couldn't ask for anything more.
Q. How much have the crowds pulled you along this week so far?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's great.  Obviously I need to do my own thing and stay patient.  Obviously they want me to do well, and they want me to birdie every hole, which I realise is not a realistic goal.  It's great to have their support.
Q. How much are you looking forward to the challenge of chasing down a third Italian Open title?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It would be amazing.  I'm glad I've put myself in this position.  Hopefully tomorrow things will go my way like they did last year.  But you know, I can only control so much, and I'll try to do that.
