Q.   Two second place finishes here in back‑to‑back years, 2010 and 2009, so a course that suits your game here?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think so.   I've always enjoyed coming here.   You know, it's a good course, a great event, weather is usually best of the year, so it's always nice to come here.   You've got a great spot on here the Tivoli Hotel, and it's an enjoyable week for everyone.

Q.   Tied seventh the BMW PGA is your best finish this year, so you must feel you're due a good performance this week perhaps. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I feel I've been playing okay all year but not getting the scores I'd like. 
So you know, it's time to push on and to try to have a good, strong finish to the year and yeah, that's what I'm going to try to do from this week onwards.

Q.   What aspects of the game are key to shooting low scores around here? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   The scoring is quite good, so you need to putt well to go deep under par.   But at the same time there's a few water hazards in play, so you need to be I think a bit careful off the tee and you can aggressive with the rest of the game.

Q.   Pro‑Am this afternoon, so a chance for you to look at how the course is set up this year?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I haven't played this week yet, so I'm going to have good look at the course.   I guess it's going to be similar to the other years, so yeah, be good to have a good look at it before going out tomorrow.
