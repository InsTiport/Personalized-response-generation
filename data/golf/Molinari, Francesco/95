 Q.  So what do you make of a first-round score here?  Lovely low one to start?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Good start.  Obviously it's a course that I enjoy playing.  I think it's in great conditions again, as pretty much every year.  With all the works they had to do for the drainage system and the irrigation system, it's impressive how well the course has recovered.  It's nice to be here playing.  Played nicely today.  Holed some good putts.  Good start for the week.   
 Q.  How much does it help when you have good memories of playing so well here?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Not much.  Not much, because that kind of course, you still need to hit a lot of good shots and you can't get away with any loose shots.  It's nice.   
Obviously I'm looking forward to this week every year but then when you step on the first tee, it's almost a case of forgetting what you did in the past and just be 100 percent on every shot.   
 Q.  You know how the course can bite back and the weather conditions; it's pretty breezy right from the start today, wasn't it?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was pretty much the same from the start.  I think it's a pretty good breeze.  The other direction would be probably tougher but yeah, the course is, as I said, in great shape, so everything is there for a great week.   
 Q.  I'm sure you'd have played this anyway, but are you totally conscious of the added points and the added status of the event this year?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I think it was a smart move from the Tour.  It's nice to see Rory here and to see a lot of the great guys, great players, supporting the event and supporting the Tour.  I'm sure it wasn't an easy choice for anyone who was exempt for Akron, but I think they did a good job.
