Q. With those birdies on the back nine, find yourself still in a nice position.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's good.  I played pretty well all day again.  Some days it goes your way and some days it doesn't, but I did well to recover on the back nine.  I'm still very confident about tomorrow.
Q. Showing resilience and patience, I guess?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, you know, it's hard to play 72 holes in a tournament without moments like today.  So it's more really how you react to them and I'm happy the way that I did today.
Q. Given that we lost 50 minutes because of the fog at the start of play, how conscious were you of the timing and the gloom to finish?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: We checked our watches on 14 and it wasn't looking too good, but fortunately, the groups in front of us sped up the last few holes and we managed to finish actually with some light to spare.  So it was very impressive.
Q. How was it on those greens to finish?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was fine.  There was plenty of light.
Q. And regrouping, very positive into the last round?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'm still very confident.  I played well today.  I think 2-under is not a very truthful score of the way I played.  Hopefully I'm keeping some of the birdies for tomorrow.
