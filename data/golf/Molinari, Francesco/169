  Q. Could you please reflect on your first-round draw?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I'm quite happy with the half a point. Obviously I had a very good start but I knew with Ian, nothing was going to come easy. So, you know, he made a great birdie on 18.  
 And I think I played very solid all day. It was quite tricky with the wind. I'm happy with the way I played today.  
  
  Q. When you holed from 30 feet, you must have thought, this is easy.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, yeah, but you know, sometimes it happens. I had a few good putts, actually, today. Some important putts. So like I said, I'm pleased the way I played and putted and just have to do the same tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Trust it doesn't feel like a de feet, because you always knew yours would be a tough one and the group system?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, half a point and a tough point, and I'm happy to take it against a good player like Ian.   
 Obviously tomorrow is going to be very important, but you know, it was going to be a tough match anyway, so I hope to do my best tomorrow.  
  
  Q. Without being too rude, dare I say, what we have been saying on Twitter about West Ham not being able to hold onto a lead --  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's not been a great time for West Ham, so I think I need to stay away from football for a little while.  
  
  Q. And how is fatherhood, changing the topic entirely.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Fatherhood is very nice. It's interesting. It's tiring. It's very nice. My wife and the baby are here this week. So it's good to spend some time with them after a few weeks away.   
  
  Q. Sleepless nights?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's getting better. We get four or five hours of sleep a time.   
  
  Q. I presume for most people it changes an emphasis on life and career, does it make much of a difference to you?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It does. It's an unbelievable feeling, and in the end of the day, the only thing you want to do is to spend time with the baby and obviously my wife.   
 As I said, I'm really happy that they are here and hopefully we can still here until Sunday.   
  
  Q. How did you find the course; was it in great condition?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, absolutely. The greens are firm absolutely pure and I think they are probably one of the best greens we putt on all year.   
 The golf course, it's tricky with the wind. So you know, you can make a lot of birdies, but you can make a lot of bogeys, as well.   
  
  Q. Exciting for match play?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Absolutely. I think it's perfect for match play and I think every match this week is going to be very exciting.   
  
  Q. Enjoying staying in the hotel?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yes, Finca Cortesin is fantastic. My family is here with me, so I'm having a really good time with them.
