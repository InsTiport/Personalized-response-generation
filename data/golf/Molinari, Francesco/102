 Q.   I know not the finish you wanted, but still some great golf, just talk about your round here.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, just a great week.   I think the shot at 16 will stay in my mind for a while.   But it was just two or three short of being good.   I tried my best, which is what I wanted to do.   I fought hard and I'm really happy with the week I've had here.   
   
 Q.   What happened on 16, that shot?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I wasn't sure that I could carry to the flag, so it was farther right.   And unfortunately didn't get enough breeze to get up there.   But, you know, when you're down you have to try to win the tournament.   So it was a decent shot, it just went left and nothing I can do about it.  
   
 Q.   What was the club on 16?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   8â€‘iron.   
   
 Q.   What year is this for you on the Tour?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It's my first year as a full member.   So my first goal is to hopefully keep my card for next year, it's not easy playing only 15 events over here.  
   
 Q.   This is your first Memorial appearance, correct?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yes.  
   
 Q.   How was your time here at Jack's course?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Great.   Obviously I enjoyed every single minute of it, and I hope to be back next year.   
   
 Q.   What do you take away from the tournament, not just here, but at Wentworth, when you were in the final group as well on Sunday?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Just obviously I'm really close.   When you get that close, it's pretty small margins.   And I think I just need to wait for my time to get the right breaks at the right time and just keep doing what I'm doing, because it's working well.   
   
 Q.   (Inaudible.)  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I was watching the leaderboard, so I knew pretty much where I was standing.   I think there was a stretch at the beginning of the back nine where I didn't play that well, but I started playing well again, and 16 just making all the difference.   It's the way it is.  
   
 Q.   16, you fully intended to attack that pin in the back?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I was going a little farther right.   I was probably five yards right, and pulled it slightly, but sometimes you get away with those shots and sometimes you don't.
