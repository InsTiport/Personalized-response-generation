Q.   You started the day with a one‑shot lead and ended tied with your playing partner.   How do you feel about your play today? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was really good again.   There were a few balls flying at the start with the albatrosses and other stuff you don't want to see when you're leading a tournament.   I stayed calm and played well the front.   The wind switched today, and I think the front was a bit more scorable, and the end, it was a bit tougher.   But overall just one bogey on the card, a few birdies, so a good day. 

Q.   How do you view tomorrow in terms of your achievements in the game so far, you've not won a major but you've won a World Golf Championship.   Where would this rank if you were to pull it off? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Every tournament is different but to win here would be pretty much at the same level I would say as the WGC.   I think it's one of these tournaments that it's just a little step underneath the majors but definitely one that you want to have on your resumÃ© in your career. 

Q.   You've had the outright lead the last couple of nights; how do you view your position after that round today? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I'm happy with what I did today.   Obviously maybe I had the chance on the last four holes to maybe separate myself from the field, but, you know, another 18 holes tomorrow, it's going to be another long day.   I'm happy the way I'm playing.   That's the main thing.   So hopefully tomorrow get the right breaks at the right time and manage to win the tournament.

Q.   You seem very comfortable with yourself and the game at the moment.   When you get on these runs you seem to be able to produce your best.   What's been the catalyst and spark for it on this occasion? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I don't know, this time of the year, I usually get into form for some reason, particularly here at Wentworth.   I just love the place, I love the atmosphere and I love the golf course especially.   Hopefully I play the same kind of golf tomorrow. 

Q.   How much is riding personally on a good result tomorrow?   It's a big summer ahead with the U.S. Open and Open Championship; this would solve a lot of problems, wouldn't it? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I'm aware of that but just need to focus on my golf and doing my best.   I don't have to get too far ahead of myself.   Obviously leading every day for three rounds is going to be in the back of your mind.   Tomorrow, it's a new day, a new start, so I need to forget about these last three days and do my best. 

Q.   Fabulous display over the last three days.   Are you pleased with the way you played today? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yes, I am.   It's not easy to lead a tournament from the first day.   Obviously it's the ideal position, but you've got guys coming for you and today I could hear the roars for the eagles and albatross.   It was another good day.   I played solid.   Only one dropped shot which is the main thing. 

Q.   What was the strength for you today? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I think consistency again.   I hit a lot of fairways.   You've seen in the last few holes when I started missing a few more fairways, things get a lot tougher around here.   So that's the first goal for tomorrow, put the ball in the short stuff and try to make a few birdies.

Q.   You always seem to hit form at this time of year.   Why is that? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I have no idea.   If I had, I would try to reproduce that at other times of the season.   But I don't know, it just seems to happen every year, and it's great.   It's nice to come into a tournament like this in good form.

Q.   Can you let us into your game plan tomorrow going out in the final group? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, nothing special, like today.   If I hit greens and make as many putts as possible, be patient; it's a course where things can turn around very quickly.   So don't get too ahead of myself and just do my best.
