 Q. Obviously you're a professional and you want to win yourself, but that must have been something special to see your brother win?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, absolutely, apart from seeing him winning, but it was really special to play together in a tournament like this in the last group, and I think it was great. You know, we had fun going around and he played very solid today, you know, the way he needed to play to win. So I think he deserved to win.

 Q. You must be really pleased for him. It's a great achievement to win on The European Tour; you know what he's feeling right now, don't you. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Especially a tournament like this; it's not just any tournament on The European Tour. 
 I think he needs to be really proud and like I said, he played an amazing round yesterday and I think that was the key moment of the tournament. 

 Q. Did you think he was -- was there ever a stage you thought, hang on, he's wobbling a bit here? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No. As I said, it was solid all the round. 15, obviously, he hit a poor tee shot but I think it was probably because he relaxed a little bit too much after holing the putt on 14. It was really, really solid all the way around, so I think it was never in doubt.

 Q. What did you say to him at the end? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Nothing; well done, enjoy, and it was really nice to play with him today. We had good fun for all the day. 

 Q. And surely you said to him, "You must be buying the dinner tonight, Edoardo." 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, better buy dinner.

 Q. And going ON to St. Andrews, something to look forward to again for the two of you?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yes, we are both playing well, so it's going to be an interesting week, and we'll see what happens.
