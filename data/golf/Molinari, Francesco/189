  Q. Your thoughts, disappointing not to have won; you came here to win.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: A little disappointed, yeah. Still a good week, but I think I didn't play good enough today. So just a bit disappointed, yeah.  
  
  Q. Was it just one of those days for your own game, you couldn't quite get there?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I struggled a bit from the start with the wind, and you know, I tried to -- I think I did pretty well to fight back. It was really hard. I was putting the ball too far from the hole and it was a really tough day for me.  
  
  Q. Extraordinary difficult circumstances for you, to play with your brother; but you must be pleased for him?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's not easy. Obviously I'm very pleased for him. I think he's Donna amazingly good to win, you know, coming here with the pressure of The Ryder Cup. We'll see what happens in the next few hours, but I think he's give it his best. So I mean, I'm really happy and proud for him.   
  
  Q. I'm not sure, I know what your answer might be to this question, but do you think he has done enough to join you in Celtic Manor?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, I don't know if he's done enough. It was hard to do more than this. So, we'll see what happens. There's a lot of factors to Colin's decision, but, I mean, he's done an amazing season so far. So I guess, I mean, if I was him, I would be disappointed in not getting the pick. But, yeah, somebody has to be disappointed.   
  
  Q. The Ryder Cup for you, what's your own schedule leading up to Celtic Manor?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I'm going to take a week off next week. I'm probably going to play Holland, and then I'll take another two weeks off. I need to discuss with Colin and with the vice captains, maybe ask them for their advice to see what they suggest.
