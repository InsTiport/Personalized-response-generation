Q.   Yesterday you told us you played very solidly, was it the same story today?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, probably a few more loose shots today, a couple of loose shots today.   I started very well again, but then he fought back and he almost went all‑square.   At the 10th hole, I had to hole a long putt to stay 1‑up. 
It was good, Felipe played quite well, as well.   I'm happy with the game.   Looking forward to the rest of the week.

Q.   This golf course when we first saw it, we thought you need to be accurate, and when we think accuracy, we think of you. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Many holes, you're either on the fairway or probably a lost ball or a hazard, so it's definitely important to be accurate off the tees.   As I said, today it wasn't my best really with the tee shots, but usually it's one of my strengths.

Q.   Having won two matches, you know that you're into the next round without any playoff to decide anything later on; will you have the afternoon off or before you have some practice?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, some practice but mainly resting and trying to get energies back.   Tomorrow will be a long day with two rounds and maybe Sunday, so it's important to keep the energies for the rest of the week. 

Q.   I take it that's mission accomplished, two wins out of two. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it's good to know that I'm through the group already, and that was the first goal, so another good day.   I played really well the first few holes, and then hit a few loose shots and let Felipe back into the match but I did well to close it in the end.   So you know, a good day, and looking forward to tomorrow and Sunday.
