 Q.   Bogey‑free 8‑under 64, your thoughts on that round.   
FRANCISCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, obviously very happy.   I played well.   I had a steady start and kind of got it going, birdieing 17 and 18, starting off the 10th.   And then birdied 1, 2, 3, which was great.   
I'm playing well, I'm putting well, so I was looking for a good week, obviously you never know what you're going to get, but it's a great start.   
   
 Q.   You referenced the week and the start, this is your second week as a full‑time member of the PGA TOUR.   Hawaii, Palm Springs, how has the experience been thus far?  
FRANCISCO MOLINARI:   It's been along journey last week to get there, but I loved the course, great course and I think I played okay.   I didn't make enough putts last week to really be in contention.   And, yeah, I'm loving it.   I've been on the European Tour for 10 years, so it's nice, I think, to be here for a change and to try something a little bit different.   
   
 Q.   You have a fellow European in Gonzalo in the pairing today, that must have eased things up a bit.   
FRANCISCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, we're great friends.   We know each other since we were probably 15, so it was nice to have his company and I love his company tomorrow and the day after as well, so it's going to be fun to be out with him.
