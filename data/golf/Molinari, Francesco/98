 Q.  10-under par, bogey-free for two rounds.  Must be happy.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I've been playing well the last couple of days, holing some nice putts, especially some nice par putts to keep the round going.  So, it's good.  It's low scoring, obviously this week, but 10-under is a solid start.   
 Q.  You had a top-10 here last year, what is it about the desert golf that seems to fit you?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I don't know, I just think the courses are in great condition.  Obviously, we changed two courses from last year, but still the greens are absolutely pure and it's just a pleasure to be out here playing under the conditions.  They don't get any better than this.   
 Q.  You played La Quinta and then the next Nicklaus Tournament Course today, the Stadium Course tomorrow.  Your thoughts on that one.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's a proper course.  I think each course is slightly different.  The Nicklaus I think has got the smaller greens and they were quite firm this morning.  So, we'll see.  We'll see tomorrow.  Conditions should be similar, so hopefully a lot of good pace on the greens and make some putts.
