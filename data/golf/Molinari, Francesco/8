Q. Good, solid couple of rounds, and you have such good memories from a year ago. Is it nice to be back as defending champion and to have another few birdies out there?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, obviously I love this place. I always nice to play at Wentworth, but obviously extra special he defending last year's win. Yeah, the start has been pretty good so far. A few mistakes too many, but hopefully clean the scorecard on the weekend and try to go low.
Q. It did get tougher as the day went on as the wind picked up. How do you reflect on where you're sitting at the weekend?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: A bit disappointed with the last few holes. I got it to 7-under at a point and then dropped a couple on the way in. So could have been a bit better, but obviously we are only halfway. Like I said, the main thing is not doing again the mistakes in the next couple of days.
Q. You've had so many experiences, good experience, a lot of them since this time last year. When you look at your game and what you've experienced on and off the course, coming into a weekend, do you sort of have more confidence and feel more comfortable in yourself to go and chase down a lead and put together a couple good rounds here?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, obviously the experiences from the last year and a half are going to help. The main thing is just, you know, working hard and playing well. I feel like the game is on a good path. Still missing a couple of beats, but in golf, you never know when it clicks. So hopefully it will be sooner than I think.
