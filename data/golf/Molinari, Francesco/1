Q. How would you assess your round today?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, pretty good.  It was my first time around here, so without Fooch on the bag, a few questionable decisions maybe, but most of it worked out okay, just a couple of bogeys with wedges in hand, which is disappointing.
I guess the greens here are tricky so even on the short holes you need to be careful with the approach shots to the green.
Q. Your first overall thoughts going around there, I mean obviously a difficult golf course, a little more difficult than Pebble?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   I don't know, I mean I was surprised, to be honest.  I was expecting this to be the lower scoring one this morning before going out.  I think probably, yeah, the pin positions are quite tricky here and if you get out of position it's really hard to get it up-and-down.
So, yeah, I did a good job to stay on the fairways most of the day, so decent start.
