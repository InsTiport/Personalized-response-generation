  FRANCESO MOLINARI:   We only played a few holes after the restart but overall it was a pretty good start for me. I felt good about my game coming into the tournament but it s early in this tournament and we ve only played 13 holes. I m happy with the start though. I made three birdies and no bogeys, which is good on a golf course this tough. I m really happy but it is very early to be too happy.   
With the wind today anything under par was good. It was hard. It s not an easy golf course anyway but the wind was making it harder too for everyone. It s never easy coming off. It looked like we weren t going to be out for too long so I tried to play a bit safer and consolidate what I had.
