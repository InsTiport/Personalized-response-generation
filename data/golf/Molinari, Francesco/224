  Q. 65, that's a wonderful round of golf.  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was a really good day. It was one of those days where almost everything goes in, so I'm really happy with it, and hopefully I can do something like this tomorrow, as well.  
  
  Q. Did you feel it coming this week at some point? Did you think you were nearly getting to your game?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: The last couple of weeks, I've been playing all right. So I knew I could score well.   
 I holed a few putts. I still missed something, but I mean, it's great. 65, it's very good.   
  
  Q. What's the best part of your game right now?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think I'm quite consistent with everything. It just depends on how many putts dropped and that's the main thing, so I'll be warming up the putter now for tomorrow and hopefully I'll have another good day.   
  
  Q. What would it mean to you to win tomorrow?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It would mean quite a lot obviously. I know Robert is a great player, so it will be tough, but I'll do my best tomorrow.  
  
  Q. What about The Ryder Cup next week; are you going to watch that?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, I don't know, because I'm going to be in Malaysia with my brother to qualify for the World Cup, so depending on the jet-lag. If I can look at something, I'll be happy.
