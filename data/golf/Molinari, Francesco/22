 Q.  Pars were pretty good on the back nine to just stay ahead of them.  Your thoughts on how it went here?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, obviously a very good start and then I think we were both really struggling for energy a little bit on the back nine.  It was a very long week.  But, yeah, we tried to keep going.  And obviously I think I played very well on the front nine this afternoon.  So maybe a bit of consolation from this morning.   
 Q.  Yeah, let's talk about this morning and the loss there and I followed every shot.  You just seemed kind of off.  Putting, couldn't get the right reads.  The short game wasn't very good.  What happened there?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's just one of those days, too many mental mistakes and some really weird shots around the greens.  But, yeah, all in all it's a positive week.  Obviously it's bittersweet right now.  I think going into Augusta it's a good work.  Clearly I need to get my short game a little bit sharper than this morning, but otherwise it seems pretty good.   
 Q.  Sum up this week for us, because you've done remarkable things for out there.  You seemed to play really, really well.  So there are some positives?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, definitely a positive week.  Just a shame about this morning on the back nine I didn't play my game and made too many mistakes, and kind of gave it away once, and then managed to fight my way back and then gave it away again.  Like once wasn't enough.  But it's golf and it's a long week, and seven rounds you can happen to be slightly off for a few holes.  So, yeah, positive in general.
