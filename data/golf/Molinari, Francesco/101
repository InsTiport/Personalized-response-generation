 Q.  Under par round, Phil Mickelson came off at 1-under.  He's happy.  It's a good start.  Do you feel that way?  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I'm really happy.  Anything under par around here, you take it and run away.  So it was a good day.  Played solid, got in trouble on 4, but I managed to get up-and-down for a bogey, which was important because it could have cost me a few shots there and just played well, stick to the plan and good start.   Q.  How is the course playing?  FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think it was fair.  This morning it's tough, obviously, but the flags were sensible and the general setup of the course.  The tee boxes were not too far back on the longest holes, so I thought it was a good setup for today.
