 Q. Just first your birdie. You got it right back to 4-under before they called play. Talk about that. How big was that?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was obviously a good feeling to finish like that and it was almost so dark and I almost could not see the hole, but we just wanted to get finished, to finish the hole and that. But I played quite solid the first five holes. It was really tough because there were two or three that were playing right into the wind. So level par for the five holes that I played today is a pretty good score and I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning. 

 Q. Conditions out there this evening tough with the wind, tougher than yesterday?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah. I think we were very unlucky to start from the first because if you start from the 10th you get the wind down for the first four holes and as I said, the second and the third and the fourth were really quite tough today because it was straight into the wind and it was at least a two club wind.

 Q. How big of a challenge has it been to have this long wait, finish early yesterday and then wait all day today? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's not been easy but I think it's going to be more or less the same for the guys who played this morning, you know, tomorrow morning, to wait for to us finish and so I don't think that it's going to make a huge difference.
