  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:     I didn't make many bogeys.   Just disappointing it wasn't my day.   I'm come again next year, try another time.   
   
 Q.   Is it all the more frustrating when you've led for three days and you've played such wonderful, controlled golf?   
    FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It is, but I knew obviously leading the first three days didn't count for anything.   So I knew there was a job to be done today, and unfortunately I couldn't do it.   
   
 Q.   You've played alongside a man who has won, so can you give us an appreciation of how well he's played?   
    FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, well, yesterday and today, both days, he played great.   Missed hardly any shots and any putts.   So I think he deserves the title completely.
