  Q. Pity about the last hole but anything in double figures has a real chance of winning tomorrow.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's quite packed and I'm quite happy with the way I played. I was going very well on the first few holes and I just 3-putted the 7th, and couldn't really get anymore birdies until the 16th, and then 18, I hit a good tee shot and I think I just got a gust of wind with the second shot, because it was a good shot.   
 You know, it's a tough hole, so bogey is acceptable.   
  
  Q. Overall, you feel you've striking the ball well and thinking well around the course this week?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, all week. I just hope it's going to be windy tomorrow like yesterday and I think that the golf course is in great condition. It's firm and you need to hit fairways to score well. So let's see.   
  
  Q. Do you think being windy tomorrow opens it up to more people to maybe catch Dustin Johnson and get past him?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Probably. Not even three shots, but four or five shots back has a chance. It's a golf course where you can make a few birdies or bogeys, as well. I think there's still a lot to happen tomorrow.   
  
  Q. Another Sunday in contention, always a pleasant feeling, isn't it.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, yeah, it's good. Obviously 11-under would have been even better going into tomorrow, but three shots back, it's close enough to have a shot at it.
