  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It's been obviously pretty good.   Two solid days.   I didn't start playing very well yesterday, but I kind of held it together and then started playing better.   Today was really good.   So really happy with the first two days.   Obviously a bit further back than I would like, but there's still time to catch up.

Q.   What was it today that improved on the opening day? 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Driving mainly.   Yesterday I hit a couple of wild tee shots, which is a bit strange for me, so today I kept the ball in play off the tees and hit some nice shots with the irons.   So it could have been even better than 67, but, you know, it's a good round. 

Q.   We appreciate at the moment it is six back, but you'll appreciate, too, just what scores are possible around here. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, definitely, especially if the weather is as benign as it was today with very little wind.   You know, there's a low score out there, all the par 5s are in reach, and I didn't play them extremely well today, so something to improve tomorrow.

Q.   You've seen the progress of this course over the last five years of development, it's in a good place, isn't it, now. 
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think so.   I think it's a solid golf course.   Obviously it needs some wind to be probably a bit more testing, but, you know, usually you don't need to ask for the wind here.   So it's a bit unusual weather that we are having these days, but we'll see what we are going to get on the weekend.
