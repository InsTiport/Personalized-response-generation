 Q.  The round didn't get off to the best start, but it was good after that.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, the first is always a tough opening hole.  I wasn't too pleased with the bogey but you can easily make more there.  It's a tough start, 1, 2, 3, I think if you get around there 1-over par, you're still doing okay.   
Yeah, since then, I played nicely.  Wasn't my best maybe to be honest but saved a few important shots, and took the opportunities when I had them.  Obviously very pleased, 5-under, it's a very good start.   
 Q.  A lot of changes to the course this year but you made it four Top 10s in a row before last year, so the old course seemed to suit you, as well.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I like the old course.  I was probably one of the few guys.  I think it's still very similar.  Obviously they got rid of a few bunkers off the tee which makes it a bit more forgiving, but if you hit the ball where the bunkers were, you still have a tough shot.  So there's a bit more of shot-making involved.  I think it's probably more enjoyable for the fans, as well, not to see us just chip it out of the bunker.  So I think they made some really good changes.   
 Q.  The 67 today, what was the most pleasing fact of that round for you?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think just my attitude and the way I stayed out there on the course, stayed patient and just waited for my chances and scored very well.
