  FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   We need to try to get that going tomorrow and just need a bit of luck to be on us.   It's not been going our way so far, but as Justin said, it's not over yet, so we need to keep believing and keep trying.

Q.   Justin, you've had no time off in this match.   You're about the only European who can say that.   How are you feeling? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   I'm not feeling too bad, actually.   I'm feeling a little bit fresher this afternoon than I was yesterday afternoon.   I'd be feeling a lot better if we were winning our games. 
But that's the whole thing.   Our team, we'll have some fresh players tomorrow, and hopefully everyone will come out and give it 100 percent.   Obviously you play more for pride no matter what in this tournament, so you never know; Ben Crenshaw said it can happen, and I just really feel if we can get close, I think everything will hit and we'll start to get a little bit frantic out here, and the American team will feel that.

Q.   What's it going to take to ignite Europe? 
JUSTIN ROSE:   Well, it's going to take a 3â€‘1 session.   Colsaerts and Lawrie need to win their game, Poulter and McIlroy need a huge comeback, and I think that would be the turnaround.
