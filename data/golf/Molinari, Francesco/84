 Q.  What's your verdict on the week?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: A good week.  Obviously could have been slightly better on the weekend, but I did my best.  I tried as hard as I could and I think it just wasn't meant to be.  But I'm happy with the way I'm playing.  I'm still very happy going into next week, and hopefully another good week to finish off the season.   
 Q.  Did you still fancy a chance into the back nine when you got that earlier birdie?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I was thinking about it.  I had a decent chance on 12, and the just missed it.  I had a pretty good chance on 15, but I think that the front nine, I easily gave three or four shots back.  It's a little bit disappointing but it's a good sign when you finish top five and you're disappointed.   
 Q.  Sounds like you can take plenty of positives to Melbourne.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, definitely.  Now it's recovery as much as possible until Thursday, it's going to be hard with the time difference, but yeah, I'm looking forward to that.  Matteo has been playing well, so I'm sure we'll have fun.
