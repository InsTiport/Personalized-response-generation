 Q.  A 67 today to back up yesterday's round, as well.  You must be pleased with the opening two days?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I played very well.  Today was as good of conditions probably as we are ever going to get around here.  It was strange, the course was really firm in the practise rounds, and I guess between yesterday and last night, it changed completely.   
Played well.  Didn't putt great yesterday but I putt well on the back nine today to save a few pars and make a few birdies.   
 Q.  We talked earlier in the week about your second place last year and your excellent record around this golf course.  How much do you take from those rounds into it, because it's a course you know very well.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: More than that, it's just a course that I love.  I love coming back here every year and I just enjoy playing.  It's a challenge, it's a test, but I really enjoy the layout and the crowds are always great.  I think it's probably the best event of the year.   
 Q.  First Rolex Series Event, and you've played yourself into contention for the weekend but at the moment five shots behind Rory McIlroy, so how does the strategy maybe possibly change or not change for the weekend?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Obviously it's not going to be easy for anyone to make up that many shots playing against a guy like Rory.  I just have to play my own game and hopefully keep the putter as warm as it was today.  We'll see.  You never know.  Conditions can change, and if we get wind and the course firms up a bit, it's going to be a completely different test.
