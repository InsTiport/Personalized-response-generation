  Q. You seem to be playing extremely well, tell us about that match.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It was another tough match, but I played very well since the beginning, and you know, I holed a few important putts, especially the end.   
 So, you know, I think it was important to close the match, because I knew Aaron was going to come back the last few holes. Really pleased with the way I played.  
  
  Q. Only behind for one hole in the last few matches, how much of an advantage can that be in that you've not been that stressed?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think it's always nice to have a good start. I was lucky enough to be 2-up or 3-up in every match, and you can play a bit more conservative and just wait for the opponent's mistake. That's perfect.   
 But I know even if I'm going to start down the first few holes, I can still put the pressure on the way I'm playing.   
  
  Q. Your thoughts on playing Westwood or Poulter this afternoon?   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's going to be really tough; because whoever wins from that match will have a lot of confidence. It's not going to be easy for me, but I'll just try to make another bunch of birdies.
