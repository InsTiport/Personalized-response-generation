  Q. What a final, what do you think?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I enjoyed it a lot, and it was nice to play with Robert. He's a really good player and a really nice guy. It's just a pity I didn't play the last holes like the first holes, because the first few holes, I wasn't really playing that great.  
 I mean, it's a very good finish, second, and it's a very nice week.  
  
  Q. Did you see any chance catching up?  
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Probably I had two chances on 16 and 17 and just missed the putt. Maybe if I hole the putt I might have a chance. You never know. It's okay like this.
