Q. You closed it out in nice fashion with a birdie on 16.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was a good game today.  It was tricky with the winds up and down.  I think we both played well.  Lots of birdies.  We both give away a couple of holes.  But I think in these conditions it's to be expected.  Yeah, really happy and obviously big game tomorrow.
Q. Against Justin Thomas.  Do you have initial thoughts on what it will take to beat Justin?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Amazing golf, for sure.  He's one of the best in the world.  I'm happy I put myself in the situation so I have a chance to play against him for the top spot in the group.  And see what I can do tomorrow.
