Q. The sixth hole, talk us through, please?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it was a really good shot straight at it.  Obviously 99.9 per cent of the times, it doesn't go in.  But it went straight in.  Good judgment because we just changed clubs.  I switched from a 6 to a 7.  Great moment to finish the season.
Q. And it was a strange kind of run, par, par, par all the way and suddenly there's a 1 on the card.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, you know, you never know when aces come, so it was a good moment to get things going, even if after that I stumbled a little bit the next few holes.  But then I had a good finish the last four or five holes.  So a good day.
Q. A nice little reward that you've got as a result of the hole-in-one.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, a couple of nights at the Atlantis.  So I'm sure the family will be happy.  We'll try to use it as soon as possible.
Q. And finishing off the championship, a tidy end to the week?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, to the week and to the year.  I think there's a lot of good stuff going into next season, so just need to keep doing what I've been doing the last few weeks and hopefully save those couple of shots in the round that can make the difference in the week.
Q. How do you reflect on the year?  Has it been a good one by your standards and perspective?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's been a good year.  It's been tough for me for the first time to play both tours as a member.  There were a lot of challenges but I think I did well on both sides.  It's nice to top it off with a nice finish.
