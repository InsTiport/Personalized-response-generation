 Q.   68, no bogeys and two birdies on the front, two birdies on the back.   Off to a good start?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, it was a good day.   I played‑‑ I could have played the par 5s probably a little better.   A lot of fairways, a lot of greens.   When I missed the fairways, I hit some really good shots from around the greens, so some nice up‑and‑downs.   
   
 Q.   Jack Nicklaus describes this as a second‑shot golf course, you only missed one fairway out there today.   It's so important to place the golf ball off the tee?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think the fairways are quite generous, but if you miss them you're going to be in trouble.   The greens are really small and quite slopey, so you don't want to miss it on the wrong side.  
   
 Q.   In talking to the players in the practice rounds, they've been saying these are some of the fastest greens and some of the best greens they've played all year, do you agree?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I think they're pure.   It's tricky to make pars, because there's some big breaks, being so fast.   But if you hit a good putt, it's always going in the hole.  
   
 Q.   You've played seven events on the PGA Tour this year, only missing three cuts.   Are you enjoying your time over here in the States now that you're playing here more full‑time?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yes, it's been a decent start.   Obviously it's a challenge for me to‑‑  
   
 Q.   We're going to look at one of the highlights at Phoenix.   Have you ever heard a roar that loud?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Probably at a soccer game in Italy, but not on a golf course.   It was a great moment, fantastic.  
   
 Q.   I think that's as excited as I've ever seen you get on a golf course.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It's hard not to get excited when the people are doing that around you.
