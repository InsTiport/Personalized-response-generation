 Q.   Give us your thoughts.   Good win?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Good win.   Definitely Thomas wasn't a hundred percent.   I thought he played quite solid and I didn't play very well on the front nine and then better, more solid on the back.   I missed a couple of chances and then obviously it was great to win the match.  
   
 Q.   It shows the tough competitor he is.   Even if he's not a hundred percent, it's still difficult to beat?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   It was obviously one of the most in form Europeans, so I knew it was going to be a tough match anyway.   Maybe I got in this morning, you know, on the front nine a bit too relaxed about it.   But then I played well coming back.   It feels strange to be in the second round for the first time in three years.   It's nice.  
   
 Q.   It's good to get through, isn't it?   It would have been another frustrating exit.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, yeah.   So it's good, obviously.   It's very good to win a match when you are 1 down and playing the last.   It's a great feeling.   
   
 Q.   Obviously the way it happened, it was a good way to win the 18th coming out of the bunker.   A great shot at the last there?   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, I mean, it was almost unlucky not to go in, and then Thomas, luckily for me, 3‑putted.   He had a tough putt.   Then I missed the chance at 19 to win the match.   So it was good to pull it off, you know, on the 20th.  
   
 Q.   How far would you think the chip was that won the game?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Probably 50 feet, something like that.   I missed the green right but it was a good second shot.   You don't want to miss it left.   I had the nice uphill way to the hole and then obviously a bit of luck to hole it.  
   
 Q.   Thoughts on tomorrow with‑‑  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   The best thing obviously ‑‑ he had a tough match here today, as well.   It's going to be tough matches all the way.   I'll do my best and see what happens tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Good day for Italy?   Francesco won, as well.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah, yeah.   He's very good at this format, obviously and I think it's an impressive win against Webb.   It's good to pass through.   We still have a long way to meet each other, but it would be nice.  
   
 Q.   You never know.   
FRANCESCO MOLINARI:   Yeah.
