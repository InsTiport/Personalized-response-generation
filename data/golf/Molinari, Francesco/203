  Q. Tough finishing hole, that one.   
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, once you don't hit the fairway with the tee shot, it gets really hard to make par.  
 So I tried to play the smart way, but the wedge shot, it was really hard to get the right yardage from there. It was a decent shot but just a bit unlucky, and then you know, I fought as hard as I could and holed the putt, but Miguel, I think he deserved to win today.
