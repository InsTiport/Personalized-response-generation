FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Obviously another good day, starting pretty much where I left off last year, so it was great.  It's great to see the crowds.  I think there's a nice buzz around the place, and I'm happy and proud to be part of it.   
 Q.  What particularly pleased you about your play today?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think on the greens and around the greens, it was very good.  I hit a couple of loose tee shots, which you don't really want to do around here, so I know what I need to work on for tomorrow.   
 Q.  Amazing run of play, 14 through the second, talk us through that.  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, you know, sometimes things just clicked, and obviously the chip-in on 18 was great.  Everything was going in and it felt easy to play golf.  Unfortunately those moments never last too long.   
 Q.  How appreciative are you of the crowd?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It's great.  Like I said, it's great to have the support; that there were big crowds, considering it was a weekday, early in the morning.  So I think it's going to be probably similar to last year, which was amazing.  So I'm looking forward to the next three days.
