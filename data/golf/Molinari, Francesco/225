 Q. 6-under through 13, after starting the day nine shots behind, what were you thinking then?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I wasn't thinking about winning because I saw Scott was doing well, so I didn't think I had the chance to win but I was, you know, trying to get on the leaderboard and post a good score there tell us how the back nine is playing. You shot 31. 

 Q. Is it really that easy?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I don't know if I -- I played really well. So it's not that easy, and it was a really good day and I could have probably holed a couple more putts in the end like 15, 16 and 18. But 64, it's a great round. 

 Q. You've had three missed cuts recently after a third place in Asia and then a good performance there, what's been going on? Why up-and-down?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I've been sort of working on my game so it's not really easy. I was feeling well after the third place in China, and the last few weeks I played all right, but I was struggling with the score. 
 I just reached to the belly putter and this week has been better.

 Q. U.S. Open qualifying tomorrow with Scott Strange; tell us about that. 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: We are going to enjoy, for sure and try as hard as we can. I think it's a great opportunity for us to have a chance to qualify for that. So I'm looking forward to that.
