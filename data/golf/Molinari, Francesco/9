Q. How nice has it been coming back to Wentworth as defending champion, not just today, but the whole week?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it's been a great feeling because it's the tournament that kind of kick-started my great run last year. You come back here and you feel how different the last few months has been. It's been more than a year, as well, so it's been quite a long time.
But yeah, lots of things have happened and obviously when you come back, you get a chance to reflect even more and just feeling good obviously about what I did last year, but at the same time, trying to get there again.
Q. How do you assess your opening round, six birdies, three bogeys?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Front nine, or for seven holes, I was hitting the ball very well and then started missing a few greens. Maybe more up-and-down than I would like but I managed to fight hard and the short game was good enough to keep me in the round and nice birdie to finish at the last.
Q. Talk us through the shot on 15. How much were you attacking the pin and from you were standing, could you tell how close it went to going in the hole?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Well, yeah, from there, the flag was on the left side of the green. So it's pretty hard to slice it with a 5-iron to hit it right of the flag. So I knew the shape was perfect to get it online with the hole. It looked very close and then I just saw the video now and it was as close as it looked.
Q. How different has the course been playing compared to last year?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Not too different. I think a little longer. The fairways obviously are a little softer and maybe the greens a little firmer. So that combination is a little bit different. But there's not a huge difference. These are similar temperatures to what we were getting in May, anyway, so it's playing very similar.
