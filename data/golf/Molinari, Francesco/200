   FRANCESCO MOLINARI: The 18th I was a bit disappointed but I'm happy with my round and the way I'm playing and I'll show up tomorrow and try to do as good as I can. 

 Q. What do you think about playing with your brother in the final group?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Depends if we are playing in two-balls or three-balls, I didn't really check that, so we will see tomorrow.

 Q. So if you are playing with your brother in a three-ball, how will you feel about that?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: You know, it will be great to be in the last match together. And I'm sure we will have a lot of fun if that's the case.

 Q. That won't put you off or anything, will it? 
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, I don't think so. We are used to playing together.

 Q. Have you any friends or family over watching you, because this is quite a unique kind of thing?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, my wife is here and she was watching today. So I guess she is enjoying the week, and hopefully the weather tomorrow will be better, as well. Let's just hope it's going to be a great round of golf.

 Q. And Edoardo, is he -- your mom and dad or anybody like that here?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: No, I think he's just on his own. His girlfriend is coming next week for The Open, but he's on his own today.

 Q. You seem very relaxed about it. How do you feel about being in this kind of position?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: You know, it feels great. We practise to achieve this and I was lucky enough to be in contention last week, as well, so it's good to be in contention for a second consecutive week.

 Q. And I guess if you don't win, you'll be happy because your brother might win?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, probably if I don't win, my second favourite is him, yeah.
