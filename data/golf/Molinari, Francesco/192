   FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I played all right all week. Yesterday I was very disappointed with the finish. Today I played okay but didn't putt as well as yesterday but it is tough with the wind. All in all it is not a great week but all good experience and I am sure it will be helpful in future tournaments.

 Q. A week off and then Gleneagles where so much can still happen in The Ryder Cup race?
 FRANCESCO MOLINARI: It is still wide open but if Martin wins that will be a good thing for me as it will open a spot more in the European Rankings. We will see. The guys I was up against like JimÃ©nez and Harrington both missed the cut so I was able to get some more ground. We will see what happens, but I am playing well and will go to Gleneagles trying to win the tournament and seal the deal.
