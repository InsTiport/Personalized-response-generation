 Q.  After the victory last week, have you had time to savor it and has it sunk in that you're a Rolex Series winner?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, it has sunk in.  It's been an intense couple of days but it's great.  I reflect on it and I'm really proud of the way I performed over the weekend.  So yeah, it's great to be here now in Italy, coming off of that and hope that I make the most of the high and have another good week this week.   
 Q.  You won this event two years ago and tied six last year.  How important is it for you to do well in your home event?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I love it.  It's one of my favourite events of the year.  So get the support of the crowd and obviously we have a new venue this year, I'm looking forward to the week.  I'll see how well I've recovered from last week's effort but I'll do as good as I can.   
 Q.  I think your last nine rounds in this event have all been under 70, so it's clearly an event where you play some of your best golf?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I enjoy the home support and it's great to see all the crowd getting behind you.  Obviously it's a little bit of pressure but I've been managing that well in the past and I'm looking forward to that again this year.   
 Q.  Having won last week, do you feel there's more pressure on you this week because people will be watching to see how you follow up that victory?  
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: To be honest, I don't think it's going to make a massive difference.  Obviously the expectations would have been high anyway, so I was glad to get the win last week.  Now we just play and start again, and I'll try to be ready for tomorrow.
