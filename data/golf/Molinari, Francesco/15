FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, did what I could out there.  Lots of good up-and-downs.  And, yeah, a shame about the finish, but it was only halfway.  So I need to hit the ball and be better than today if I want to contend at the weekend.
Q. How's the course playing?  We don't see a lot of (indiscernible).  Furyk is like 4-under, and Jordan a few, but not too many low numbers out there today.
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: Yeah, I mean, it's similar to yesterday afternoon, to be honest.  There's not a lot of difference.  I guess it'll probably firm up a little this afternoon.  If this morning was like it was yesterday afternoon, means they're slightly firmer than yesterday.
So, yeah, just a little bit tougher, but still not a lot of wind, so it still is scorable.
Q. Do you expect the course to get significantly tougher over these next two days than these first two?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I think it's going to depend on the wind, really, the course is what it is right now, and, yeah, the wind is going to be the main factor.  Obviously today there were a few flags maybe a bit tighter to the edges.  And it will be trickier.  So that's going to be the defense of the golf course if we don't get any wind.
Q. We don't have a crystal ball.  We don't know what's going to happen this afternoon, but right now you're just a few off the lead.  You like your position going into the weekend?
FRANCESCO MOLINARI: I liked it more before the last two holes.  But, yeah, I mean, it's fine.  I can -- I did what I could, like I said, today.  Could have been easily a few over par, and I just fought with what I had.  So I need to play better the next couple of days.
