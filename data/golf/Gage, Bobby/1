Q. So you had two solid rounds to start out this weekend.
BOBBY GAGE: I did.
Q. What worked for you today?
BOBBY GAGE: I tell you, we stuck to our game plan and for the last two days, I've only had two big hiccups, a triple on the last hole yesterday, and I made a double on a short par 4 today.  But, boy, outside of that, I played good.  I made the putts I was supposed to make.  You've got to make some putts out here because it's tough to get the ball around the holes.
I mean, this afternoon I think was a bear.  I played great.
Q. Was the wind or the heat --
BOBBY GAGE: Both.  The wind makes a big difference out there, but it's hot, and I'm exhausted right now.  I'm worn out, and if you lose focus at all out there, you're in trouble because this golf course will wear you out.  It's fantastic.  It's an amazing venue.  You can't fake it out there.  It's just, I'm so happy to be here.
