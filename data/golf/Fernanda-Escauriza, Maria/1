  Q. How have you been liking the course so far?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   Well, it's kind of tough because the course is super wet, so the driver just bounces and stays there, and then you have like a 5-iron in, so it's kind of hard to leave it on the green.
 Q. You played well, though; what was working?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   Yeah, my second shots, my irons were -- I only missed three greens, and then my putting was okay.  I made three birdies and no bogeys, so I guess that helped a lot.
 Q. It's been a weird year; have you been able to play much golf this summer?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   No, not really.  Golf back home just started opening up everything, so there's no tournaments.  That's why I had to come here and try to find some tournaments and play.
 Q. When did you come back over here?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   The 29th.
 Q. So this is your first tournament of the summer?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   Yeah.  There was only one flight to come back, so I had to come on that one.
 Q. And then lastly, this is a long week; how do you kind of stay prepared for such a long tournament?
 MARIA FERNANDA-ESCAURIZA:   Yeah, first make the cut, of course.  That's the first priority.  And then just -- I like playing match play, so hopefully that helps me a lot.  And yeah, just focus day by day.
