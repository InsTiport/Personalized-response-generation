 Q. How's your arm, Mike?
 MIKE WEIR: It actually feels a lot better today. Jeff did a good job on it last night, and it feels a lot better.

 Q. (Indiscernible)?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't want to use an excuse like that. Just didn't play well. 

 Q. How did the course play? 
 MIKE WEIR: It's tough. Tough golf course. Hit it in the rough, it's tough around the greens, rough around the greens. It's very unpredictable. 
 But if you drive it well and get it in the fairway, you can score, but if you don't, it's going to be a tough golf course. 

 Q. Did you feel after the eagle, you maybe had a chance to get on a roll there?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah. That was a nice bonus to chip that in and then make a couple birdies and kind of get some momentum, and then got a bad break on 12. The wind was gusting pretty hard in, and I hit a shot right over the flag and got a bad lie and made a bogey there and never gained momentum again.

 Q. The ninth hole seems to be sort of everybody's favorite hole at this point. (Indiscernible)?
 MIKE WEIR: You know, it's the shortest par-5. I mean you get the ball in the fairway, the ball will chase down there an extra 40 or 50 yards and you'll have an iron in. So that's why guys are scoring on that hole.

 Q. Mike, if it wasn't the elbow, what specifically didn't you like about your game today?
 MIKE WEIR: It was pretty obvious. I didn't play well. All aspects weren't great. 
 NELSON SILVERIO: All right. Good. Thanks, guys.
