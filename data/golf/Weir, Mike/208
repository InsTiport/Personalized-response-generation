Q.  How many holes did you end up playing today? 
MIKE WEIR:   I played 14 today, so far. 

Q.  And made eight birdies and a bogey.  Just maybe talk about your round.  The course seems a little earlier, maybe because of the weather and you hit some good shots, too. 
MIKE WEIR:   I did.  I played really well.  I was really disappointed  -- I played the par 5's really poorly.  I parred them all.  So if you shoot 65, you don't expect  -- you expect to take advantage of the par  5s, and I need to do a better job of that on the weekend.  But playing well. 

Q.  Just real quick, going through your round, you started on No. 10 with a birdie.  I guess that was yesterday, obviously. 
MIKE WEIR:   I hit a drive and a 9-iron probably to 15 feet. 

Q.  And then you birdied 11?
MIKE WEIR:   11, 9-iron to about six feet. 17, a drive and a 7-iron to ten feet.  18, drive and 7-iron to four feet. 1, drive and a wedge to five feet maybe.  5, I hit a 6-iron. 
6, I drove it in the fairway bunker.  I hit it in the green-side bunker, hit it out about six feet and missed a 6-foot putt. 
7, I hit a drive and a sand wedge to probably 15 feet. 
8, I hit a 4-iron to about 12 feet. 

Q.  That putt on 9, is that a tricky putt? 
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, I just didn't line up right.  Pulled it a little bit. 

Q.  In general, you said you're playing well.  Anything in particular you're doing really well? 
MIKE WEIR:   I'm really controlling the distances with my irons.  That's the key.  I'm hitting a lot of shots close to the hole, and that's a key.  I've just got to play the par  5s better.
