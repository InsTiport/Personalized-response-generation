Q.  Did you feel in control?
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, my game, I felt pretty good about it today.  But Paul made a good run there, birdied 8, 9 and 10 and I had to make a big putt to halve him on 10.  It was a tough match.  Even though it was 3&2 it was tough all the way through.

Q.  Was there a point you took charge and felt in control?
MIKE WEIR:   I think just got off to a really nice start.  I chipped in on the first hole.  Hit it just over the green on 2 and made a birdie there.  Then I hit a long putt on 4.  So I was 3-up early.  I really had some momentum going early and just kind of carried it through.

Q.  When you play match-play  --?
MIKE WEIR:   You have to pay attention to the other guy, but at the same time you've just got to really focus on your game.  There's definitely a little strategy involved.  I just played really well.  I don't think Paul played poorly at all.  I think he played well.  I think all of the holes were won on birdies except for the last hole.  So I think it was a pretty good match. 
He made it from the bunker and then after birdieing 8, 9, holed a bunker shot on 10; so it was a big putt.  You just never know.  That was a big putt.  There were a lot of big putts that he made out there.  To really bear down, I had to  -- he birdied 8, 9, but I had chances to birdie both of them, as well.  I was inside, only about a 4-foot putt to birdie 8, as well and missed that putt.  Had a good chance on 9, didn't make it.  Then he holed out a bunker on 10.  So I just really need to bear down and focus on my putting to not let it keep going in that direction.
