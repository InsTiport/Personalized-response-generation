 Q. Mike, you tee it up every weekend trying to win. Do you feel the extra pressure because it's the Canadian Open? 
 MIKE WEIR: No, not really. There's no expectation the way I've been playing. So if I was playing a little better, possibly. 
 But, you know, I haven't been playing too well, so...

 Q. Does that in a sense almost make it easier because the expectations aren't there yet the fans are still asking?
 MIKE WEIR: Well, the fans are great. That's all I can say. They're very supportive. You know, you just try to give your best. I was battling as hard as I could trying to get the ball up-and-down. Kept telling Don, maybe I'll hole a wedge shot or do something to get some momentum and get it going. But the crowds are wonderful.
