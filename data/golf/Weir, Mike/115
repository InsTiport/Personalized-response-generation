 Q.  You take a lot of positives from this week obviously? 
 MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, I could have easily won.  Get a few breaks and get it going the right way -- it was tough, the wind switched and it was that way for everybody.  And I left myself a number of tough putts today.  It seemed like I was above the hole and playing for par above the hole; and I'd have a 6 or 7-footer, on poa annua greens, late in the day, they are tough to make. 

 Q.  Where did it go wrong for you on the back nine?  What were you not able to take advantage of? 
 MIKE WEIR:  The wind was just tough out there.  It switched on me four or five times, I hit really good shots and wasn't rewarded for anything. 

 Q.  Do you feel like you left some putts out there today? 
 MIKE WEIR:  I did.  I left some putts out there.  The putts were on the wrong side of the hole.  I was above the hole right-to-left and as I said, when they are bumpy poa annua like they were today, tough to make. 

 Q.  Overall, Top-5 finish, happy with that? 
 MIKE WEIR:  No, I'm not.  I'm not happy with the way it turned out at all.  Should have been -- I had a great chance to win. 

 Q.  How do you feel that the course played today for everyone? 
 MIKE WEIR:  It played difficult, especially for the leaders coming in with these greens, when you play poa annua and they get dried out, they are very difficult to putt. 

 Q.  What's your schedule from here on? 
 MIKE WEIR:  British Open next.
