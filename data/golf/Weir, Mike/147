MIKE WEIR:  If I can get a few to go in, I might be able to do it.
Q.  What's been the change here this week?  You've had good play.
MIKE WEIR:  I think just a couple things.  I've just been working hard the last month with my coach on figuring out some things with my ball-striking that hasn't been very solid, and I think just the work I've been doing and getting my club in a little better position at the top is allowing me to hit some better shots and I haven't seen that in a while on a consistent basis.  You know, Thursday wasn't great, but I managed to scrape a round.  Yesterday I struck it much better and today I hit it well, as well, except for a couple of shots, so it's coming around.
Q.  Is there any difficulty in finishing 16, 17, 18 yesterday, not your best?  Is that still in your mind when you come out here today?
MIKE WEIR:  No, not really.  I just wanted to put that behind me.  I tried to look at the positives of yesterday, that I did play well.  I was playing well and it was unfortunate that I finished the way I did, but I didn't feel like it was from really poor play or anything.  I felt like I hit one bad shot on 16, but outside of that, you get a little wind gust or mud on the ball like I told you yesterday, but I just wanted to stay positive with my attitude going out there today and try to creep back into this thing.
Q.  Pretty much the same tomorrow, and having left a couple of shots up there today, you're still right there.
MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, you're not going to make every one, but I made some nice putts.  I could have made a couple more, but that's golf, and I'm still in this thing, so hopefully tomorrow I'll get that flat stick really hot like I maybe had it the first day and give it a shot.

Thank you.
