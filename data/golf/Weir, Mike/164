Q.
Just talk about your match today. 

MIKE WEIR:   I think it just came down to Rich and I both didn't play the greatest today.  I just happened to make a couple more putts coming in, and that was really the difference.


Q.  Where was the turning point?  Was there a putt that he missed?

MIKE WEIR:  Early I got off to a good start.  He missed a couple putts so I was up 2 and then he made a couple birdies so we were even through 9.  Maybe the turning point was 12, where he hit it in the fairway bunker and made a bogey, and then the next hole I made about a 25-footer for birdie to go 3 up and ended with a birdie at the last here.
