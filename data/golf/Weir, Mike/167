TODD BUDNICK:  Great start.  You're six under.  Talk a little bit about the conditions.  

MIKE WEIR:  I played really well today, you know, just played solid all the way around and made a few putts and then had some chances coming in to get a little bit better, but I had my work cut out for me to get it up-and-down out of the bunker on the last hole, so I just couldn't see what I was doing there, so I'll finish in the morning.
