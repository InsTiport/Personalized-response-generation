  Q. But for the first seven holes on Friday you would have been in the mix?   
 MIKE WEIR: Exactly. I still could have been today. That was the highest I could have shot today. I hit the ball really close but didn't convert enough.   
  
  Q.  Friday, 6-over for the first seven - what do you put that down to?   
 MIKE WEIR:  A little glitch. I am trying to draw the ball and I just over-drew a couple but it wasn't good around the greens. I really struggled. For three days I've been hitting 15 or 16 greens but on Friday I just couldn't find the putting surface and that put me under pressure. It was a good recovery. I thought if I got into double digits I would have a chance and after making birdies at the eighth and ninth I had a chance at 10 then birdied 11 and guessed if I could make a couple more I would have a chance to win. I had the birdie chances but just couldn't convert them.
