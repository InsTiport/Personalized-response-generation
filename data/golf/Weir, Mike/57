   MIKE WEIR: It was a long week. I don't know. To put it in perspective, it was tough on everybody, tough to get any flow. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 MIKE WEIR: I played great. I just -- I've never seen so many putts lip out. It was just a crazy week that way. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 MIKE WEIR: It's tough. I mean, like I said, I think the momentum thing was hard, and to get in any flow to the tournament. 
 And you know, it didn't really play like a Canadian Open championship. It was a dart contest out there, and it's too bad because they did have the golf course in really good condition earlier in the week, and Mother Nature didn't cooperate, so it played quite a bit easier than probably the way it should have.

 Q. Are you concerned when you guys come up here maybe that you're going to have bad weather up here?
 MIKE WEIR: Hey, it's luck of the draw. 

 Q. What about going into the 18? Tough greens there. (Indiscernible).
 MIKE WEIR: That I had a chance? 

 Q. Yeah. (Indiscernible).
 MIKE WEIR: Well, even when I made a couple birdies at the turn, I was still 5 or 6 back, so I needed to have something really special happen, and then I lipped it out on 11 and 12 and 16, 17 and 18. So it was just one of those weeks. 

 Q. What about St. George's in the rotation next year, might make a difference?
 MIKE WEIR: Well, it's a new course for everybody. It's tough to get the word out. We know it's a pretty good golf course, and hopefully they do a good job setting it up and making it difficult. And I think guys like playing old-style golf courses, which I think will help a little bit. 

 Q. (Indiscernible).
 MIKE WEIR: Well, you know, it's a little dÃ©jÃ  vu from last year, but I think the staff did an incredible job to get it ready, and I have no idea how the other guys are going to remember it. 
 I don't know, but staff and everybody inside, all the volunteers to stick around here was pretty phenomenal, so it was just tough on everybody, just one of those kind of weeks.

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 MIKE WEIR: Where do I play? I play Firestone and then PGA week after next. 

 Q. (Indiscernible). 
 MIKE WEIR: Well, yeah. It's great. You know, I think for him to get experience playing in professional tournaments is going to be big for him. He still has two years of college left, so you know, it's great. The more experience he can get at this level, so when he does turn professional in a couple of years he has those under his belt. And he's had a phenomenal year, and I think he'll continue to keep improving, and look forward to watching his progress. 

 Q. Monday finish here, a Monday finish at the U.S. Open. Overall weather a determining factor for whether you return this year?
 MIKE WEIR: I'm getting a little old. My memory's not so good. I can't remember the years. 
 But yeah, it's recent in our memories right now, that yeah, it's been a lot of rain this summer, in a lot of big tournaments. 
 I can't recall off the top of my head when there's been something like that, but you know, if you play the game long enough, you see stuff like this.
