 Q. Great comeback out there today. I thought you might get two eagles on those par-5s coming in. But one is still nice. 
 MIKE WEIR: It was a bonus to make that putt. No kidding. But I got off to a terrible start, but I was very patient because I knew I've been playing really good and yesterday I shot 8-under in the pro-am and just felt good about my game. So I didn't want to get frustrated because I was hitting some good shots and just getting a few unfortunate things out here. But that's the thing with this golf course. You are just a little bit off, you can make some bogeys pretty easy.

 Q. It's like this course almost forces you to be patient, doesn't it?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, it does. I said, I felt like the ball was going a little further today. A couple iron shots really shot on 16 really surprised me. I thought, I hit a beautiful iron shot in there and one hopped in the back bunker and it went about 15 yards further than the same club I hit yesterday. And then from back there you have nothing. So you have those things happen. It's going to happen to everybody. And you just got to be patient.

 Q. The way that you played on your back nine has got to make you feel good going into tomorrow?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, I had some nice chances and I felt like I found something last week with my putting and I feel like I'm rolling it a lot better.
