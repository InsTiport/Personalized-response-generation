   ERNIE ELS:  Obviously they were cheering for Mike a lot, but we felt their support.  We were a bunch of Canadians as we said.  I think the crowd has even been very fair to the American Team.  But we definitely have had a lot of support and it was great playing with the local hero.  He played wonderful. 

 Q.  Mike, your thoughts on your game today, six birdies, you played very well today. 
 MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, I played steady.  I had not been driving it the best coming in here, and just found something with my driver.  Driving it very straight, and obviously Ernie being as long as he is, I think the strategy worked well with me hitting first. 
 I played nicely today. 

 Q.  What was the strategy? 
 MIKE WEIR:  Well, I think that was it, for me to tee off and get the ball in the fairway and then Ernie on the par 5s could take more chances.  The strategy worked well, was able to drive it and make a birdie on 13, and you know, just me getting into play before he can let loose. 

 Q.  Any chance to see you together tomorrow? 
 ERNIE ELS:  Yeah, I hope so.  I think we worked well today.  I think, you know, Mike hit really solidly from tee-to-green, he was very solid, and I was kind of the background support.  You know, if we play this way, you know, we'll be tough to beat.  I didn't putt that well but Mike made all the putts.  If we keep this up, we'll be fine.
