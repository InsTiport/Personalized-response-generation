  MIKE WEIR:   Hopefully tomorrow if I play the way I did today and keep the ball in the fairway I have a good chance to do that tomorrow.   That's encouraging, sure.

Q.   There's not a lot of low numbers out there what's the difference on this golf course?
MIKE WEIR:   I think around the greens.   Putting is very difficult.   I find it very difficult.   They're very soft.   They're very slopey greens. 
For being such an old golf course, they built the course ‑‑ the green speeds were not quite what they were now.   You're left with come devilish little putts around the holes.   It's tough putting. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, that was a nice par save there.   My first hole I had ten feet up the hill.   The second hole I had 12 feet.   I made a couple, I did.   But I still‑‑ I had some opportunities that I didn't capitalize on. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I missed a fairway with a 3‑wood on 14.   Laid up on I 7.   That was kind of a blind tee shot.   You can't see where you're going.   I missed that. 

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I hit probably four or five, probably, and then 3‑woods, a few 3‑woods‑‑ no, it would be more than that.   It would be about six drivers and probably a few 3‑woods.

Q.   Where were you when they called it?
MIKE WEIR:   I was about 15 minutes from teeing off.   There was a group in front and I was next.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I think it's the same.   I was fully warmed up.   I had done a full warm up and had done everything and had to go back and start over again, like everybody else.

Q.   How long is it from warm up to‑‑
MIKE WEIR:   I try to give myself 35, 40 minutes.   You have a police escort over here.   By the time you get over here, you can putt over here on the side and hit a few chips.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I think so.   Those guys aren't getting up at 4:00 in the morning for an early tee time.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   Sunday after the Memphis ended.   I had a good feeling.   There would have had to be five guys who ended up top 60 for me not to get in.   It would have been highly unlikely, but you never know. 

Q.   After what you went through the last two years, and then this year, do you think things are turning around?
MIKE WEIR:   The last little bit, yeah, it definitely does.   My ball‑striking is getting much better.   I have strength in my arm again.   I am feeling good.   I'm feeling much better.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I had a torn extensor tendon in my elbow.   It happened in 2010.   I tried to play through it for a while and finally had surgery in 2011, the fall of 2011.

Q.   You said you feel good about this tournament.   Is there anything on (inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   I think there was times that, yeah, you wonder, when you're injured and you get a little older, you kind of wonder that.   But at the same time you wonder ‑‑ but I was very determined to get back.   I still love the game.   I still love the practice.   I enjoy the competition. 
So, yeah, I was very motivated to get back.   I feel like I still have quite a bit of good golf left in myself.   If I didn't, I wouldn't have worked as hard to get back in the top 10.   I still feel motivated.   I still feel I can do some good things around here.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, it's nice.   If there's a big delay here, we could tee off at 5:00, 6:00 now.
