 Q. 9-under overall. Talk about your round. 
 MIKE WEIR: I played nicely today. I got off to a good start on the back nine birdieing 11, and then I made a nice stretch, birdieing 16, 17 and 18. I played well. I just made one mistake today, was caught between shots, kind of had a little thin lie. I would have loved to have flopped that but I didn't have a very good lie. I just chipped it too hard and caught a little spike mark in my second putt. All in all, it was a good day.

 Q. It seems like you have a high level of comfort at this TPC Boston golf course. 
 MIKE WEIR: I think that's probably what it is. I've just had good success around here, and I see the shots well. I think anytime you play well on a golf course it just sets you at ease a little bit, and starting the day I just felt comfortable. 

 Q. Talk about your round a little bit. You had seven birdies and a bogey. 
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, it was a nice round. It was one of those rounds that was just pretty comfortable all day. My only mistake was on 7 there, just kind of had a really thin lie and just tried to bump-and-run one and hit it too hard and three-putted. But outside of that, I played really well and had a lot of chances and made some. It was a good day out there.
