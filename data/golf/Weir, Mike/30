 Q.   Can you put the two days into perspective?   
MIKE WEIR:   I don't know.   I just got off the course five minutes ago.   I need a little time to think about it, and see what I can draw on it and see what we can get ready for next week.  
   
 Q.   Today's round, talk about that?   
MIKE WEIR:   Well, I guess I had a couple good chances on four, five and six on the back nine, and the front nine, which was my back nine.   If I could have gotten those going, I thought I was looking okay.   But I just couldn't buy a putt there, and those last holes were a little tough.  
   
 Q.   How does the course play today compared to yesterday?   Different winds?   
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, little different.   Even after all the rain, the course has held up pretty nicely.   It's in really good condition.  
   
 Q.   Are there positives you can take away from the week?   
MIKE WEIR:   Like I said, I'll think about that in a few minutes once I get time to settle in and reassess it and go over my notes and kind of what I was trying to get out of it.  
   
 Q.   Still playing next week?   
MIKE WEIR:   Oh, yeah, absolutely.  
   
 Q.   Another 10,000 balls coming?   
MIKE WEIR:   I don't know if I'll get that many in next week.   But there will be a lot.
