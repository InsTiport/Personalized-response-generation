Q. Just talk about your round.
MIKE WEIR:  It was an unbelievably tough match.  You know, Bernhard is as gutty as anybody.

He made a 15 footer for par to keep the match going on 17, then he made another 12 footer, then he made an unbelievable up and down on the first playoff hole.

I knew he wasn't going to make a mistake.  I was going to have to make a birdie to do it, so I hit a shot in there close to take advantage of that opportunity.
