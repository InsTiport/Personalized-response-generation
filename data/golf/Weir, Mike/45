 Q. Mike, an incredible start to your match. Five birdies in a row, what sparked that run?
 MIKE WEIR: I think the change of the putter. I hadn't been putting very well to start this season. I got a heel shafted putter to get a little more swing in the putter, and it seemed to be going in. I felt bad for Alvaro to come all this way. I just got hot today. 

 Q. Nine birdies in ten holes, what's going through your mind at that point?
 MIKE WEIR: I was starting to laugh. That one on nine. The one on 8, too, they were both six foot of break, and 30 feet, and they were just going right in the middle. That doesn't happen very often in this game. So I guess when it happens you enjoy it and hopefully that's going to be some good stuff for me the rest of the year, the rest of the week and the rest of the year. I really struggled with my putting so far this week.

 Q. You're not one of the longest guys. You were able to put some close and put the pressure on?
 MIKE WEIR: It did help. The wind direction helped me today. He couldn't use his power to his advantage. For myself, hitting the 3-wood off the first hole, I got 330 yards with the downwind, where yesterday it was the other way. So it just seemed I got on a nice roll, 20-footer on the first hole to get things started and just put the pedal down.

 Q. Thoughts on playing Paul Casey tomorrow?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, we had a close match that came down to the 18th hole here maybe two or three years ago. Obviously he's a great player and a good match player. He's got a good match play record. I'll have my hands full.
