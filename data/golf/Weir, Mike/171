ROBERT ALLENBY:  We were looking at 4-down down before the end of the day and we sort of managed to creep ahead at the end of the day.  Match-play is a funny event, so different from straight play.  Anything can happen at any given time.  We've all definitely got the momentum going and hopefully we can keep it going for this afternoon. 


Q.  Describe what it's like to have a player as steady as Mike Weir as a partner in an event like this.

ROBERT ALLENBY:   It's awesome.  I could not vouch for a better player, rock solid, and it's always nice to have. 


Q.  Tell us about the putting, Mike.  You just holed putt after clutch putt all day long today.

MIKE WEIR:  My putter was good.  Robert called me in, I was all over the place the first few holes.  He got us off to a nice, steady start and I started to play better and roll a few putts in.  The putts I made, he was in there nice and close, which let me free wheel it a little bit.
