Q.  Make a comment on the conditions and the magnitude of it all.  Is it as good as you could possibly do out there?
MIKE WEIR:  I played as well as I could really play.  I mean, it gusted a couple times for my only real bogeys.  But everybody is going to have some of those problems out there with the wind gusts.

I played really well.  I hit the ball really solid, hit the ball close, right at the flag a lot, which was good to see.  The first couple days I was maybe a little bit indifferent with my golf game and today played a little bit better.
Q.  On the weekend at a tournament like this you don't want to start so far back, but is there an advantage for you to go out there and free wheel it a little bit when you're playing earlier on moving day?
MIKE WEIR:  I guess at the beginning being 6 behind, anything in the 60s would get me close, especially on a tough day like this.  We'll see what happens with the leaders as they come in, but it's not getting easier out there.

I knew if I could play a solid round today I'd give myself a chance for tomorrow.
Q.  Is there any advantage to teeing off at 12:00 to 12:30 as opposed to 1:00 or 1:30?
MIKE WEIR:  There's probably a little bit less pressure for sure.  Still, the conditions are probably about the same but there's a little less pressure.
Q.  Are you pleased with your game overall?
MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, I'm very pleased with it.  The last few rounds at Bay Hill, I feel like I was right on the verge and didn't get my shot at them.  The first couple days here I played okay but still felt like I left some shots out there, and then today I played very well in these conditions.
