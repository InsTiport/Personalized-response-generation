   MIKE WEIR: Kind of like the U.S. Open. Hard to get any rhythm out there.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah. It was tricky. You know, it was not what we wanted for this event. It's kind of playing soft and dark, it's too bad because the course is really good, it's in really good condition, but super soft.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah. Maybe a little bit. I had a tough time finding my rhythm today for some reason, but maybe all the waiting around and getting warmed up and then getting pushed back another hour, we're creatures of habit a lot of the time, so maybe that was part of it. But yeah.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: 4:30.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: Eat a couple times. Just hung out.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: Just the lie wasn't very good, and my wedge has been good, so I just wanted to rely on that.   
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: It was very soft. You know, the greens are tough play today. You have that much moisture and you get footprints on there, they are very bouncy and lots of pull in the greens.   
 And late in the day they kind of butt up and they don't roll the greatest late in the day with that much water, so I thought the greens were pretty tough.  
  
  Q. (Indiscernible).   
 MIKE WEIR: Oh, not really. I think last year, if I remember right, I was on the good side of the draw. I think this year, you know, who knows what tomorrow brings, but it'll be nice to play a bunch of holes in a row tomorrow.   
 I'll probably not tee off till 6:30 tomorrow night. So if it's a good day tomorrow, those guys will have a nice advantage.
