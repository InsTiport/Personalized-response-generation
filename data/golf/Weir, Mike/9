Q.   Can you sum up the week? 
MIKE WEIR:   You know, I'll sum up today.   I played really well today.   I just had a horrible day on the greens.   It could have been a really good round today.   I really had lots of chances and just couldn't convert, so I guess if I sum up the week, that was a little bit of the same, too.

Q.   Just kind of almost but not quite there?
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, a little bit like that.

Q.   24th time in this championship.   Has it changed over the years for you?
MIKE WEIR:   I think every year it changes a little bit.   The excitement of the first time is different than the 24th time, but it's still fun to play.   I always enjoy playing this event.
