   MIKE WEIR: We have a couple holes left. It got a little uneventful, really. I played well, and they just didn't go in. Didn't make many putts. I think the softness of the greens and a little later in the day they were a little -- our whole group was having trouble.

 Q. Talk about the conditions compared to yesterday's conditions. 
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, I think it played a little harder. You know, the wind was up pretty good. Yesterday it was wet, but there wasn't any breeze at all, so like I said, yesterday it played pretty easy.

 Q. Everybody has to play in these conditions. The quirkiness of the weather and the tee times, has that messed your rhythm up at all?
 MIKE WEIR: I don't know. I mean, I'd like to think not.

 Q. Your driver looked a little off on a couple holes. 
 MIKE WEIR: Two drives. I mean, that's golf. I hit one bad drive on 9 and one on 16. That's the only two in two days. That's golf. 

 Q. Chez is at 13-under. Is there a way to come back, six back?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, there's a lot of golf left. He's never won before, but he's obviously playing great golf. But there's tons of golf left. There's a lot of the tournament left. 

 Q. Disappointed in your putter?
 MIKE WEIR: No, just didn't go in.
