Q.  You were 1 down after one but after that it was pretty good.
MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, I played well.  I made a lot of birdies.  You've got to do that against a guy like Adam because he's such a good player, and obviously coming off the win last week, so he's obviously in good form.  We kind of each gave each other a few shots here and there, but I think I hit a few shots closer than he did.
Q.  It's about momentum, isn't it, you can get on a bit of run of form and it can help you, can't it?
MIKE WEIR:  Exactly.
Q.  Your thoughts on tomorrow, Paul Casey, that's a tough game.
MIKE WEIR:  Obviously he played well today, beating Retief.  But every match is tough.
Q.  Do you enjoy the match play format?
MIKE WEIR:  I love it.  It's fun.  It's different.
Q.  A different form of golf, isn't it?
MIKE WEIR:  It is different.  We don't get to play it that often, so it's a nice change.
Q.  Everybody obviously talking this week about Ryder Cup next week, you're obviously not involved in that, do you have a view, do you have a sneak of who is going to win at The K Club, you probably know the guys from both sides well.
MIKE WEIR:  Exactly.  I heard Ernie talk at the dinner last night about kind of home course advantage, which could be a big factor.  It seems like the U.S. guys are really coming together.  They seem to be playing some practise rounds together.  You know, those young guys, they are solid players.

I have no idea who is going to win but it should be a close match.
