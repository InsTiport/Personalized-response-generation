 Q.  You just got off to such a tough start on the front nine but really brought it home like a champion on the back nine. 
 MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, obviously hit a bad tee shot on 1.  Outside of that, I thought I played pretty well, just got nothing out of it.  I thought the three-putt on 5 hurt, three-putted 5 and then hit a really good drive on 6 and it rolled all the way across into a bad lie where I had 60 yards and didn't have a shot.  Yeah, I battled back but it was a tough start. 

 Q.  I walked a few holes with you today and I thought if you could birdie 9 it might jump start the back, and you hit a brilliant chip in there to within three feet. 
 MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, I birdied there and I birdied 10 and hit a really good shot on 11, burned the edge, and left it right in the jaws on 12 short.  So it was just -- I made a putt on 18.  That was really the only putt I made all day.  I just really didn't make anything. 

 Q.  Being 2-over par at one point, and if you would have holed out for double eagle you would have gotten into the playoff, but 209 is big enough to negotiate. 
 MIKE WEIR:  Well, it is.  I hit a great shot into 17.  I had a 12-footer up the hill.  I thought if I could make that and eagle the last I'd have a chance.  Again, I just didn't make anything today. 

 Q.  I hope you don't beat yourself up, 3-under in the final round, 16 under, a top-four finish in the Mercedes-Benz Championship.  That's a pretty good start to the year. 
 MIKE WEIR:  I'm not going to beat myself up.  I played well, just a bad start.  If I could have made some putts, I could have easily still shot 5-, 6-, 7-under maybe and been right there.
