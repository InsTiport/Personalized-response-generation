  Q. Seven birdies, you obviously got something going.   
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, I hit the ball closer to the hole and got some in the fairway today. I didn't hit many balls in the fairway yesterday, and couldn't get it close to the hole, especially in the afternoon when the greens were firm.   
 Today I just hit more fairways so I was able to tackle them more with irons and the greens were a little softer than yesterday.  
  
  Q. Do you like this sort of venue where you're required to shape the ball more?   
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, I think it's better for guys like me, and it makes things interesting. You can have more guys in the mix.   
 It's still a long course, but you just can't stand up there and whale away. The ball has to be shaping right, as you said to, get it in the fairway.  
  
  Q. This is the first time I've seen you with a beard. Is this a Playoffs psychology?  
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, it's definitely psychology. I was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and I thought, hey, it's Playoffs time, maybe I'll just keep it. It's a hockey thing. In hockey, guys grow the beards, so thought I would give it a shot and see if it works.
