Q.  Talk about putting yourself in position for trying to get a win on Sunday.
MIKE WEIR:  I played well today.  I made some nice putts but I burned a lot of edges, especially on the front nine.  I had a lot of close putts for birdie, especially on the back side, I had quite a few.  Disappointed I hit a poor wedge on the last hole.  Overall, I'm right there, depending what Tiger does, two or three back, and you have to shoot something low to catch him.
Q.  How important is tomorrow to get a pretty decent start with knowing that the back side is where everybody is going to be?
MIKE WEIR:  It would be nice to birdie 1.  For the long guys, they can reach that hole.  Early in the week I could, but I can't reach that hole right now.  Obviously I can hit a wedge in there and hopefully make a birdie.

You do want to get off to a solid start.  I did get solid start today.  I was 3 under making the turn and I was licking my chops on the back nine; that was kind of the scoring side, the back side.  A little disappointed not to get a few more.
