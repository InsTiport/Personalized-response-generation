  MIKE WEIR:   It was kind of adventurous and not very profitable at all.   Again, didn't make anything again and struggled a little bit at times.   Just never seemed to get in the flow of the round.   My left foot gave way on the 6th hole, and it was just an unfortunate thing, and then I lipped a chip out there, lipped a bunker shot out the next hole, left a putt hanging over the hole on 10.   It was just kind of one of those days that I just never got anything going at all.  
   
 Q.   Seemed like the speed of the greens‑‑  
MIKE WEIR:   They were a little slower I think with the moisture, and the golf course for me played a little longer because the ball wasn't chasing out.   So it was a little different course today.   But you've got to be able to adjust.   You've got to be able to adjust your speeds, and I didn't do a good job of it.   I seemed to be leaving everything short.  
   
 Q.   So other than just not getting into the flow today you were hitting the ball well?  
MIKE WEIR:   Well, I wasn't as sharp as the first two days for sure, but hopefully tomorrow I'll go get it sorted out and have a good one tomorrow.   
   
 Q.   Does that add to the frustration for you because you've seen some of the scores out there?  
MIKE WEIR:   Well, a lot of the really good scores, there's some guys doing it, playing pretty well right now because it's getting a little better conditions right now, and obviously early this morning they were perfect, and it was kind of clearer air and ball was traveling, and then we played when it kind of got heavy and a little different conditions.  
   
 Q.   Can you just comment about Hunter leaving?   
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, I mean, I guess it's his first child, so he wanted to be there.   I didn't even know his wife was pregnant.   All the best to him for sure.
