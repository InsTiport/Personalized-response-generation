  MIKE WEIR:   They just didn't fall in.   I don't know why.   A lot of really good putts out there.  
   
 Q.   Yeah, on No.1, your No.10.   You were so close.   
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, that was okay, but coming in I had a couple of really nice ones.   All in all, could have been even better.  
   
 Q.   I know the crowds were with you all the time even though they were watching the board and saying, oh, he's even par.   Do you feel that when you're playing?  
MIKE WEIR:   Oh, yeah, I had great crowd support out there and I was hoping to just make a few birdies and get some momentum going and get some roars going, but it just didn't happen today.   
   
 Q.   Put that round into words for us.   
MIKE WEIR:   Well, they call it a game of inches, right?   There was a lot of putts that‑‑ a lot of things that if it just fell the other way it could have been a good score, but it didn't happen today.  
   
 Q.   One of those days where you're just on the wrong side of the inches as they like to say?  
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, exactly, it just seemed like that.   Just a lot of really good putts with nice speed and on the correct side of the hole that looked like they were going to go in, and for whatever reason they just didn't.   
   
 Q.   I guess you're bubble boy for the next couple of hours?  
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, that just seems to be the story of the year.   Almost 80 percent of the tournaments probably I've played I've been on the bubble this year.   It's just kind of been one of those years that I feel like I'm playing okay but not great.   Today could have been‑‑ especially the back nine could have been a lot better.
