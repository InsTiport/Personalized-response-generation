 Q.  You've had rounds of 69, 64, a 5-under 65 today.  On Wednesday you told us it was a learning process out here.  How do you think you're doing? 
 MIKE WEIR:  Well, you know, pretty good.  I'm happy with the way I'm figuring out the golf course, and for the most part I've put it on the smart side of the hole this week.  That's what you have to do around here. 
 The greens are very difficult, so you have to put it on the right spots on the greens. 

 Q.  How would you describe your round today? 
 MIKE WEIR:  It wasn't quite as clean as yesterday.  I hit a couple shots I wasn't too happy with, but made some nice of saves and I made some nice putts.  So that part of my game, which has been lacking a little bit, was there for me today. 

 Q.  Solid threesome.  It seemed like you guys were almost drafting off each other out there. 
 MIKE WEIR:  I think any time three guys like that are playing well and making birdies, it just makes the day go along nicely, and I think we were probably feeding off each other a little bit.
