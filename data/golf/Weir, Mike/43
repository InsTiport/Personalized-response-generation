   MIKE WEIR: It was a bear. That wind was really difficult. There was a few times out there it looked like it was going to bluster up there and start to pick up and then that front came through and it laid back down can changed a little bit. I'm happy with that round.

 Q. Certainly getting off to a good start at any golf tournament or round is important, but how important is it here when you've birdied the first three holes?
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah, it's important. Yesterday I played the par 5s 1-over par and that's what killed my round yesterday. Other than that, played great. 
 And today to get some of the par 5s, eagled 1 today and birdied 10 and birdied 12, so played much better today, so that was key.

 Q. You're putting with a different-style putter, is that something you've implemented this year and why? 
 MIKE WEIR: I put it in at the Match Play. I wanted to get a little more swing in my putter, a little more release. So I went with the heal shafted, kind of just with the idea that I practice with it, and then go back to my old one. I felt so good with it, so went with it at the Match Play. So this is the third tournament with it, and it feels good.
