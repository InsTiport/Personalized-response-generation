  Q. Talk about your day.   
 MIKE WEIR: I played great. Drove it great, hit a lot of close iron shots. I gave myself lots of chances. I had almost chipped in for eagle on 2. And I had it close on 3, 4, missed those two, missed an opportunity on 8 from right beside the green and then hit it about three feet on 9. So I was 2-under on the front and really had a tap in and a 3-footer.   
 And just played solid on the back side. Hit it really close on 14 for a birdie to about three feet there. Missed a short one on 13 from about 8 feet and then hit it close on 14 and then close on 18. So my birdies were really all within five feet. And so I just played great.   
  
  Q. Are you happy with your position going into the third round?  
 MIKE WEIR: Yeah. I'm right there and two more days and I'm moving in the right direction so it's good.  
  
  Q. Was the conditions at all a factor, like are the greens firming up?  
 MIKE WEIR: The greens are still very receptive, but the wind was a little tougher. It died down a little bit now, but it was definitely a factor out there. And I was fortunate enough to pick the right club most of the time out there. But it was tough picking clubs through the middle of the course. .
