  MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, just made one putt today on 15 from 15 to 18feet or something like and that's all I made.   Again not getting momentum going. 
And I felt like early in the round if I could have made a couple of putts and got off to a start, got some momentum going, but it's kind of one of those weeks that I seemed to be picking the wrong club at the wrong time or the gust to hit at the wrong time, hit a beautiful shot to 17.   And just things like that.   But that's golf sometimes.   And that's just what's happening.

Q.   Do you feel it's anything getting close?
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, you know, I think easily if things are going your way, my way there, it could have been 66 or something.   But just not happening. 
Kind of just the same as the first couple of rounds.   Just no momentum.   Only two birdies.   So not much going on there.

Q.   (Question off microphone)?
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, great crowd support.   Fans are great.   I wish I could make a few more putts to give something to cheer about or chip something.   Had a couple of bunker shots lip right out and close.   Just seemed to be just nothing to get things kickstarted.

Q.   (Question off microphone)?
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, yeah, I feel good.   I mean, I feel like 71 was‑‑ kind of gutted it out a little bit.   But still like to make some birdies and get the momentum going on the positive side instead of scraping around for 70, 71.
