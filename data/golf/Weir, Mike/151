MIKE WEIR:  I made a nice save on 8, kept things going.  I had a good shot at 9.  I just had a perfect number.  I had 197 yards a little bit into the wind.  I thought I'd go for a good solid 5-iron.  I haven't been hitting my mid-irons that well all year.

MIKE WEIR:  When I played here four years ago I wasn't playing well at all.  I couldn't hit the ball up in the air like I can now and I was hitting a flat trajectory -- (inaudible).
