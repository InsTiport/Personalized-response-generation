THE MODERATOR:  Momentum was an elusive quality for you today.
MIKE WEIR:  Yeah.  It was a little bit.  You know, I could have, you know, in the first four or five holes I could have gotten off to a good start.  I had some opportunities but it seemed to be on the wrong side of hole even though I was in there inside of 15 feet.

I was on the wrong side of the hole and putting a little by bit defensively from above the hole.  Couldn't get any of those to drop.  And then caught a mud ball on number 18 and made a bogey.  Made a few good saves on 1 and 2 and thought I had some momentum going, and just didn't happen.
Q.  Guys that went out early, especially Jim, are posting the low scores, you know, with the soft conditions they were able to take advantage of that.
MIKE WEIR:  Uh huh.
Q.  Were the conditions firming up by the time you teed off?
MIKE WEIR:  Not so much they were firming up, but the greens get a little difficult.  They get    obviously throughout a day of traffic they get tougher to make putts and they get a little bouncier because they're soft.  We'll have some good greens in the morning, hopefully morning go out and roll a few in.
Q.  A 63 today.  What do you think would have been a good score today?
MIKE WEIR:  Yeah.  If I shot 4 or 5 under I felt like I could have done that.  Like I said, got a few putts early and got something going, but it just wasn't the day.
Q.  You've got to feel, based on the (indiscernible) numbers, that the advantage is (indiscernible)?
MIKE WEIR:  No, not at all.  Go out tomorrow and play good and chip away at it.  Get right back in it.
Q.  Do you think it might be to your advantage if to course dries out a bit?
MIKE WEIR:  You know, I think all the players would have liked to see it play firmer and faster.  But we had that rain and it was wet to begin with before that rain.  I don't think we're going to get anywhere close to firm conditions out here.  Might get a little bit firmer by the weekend.
Q.  Looked like there were a couple of Canadian amateurs out there.
MIKE WEIR:  Oh, good.
Q.  So far, one was minus two and one is on the course right now.  Is that something for you to be proud of looking at these young guys coming out?
MIKE WEIR:  That's great.  We want more guys playing well, no question.  And if it's the younger guys today    you know, hopefully it will be some of the veterans tomorrow    but it's good to see some of the younger guys playing well.
