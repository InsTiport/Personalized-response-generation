  Q.  Mike, that's a lot of pressure today.   
 MIKE WEIR:  Yeah, they put a lot of pressure on us, too.  It was a great match.  That was probably, in the four Cups I've played in, probably the toughest match; back and forth, they got ahead and then we stormed back and then they stormed back and it was just seesaw.   
 So it was a number of quality shots out there, a number of quality putts holed, especially coming down on last three holes, Woody made two great ones and Phil made a great one on 17.   
 We had them right there and that's why he's No. 2 in the world; he makes those putts.   
  
  Q.  How about Captain Nicklaus's call to concede Vijay's putt on the last hole?   
 MIKE WEIR:  Well, as I was telling some of the guys, it doesn't surprise me with Jack or Gary.  They do the right thing and they have for their whole career and, you know, I'd like to think that if it was role reversal there, we would have done the same thing.
