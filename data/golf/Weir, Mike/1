Q. 2-under par today, talk about your round and a week as a whole here at the Sony.
MIKE WEIR:   I really enjoyed my week this week.  Did lots of really good things.  My putting was a little bit of a weak link this week but I played nicely and kind of sharpened that up for next week, short game a little bit.
Q. And speaking of that, now talk about the mindset of going from the Sony over there?
MIKE WEIR:   It's different.  Only three rounds, and the guys shoot low numbers, so you've got to have the scoring mentality to get off to a fast start.  You know, I know the course.  I've been coming over to Kona for probably the last dozen years and just playing with a couple of friends over there.  So I know the course pretty well.  So you're going to have to shoot some low ones.
Q. How excited are you to get the Champions Tour started at Hualalai?
MIKE WEIR:   Very excited to get started.  It's a thin schedule early in the year, so it's nice to get one early and kind of pace yourself for the when the late spring is and summer comes around when a lot of the big tournaments happen.  Hualalai is a great event and I've heard nothing but great things.  Excited to be part of the feeling.
Q. And carrying over a little momentum from a solid week.
MIKE WEIR:   Yeah, nice, solid week.  My game is heading the right direction, very pleased with where my game is at.  Like I said, just sharpen up the short game and it will be even a little better.
Q. Anybody in particular on the PGA TOUR champions that you're looking forward to getting see more of now in competition and competitive level?
MIKE WEIR:   There's so many guys.  I've played with Bernhard a number of times.  Haven't played with Fred Couples yet since our days on the PGA TOUR.  So looking forward 20 getting paired with Freddie one of these times.
