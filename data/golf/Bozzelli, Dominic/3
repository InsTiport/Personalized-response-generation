Q. You must be pleased, got off to a rocky start but you saved all those pars on the front nine and then turned, made a birdie.  So two birdies and one bogey, pretty steady day?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Yeah, not too bad.  Anything under par out here is a good score.  It's getting tough.  The greens are only getting firmer.  Some of the pins, I feel like they were accessible today but you've got to be in the fairway.  I did a nice job of getting up-and-down.
Q. You're 110 in the FedExCup rankings, do you think about that or do you just focus on your game plan tomorrow?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: No, I'm definitely not thinking about FedExCup points.  I just try to work hard and put the time in and do the right things and prepare the right way at the start of the week.  I feel if I do that each week, the rest will take care of itself.
You can't play defense out there.  Did a nice job today of staying in the moment.  Me and my caddie, just kind of doing our thing out there and that's what we're going to do again tomorrow.
