Q. You have gotten off to a wonderful start on the PGA TOUR.  You are seventh on the Money List last year, the Web.com Tour with one win.  What do you think that that experience, especially last year, and then again at the Career Builder, has done for you?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: It was good.  You know, each week I just try to learn something from it, and this is my tenth start I think on the PGA TOUR, and I've already been fortunate enough to experience the final group and the second to last group.
All those are big positives, and just moving forward, I'll be able to draw from those experiences and hopefully get in the winner's circle here sometime.
Q. You certainly scooted up on the FedExCup points ranking very well, and I was really impressed with your poise and your patience today.  Talk a little about those characteristics that you can take forward in your career.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Yeah, definitely got to stay patient out there.  You know, it's something I kind of learned over the last few years, but especially on this course, where my game plan going into today was I was going to try to hit the par 5s.  A good shot is 25 to 40 feet a lot of times out here, and you just kind of need to take advantage of the opportunities you do have when you're in the fairway.
Front nine, I was kind of scraping it around.  I didn't have my best stuff.  You get going, your body feels a little bit different in the final round sometimes, you kind of just have to kind a way to get it done.  I was really pleased with how I pieced it together.  I think I turned at 2-under of the just keep building and move on to the next week now.
