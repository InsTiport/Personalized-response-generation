Q. You made a ton of great putts this week, but I think that birdie at the last to get solo fifth is going to be pretty sweet.
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Yeah, it definitely makes me feel a little bit better at the end of the day.  All in all, a lot of positives this week.  A lot to be proud of and build on after today.  It was just nice being a part of that final group and feeling those feelings out there and it's all good stuff.
Q. What did you learn from today and what did you learn from this week?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Just to stay patient and it shows how important short game is.  Scrambled a lot this past week and some huge par saves that kept the round going.
