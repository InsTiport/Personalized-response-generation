Q. Birdies on the last two holes, pretty solid finish?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: It's always a nice way to finish.  Was scrambling on the back side, and just made some nice par saves, got the ball up-and-down and got a head of it.
Q. How different is this golf course when the wind picks up and how do you adjust?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: It was definitely, it kind of switched a little bit out there.  The rough's kind of tricky around the greens.  But it's all about getting the ball in the fairway and just keeping it in position.  Because if you're out of position, it's easy to make bogeys.
Q. Felt like a little SEC reunion, brought back some of the college vibes?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Yeah, honestly, I missed -- he's a good kid, lot of talent.
Q. What do you take from the first two days?  What have you found this week?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: I've been working a lot on my short game.  Just keeping the round going and get the ball up-and-down.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, we spent a lot of time just judging lies in the rough and having an understanding of how the ball is going to come out and that was huge for me.  Made that bunker shot when I was all over the place and stuff like that, just gets the momentum going the other way.  That's big for me.
