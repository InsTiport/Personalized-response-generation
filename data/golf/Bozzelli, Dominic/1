Q. 2-under 68 today, in the-bad score, given the wind.  If you can touch on the wind ask your 68?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Yeah, not at all.  Not a bad day.  It did get tough out there.  I drove the ball pretty well today and definitely leaned on my short game.  Chipped and putted pretty well.  Any kind of mis-hit out there gets exposed pretty bad by the wind.
There are a few I thought I hit pretty good and missed it just a touch.  Just ballooned up in the air and came up short.  Tough to hit a lot of greens.  Feel like I was working pretty hard, but all in all, I'll take 2-under all day.
Q. How about the greens, given the wind.  We've heard mixed reviews.  Most people tend to think that they are hard, firm and fast.  Did that work to your favor?
DOMINIC BOZZELLI: Into the wind, they were stopping kind of quick, but if you miss the green, you'd like to be chipping back into the wind just to help you stop it a little bit.
Out of the rough, it hits and kind of putts front-wheel drive on.  You know, it is beneficial to stay in the wind but I imagine if the forecast stays the same and it's windy each day, it's only going to get firmer as the week goes on.
