Q. It was a close match all day.  Walk me through your feelings.
RYAN SMITH: Yeah.  Didn't start out great.  The middle I kind of found -- kind of after hole 6 I kind of found my form and kind of started hitting the ball a little bit better ball striking-wise.
Putts started to go in kind of halfway through and momentum kind of switched a little bit.  He played a great match today.  It was back and forth the whole day.  None of us had bigger than a 1-up lead the entire day.
It was a great match.  It was nice to hole the putt on the last so I didn't have to figure out the first hole once again.
Yeah, so it was great.
Q. You were a quarterfinalist last year.  How does that help prepare you for going into what's to come?
RYAN SMITH: You know, last year I hit my driver off the planet, so that gives me a little confidence, that even if one part of my game is a little bit off that I can at least scramble it around the golf course and play one-on-one and don't have to worry about everybody else.
Yeah, gives me a little confidence going in.  See tomorrow how I feel, yeah.
Q. Is there anything you want to change about your game going into tomorrow?
RYAN SMITH: Yeah, maybe the first couple holes, getting off to a little bit of a better start.  I mean, I played well today.  We'll see tomorrow how I feel.  Kind of go from there.
Q. What are your feelings about the course so far?
RYAN SMITH: Course is in great shape, as is the lower two.  Both in great shape for stroke play and match play today.  Couple tougher pins.  The course is a little bit tougher today than it was yesterday.
So, yeah, I think it'll probably get tougher as the week progresses.  There is no rain in the forecast, so I think it'll get drier and firmer as the week goes on.  Looking forward to it, yeah.
