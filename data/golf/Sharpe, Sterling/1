Q. Sterling, can you tell me what you shot today.
STERLING SHARPE: No, I have really no idea.  I made double on the last.  I do remember that one.  But other than that, I played well all week.  I was happy with how I played.  I stayed on the leaderboard all week.  I'm happy.
I don't know where I'm going to finish.  I don't know what the guys behind me are going to do.  I know Smoltz had already caught me, but it was a good week for me.
Q. You talked earlier in the week about being a big fan of the LPGA players.  How fun has it been being out here this week?
STERLING SHARPE: Great.  They have been wonderful to us.  You come in, and you go, well, the language barrier may be a little difficult, and it wasn't.  They were great, from Shanshan Feng to Sei Young Kim to Annie Park.  They were all wonderful to us.  I had a great time.  If we do it again next year, I hope I'm back.
Q. Conditions were a little tougher today.  Can you explain how you managed it so well?
STERLING SHARPE: It wasn't that bad.  We've all played golf in the wind.  These are our clubs.  We know our clubs and how far they go and what they do.  We've got a few that went a little shorter.  We've got a few that went a little farther.  But like I said, it was a great week.  Tough conditions, that's what it should be for the final round.
