Q. Did you see something like this coming, 64 in the opening round?
GRAYSON MURRAY: Probably not, but I mean I've been here since December 30th working on the game and I feel like I probably am the most prepared of the field for all three courses. Coming off of a long off season you never expect to come out the gates like I did firing, but I'm comfortable around all three of these courses, the Stadium I've had pretty good success in the past few years and, yeah, I mean, I love it out here in the desert.
Q. The fall was kind of tough, you missed some cuts, you withdrew at Houston, that was your last event in the fall. So you had plenty of time to work on things, what specifically did you work on to gets this thing turned around?
GRAYSON MURRAY: My body, first and foremost. I got in the gym and started losing a few pounds, getting my cardio going and just feeling better in general now. And still got work to do, but that was kind of the main thing is to -- I mean, seeing all these guys who are older than me in the gym and I'm like, Why am I not? I mean, if they're working that hard, you see Phil and them, and so I had to turn that around to feel better about myself, first and foremost, and then my game will never be that far off.
Q. How does this change your approach to the rest of this week, 64 in the first round? It has to do something to you mentally.
GRAYSON MURRAY: It does, it obviously puts me in good position. And to go see the other two courses, La Quinta and the Nicklaus, there's birdies to be made on both of those. And, yeah, I mean, this is just one day and we'll take it one day at a time.
