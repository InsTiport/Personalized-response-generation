 Q.  Probably not the front nine you wanted, but four birdies on the back.  How would you assess the day overall?  
GRAYSON MURRAY: It was okay.  I didn't hit it close, my iron shots weren't really that great, especially on the front nine, so didn't really have many birdie looks.  But I turned it around a little bit on that back side and made a couple coming in, which was nice.  Anything in the 60s over here or anything in the 70, you feel like you're giving shots back, so definitely wanted to keep it in the 60s.  And, yeah, I mean this course is probably the, of the three, it doesn't fit my eye the best, but there's a lot of birdie holes out there and I'm just pleased that I birdied 17 and 18 coming in.   
 Q.  How do you feel like your standing going into the weekend, getting another shot at the Stadium Course, do you feel pretty confident going into the weekend?  
GRAYSON MURRAY: Yeah, I get the Nicklaus Course tomorrow, that will be nice, just because I can hit a lot of drivers and I feel like I'm driving the ball pretty well and obviously the Stadium's fitting my eye pretty good this week, so it's going to be a shoot-out the next couple day, I think I said that yesterday, so I don't think it's any different.
