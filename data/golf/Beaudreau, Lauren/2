Q. Ended up winning 3-1; you were down 2 after 7.  Talk me through a little bit about what your mindset was and how you were able to kind of come back.
LAUREN BEAUDREAU: Yeah, first couple holes were a little tough.  On the par-5 that I had birdied every time I played this week I put in the water off the tee.  So I ended up making bogey there and lost the hole, so I was a little behind the eight ball.
Then I birdies 9, 10, and 11, and it really changed the momentum of the round.
Moving forward then, I hit my driver really well and made some clutch putts coming down the stretch.
Q. So now a quarterfinalist in the U.S. Girls' Junior.  What does that mean to you?
LAUREN BEAUDREAU: It means a lot because this is my fourth time playing in this tournament, and the farthest I ever made it before was round of 64.  Being this far, it's a great way to end my last U.S. Junior.  Hopefully I can go all the way.
Q. Maybe what's something in your game that you need to work on maybe heading into tomorrow and you want to make sure is sharp?
LAUREN BEAUDREAU: Just couple of approach irons were a little weak today.  My chipping and putting has really saved me all week.  I've converted almost all of my up and downs.  So if I do get into a tough spot I know I can rely on that, which is nice.
But just capitalizing when I'm in the fairway and making some more birdies from there would be the goal.
Q. Favorite part out here this week so far?
LAUREN BEAUDREAU: Just, I mean, this course is amazing.  It's in beautiful condition.  Yeah, my friend is caddying for me.  We have a really good relationship.  My whole family is out here watching.
So just the whole atmosphere of the tournament.  This is my favorite tournament.
