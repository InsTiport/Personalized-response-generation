 Q.   Thoughts on the 65 that pushed you up to prominence on that board.   
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   It was great.   I hit the ball very nice, especially off the tee, very long.   It helped me having some shorter irons that I obviously was taking advantage of.  
   
 Q.   So you played a lot better than previous days, which were modest scores?  
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   I guess I putted much better.   But I hit the ball quite good yesterday, especially yesterday was a good, solid day swinging.   
   
 Q.   I know the clichÃ© is moving day, but were you conscious of getting up that board and rising to that position right at the top for a while?  
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   Yeah, there is birdies out there.   Some pin positions are either birdie, bogey.   There will be a lot of colors in people's rounds, and obviously mine, that blue on the last, which is a little bit sad.   But hopefully I can make up some birdies tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   That blue at the last, you say it's sad.   What actually happened there.   Everything had been going along so smoothly?  
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   I didn't miss any balls to the left the last two days.   And this was actually the first drive that I missed left, and a bad hole to miss left.     
   
 Q.   This has been coming, hasn't it.   The form has been good.   You made a few changes and seen the results, I guess.   
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   Yeah, it is starting to show, and I'm delighted, because I haven't had the best four or five months, and now it's the second time I see you in two, three weeks.   So it must be good.   
   
 Q.   Tell us about some of those changes.   
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   The clubs, I have lengthened them a lot more than people think.   But that, and the help that I got from my old coach.   I got back with him a month ago.   It's been working really nice, getting everything sorted, and see where that takes me.   
   
 Q.   The obvious question is:   Where will it take you tomorrow?   What are your thoughts on Sunday in this position?   
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   I would love to make a Top‑10 and play next week.   That was my goal at the start of the week, and I gave myself a great chance tomorrow.   Nothing to complain.
