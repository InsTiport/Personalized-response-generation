Q.   Talk us through 17. 
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   I thought I had the perfect number to be honest, 235 front, plus ten where I wanted to land, because I knew the greens were soft.   I thought, if I really cut one, I can take off some distance and it will be good. 
When I saw that curving, I thought this is going close, and I didn't know it was going to be that close but it was fun.

Q.   Marvelous in terms of the scoring, because it's been a low‑scoring round and to have an eagle two there and to finish off the way that you have, it means you have a wonderful opportunity. 
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   To be honest, I didn't start‑‑ I bogeyed the first, and I thought, the rain, it was kind of heavy, the ball was not flying that much.   So I thought I'm really going to have grind it today, and I did.   I didn't play as good as the other two days, but the putter worked very nicely.

Q.   It's like a different course now as a result of the weather. 
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   It takes a little bit of time to adjust.   I've been planning to land it short for a few days now, and now it's just almost backspinning.   Even with driver, it's one, two meters where it lands.   So we'll see tomorrow.

Q.   Do you get the impression of where you'll be in relation to everybody else going into the final day?
CARLOS DEL MORAL:   I know I did my best.   I know I did pretty good and tomorrow, if I play the same way, I will be there.
