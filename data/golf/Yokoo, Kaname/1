JOHN BUSH:  Can we get you to go through your birdies for us, the clubs you hit and the distance of your putts starting on No. 1?

JOHN BUSH:  Number 17?
KANAME YOKOO:  160 to the hole, 8-iron, about 10 feet.
JOHN BUSH:  Questions?  Can you go through the bogeys as well?  No. 12?
KANAME YOKOO:  Went to the right rough.  Tee shot went to the rough, to the edge of the bunker on the lips kind of, put it on the fairway, had 66 yards to the hole and it wasn't very close and 2-putt.
16, tee shot in the bunker, went -- put it about 2 feet from the hole but missed that putt for a bogey.
JOHN BUSH:  So missed a 2-footer?
KANAME YOKOO:  Missed a 2-footer.  Put it in the right bunker on the tee shot and I slipped -- my left foot slipped when I hit the 2nd shot out of the bunker, and it hit the lip of the bunker.  I still had about 115 left, about 18 feet, 2-putt bogey.
JOHN BUSH:  Questions?
Q.  You've missed about the last 6 cuts or so.  Explain what happened there and what was so much better today to get you off to this good start.
KANAME YOKOO:  My putting, it wasn't very well.  My shots weren't that bad, but 3- or 4-footer putts I've been missing during that time I've been missing the cut.  And last week at the Open, Scotty Cameron  -- I got a lesson from Scotty Cameron at the U.S. Open last week.

Q.  Putting lesson?
KANAME YOKOO:  Putting lesson.  I've been practicing since last week and it became pretty good, but still I miss a few.

Q.  What did Scotty try to have you do?
KANAME YOKOO:  My putting style was always straight, straight, and every time I would hit it, it would open up, it was kind of open.

Q.  So you got it more on line, is that it?
KANAME YOKOO:  Mine was -- Scotty Cameron told me to go from more open to closed type of swing on my putting, stroke, from inside to inside to like an open-closed type of stroke.

Q.  When did he work with you, just at the Open, 1 day, 2 days or --
KANAME YOKOO:  At the U.S. Open.  Maybe Tuesday at the U.S. Open.  I practiced a lot during that U.S. Open, but during the U.S. Open it didn't -- it didn't show that -- what I was practicing at, so that night when I went back to the hotel room, I practiced a lot.

Q.  Did you work a lot at the beginning of the week, this week?
KANAME YOKOO:  Yes.

Q.  Do you know this is the last year Canon is the sponsor?  And would that mean something special?
KANAME YOKOO:  Is that so?  I didn't know.  I would like to have it continue because it's Japanese.
JOHN BUSH:  Anything else?  Okay, Kaname Yokoo, congratulations on a good round.  Good luck the rest of the week.
KANAME YOKOO:  Thank you very much.
