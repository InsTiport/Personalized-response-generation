Q. What are your initial thoughts on winning that match?
YUJEONG SON: Honestly, I thought I played really good, but she was kind of having some trouble on the front, but she quickly caught up with her game on the back.  I could have made a few more putts to give myself a bigger lead, but I didn't.  But that's okay.  My game was to get pars and just to stay calm.
Q. Last year advancing to the round of 16, this year you've already won two more matches.  What would it mean to win one more and make it to the final?
YUJEONG SON: Oh, my God, I don't even want to look that far ahead.  But it would mean a lot to me.  I want to take it one shot at a time, not get ahead of myself because I know whoever wins, I'm going to have a tough time trying to beat them.  I just really want to have fun.
I think this year with Kelly on my bag, I think I had so much more fun than I did last year.  Yeah.
Q. I know you're having a great time with Kelly.  What would you say was the highlight of the last match for you against Kendall?
YUJEONG SON: The highlight was I think my last birdie putt for sure.  I won 11 and 12, and I think that really got me some momentum, and that really calmed me down and relaxed me a bit, so just half pars.  This back nine isn't the easiest to birdie.  The whole course is hard to birdie.  So I think that really gave me some momentum.
Q. So what will you need to improve the most for your semifinal match?
YUJEONG SON: Honestly, I have to say I could have made a lot more six-foot putts today, and so I think if that improves, I think we'll have a good time out there.
