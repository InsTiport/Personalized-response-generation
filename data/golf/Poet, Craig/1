Q. You backed off some guys that have pretty good credentials.
CRAIG POET: That we did.  That's putting it mildly.
Q. Did that make it easier on you guys when you're going out?  Less pressure on you knowing they're kind of maybe the more well-known team, the team maybe favored to win?
CRAIG POET: I probably felt less pressure.  Like everybody, if you looked at it, you would think Nathan and Todd, they've done it in the past.  They're used to playing in these events.  It made it a little easier, I think, to go out and free wheel it.
Q. You guys got up early.  Did that take some of the pressure off too?
PAT COLLOGAN: Getting up was certainly better than getting down, but you obviously know there is a whole lot of golf left.  Against those guys, you better not sleep on the lead.
Q. Was there a key moment in the match?  Was there a key putt, a key shot?
CRAIG POET: You know, I don't know.  9 was a big putt, I think.
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah.
CRAIG POET: To go 3-up.  It was right when it was pouring rain, and Pat hit it in there close.
Q. How close?
PAT COLLOGAN: Oh, probably four foot, five foot.
Q. With what club?
PAT COLLOGAN: A 6-iron.
Q. What was it playing today?
PAT COLLOGAN: It was about 180.  Just hit on the back side of the green, and there happened to be a slope there that brought it back towards the front of the pin.
CRAIG POET: That was right before the delay, so that was big to get 3-up.
Q. Then again, the delay, they got a chance to maybe regroup --
CRAIG POET: Well, that's true.
Q. -- and take some of your momentum away, but obviously it didn't, it didn't bother you guys.
CRAIG POET: Well, we were able to kind of weather the storm, literally.
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah.
CRAIG POET: They went birdie-birdie, and Pat made another birdie on 10, and we birdied the par-5 to get back to 3-up.
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah.
Q. Knock it down in 2?
CRAIG POET: No, laid up, and I hit it in there probably three feet away and made it.
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah, we all had good looks on par-5, and almost made it.  His last putt rolled in to get us back up to 3, which, again, 3 is more comfortable than 2.
Q. Have you guys ever played this before?
CRAIG POET: No, we tried to qualify the previous couple years and haven't made it.
Q. I see you've got a Mid-Am?
CRAIG POET: One Mid-Am, Country Club of Birmingham a few years ago.
Q. Have you played anything?
PAT COLLOGAN: First USGA.
Q. So you guys went to one USGA event versus guys that have probably combined for maybe 50, and five championships for Nathan and one for Todd, and two Walker Cups.  That's a pretty good notch on the belt to knock off a couple guys like that?
CRAIG POET: Sure.  Sure.
PAT COLLOGAN: That's right (laughing).
Q. You're both from Ponca City, Oklahoma?  You grew up as buddies or meet at the club you played at?  How did you form your team?
CRAIG POET: I'm a lot older than he is.
PAT COLLOGAN: Not a lot older.
CRAIG POET: 15 years.  But we had become buddies once we both came back to town.
Q. You play at the same place?
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah, we play at the country club.
Q. Ponca City?
CRAIG POET: Ponca City Country Club.
Q. You guys are not in the same business though?
PAT COLLOGAN: No, he's a financial advisor.
CRAIG POET: He's an attorney.
Q. How long have you known each other?
PAT COLLOGAN: 15, 20 years.
Q. Since childhood or just college?
CRAIG POET: Well, I mean, I knew of him because like I said, I'm 15 years older, so I knew of him probably when you were in high school.
PAT COLLOGAN: Yeah.
CRAIG POET: Then after college, after he came back we kind of played a little golf together.
Q. Okay.  And you went to college at Belmont?
CRAIG POET: No, I went to University of Nebraska.
PAT COLLOGAN: Louisiana-Monroe.
Q. And anybody tease you about your last name?
CRAIG POET: All the time.
Q. What is the funniest thing?
CRAIG POET: Oh, you know, everybody just asks me to do a poem.
Q. You think you can come up with some rhymes?
CRAIG POET: You're a poet and you know it.
