   CRAIG SMITH:  Fu Chiang Pan, 15 years old, the youngest guy in this field of match play.  Are you surprising yourself?  Or are you ready for this. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Really surprising.  I qualify for this tournament and I don't think so I can make it.  But I did make it.  I did it and I make it. 
 And this week I came here and I saw many many people like me, very strong and in this case very good.  I don't think that I can hang in, I can -- I played very well today. 

 Q.  You played very well today. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah. 

 Q.  On the 16th you were just over the green a little bit.  And you chipped very close.  It seems like you chipped very well on the holes I saw.  Is that something that you usually do well? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah.  It's very close, the pin, so I think that it -- yeah, that chip is very good, I think. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Tell us just a little bit about you.  We haven't seen you play golf a lot.  You live in Taiwan. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  I live in Taiwan. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  You visit here. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah, I was playing in the Asian golf.  I play in Asia.  So the year I played over in Asia.  I was playing in Asia. 
 Now I play in the United States. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What made you decide to come here and play the U.S. Amateur to try and qualify? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Everybody says this course is very good, it's very challenging, so they told me to go try it and last year I tried it and but I don't make it.  I didn't qualify last year. 
 CRAIG SMITH;  you did try last year and didn't make it. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  So now you not only qualified you make match play, there are some people out there that are twice your age.  Are you having any, what's the most trouble that you have out here being so young and do you hit the ball as far as the rest. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  No.  I think not.  I'm not very too sure.  I'm not too short, but not too long. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Is golf something you want to do for your career or is it too early to tell?  Do you want to play golf for your life? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Pro? 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Yeah.  Professional. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Maybe. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah. 

 Q.  You said -- had you heard about this course before? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Before I heard of this course of the U.S. Open here and I said it's very challenging. 

 Q.  How does it compare to the courses you usually play? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Practice round I played it was so close, maybe 10 -- the courses was very long, the rough was very long.  And every hole, you must hit it in the fairway on every hole.  And I think that's what I do. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Are you one of the best junior golfers at home? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah.  I think so. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  What have you won back home? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  In Taiwan?  I won the season amateur.  In Taiwan we have four seasons amateurs.  So I won that. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Who is your favorite golfer? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Tiger Woods.  And every top player. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Every top player? 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Yeah. 
 CRAIG SMITH:  Thank you very much.  You played very, very well.  Good luck. 
 FU CHIANG PAN:  Thank you.
