Q.  Could you give us a brief background.  Are you from Seoul, and when did you start golf?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  My background, I started golf when I was 11.  My father is a -- was a touring professional in Seoul, Korea, on the PGA TOUR.  He comes every winter, and for a month or two to practice.  Didn't play in too many tournaments.  And this year, he wanted to try to come here and try some of the bigger tournaments.  And I set -- 
 

Q.  Do you live in California?
 
FRANK BAIK:  He stays with me in Diamond Bar, California. 
 

Q.  How did you meet him, or are you a relative, what's the connection?
 
FRANK BAIK:  I played golf in some Tours, and professional a little bit.  And I went to Korea, I met his father and also an instructor, who is a top professional in Korea.  Every winter they come and practice, and I get along with them.  He couldn't make it, and he left me in his hands.  My name is Frank Baik, B-a-i-k.  
 

Q.  Where are you from, originally, LA area?
 
FRANK BAIK:  Yes, born in Seoul, Korea, but from southern California. 
 

Q.  Are you surprised by what you've accomplished this week, what was your goal starting out this tournament?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  We felt like if we could get into the quarterfinals, that was fine; I'm really satisfied.  Anything beyond that, I'd be really excited and surprised.  So I'm in the Final 4 now; so I'm pretty excited. 
 

Q.  Obviously, with the last few years, with Se Ri Pak, and Grace Park, and the women golfers coming out of Korea, how big a sport is it there, and do a lot of people play or just a few?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I thought Se Ri Pak and Grace Park -- golf especially in the Juniors, it's a boom over there.  A lot of parents are trying to get kids in golf. 
 

Q.  How many courses in Korea?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  About a hundred. 
 

Q.  Why have we heard more about the women than the men?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I can't really answer for the  ladies, but for the men, it's more the golf courses. There's so many different types of golf courses here in the States than in Korea, and you can only develop your game so far over there, as opposed to here. 
 

Q.  How long have you been joining Mr. Baik?  Are you learning any English, or do you not want to learn English, and do you hope to go to college here?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I'm trying to learn English. Mr. Baik is teaching me some things.  But my English is not very good. School-wise, I can't go to school here.  I have to pass SAT's and so on.  I'd love to go to school.  That's the goal.  But we talked to some coaches, and there's no way around it. 
 
PETE KOWALSKI:  Could you talk about the ebbs and flows in the match, and particularly how you felt about the bunker shot on 17? 
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I thought the match would be over on 17, but after I holed it, I didn't feel one way or another.  Just nothing. 
 
PETE KOWALSKI:  Did you feel that the match was truly over after James hit his tee ball in 18 into the hazard? 
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Yes. 
 

Q.  What did you hit into the green, the third  shot?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I had 188 to the front.  We hit a 3-iron. 
 

Q.  I know we touched on this a very little bit on TV, but was it any easier for you playing someone your own age in this match, unlike the older guys you've probably faced early on?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  If I was to face Bryce Molder, I knew of him because of his past.  I thought it would be a tougher match mentally for me to prepare.  But since I was facing James -- I know him.  I felt a lot more comfortable facing James than if Bryce Molder would have been in the quarterfinals. 
 

Q.  How do you know James?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I met James at the U.S. Junior about a month ago.  That was the first time.  We knew of each other, but that was the first time we shook hands and said hello. 
 

Q.  Are you the top Junior in Korea?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Top Junior and Amateur right now. 
 

Q.  Explain the field and size of the professional field?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Just the full size, 156 Korean PGA tournament with Korean professionals.  
 

Q.  What was your father's full name?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  First name, J-i-n.  Middle is Y-o-u-n-g.  Last name is Kim, of course. 
 

Q.  Have you been in touch with his father the first few days?
 
FRANK BAIK:  Yes, they know the scores on the Internet. 
 

Q.  What time is it there?
 
FRANK BAIK:  About 7:00 in the morning. 
 

Q.  He must understand a little bit of what we're talking about?
 
FRANK BAIK:  I'm sure he does, a little bit. 
 

Q.  Are you comfortable enough given the language barrier?  Do you know what the people are saying in the crowd, cheering for you?  Does it all translate?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Very little.  Very little. 
 

Q.  You understand very little?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Very little, yeah. 
 

Q.  Could you give us your height and weight?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  90 kilograms.  178 centimeters.  About 5'10, I think. 
 

Q.  Did you talk at all with James?  Did you talk much during the match?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  No, not really.  Just "Nice shot, okay."  
 

Q.  You read your own putts?
 
FRANK BAIK:  We get into a lot of fights out there; so we agreed he's the one putting, and if he has a problem, he'll ask for my advice.  Especially the short putts, I don't think he's missed a short putt yet, under four feet, for any round here.  He's been putting -- on the short putt, I won't touch it, but on the long putts, he'll ask and I'll give advice. 
 

Q.  Have you seen Pebble before, or on television?  What's the first thing you thought of when you saw it?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  The first time was the '92 Open.  Was that Tom Kite?  I saw Pebble Beach on TV then. 
 

Q.  Was this the first time you played it?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Yes, this is the first time I played it. 
 

Q.  Was it similar to what you saw on TV, or was it much harder?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I like the scenic views and the surroundings of Pebble Beach.  But if I have to play Pebble Beach for another week, I'm going to give up the game.  (Laughter.) 
 

Q.  How many years have you been coming here? What do you like best about America, and what do you  like least about America?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Best thing about the U.S. is the golf courses, the facilities.  You can go to a public course and play on a nice golf course.  And the thing I don't like about America is the English (language) barrier, I've got problems with. 
 

Q.  What's his personality like, since we can't tell?
 
FRANK BAIK:  Pretty much what you see, he's very quiet.  But he's a lot more -- one of the caddies in the third round we played with, David Hearn, he was coming up at 11.  He was coming up to me and telling me, "How old is he," and I told him 17.  He said: "Looking in his eyes he's a fierce, fierce competitor."  And he was saying that to me, and I looked at him.  I agree to a point, he looks like -- his nickname in Korea is Pooh, Winnie the Pooh.  But inside, he's very fierce.  He's pretty strong, very strong mentally. 
 

Q.  Did you play any sports growing up besides golf?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Short track ice skating a little bit when I was 9, 10. 
 

Q.  Do you follow the Dodgers because of Chan-Ho Park? 
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Yes. 
 

Q.  Are you getting a lot of attention in Korea right now for this?  Are you doing any phone interviews or anything?
 
FRANK BAIK:  We got a phone interview yesterday after getting out of the Media Center.  But I'm sure they'll keep calling the hotel room. 
 

Q.  From a newspaper?
 
FRANK BAIK:  Yes.  And TV.  He told me yesterday it was on the sports news in Korea, the 11 o'clock news.

Q.  Does he have brothers or sisters or a girlfriend or such?
 
FRANK BAIK:  I know he's got a girlfriend.  He calls her every night.  He's got two older brothers, one is a golfer, and one is not. 
 

Q.  What foods do you enjoy here and, what are you  doing in your free time and the rest of the day today?

FRANK BAIK:  Very so-so, he said. 
 

Q.  Is your girlfriend back in Seoul?  How long do you talk to her, and how much does it cost?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  First time I was here, I was at the U.S. Junior qualifying, and I ran up my telephone bill.  It came out to $300 or so.  So Mr. Baik bought me some phone cards.  It's much cheaper that way. 
 

Q.  Does she play golf?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  No. 
 

Q.  Do you feel any pressure?  Are you just having a good time, or do you kind of realize where you are now?

Q.  Why?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Just everything about him: His swing, his attitude, his looks, just looks cool. 
 

Q.  What do you know about Hunter Haas?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I guess he was on U.S. Pub Links.  He was on TV.  We watched the match together.  I saw him a couple of times on TV. 
 

Q.  When did you see it?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  I don't remember when, but I remember watching it. 
 

Q.  Are you nervous at all, having to face him tomorrow?
 
SUNG YOON KIM:  Not nervous, but since I saw him play on TV a couple of months ago or whatever, and I get to play a match with him tomorrow, it's sort of a funny feeling.  More nervousness.
