Q. How did it feel out there to put that together obviously going into a major?
MARIA FASSI:   I mean, I think it was kind of -- this whole week I was feeling good.  I was hitting it good, putting good rolls on the putts, and I think today they just kind of finally dropped.
Eagling 18 and kind of going 5-under with nine to play really just gave me the boost in confidence I needed to go low again.  The front nine played hard for me.  I think I they're tough holes and it was windy out there.
Just very happy with the way I played, with the game how it's looking, and very excited for KPMG next week.
Q. I've heard a lot from maybe some veterans on the LPGA about how it takes a while to learn this course, and then finally put that and execute and find a low number here.  Do you see that out there?  Have you learned it pretty quickly, do you think?
MARIA FASSI:   Yeah, I think there are some hard holes out there where if you know I guess where is a good place to miss and where is the easiest up and down, I guess it really pays off.
And I think essentially the greens can be tricky.  I think playing it more can really payoff.  I mean, you still have to hit the shots.  Even though you know course like the back of your hand, you still have to make the putts.
I think as the years go by I'm going to be more comfortable out here.  And hopefully I can get a win out here someday.
