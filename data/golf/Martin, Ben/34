Q. So 1-under today, 3-under for the tournament, how are things looking for tomorrow?BEN MARTIN: I'm just trying to keep doing what I've been doing.  I think any time you shoot under par on this golf course, especially in the afternoon when it's getting firm, is a solid round. So just kind of pleased with what I've done the first three days.  Just got one more day to do it.
Q. Have the greens been the biggest difference between playing in the morning and afternoons?BEN MARTIN: I think so.  Thursday morning, I was first off, 7:00 A.M., and by far the softest they have been all week, and they have been getting a little firmer as the days go along and in the afternoons each day.  Especially the last four or five holes today were really playing tough.
Q. What do you think has been working well for you this week?BEN MARTIN: A little bit of everything.  I think -- I haven't really looked at my stats today, but I was driving it in the fairway a lot the first two rounds, making all -- most of my putts inside of eight, ten feet.  So if I can continue to do that, I think I'll have a good day tomorrow.
