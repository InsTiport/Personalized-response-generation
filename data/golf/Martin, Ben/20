  BEN MARTIN: Especially coming back into the greens at 17 and 18 would have been tough, but it kind of laid down for us.  The greens got a little firmer, maybe speed stayed about the same, but it was gettable to a certain extent.   Q.  All right.  We look forward to your playing on the weekend.  Thanks.  BEN MARTIN: Thanks.   Q.  Hey, Ben, could you just give me overall thoughts on your rounds so we can get some quotes?  BEN MARTIN: Yeah.  I haven't really looked at the stats, but fairways lot of greens and kept it simple today.  I think for No. 6 to No. 12.  I didn't have a single birdie putt, but I'm grinding it out.  I got up-and-down, made some good par saves.   Q.  Overall thoughts on your position heading into the next couple of days?  BEN MARTIN: Yeah.  I'm right where I want to be going into the weekend.  So I played two pretty solid rounds and every day is a new day and just kind of keep going and add them up at the end.
