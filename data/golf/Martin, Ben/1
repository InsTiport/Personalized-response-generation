Q. 4-under, 66.  Talk a little bit about your day and the scrambling.  Seven out of seven.  That was impressive.
BEN MARTIN: Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I think I've played well here in the past.  I have some good memories coming back here.
Got off to a good birdie birdieing 1, and then just kind of, yeah, the scrambling kind of kept the round going.
And then being able to finish birdieing 16 and 18 was just kind of icing on the cake.  A lot of times those par saves are just as big at the birdies.
Q. Absolutely.  Talk about the conditions.  Was the wind a factor at all this morning?
BEN MARTIN: Yeah, we got out the third group at like 7:20, so it was pretty light for most of the day.  It's certainly out there.  The rough is up out but the greens are kind of soft.
There are birdies to be had, but you got to work it around this place and hit your targets.  It's a good combo.  Certainly scoring conditions were good this morning.
