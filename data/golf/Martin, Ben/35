Q.   Bogey‑free 65 today.   Course playing easy, or are you just hitting it that good?
BEN MARTIN:   I was hitting it really well.   On the front nine I had a couple of missed opportunities.   It really could have been a really good front nine. 
But rolled a few putts in and just kind of making the turn and made a good birdie on 10, and then made three more in a row.   Birdied the first four on the back and then kind of held on coming in. 
It was nice to finish bogey free, but it was good to get up‑and‑downs on 17 and 18.

Q.   And just talk about that streak of those four in a row, what exactly was going right there.
BEN MARTIN:   Really I felt like the front nine I could have birdied almost every hole.   Trying to think back if I ever had ‑‑ maybe 2, I got up and down on 2.
But I finally ‑‑ when I rolled to putt it, birdie putt in on 8, I think that gave me a little bit of confidence with the putter.   I knew I was hitting it good.   I think it was 12 feet on 10, probably four feet on 11, 12 feet on 13, and then like 30 feet on 14 to cap it off.
And Luke was making birdies, too, so we were kind of feeding off each other out there, so it was a lot of fun.

Q.   And how do you keep this momentum going into tomorrow?
BEN MARTIN:   Just kind of do what I always do, take a look at the big picture.   I would say probably going to have a later tee time tomorrow, so there will be a lot of time off.   Just hopefully ‑‑ you never know how you're going to play on a Sunday, but I'm just looking forward to the opportunity.
