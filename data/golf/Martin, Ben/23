Q.   Great way to start, especially in these conditions for the first round of the RBC Heritage. 
BEN MARTIN:   It is, yeah.   I played well here last year, and the conditions today were very similar to last year, a little chilly, with a north wind blowing, dead in our face for the last two holes.   Almost felt like it was a continuation of Sunday's round from last year.

Q.   2‑under on that back nine, what did you have dialed in as you came in on the final nine holes of this first round?
BEN MARTIN:   I just really like this course, and I'm able to manage it around, and I think my way around it.   So just hit a couple close and took advantage of it, and when I didn't, I think I left it in the right spots to get it up and down.   It's a course you look on the scorecard, it doesn't look that hard, but you get out there and things change.

Q.   This has to be a special place for you to play here in the state of South Carolina?
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, the only event in my home state.   We don't get many home events, so to speak, on the Tour, because we're traveling throughout the country.   So anytime you have that local Clemson support and South Carolina support is good.

Q.   Ben hit the tee this morning, Mother Nature greeted him with cloudy, cold, windy conditions.   That being said, how good was that number you posted?
BEN MARTIN:   You know, today was a lot like the whole tournament last year.   The north wind started blowing and it got a little cooler.   I think 18 was actually the coldest point on the course, it actually got colder as we were playing, at least it felt that way.
And I played well here last year, under similar conditions, same kind of feel.   I almost kept that momentum going.

Q.   What do you like about this layout?
BEN MARTIN:   I like that you have to think your way around.   You look at the scorecard and the length, and it doesn't look that hard, but it's a lot of picking your spots and knowing where to miss it.   And it just suits my game, I guess.   And a lot that it's in South Carolina, it's a home state event.   And we don't really get to play many home events on Tour, so it's nice to have that level of support.

Q.   You attended Clemson, did you hear it from the Tiger fans out there?
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, absolutely.   Absolute a lot of folks from Greenwood, Greenville and Clemson.

Q.   (Inaudible.)
BEN MARTIN:   I think a lot of it has to do with it being in South Carolina.   I always like playing close to home.   It's nice to kind of having Augusta last week, and Hilton Head this week.   Having back‑to‑back home events are sweet for me. 
And I also like you have to think your way around this place.   Just hitting it in the fairway sometimes isn't necessarily ‑‑ you have to be on the right side of the fairway.   I like courses where you've got to manage your way around and think your way around.

Q.   Good number in Round 1.   What's it going to take for you to be in the thick of things come Sunday?
BEN MARTIN:   There's still a long way to go until Sunday.   I've had success here last year, and I think I did that by just taking it a day at a time, a shot at the time.   It's kind of clichÃ©.   If the conditions stay like this, that's almost what you have to do.   Because I think the tougher it plays, the more‑‑ sometimes the easier it is to kind of hit the next shot.
