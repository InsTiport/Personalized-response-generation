 Q.   Can you just tell us a bit about your round, how it went out there?  
BEN MARTIN:   We had a good time.   Played with James Hahn and Robert Streb, and all of us had our wives caddying for us.   We were kind of all at the same stage of our Tour careers the first couple of years, so it was fun playing with some guys that I've gotten to know over the last couple of years.  
   
 Q.   How was your game plan for you today?  
BEN MARTIN:   I haven't played the Par 3 since I was here the last time five years ago, so I was trying to remember all the greens broke.   And of course, they have the pins set up to just make a few hole‑in‑ones.   I made four birdies; that was a good thing.  
   
 Q.   Pretty good.   How you feeling heading into tomorrow's first round?  
BEN MARTIN:   I'm just looking forward to being here.   Since I won in October this is the one thing I'm been looking forward to the most is this week.   Just excited that tomorrow starts the first round.
