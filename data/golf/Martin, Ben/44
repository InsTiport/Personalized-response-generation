 Q.   Just tell me a little bit about that round.  
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, it was two probably the best rounds I've played all year, just consistency wise and putting well.   
Got off to an average start, missed a few makeable ones, but then got one to drop on, I guess, 16.   And that kind of opened the gates for me, made‑‑ I think I birdied four out of five, and then just gave myself a lot of good chances, and it makes it a lot more fun out there.  
   
 Q.   Two solid rounds you said probably the best of the season so far.   What do you attribute that to?  
BEN MARTIN:   I think‑‑ you know, it's a little bit frustrating not getting in some of these events, but I had the last three weeks off, not because I wanted to.   So I think just being at home and kind of thinking back.   You know, I had a lot of success last year on the Web.com Tour, and kind of getting in that same mindset that I had last year, and I think that's showing up in the results.  
   
 Q.   Tell me a little bit about the course.   How is it playing?  
BEN MARTIN:   I like the course.   I was down here a couple of years ago and had a pretty good tournament.   I don't remember exactly what I shot, but I know I had some low score here or there, one or two of the days.   So I have some good memories here.   The wind usually blows, so you gotta strike it solid.   And then the greens are good.   So looking forward to the next two days.  
   
 Q.   And just last question, tell me a little bit about your experience in Puerto Rico so far.  
BEN MARTIN:   It's been awesome.   Yeah, I played the college event in Rio Mar four years, so this is my sixth time down here.   I enjoy it every time I come.   Can't beat the weather when it's just snowing a few weeks back home.
