Q. Ben, a really solid round of golf out of you, and yet maybe it was a bogey at the 13th hole that kind of spurred you on to three birdies in a row?
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, played solid all day.   I had a lot of offense yesterday.   I think I had a couple bogeys and a double, but I know I made six birdies and an eagle yesterday and a lot of birdies today.   Yeah, it's starting to come together.

Q.   And you had another putt for eagle at 16 here in the second round. 
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I made eagle there yesterday, so some good memories coming into there.   I cozied it up for a nice two‑putt birdie, and I think that's the stretch in the course you've got to score with a couple par‑5s and a drivable par‑4 there.

Q.   Where is all this offense coming because it wasn't a great start to the season last week out in Napa. 
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I'm not sure I beat anybody last week.   I think we can chalk to up to a little bit of rust, a couple weeks at home, and just really tried to engage a little more this week.   I think I still kind of had that home mindset.   To get back into tournament mode and really didn't come in here with a lot of confidence after last week, so it's nice to put two good scores together.
