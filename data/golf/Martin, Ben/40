 Q.   You mentioned 31 holes in the wind and the rain?  
BEN MARTIN:   I was tired the last two or three holes.   I hit a few wayward drives.   And 18, I think I hit a 3‑wood further than my driver on the last hole.   Nice to close it out with some pars on the last couple of holes.  
   
 Q.   How much did today being in that final group prepare you for the possibility of winning this tournament tomorrow?  
BEN MARTIN:   It was a lot of fun, a position I've never been in before, obviously playing with K.J., but after the first hole or two I kind of settled in there and felt like I played well.   
   
 Q.   Tomorrow you're going to be chasing Luke Donald, the leader right now.   
BEN MARTIN:   I don't really pay any attention to the leaderboard.   I couldn't have told you where I stood.   I hadn't really looked at the board all day.   I try to go out there and focus on what I do.   
   
 Q.   What's the mindset going into tomorrow?  
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I played 31 holes.   I'm pretty happy to finish it out with a few pars.   The last holes are playing tough.   So I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing all week:   Having fun, focus on what I can control and what I'm doing out there, and add them up at the end of the day tomorrow.  
   
 Q.   Talk about your second round.   You alluded to not going to focus on finishes, just what you can control.   Kind of expand on that moving into the final round, knowing you've got a shot at your first victory right here in your home state.   
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, the best way for me to give myself an opportunity to play well is just focus on my routine, my process, as long as I know what I'm doing with the ball and not worry about anybody else.   To go out there and hopefully‑‑ I think with the tough conditions, it helps focusing.
