 Q.  Ben, another good start for you here in Reno.  Just comment on your day.  
BEN MARTIN: Yeah, it was nice.  Off to a pretty good start.  I guess I've been here twice now before and had two top-10s.  So got some good memories coming back here.  And kind of picked up off where I was last time.   
 Q.  Any bogeys?  
BEN MARTIN: I did make a couple of bogeys, I believe.  I bogeyed No. 5, hit it -- kind of bounced right off the tee.  And I bogeyed number 7, I 3-putted.  I don't know how -- I think it was five birdies, an eagle and two bogeys, if that adds up to 13 opponents.  I eagled the last hole.   
 Q.  18?  
BEN MARTIN: No. 18, made like a 50-footer for eagle, so it was a nice way to cap it off.   
 Q.  You've got a late tee time tomorrow.  Does it change how you approach Friday's round?  
BEN MARTIN: Not really.  We do it every week.  So one day we play early, one day we play late.  I'm sure it will be a little more firm in the afternoon.  But everybody gets a taste of it.  So just kind of -- we do have a little bit of wait this afternoon, then tomorrow we'll just pick back up where we were.  Nothing we don't normally deal with.
