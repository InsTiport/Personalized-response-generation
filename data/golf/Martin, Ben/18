 Q.  What do you take out of this week?  BEN MARTIN: What do I take out of this week?  It was a good experience.  Being in the hunt on Sunday and in one of the best fields in the world one of the best tournaments we play all year. So I won't take any negatives away, only positives.  I gave myself a chance, birdieing 15, 16, 17 and would have been nice to hit a -- I hit the same tee shot I hit the last two days on 18.  So that tee shot just kind of will kind of be the one thing that got me three out of four days.   Q.  Your first appearance here.  What are your expectations coming in and did you exceed those?  BEN MARTIN: My expectations, every week are just to prepare as well as I can, give myself an opportunity to be on the leaderboard on Sunday.  Every week I want to be, have a chance to win on Sunday.  So I was right there this week, so only good things out of this week.   Q.  What were the clubs on 15, 16 and 17?  BEN MARTIN: 15, I had a 50 degree wedge from 133. Then 16 I hit hybrid from I want to say I had 218 front.  233 hole. 17 was basically the same shot I hit on 15.  I think it was like 133 again or 132.  So I had a good, I just hit that shot two holes earlier, so I had a good number on it.   Q.  Where were you when Sergio made the putt and what was your reaction to the reaction of everyone around you?  BEN MARTIN: I want to say we had already -- I think we were done on 16.  So, I just kind of laughed it off and said, good for him, give us something to shoot for.   Q.  Describe that second shot on 18.  BEN MARTIN: All I had was a pitch out.  Until my third shot I had 93 to the front 100 to the hole.   Q.  There was no option of going at it at all?  BEN MARTIN: No, I was trying to get up-and-down with a wedge.
