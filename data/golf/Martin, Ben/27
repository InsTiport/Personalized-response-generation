 Q.   How about that finish, that was really, really fun on 18.   The par that you saved on 15 kind of set it up.   
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, that was big.   A lot of times a nice par save can do more for your round than birdie saves.   After I had one come down the hill to me on 15 to get that one up‑and‑down, and birdie 16 and finish it out on 18, good start to 2015 season.   
   
 Q.   The shot that Robert hit there kind of surprised you and all of us how it grabbed so much.   
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I wanted to make sure I got it down the hill.   It was coming in a little hot but had it on line.   
   
 Q.   Just some comments on your 67 today.   
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, got off and was hitting good shots, and I think I only missed two greens all day.   And one of those was a pitch shot.   
So ball‑striking felt solid and the greens out here can be a little tricky.   I knew if I could stay patient, I could get a few to go in throughout the day.   Closed out strong, which I always like to do.   
   
 Q.   Talk about the shot on 18.   
BEN MARTIN:   It's something, that kind of pitching‑‑ that range is something that I've been working on, I think that's the weakest part of my game, at least it was last year.   So any time I can see one turn out like I like it, it just gave me a little more confidence in that area.  
   
 Q.   What is that range?  
BEN MARTIN:   Anywhere before from 20 to 30 yards off the green.   Kind of like the shot I hit off 15.   My tendency is to get a little steep and stuck in the turf, especially with this bermudagrass, it can catch a little easy.   So I'm just working on getting the bounce going through the turf a little better.
