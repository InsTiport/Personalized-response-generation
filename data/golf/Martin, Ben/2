 Q.  Another solid day, 10 points, now 23 through two rounds.  Just comment on your afternoon.  
BEN MARTIN: Yeah, started on the back today.  Didn't get off to a great start but bogeyed the par-5 there.  I was hitting it fine, just not close enough to make any birdies, and then hit a good one into 18, two-putted for birdie, and then holed out on No. 1, kind of got things rolling.  I think eagles are so huge in this event, getting five points.  And then we had the rain delay in there, but came back out and hit a lot of good, quality shots.  Made a good par save on 7.  But it was nice to finish the day off birdieing 8 and having a good look at 9, but 10 points is a solid day.   
 Q.  What was your club and yardage on the eagle?  
BEN MARTIN: I hit an 8-iron.  I think I had 192 to the hole adjusted, but with -- I normally hit my 8-iron 165, so with the altitude the ball was going a little bit further.   
 Q.  We talked about it earlier this week, but two top 10 finishes in as many starts here.  Just comment about your comfort level on this golf course.  
BEN MARTIN: Yeah, I think that's huge in golf, whenever you're comfortable where you are, whether it's on the leaderboard or at a course that you like.  A couple of my successes here, and I felt like I've been playing well the last couple months.  It's nice to show some results, and hopefully keep doing it on the weekend.
