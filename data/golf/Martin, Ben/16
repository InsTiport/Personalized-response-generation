Q.   Ben Martin, 4‑under 66.   Good start. 
BEN MARTIN:   Thanks.   Yeah, after the three‑hour delay, I was a little bit tired starting this morning, just kind of‑‑ but got it going with a birdie on the first hole.   Just played solid overall. 
I think I hit a lot of fairways, a lot of greens I felt like, so that's kind of the way you want to play this place.

Q.   Were you already out here when you heard about the delay?
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I woke up at 5:30, and ended up after they announced the three hours, I ended up going back to the house we're staying at and I got about an hour at home and kind of restarted.

Q.   Of course the question was condition of the course with all that rain.   What did you think?
BEN MARTIN:   Yeah, I thought it's probably playing as easy as it could, just the ball pretty much was stopping right where it hit on the greens.   As long as you drove it in the fairway, then the course was playing easy.   Not a whole lot of wind.   So yeah, I expected maybe somebody to go out this morning and shoot 7‑ or 8‑under.

Q.   One bogey today; is that right?
BEN MARTIN:   I made two bogeys.

Q.   On No.11 and‑‑
BEN MARTIN:   And on 5.   I drove it in the rough on 5.

Q.   A lot of people bogey 5. 
BEN MARTIN:   So six birdies and two bogeys.

Q.   What happened on the par‑5? 
BEN MARTIN:   I hit my second shot in the rough, and then from there in the bunker and didn't get up‑and‑down.
