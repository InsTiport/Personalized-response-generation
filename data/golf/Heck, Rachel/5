Q. First of all, congratulations on everything this week.
RACHEL HECK: Thank you.
Q. Rachel, 15 years old.  Describe briefly your emotions now that you completed the U.S. Open.
RACHEL HECK: It was amazing.  Definitely like it's something I'll remember the rest of my life especially after today with Lexi, one of my role models, to play with her.  It's a dream come true.
Q. What are some of the best memories you'll take from the week?
RACHEL HECK: Playing with Nelly Korda the first two days.  These are girls I looked up to for so long.  To play along side of them, it's a great really great experience.
Q. Considering all the pressure and the difficulty of the golf course, how would you assess your play overall this week?
RACHEL HECK: I'm really happy with how I played.  Going in I was confident with my game but I didn't know how it would be since the course is really tough but I just took it shot by shot and had a lot of out.
Q. Tremendous.  Congratulations.  Good luck.
RACHEL HECK: Thank you.
