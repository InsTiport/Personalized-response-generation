  Q. How excited are you to be here this week?
 RACHEL HECK:   So excited.  It's unreal, I honestly can't put it into words.  Growing up as a girl, you couldn't really dream about playing Augusta, because you know, you don't think that's possible.
 So to actually be here and to actually know that I'm going to play Augusta in a couple days is surreal.
 Q. What are your goals or expectations?
 RACHEL HECK:   You know, I think it's just going to be hard.  I'm just going to try to put away those expectations and just play golf the first two days.
 I think you can put a lot of pressure on yourself.  You know, top 30, move on to play Augusta the last day and I think playing with that burden it is going to make it extra hard.
 So just take this one day at a time, one course at a time, enjoy the course the first two days and try to do everything I can.  Honestly, it's win/win, because if you miss the cut, you get to play a little leisure round at Augusta on Friday.  So can't really lose once you're here.
 Q. What are you most looking forward to?
 RACHEL HECK:   Just walking up the fairway and thinking about all the big names who have walked up that same fairway, picturing all the shots they hit and just taking in the moment no matter what I'm shooting, whether it's the final round or just a leisure round, but just thinking where I am and enjoying every second of it.
 Q. Talk about your excitement for tonight.
 RACHEL HECK:   I'm so excited.  It will be crazy, Chairman's Dinner at the Clubhouse, that's something only the boys get to do.  I'm excited, about to go back and shower and dress up.  It will be fun.
