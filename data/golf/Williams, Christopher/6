  CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS: This is my first Open, so I'm very excited, playing with all of these great golfers and people that I admired when I was a kid, and to be here playing with all of these fellows is just brilliant.   
  
  Q. Nice to see yourself up there at the top of the leaderboard?  
 CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS: I couldn't have asked for a better start.   
  
  Q. Especially amongst all those guys.   
 CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS: I look at that leaderboard there, it's a Who's Who of golf.   
 You talk about a good start like this; I couldn't have asked for anything better.   
  
  Q. It's been a good start overall for the Senior Tour for you.   
 CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS: Yes, Slaley was my first one, and I finished second, so that's a good start. It's opened a couple of doors hopefully and we'll take it from there.
