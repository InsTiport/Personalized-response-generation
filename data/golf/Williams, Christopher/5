Q.   Talk about your round today and your mentality going into tomorrow. 
CHRIS WILLIAMS:   A lot better than I was yesterday.   A lot more relaxed.   I made the cut, so I feel good about it.   My game was good today, I played very well, even though I had a triple on the 15th hole.   And I kept the game going today and am looking forward to tomorrow.

Q.   What was your mentality after the triple bogey because you had six birdies during the round?
CHRIS WILLIAMS:   I was disappointed.   It's really hard to come back from it.   But I just tried to stay calm and make myself ‑‑ I told myself I was playing well, it was only one hole, there's a lot of golf left. 
So I tried to keep my mind focused and it turned out to be okay.   I started putting a lot better, felt my rhythm a bit more, didn't try and hit it too hard.   And it turned out okay.   It's a good score on a course that's very difficult to hit iron shots into the right spots. 
The greens are running fantastic, if you got the right position, it's not so difficult.   The biggest challenge is staying out of the long grass and hitting good iron shots into the right spots.
