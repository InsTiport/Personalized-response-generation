 Q.  Not only does your name go on a very esteemed trophy with some of the greatest names in the history of golf, you've also entered into the British Open next year, as well, along with the Masters and the U.S. Open.  Could you have ever dreamed this in your wildest dreams?  GUNN YANG: I mean, I was just trying to build up my confidence by playing local events and then just trying to get -- you know, improve myself.  But I never thought that I can get the U.S. Amateur right away, I mean, one year after the surgery.  This is just a dream come true.   Q.  There's nothing in your resumÃ© that would say, yeah, you're ready to win the USGA Championship.  Just how did you do it?  GUNN YANG: I was trying to focus on my game again but Corey was playing so well.  I mean, he made so many crucial putts and we were all-square after 28 holes and then it was just amazing.
